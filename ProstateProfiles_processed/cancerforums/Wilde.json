      "Content": "Hi Matt, Without having read the Grimm study I have the following comments: 1. All treatments have side-effects, surgery gives it all from day one and then it gets better, however how much better varies. Radiation (seeds or EBRT) have fewer side-effects from day one but things tend to come with time (the gift that keeps on giving) So basically it is up to your preferences. So the older you are the more speaks for radiation. 2. Statistics are statistics but you are you. There are studies showing surgery being slightly more advantageous and vice versa. The problem is that to get a statistically significant number of cases you have to look a significant time back, and things have changed in that time so basically the surgery technique used today as well as the radiation technology used today differs from the stuff showed in the statistics. So you will never be able to choose between two very similar roads since they both develop. 3. At the end of the day it is your choice that matters, both seeds, EBRT and surgery is probably similar if done by a skilled professional team. I really almost decided on seeds but changed my mind when the radiation oncologist told me that I would need seeds AND EBRT to treat my tumor. I was just afraid that that much radiation would at the end of the day cause trouble. Also I felt that I would easier be at peace when the thing was physically removed from my body. My wife also supported this. I have no incontinence and ED is ok so I am happy. I also am glad to have a second bullet to fire with radiation if the cancer comes back. But that is me, it is a 50/50 choice and all I can recommend is to find a team you trust and a treatment that you are comfortable with and go for it. There is no given best choice... Good Luck",

Surgery is what very many do and even if it has some drawbacks, at your age you should be fine given that you go to an experienced surgeon. The first weeks after surgery will not be the best in your life but that period goes quickly and then you will feel way better. You are on the right track and soon this will be behind you.

Surgery is what very many do and even if it has some drawbacks, at your age you should be fine given that you go to an experienced surgeon. The first weeks after surgery will not be the best in your life but that period goes quickly and then you will feel way better. You are on the right track and soon this will be behind you.

      "Content": "Hi Matt, Without having read the Grimm study I have the following comments: 1. All treatments have side-effects, surgery gives it all from day one and then it gets better, however how much better varies. Radiation (seeds or EBRT) have fewer side-effects from day one but things tend to come with time (the gift that keeps on giving) So basically it is up to your preferences. So the older you are the more speaks for radiation. 2. Statistics are statistics but you are you. There are studies showing surgery being slightly more advantageous and vice versa. The problem is that to get a statistically significant number of cases you have to look a significant time back, and things have changed in that time so basically the surgery technique used today as well as the radiation technology used today differs from the stuff showed in the statistics. So you will never be able to choose between two very similar roads since they both develop. 3. At the end of the day it is your choice that matters, both seeds, EBRT and surgery is probably similar if done by a skilled professional team. I really almost decided on seeds but changed my mind when the radiation oncologist told me that I would need seeds AND EBRT to treat my tumor. I was just afraid that that much radiation would at the end of the day cause trouble. Also I felt that I would easier be at peace when the thing was physically removed from my body. My wife also supported this. I have no incontinence and ED is ok so I am happy. I also am glad to have a second bullet to fire with radiation if the cancer comes back. But that is me, it is a 50/50 choice and all I can recommend is to find a team you trust and a treatment that you are comfortable with and go for it. There is no given best choice... Good Luck",

Surgery is what very many do and even if it has some drawbacks, at your age you should be fine given that you go to an experienced surgeon. The first weeks after surgery will not be the best in your life but that period goes quickly and then you will feel way better. You are on the right track and soon this will be behind you.

      "Content": "Hello Logic, It is not so easy but remember the surgery is not the end of the world, You will be more or less uncomfortable while you have the catheter but then things improve. I tried to spend time with my wife, have really nice dinners and good wine (without overdoing it) long walks trying tp keep busy with fun activities. Not saying that you will not be able to do that later but there will be a period that for some is only uncomfortable, for some painful. The operation as such is really not bad, some pain but not bad, your stomach will be in some disorder and you will have the catheter but not that bad. Good Luck",

      "Content": "This is interesting, I don´t think it is due to any physical changes in the urethtra but maybe, there are clinics in Sweden who clearly claims that you will loose an inch...Since I am no pornstar I stayed away from that clinic. But what is a real issue is (I believe) that the blood flow to the poor penis is reduced after surgery due to nerves being bruised so you get the \"after-ice-bath-effect\" all the time. Normally your penis is filled with blood during sleep or basically now and then just to keep blood flowing. If this stops you risk long term effects, that is why many of us gets Cialis prescribed, not to have sex, just to get blood flowing. If the penis is without blood for a long time you may risk negative effects. ( this is how I had it explained at least) So it is a good thing to try to get erections even if you don´t have sex, just to \"stretch things out a bit \" as my surgeon said. Another way of putting it is \"Use it or loose it\". So my unqualified guess on this is that the surgery as such don´t really shorten it at least if you have a good surgeon, however long time lack of blood flow may. My penis is now able to get hard after 17 months and it is not shorter or thinner but it is a little bit curved.... I don´t know what that means but it is differently shaped and that may be due to the lack of erections. I am guessing here. So what I do is have sex as often as Mrs W can take it and play with myself in-between to stretch it. It is a hobby as good as anything.",

I had a similar diagnosis as you, G3+4 and several cores cancerous so treatment was definitely needed. I did surgery in January 2015 and am today almost totally recovered (some ED but basically ok). I did however seriously look into radiation. With my rathjer big tumour I would have needed both external radiation and brachytherapy and it just seemed too elaborated compared to surgery.

      "Content": "Hi Mike, When I made my choice I talked to the surgeon and he advised me to also talk to a radiation team which I did. In Sweden at least they would not recommend doing only Brachy on a tumor of the type I had (described in my signature) but would do Brachy and EBRT. The statistics for a cure is about the same so it is all about your own taste and fears. What turned me to surgery was primarily that I wanted the tumor out and quickly get the results (PSA test can be taken quite soon after surgery and you know if it worked) while radiation results in a slowly declining PSA. As my wife said \"You will worry to death before the cancer gets you if you do that...\" I was afraid of the side-effects of surgery, my surgeon said that with the size of my tumor he could not guarantee that nerves could be spared...But he managed to do that and now 18 months later I have no problems with incontinence that I care about (it was fine after two months) I can handle ED with pills and mostly important PSA is <0.1. I don´t want to push you in any direction, just give my experience, and I am sure you will be fine with radiation also but don´t rule out the surgery for fear of surgery as such, that is really not bad at all.

      "Content": "Hi WiW, I have no experience of the drugs you ask about however I have some experience of friends and close ones with terminal cancer. It is probably very very hard to accept that you are dying but the fact that there is no cure does not mean that you cannot live your life in an acceptable way. My mother has had terminal cancer for 14 years, she will die from it at some point but the years she has had have at times been very good. I also had a colleague who was in palliative care for at least two years and even if he suffered he still had good days and stayed with us for a long time. I know this is a very poor comfort but what these two have learned me is that every day has a value and being terminal may not mean that every day and every hour is bad. But this is probably very easy to say and very different when you are in that situation yourself. Take care",

      "Content": "Hi Mike, When I made my choice I talked to the surgeon and he advised me to also talk to a radiation team which I did. In Sweden at least they would not recommend doing only Brachy on a tumor of the type I had (described in my signature) but would do Brachy and EBRT. The statistics for a cure is about the same so it is all about your own taste and fears. What turned me to surgery was primarily that I wanted the tumor out and quickly get the results (PSA test can be taken quite soon after surgery and you know if it worked) while radiation results in a slowly declining PSA. As my wife said \"You will worry to death before the cancer gets you if you do that...\" I was afraid of the side-effects of surgery, my surgeon said that with the size of my tumor he could not guarantee that nerves could be spared...But he managed to do that and now 18 months later I have no problems with incontinence that I care about (it was fine after two months) I can handle ED with pills and mostly important PSA is <0.1. I don´t want to push you in any direction, just give my experience, and I am sure you will be fine with radiation also but don´t rule out the surgery for fear of surgery as such, that is really not bad at all. Good Luck",

      "Content": "This is interesting, I don´t think it is due to any physical changes in the urethtra but maybe, there are clinics in Sweden who clearly claims that you will loose an inch...Since I am no pornstar I stayed away from that clinic. But what is a real issue is (I believe) that the blood flow to the poor penis is reduced after surgery due to nerves being bruised so you get the \"after-ice-bath-effect\" all the time. Normally your penis is filled with blood during sleep or basically now and then just to keep blood flowing. If this stops you risk long term effects, that is why many of us gets Cialis prescribed, not to have sex, just to get blood flowing. If the penis is without blood for a long time you may risk negative effects. ( this is how I had it explained at least) So it is a good thing to try to get erections even if you don´t have sex, just to \"stretch things out a bit \" as my surgeon said. Another way of putting it is \"Use it or loose it\". So my unqualified guess on this is that the surgery as such don´t really shorten it at least if you have a good surgeon, however long time lack of blood flow may. My penis is now able to get hard after 17 months and it is not shorter or thinner but it is a little bit curved.... I don´t know what that means but it is differently shaped and that may be due to the lack of erections. I am guessing here. So what I do is have sex as often as Mrs W can take it and play with myself in-between to stretch it. It is a hobby as good as anything.",

You have already been given good advice above but I would like to add that with your diagnosis you are NOT in a hurry to take decisions, take your time until you feel reasonably ok with your decision. I was diagnosed in October 14 and was operated last week.",

      "Content": "Hi Daughter, Well 10 biopsies positive is not good as you say but the important thing is that he was clean in the other scan and it may not have escaped the prostate. Hormones and radiation as recommended is quite common and as I get it 8 weeks is standard. The other option is surgery, both have the same success rates. It is hard to give more advice without a detailed biopsy report, what was his PSA? what was the G-score of the biopsies? to what extend (%) were the samples cancerous? At least is Sweden they tend to recommend radiation for the more advanced cases with the motivation that the odds are you will need it anyway and then the surgery is an unnecessary action. But this is not in any way a clear cut and I strongly recommend you to get a second opinion on surgery also. Try to relax, if this is contained in the prostate your father has a good chance to fix it. If you are to have cancer, prostate cancer is the one to have since there are options to fix it and slow it down. Having said that you really need to get the biopsy report to understand what you are dealing with and how much in a hurry you are. Good Luck",

If he is G6 and early stage you have time to decide and educate yourself. Don´t panic. Also for us it was a big help to be two at all meetings since you tend to be slightly shocked at some times.

One thing that probably never go away is that when it is full and you need to pee, you need to do it NOW!

      "Content": "Hello Let´s, I am 52 and now 4 weeks behind surgery. This place is the place to be, It has helped me a lot. You will get good answers and also read the stickies at the top. Basically I would say since he is only 50 some treatment is needed. G6 and early stage to me sounds \"fixable\" but get the correct G-number and staging from the doctors. If he is G6 and early stage you have time to decide and educate yourself. Don´t panic. Also for us it was a big help to be two at all meetings since you tend to be slightly shocked at some times. Panic attacks may pop up. But please take my advice for what it is, non-expert only based on my experience. Good luck and take care",

And also not aggressive so you have time to get educated and make an informed decision on what you should do. Read the books recommended and read the stickies threads at the top. Most guys here have done surgery but several have done radiation also. You will get answers to all your questions here. Good Luck",

I think that is why it takes some time to get it to fill up properly. But it eventually does and then all the strange feelings decrease. One thing that probably never go away is that when it is full and you need to pee, you need to do it NOW! So if you see a guy in a shopping center scouting and memorizing the restrooms it is probably one uf us.",

      "Content": "Hello Let´s, I am 52 and now 4 weeks behind surgery. This place is the place to be, It has helped me a lot. You will get good answers and also read the stickies at the top. Basically I would say since he is only 50 some treatment is needed. G6 and early stage to me sounds \"fixable\" but get the correct G-number and staging from the doctors. If he is G6 and early stage you have time to decide and educate yourself. Don´t panic. Also for us it was a big help to be two at all meetings since you tend to be slightly shocked at some times. Panic attacks may pop up. But please take my advice for what it is, non-expert only based on my experience. Good luck and take care",

I think that is why it takes some time to get it to fill up properly. But it eventually does and then all the strange feelings decrease. One thing that probably never go away is that when it is full and you need to pee, you need to do it NOW! So if you see a guy in a shopping center scouting and memorizing the restrooms it is probably one uf us.",

Even if a PSA of 25 for sure indicates cancer, it is not disaster high and there is still good chance that this can be cured, by surgery and/or radiation. I also think that chemo is a long time away yet. But the data from the biopsy would give more info. Just for now I think it is important that you both get educated before he takes some drastic (unwise) decisions. Really do read the book recommended by Chuck and you will realize that this may not be the disaster you think yet. And to be perfectly clear, prostate cancer can be cured if caught in time and it can be stopped for many years with hormone treatments if it has spread, but it can NOT be fixed with anything else. And I don´t want to be blunt here but if your father goes into alternative treatments too soon he just may miss the window of opportunity to fix this and believe me, that he does not want to happen.

      "Content": "Hi Kate, I think that the surgeon tried to avoid positive margins and decided to cut wider. You will know when you get the pathology results. The fact that the tumor was in both lobes is really not that important now since it is gone. I know it is hard but you cannot draw any conclusions until you get the pathology results. I guess that others will comment also but so far I have heard nothing but good about Dr Tewari who seems to know what he is doing so don´t be discouraged. The catheter is a nuisance but will soon be gone. Also you should be aware that after surgery you can get very emotional and have mood swings, this will go away in a short time and the mood will be better. Good Luck and stay positive, worst is probably done now.",

Other than that I occasionally squirt while sneezing or coughing, but I've learned to Kegel-it-up when I feel one coming on, and I get through it ok. What's with the bike thing? What is being pushed on that opens the flood gates? Well, I was not allowed on a bike until three months after. Some guys have been told six months. So be careful with the biking, and maybe you found out the reason why we should be careful...",

      "Content": "Hi Kate, I think that the surgeon tried to avoid positive margins and decided to cut wider. You will know when you get the pathology results. The fact that the tumor was in both lobes is really not that important now since it is gone. I know it is hard but you cannot draw any conclusions until you get the pathology results. I guess that others will comment also but so far I have heard nothing but good about Dr Tewari who seems to know what he is doing so don´t be discouraged. The catheter is a nuisance but will soon be gone. Also you should be aware that after surgery you can get very emotional and have mood swings, this will go away in a short time and the mood will be better. Good Luck and stay positive, worst is probably done now.",

You were supposed to drop it down your Urethtra and then some would end up just around there and you should massage that in. For me the Muse worked better, but remember that when I tried the gel I had basically no led whatsoever in my pencil so I guess I needed something stronger. Haven´t tried it since because it is not covered by my insurance but Muse is. Good Luck and maybe you should try to combine it with Viagra to get a real boost",

      "Content": "Hi Sandra, and welcome. We have many daughters on the forum right now, read their threads and you will get more help. I think you should try to take it easy just now. Even if a PSA of 25 for sure indicates cancer, it is not disaster high and there is still good chance that this can be cured, by surgery and/or radiation. I also think that chemo is a long time away yet. But the data from the biopsy would give more info. Just for now I think it is important that you both get educated before he takes some drastic (unwise) decisions. Really do read the book recommended by Chuck and you will realize that this may not be the disaster you think yet. And to be perfectly clear, prostate cancer can be cured if caught in time and it can be stopped for many years with hormone treatments if it has spread, but it can NOT be fixed with anything else. And I don´t want to be blunt here but if your father goes into alternative treatments too soon he just may miss the window of opportunity to fix this and believe me, that he does not want to happen. Please read the book and try to get educated to make a better decision than going \"alternative\" Good Luckl",

      "Content": "Hello SeaCock, Trimix is not available in Sweden but I did test Alprostadil as a gel. You were supposed to drop it down your Urethtra and then some would end up just around there and you should massage that in. For me the Muse worked better, but remember that when I tried the gel I had basically no led whatsoever in my pencil so I guess I needed something stronger. Haven´t tried it since because it is not covered by my insurance but Muse is. Good Luck and maybe you should try to combine it with Viagra to get a real boost",

With nerve-sparing surgery it can take some time but after a year I would guess that some small sign of life should come back. And same on leakage. But I am only a guy no expert, having a surgeon that you trust is very important and if you together can for a plan of action that is really valuable. But also we are all different and for some guys it takes longer to heal. I spoke to a guy who had surgery about five years ago and he still think that things are improving for every day. I can really feel your pain but don´t give up, it will improve, and you are cancer free! Take care",

They may for sure reduce the risk of ever getting cancer but when it has developed it is another game. For me it is like hitting the brakes after you have already crashed. I do beieve in eating healthy and exercise but mainly to be able to cope with the treatments. Your father have a \"nice\" type of cancer and he may well wait for some time to get treatment (if he ever needs it) but I strongly recommend to keep track of how it develops and use the time to get informed on treatment options and make a plan.

Teva's sildenafil has been available in Canada for about three years, after their Supreme Court invalidated Pfizer's patent. Buy your ED meds from there until 12/2017. This already happened in Europe, so I use only generic Sildenafil now. It works better than Cialis on me. One pill is about 3 bucks.",

My wife is very supportive and so are all my friends. I do worry a little about incontinence and ED but at my age and based on internet witnesses I will probably be just fine and good chances to get cancer free. So Hooray! But here comes my question: I still feel really depressed, not able to enjoy the good things in life, not even the sex. I feel like crying very often and drink more wine than I should. Hopefully this will go away next week when all is done but do you guys have similar experiences? I do not want to complain and I know I am lucky to get this fixed so my brain understands that I am fine, but my heart just seems not to get it...",

      "Content": "Hello Kate, not much to add but I am another one that did surgery. I was also offered Brachy as a choice but decided for surgery mainly because you get an answer almost immediately if the treatment was succesful. With any radiation it takes time to know if it worked. My wife said I would worry to death if I did that and she was probably right on that. Good Luck",

      "Content": "Hi, I am about to have the prostate removed Jan 7, in three days, with daVinci surgery. I have no second thoughts, my surgeon has long experience and I trust him. My wife is very supportive and so are all my friends. I do worry a little about incontinence and ED but at my age and based on internet witnesses I will probably be just fine and good chances to get cancer free. So Hooray! But here comes my question: I still feel really depressed, not able to enjoy the good things in life, not even the sex. I feel like crying very often and drink more wine than I should. Hopefully this will go away next week when all is done but do you guys have similar experiences? I do not want to complain and I know I am lucky to get this fixed so my brain understands that I am fine, but my heart just seems not to get it...",

Having said that you have time to get educated and time to make a decision. AS is fine done correctly and it certainly postpones the side-effect risks of all treatments. However at some point you might want to take treatment and you should then be educated to be able to weigh your risks and your willingness to gamble versus the side-effect risks. Plenty of information here and in the stickies above Good Luck",

And apart from that the incontinence is not an issue anymore, very rare ghostsquirts, that is almost all. And ED is ok, not as before but ok. I just had a chat with a colleague who had surgery 3 years ago and he said that ED for him is still improving, which felt good to hear. So all you newly diagnosed, things get better and there is life after treatment. I think I will have a drink tonight and sit in the sun with a stupid grin on my face.",

My wife is very supportive and so are all my friends. I do worry a little about incontinence and ED but at my age and based on internet witnesses I will probably be just fine and good chances to get cancer free. So Hooray! But here comes my question: I still feel really depressed, not able to enjoy the good things in life, not even the sex. I feel like crying very often and drink more wine than I should. Hopefully this will go away next week when all is done but do you guys have similar experiences? I do not want to complain and I know I am lucky to get this fixed so my brain understands that I am fine, but my heart just seems not to get it...",

I note your latest PSA reading (<0.05) in your history differs from your previous results (<0.1) and now appears that you may be utilizing a more sensitive assay machine. Is that the case? Jim Yep, they have changed the \"standard\" of PSA-testing. Sweden differs a little from USA since the care is highly regulated which means that every lab here uses the same technology and the same level of detail. So the answer I got also came with a comment explaining that the new national standard is 0.05 as lowest level replacing 0.1. Still the <-sign is the most important.",

      "Content": "and the verdict from the jury is......drumroll.........<0.05. I am quite relieved. And apart from that the incontinence is not an issue anymore, very rare ghostsquirts, that is almost all. And ED is ok, not as before but ok. I just had a chat with a colleague who had surgery 3 years ago and he said that ED for him is still improving, which felt good to hear. So all you newly diagnosed, things get better and there is life after treatment. I think I will have a drink tonight and sit in the sun with a stupid grin on my face.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by Jim215 Hi Wilde: Very glad to hear that news. I note your latest PSA reading (<0.05) in your history differs from your previous results (<0.1) and now appears that you may be utilizing a more sensitive assay machine. Is that the case? Jim Yep, they have changed the \"standard\" of PSA-testing. Sweden differs a little from USA since the care is highly regulated which means that every lab here uses the same technology and the same level of detail. So the answer I got also came with a comment explaining that the new national standard is 0.05 as lowest level replacing 0.1. Still the <-sign is the most important.",

As DjinTonic says it can come back after a very long time, does that mean that you are never cured? well maybe but if you define cured as having the same odds as any guy to get cancer it gets a little easier to grasp. Since it is all about statistics I prefer to see it as just that, my odds of getting cancer is in the same range as any guy. The difference is that we who once have had it knows that it can come back and so we think about it, most other guys never think about their odds of getting cancer.

      "Content": "Hello Kevin, Take it easy is the best advice. It is a major surgery and it would be strange if it didn´t affect you. (Think of it as having been stabbed 5 times in the stomach..). Don´t lift and twist, it is bad and hurts. Try to walk as much as you can but don´t overdo it. It is good that you take the 6 weeks, after 4 you will be fine. Running to the bathroom is normal (at least I did it too), the bladder is unused to be stretched after the catheter but that will improve. If you are concerned about the incontinence try to weigh your pads and calculate your daily leak. It will show the improvement even if you don´t feel it. I had similar data as you (3+4 and a large tumor) and also felt the \"having dodged a bullet\" for a long time. In the first week after surgery this made me quite emotional, I thought I was going mad but it went away rather soon. Take your weeks off and take care, soon this will be behind you Good Luck",

Having said that you have time to get educated and time to make a decision. AS is fine done correctly and it certainly postpones the side-effect risks of all treatments. However at some point you might want to take treatment and you should then be educated to be able to weigh your risks and your willingness to gamble versus the side-effect risks. Plenty of information here and in the stickies above Good Luck",

Many with her type of cancer does not live for more than a few years, the response to treatment is very different and individual. She is now 76 and noone really knows how long she has. Also: Just Before Christmas I was attending a funeral for a colleague who had terminal cancer for many years. He was in palliative care for two years. He had a relatively good life until the last three days (which honestly were bad).

For the first 6 months after surgery basically nothing worked well enough. I did use Muse (or Bondil as it is called here) and it worked but it hurts a lot. My surgeon urged me to use them even without having sex \"to stretch things out a bit\" and I think that is a good thing. You may not want to hear this but I think you should be prepared for a poor year, if it goes quicker that is good but it sounds among the guys here that a year is pretty much average time. But do keep trying and maybe use Muse, it might work, specially with a younger wife",

You are young and need to hit this thing good and hard and with a G8 probably sooner than later. But don´t panic, read the stories here and get educated. It sounds as you are in good hands also so you should be able to get the best treatment. Good Luck",

And also full of guys with more or less bad cancers but still alive and kicking which have helped at least me a lot. It is amazing how quick your PSA went down after treatment and it certainly seems to be doing good. Also being able to tackle this with humor and an equally humorous wife is a great help. When I mentioned that I would probably have ED to my wife she said \"finally a vacation\" and we could laugh at it. I wish you all luck with your treatment and please keep posting.",

I also checked the other surgeons at my hospital and there they all have now \"converted\" to daVinci and only use open surgery on really large prostates. Since you are not in the same country as i this may be of little help but what I am getting at is the same as many others, get an experienced surgeon and if you trust him/her the method is probably better to let them choose.

And also full of guys with more or less bad cancers but still alive and kicking which have helped at least me a lot. It is amazing how quick your PSA went down after treatment and it certainly seems to be doing good. Also being able to tackle this with humor and an equally humorous wife is a great help. When I mentioned that I would probably have ED to my wife she said \"finally a vacation\" and we could laugh at it. I wish you all luck with your treatment and please keep posting.",

I really have no advice but as Chuck said don´t overdo Kegels but also try to do them in the same way and at the same time every day (I did them every evening in bed). The other thing is that it takes a year or even more to heal, which is a long time but remember that things keep getting better for all that time. Good Luck",

      "Content": "Hi Kamie, I really have not very much to add to the guys responses but to add my view. Living healthy is a good thing, don´t misunderstand us, it can increase the ability of your immune system and in some cases reducing the risks of getting cancer. It is also very good to be fit to be able to cope with any health issues. But when the cancer is there it will not go away. A smoker who gets lung cancer will not be cured by stop smoking either. But a G6 cancer is NOT a death sentence. There are lots of options and many G6 guys do Active Surveillance for many years, and some reach the end of their lives for other reasons never needing treatment for the cancer. But there is a very dangerous issue with prostate cancer and that is that it often don´t give any symptoms until it is too late and if the cancer spreads there is no cure. There are very good treatments to keep it controlled for many years though. With a G6 you have time to get educated on the issue. Read the book recommended and read the stories here. By all means live healthy and exercise. Don´t smoke and cut down on read meat. When it comes to surgery and/or radiation there are many stories in here describng what to expect in side-effects and recovery time and very many are happy to get the cancer out. What made your husbands brother regret his surgery? You can fix this, it is not that bad. But please don´t believe it will go away by food supplements or similar, it won´t. Good Luck and take care",

I really have no advice but as Chuck said don´t overdo Kegels but also try to do them in the same way and at the same time every day (I did them every evening in bed). The other thing is that it takes a year or even more to heal, which is a long time but remember that things keep getting better for all that time. Good Luck",

      "Content": "Well here is my theory: there are things that may slow your cancer down, like cutting red meat and stop smoking and drinking. Also exercising is good. I think this strengthen the immune system. But I think it is mostly important to prevent you from getting cancer at all. I think it is in no way a cure when the cancer has got you. However to generally be of good health helps the treatments you get. Being fat and unfit increases risks at surgery for example. I try to eat healthy and to exercise but if I ever get another cancer I would not try diets to fix the cancer. But I am no expert in this.",

I think that the risk of upgraded G-scores after surgery is not enough presented by different experts.

Not really sure what I'm after by this post, maybe the next wave has come and some of the more familiar folks from the time I spent here just aren't around as much; I guess I just kind of miss the friendship, but I guess these things, by there very nature are always changing for new people with new questions. Very best regards, DD Hello DD, all is well and I think understand your post. I think that many leave the forum after a while when the cancer is behind them, which probably is a good thing. But I also now and then miss the guys and the friendship and the support from this group which helped me immensely.",

Not really sure what I'm after by this post, maybe the next wave has come and some of the more familiar folks from the time I spent here just aren't around as much; I guess I just kind of miss the friendship, but I guess these things, by there very nature are always changing for new people with new questions. Very best regards, DD Hello DD, all is well and I think understand your post. I think that many leave the forum after a while when the cancer is behind them, which probably is a good thing. But I also now and then miss the guys and the friendship and the support from this group which helped me immensely.",

      "Content": "Hi Bernard, I have the same issues with some of my friends, same arguments. What I think is important is that there are several forums like this as well as different discussion groups and so on where real people who have had cancer can witness on treatments, cures and also unfortunately failing treatments. These people are real people living with cancer. I assure you that you will not find these types of groups of people being treated by whatever \"alternative\" options. You will however find a lot of \"I heard about a guy from a friend who cured himself with snake oil! You should try it!\" Also if the \"Gig Pharma Conspiracy\" was true probably no-one working there and no-one working with cancer would ever die or take any treatment, but they do, as the rest of us.... It is your life, you only have one shot, listen to the guys who have been in your situation and by all means get a doctor you trust. That is my advice Good Luck",

I am no expert but since you have been keeping track of your PSA and it is not very high and with a biopsy where 1 of 14 showed 10% G3+3 you might not need to do anything right now but track it. Also this diagnosis has very high chances of being cured no matter what treatment you choose, and you have time to get informed and choose whatever suits you best. You might want a second opinion on the biopsy, to be really certain what you are dealing with. Don´t panic, talk to your urologist and maybe also book an appointment with an oncologist for a second opinion. I am sure the more experienced guys will also give further advice. Good Luck",

      "Content": "Hello Runlikewind, As the others say fPSA is an indicator of cancer if combined with a high PSA. It is expressed in % and I am not sure how to interpret your number but a low fPSA <15% indicates cancer. But it is not really that important, with two PSA-tests of 8-10 with antibiotics between you should take the DRE and if it was me the biopsy also. PSA can go up and down and the only way to be sure is the biopsy. And really it is not as bad as it sounds. Just abandon all dignity and you will be fine.",

      "Content": "Hello Runlikewind, As the others say fPSA is an indicator of cancer if combined with a high PSA. It is expressed in % and I am not sure how to interpret your number but a low fPSA <15% indicates cancer. But it is not really that important, with two PSA-tests of 8-10 with antibiotics between you should take the DRE and if it was me the biopsy also. PSA can go up and down and the only way to be sure is the biopsy. And really it is not as bad as it sounds. Just abandon all dignity and you will be fine.",

So you probably do not need to worry at all. So that is very good. But the other issue than statistics is to live with the worry of recurrence, and in my case that the final pathology should be upgraded to something higher than 3+4 which keeps me awake at nights since G8 or higher is a different animal to live with. I have one week to the first PSA and final pathology and it is really getting to me.

I was lucky since I had no problems with urine leakage during sex but it is different. Absolutely no issues whatsoever with not lasting long enough, that is just not an issue anymore. Also when it finally gets hard enough (which takes some time and requires Viagra) it stays hard for a long time. So bottom line is it is different now, not necessarily worse. It is what it is....",

I am no expert but since you have been keeping track of your PSA and it is not very high and with a biopsy where 1 of 14 showed 10% G3+3 you might not need to do anything right now but track it. Also this diagnosis has very high chances of being cured no matter what treatment you choose, and you have time to get informed and choose whatever suits you best. You might want a second opinion on the biopsy, to be really certain what you are dealing with. Don´t panic, talk to your urologist and maybe also book an appointment with an oncologist for a second opinion. I am sure the more experienced guys will also give further advice. Good Luck",

      "Content": "HI Delta, Our data is quite similar, I am also a G3+4 and also had some small positive margins, I think 4 mm. Statistically positive margins will increase your risk of a recurrence but with a veeeery small number. It is also common that the prostate gets squeezed while removing it which creates a \"false\" positive margin (the tumor was squeezed towards the surface). I think all of us have PSA angst and for me it actually gets worse for every time even though statistically every zero means reduced risk of reoccurrence. Last time I almost cried when I got the results... You have a quite low-risk situation but it is not a 100% no risk situation but the more time passes the better it is. I strongly recommend a glass of wine or similar after every 0 PSA to celebrate. If I ever get a not 0 PSA I will probably have two glasses... Try to relax, You have done all you can and will probably be just fine",

It is expressed in % and I am not sure how to interpret your number but a low fPSA <15% indicates cancer. But it is not really that important, with two PSA-tests of 8-10 with antibiotics between you should take the DRE and if it was me the biopsy also. PSA can go up and down and the only way to be sure is the biopsy. And really it is not as bad as it sounds. Just abandon all dignity and you will be fine.",

      "Content": "HI Delta, Our data is quite similar, I am also a G3+4 and also had some small positive margins, I think 4 mm. Statistically positive margins will increase your risk of a recurrence but with a veeeery small number. It is also common that the prostate gets squeezed while removing it which creates a \"false\" positive margin (the tumor was squeezed towards the surface). I think all of us have PSA angst and for me it actually gets worse for every time even though statistically every zero means reduced risk of reoccurrence. Last time I almost cried when I got the results... You have a quite low-risk situation but it is not a 100% no risk situation but the more time passes the better it is. I strongly recommend a glass of wine or similar after every 0 PSA to celebrate. If I ever get a not 0 PSA I will probably have two glasses... Try to relax, You have done all you can and will probably be just fine",

      "Content": "HI Delta, Our data is quite similar, I am also a G3+4 and also had some small positive margins, I think 4 mm. Statistically positive margins will increase your risk of a recurrence but with a veeeery small number. It is also common that the prostate gets squeezed while removing it which creates a \"false\" positive margin (the tumor was squeezed towards the surface). I think all of us have PSA angst and for me it actually gets worse for every time even though statistically every zero means reduced risk of reoccurrence. Last time I almost cried when I got the results... You have a quite low-risk situation but it is not a 100% no risk situation but the more time passes the better it is. I strongly recommend a glass of wine or similar after every 0 PSA to celebrate. If I ever get a not 0 PSA I will probably have two glasses... Try to relax, You have done all you can and will probably be just fine",

Well I did the surgery in january 2015 and have no regrets at all. For sure it hurt but really what hurt most was my dignity. I was incontinent for a couple of weeks, not that bad at all and today I only have the rare small squirt when I squeeze some part of my wife (it is really weird). ED took about a year to get to ok. It freaked me out in the beginning but now I am basically back to normal. I use Viagra but I think that is more psychological today. What I am trying to say is that soon this will be only a memory for you, you have caught this in good time and with your low relatively low PSA I would be surprised if it is not contained in the prostate. Try to relax and have all the sex you can before surgery. Good Luck",

On ED I have no success so far whatsoever. Eating Cialis helps with the blood-flow as Pratoman says, but it will not give me any real erections. I have tried Muse also \"to stretch things out\" as my urologist said, and it does that, but it hurts and does not really inspire to any sex. But it is early yet and things may improve still.",

      "Content": "Hello Hammer, and welcome here. Not much to add from the others but to say that we have similar cancers you and I. I was diagnosed when I was 52, G3+4 but I had more cores than you. Well I did the surgery in january 2015 and have no regrets at all. For sure it hurt but really what hurt most was my dignity. I was incontinent for a couple of weeks, not that bad at all and today I only have the rare small squirt when I squeeze some part of my wife (it is really weird). ED took about a year to get to ok. It freaked me out in the beginning but now I am basically back to normal. I use Viagra but I think that is more psychological today. What I am trying to say is that soon this will be only a memory for you, you have caught this in good time and with your low relatively low PSA I would be surprised if it is not contained in the prostate. Try to relax and have all the sex you can before surgery. Good Luck",

But remember what is the chicken and egg here, you have 3+4, this increases your PSA. This does not mean that if your PSA decreases your 3+4 is cured. I am sorry to say but that is not how this works. We all make our bets and have our beliefs but at age 61 and with a 3+4 I would not risk the quality of life for the upcoming many years by delaying treatment. Radiation (sometimes combined with hormone treatment) or surgery is at the end of the day, a matter of taste. I wish you good luck",

But it will soon be over and after the surgery time seems to move rather quick. In 144 hours you will probably feel quite ok albeit with a hose up your penis. I am sure you are well prepared but one small tip I will give you, the strong painkillers (morphine, oxycontin) will stop your stomach from working and you will clog up. This hurts after a prostatectomy, so try to eat as little as you can manage of painkillers and eat fibrous stuff to get your bowels moving again. Drink a lot, the catheter has the advantage that you don´t have to get up to pee. Hug your wife and Good Luck.",

This is actually one of the advantages of surgery, you get an exact final answer of what is going on and can act on it, even if that answer is not what you wanted. Thanks for posting your doctors notes, it is always interesting to read their clinical and a little dry descriptions. I still remember my surgeons writing that \"the patient is inside-fat\" which made me laugh. I have also been recommended a pump but as you say I just can´t bring me to do that. Enjoy your sausage and wine, it is a great combo.",

I was not prepared at all for the biopsy, my normal doctor who discovered the high PSA sent me to a specialist and at the first meeting with him he just told me \"And now we will take a biopsy\" so I swallowed an antibiotic and then it was pants down..... No enema and no other preparation and I was fine, dignity was severely abused but that was it. Good Luck",

But it will soon be over and after the surgery time seems to move rather quick. In 144 hours you will probably feel quite ok albeit with a hose up your penis. I am sure you are well prepared but one small tip I will give you, the strong painkillers (morphine, oxycontin) will stop your stomach from working and you will clog up. This hurts after a prostatectomy, so try to eat as little as you can manage of painkillers and eat fibrous stuff to get your bowels moving again. Drink a lot, the catheter has the advantage that you don´t have to get up to pee. Hug your wife and Good Luck.",

But it will soon be over and after the surgery time seems to move rather quick. In 144 hours you will probably feel quite ok albeit with a hose up your penis. I am sure you are well prepared but one small tip I will give you, the strong painkillers (morphine, oxycontin) will stop your stomach from working and you will clog up. This hurts after a prostatectomy, so try to eat as little as you can manage of painkillers and eat fibrous stuff to get your bowels moving again. Drink a lot, the catheter has the advantage that you don´t have to get up to pee. Hug your wife and Good Luck.",

I think you are onto something important on exercise, it was recently proved in a Swedish study that exercising boosts the immune system to better kill cancer cells. I actually believe that it was tested on prostate cancer. And of course it gives you the energy to cope with tough treatments. I really admire you for keeping it up. Good Luck and take care",

It takes a couple of times to get used to it and the first times it did not work so well for me. My doctor told me to use them twice a week even if I should not have sex \"to stretch things out a bit\". I have not used it more than once a week but last time (tenth try) I think I may have been able to use it for more fun activities. Showed it to wife who said \"Hm, that might actually work!\" I take them before I shower at night. It is interesting to see little Wilde grow but then the pain comes and to be frank to you, the first time it felt like I had hit him with a hammer...But it gets better for every time so don´t give up on Muse, keep trying. Good Luck",

      "Content": "Hi Alex, I was 52 when I got PC and my youngest daughter was 21, oldest 23, and I remember how hard it was for them to handle the fact that daddy was ill. Fathers always want to protect their daughters and your father probably is too. You may want to talk to his doctor instead to get correct information, your father probably has a hard time telling you everything. It is hard to comment on survival rates with this little information but I know one thing and that is that statistics is one thing but the variations in survival time is large, There are many guys here who are on hormone treatment right now and they know more than me. I am sorry to say but your father seems to be very ill with a PSA of 83, and aggressive treatment will be needed, but don´t give up, there is always hope and you may have many years of good time ahead of you. Take care and I wish you both good luck",

      "Content": "Hello Alpine, sorry about your diagnosis but you are in a good place here to get info. I have no experience of such a large tumour that you seems to have however I strongly agree with lancepeace that you should very soon treat it. You are probably still \"lucky\" in that it seems to be contained in the prostate but that will not last forever and I would grab the opportunity to go for a cure soon. When it comes to surgery vs radiation it is tricky, it is true that many of us have reasoned that if I do surgery first I have the opportunity to do radiation later. That has been with smaller tumours though. The advice I got from both the urologist and onchologist was that generally the bigger the tumour the more speaks for radiation/hormone treatment. I am not sure exactly why. Good luck and I am sure others will also answer you",

      "Content": "Hello Jlynn, It is not that bad at all. If your husband have had surgery before he will know what to expect. Of course the stomach area will be sore, after all there are 5 holes in it, and also his bottom will hurt when he sits. (that might also come a little later). The most common complain afterwards seems to be gas-pains in the shoulders (sounds strange but the nerves obviously work like that) and gas pains from the stomach. Walking and eating correct food helps with this. Painkillers also slows down the digestive system so trying to use as little as possible of them is good. He will not feel well for a week but it will be bearable, that is my personal view. The catheter is not much to worry about, it is actually a help since he will not need to get up at nights to pee. Many people here thinks it is the worst part, I thought it was not so bad. And it does not hurt to take it out. (Well apart from a very hurt dignity....) Later on after catheter removal the continence is the big issue. See to it that the Kegels are done and also not overdone, stick to the schedule your surgeon gives you. Some get continent quickly, some takes longer. Weighing the pads and keeping track works to show progress even when it feels bad. Few are continent from day one (but it happens) most seems to need a couple of months and a few even longer. But the curve is steep and most of us live with maybe using a pad/day just to be safe for a few months. As I understand it about 10% have bad incontinence issues. And then comes the ED journey. This seems to be very different, some guys no problems, some guys big problems. The only advice I can give is patience, and trying the different medicines that exist. Here is the link to my thread on the surgery if you like to read the more gory details http://www.cancerforums.net/threads/...12-Hours-to-go",

When the nurse came and ripped out all the tubes from my hands and arms and the drain and told me to go and shower I almost fell in love with her.",

      "Content": "Hello Steve, as I understand it G6 is considered low risk, G7 medium and higher G is unfortunately high risk. This for sure needs to be considered when planning treatment. But remember that the treatment still have a very very good chance of curing. The tables are not really useful for us as individuals as we tend to see ourselves as always being the average. But the tables are based on a large amount of men all with different stories and probably few of them being \"average\". So they cannot predict what is going to happen to you as an individual. They can advice you on treatment choices. But take one step at a time, and keep track of your PSA after treatment, that is all we can do. And even if your nerves will be gone there are ways of handling that also, others will probably comment on this. Good Luck",

      "Content": "Hi 2b-lucky, and welcome here. You ask a tricky question, as I understand a G6 normally don´t spread outside the prostate. But on the other hand a biopsy can never detect everything going on inside and if it has missed something the closeness to the edge might increase the risk. But I am not a professional, just a guy who had PC. Your data would be useful in advising, as age, PSA history and so on.. I am sure the other guys also will ask where you are been treated, I cannot advice on that since I am in Sweden. Good Luck and take care",

      "Content": "Hi wbigs, and welcome to the club. Don´t worry too much, with a PSA of 3 it is very probable that this is contained and you have plenty of time to make a plan. And the plan will be made very much based on your own preference/fears. Basically you can choose between surgery and radiation, both with the same success rates. The younger you are the more speaks for surgery, you can handle it well, you get to know what is in there after the pathology. Radiation however have fewer immediate side-effects but as you are young those side-effects will sneak up on you sooner or later. The third alternative is just to watch this and act when the PSA is at a certain level, this buys you some time without side-effects. It is a devils choice but if you read the stories here you will see that many guys pass through with very few problems. But also for sure some don´t. For now you should be aware of the fact that you are not in a hurry, do get educated and find a surgeon/onchologist you trust and do ask your questions here. Good Luck",

      "Content": "Hello Guys, I don´t post much nowadays, but I still hang around now and then. Also I see that many of the guys active 4 years ago have left but still I would like to wish you all a Happy new Year. And a special Thanks to Chuck and Michael F who have helped so many. I think that many of us who have been somewhat lucky with side-effects and stuff tend to not post but here goes. I had surgery exactly 4 years ago, leakage was a small issue and only a problem for a couple of months, now it is not an issue. ED was more persistent and for a period I was quite depressed by it but to my surprise and joy it is still improving and for the last 6 months it has quite drastically improved, so the famous nerves heal for a very long time indeed. So what I am trying to say to all of you who feel depressed by ED is that keep the faith, it will improve. Good Luck and thanks to all of You who supported me.",

      "Content": "Hello and welcome to the forum. He will need some help for about a week, the catheter is a problem to move around with and he will have problems getting up from and into the bed. He will be sore and bloated and have some pain. It is probably better to sleep alone just because you sleep poorly and move around a lot, also here the catheter is always in the way. But after a week he probably can take care of himself, maybe sooner. He will need to eat food that gets his stomach going, prune juice for example. On tips for the day before surgery......well it is all kind of dirty....(sorry about that) Don´t worry, this will be over in a short time. Good Luck",

      "Content": "Hello Rick, and congratulations on the downgrade. The urge to urinate took some days for me to come back, before that I went rather often. The Kegels sure are important but don´t overdo it, that might make it worse. The first step for many is to get dry over a night, and then during walks and finally during strange moves or sneezing. I weighed my pads but only to try to track if I was getting better, and it helped me because sometimes it felt hopeless and then the curve could show me that I was getting better after all. Good Luck",

Hi Jim, actually you are spot on, flax seed is used on horses with poor fur, and women take it to get better hair. It also is good if you have a slow stomach and need to get things moving. But that is also all it does. Quark is good if you want to loose weight and are used to eat a lot of ice-cream....

He will be sore and bloated and have some pain. It is probably better to sleep alone just because you sleep poorly and move around a lot, also here the catheter is always in the way. But after a week he probably can take care of himself, maybe sooner. He will need to eat food that gets his stomach going, prune juice for example. On tips for the day before surgery......well it is all kind of dirty....(sorry about that) Don´t worry, this will be over in a short time. Good Luck",

      "Content": "Hi Ron, did you also get a freePSA result? I am a Swede and I know that the procedure here differs a bit from USA but here they use the freePSA as an indicator to do a biopsy. But I would guess a new PSA first of all and probably then a DRE and then maybe a biopsy. Having said that none of these steps are anything to worry about. I know there are some differences of opinion here but I found that what took the worst hit was my dignity.... As the others say take one step at a time and try not to worry, the \"good\" thing with prostate cancer is that it most often develops slowly and with a PSA under 10 you still will have time to get educated and make an informed choice. But you are far from that yet, take a new PSA first of all. Good Luck and try not to worry too much",

      "Content": "Hi NW, the incontinence improvement comes in steps. And unfortunately sometimes it can feel like a step in the wrong direction. You should measure progress weekly not daily. I don´t think the chainsaw work had any effect on incontinence. How much does he leak? If he is using pads try measure the weight and keep track of that because that will show the improvement even if it feels bad. I did this and it helped to see that it did improve even when it felt bad. I also guess that as he feels better he also starts moving around more and this can cause more leaks, for example walking and spitting, sneezing, hugging, all these can cause a small leak. I think you should tell him that he seems to experience what many of us have experienced and that it is normal. On ED you really should not get nervous for at least 6 months. I am sorry to say this but I think that it is important to realize that ED can be an issue for many months but it will get better and also you should try the pills and other stuff because it will sooner or later work. Don´t give up. Good Luck",

      "Content": "Hello Wife, I had exactly the same, basically my stomach shut down. Nothing passed. I had to stay for six days in hospital, on the fifth day I couldn´t eat any more, i actually threw up when I ate, I guess I was full. But on day five gas started to pass and on day six I was sent home and slowly things got better. My surgeon said that this happens now and then and that it is a combination of the surgery messing up your bowels and the painkillers making you constipated. It is really painful. The pain from the holes in my stomach and the catheter was really nothing at all compared to the bowel issues. What finally worked for me was walking, I was fine in all other respects so I walked round and round the ward and slowly things started happening. But it was very slow. The surgeon also told me that they did not want to send me home until either gas or else had passed since there may be \"something else going on\" but he never told me what that might be. I don´t have any real advice more than walking and trying to move around but you should tell him that this has happened to others also. I really feel for him, to others it sounds like a ridiculous thing but it is really painful. Good Luck",

      "Content": "He will be much better after that happened. The sore spots is normal, he has had 5 holes in his stomach and it will hurt for a while but soon get better. He should not lift anything even slightly heavy and he should certainly not twist while lifting. (but that will hurt so it is kind of self-regulating). Don´t worry about the recovery, it will be a lot easier from now on. I have had a hip replacement a couple of years ago and even if everybody says that \"it is a standard procedure and you can go home after two days and you quickly get back on your legs\" for the first week it HURTS. But it soon gets better. And I think it is the same with most major surgery, it quickly gets better but the first days can for some be very rough and we tend to only read and listen to the ones that have a smooth trip so it can be stressful when we are in the middle of pain and discomfort. But it gets better and it gets better very fast so give him a week more and you will hopefully be smiling at all of this.",

      "Content": "nrhk, I have limited experience of chemo but my mother have multiple myeloma and she has taken two series of really hard chemo, basically they gave all she could take in order to do a stem-cell transplant. What she told me is that the nausea you get used to, however the chemo caused side-effects as virus infections, herpes wounds, teeth problems and other. I don´t mean to scare you but I would like to tell that she said it was totally worth it since it prolonged her life and when the chemo stopped she quickly became better. She said that support from us was important and just to let her vent and complain about it all was important. So remember that chemo will prolong life and even if it is a pain while taking it, life quick gets better when it stops. Good Luck",

      "Content": "Hi Ron, did you also get a freePSA result? I am a Swede and I know that the procedure here differs a bit from USA but here they use the freePSA as an indicator to do a biopsy. But I would guess a new PSA first of all and probably then a DRE and then maybe a biopsy. Having said that none of these steps are anything to worry about. I know there are some differences of opinion here but I found that what took the worst hit was my dignity.... As the others say take one step at a time and try not to worry, the \"good\" thing with prostate cancer is that it most often develops slowly and with a PSA under 10 you still will have time to get educated and make an informed choice. But you are far from that yet, take a new PSA first of all. Good Luck and try not to worry too much",

      "Content": "Sorry to hear about the diagnosis, as the others have said he needs to do something and sooner probably than later. I guess he already had a biopsy and that the G7 was identified by it. His PSA is high but I have seen way worse also. You can see this as a \"glass half full\"-situation since the cancer has been identified and you can act on it compared to having missed it for couple of years more. As the others have said this type of cancer have good chances of a cure but you should hit it hard and good right now, maybe with both surgery and radiation (but your doctors will know best) And concerning diets and other methods they are fine before you get the cancer, to decrease the odds of getting it, but (and I cannot stress this enough) they are not a cure when the cancer is there. But there are still lots of things your husband should do, he should try to get as fit as ever possible before the treatment because then it will be easier to get through it, he should get educated on prostate cancer (that reduces anxiety and stress) and you should talk about it together. Apart from when my children was born, the period of handling cancer was the period when me and my wife was as closest and even if the reason was bad, it felt really good. Good Luck and feel free to ask any questions. You will soon realize that the people in here are not shy or too concerned about dignity..",

It is used as a warning in Sweden and was the reason for me to get a biopsy. A 3T MRI also gives better info. The problem is that a biopsy certainly can miss a tumour, it is not a perfect method, and here the free PSA and/or 3T MRI can give more info. I don´t want to sound negative here but I would strongly suggest to track the PSA and free PSA every say three months to catch if there is a trend. If the free PSA is <20 I would get a new biopsy. But that is me, I am just a guy who had PC. Take Care",

      "Content": "Hello Sandra, The PSA of 10 and a G3+4 in 7 samples of 18 is not good, but not very bad either. To me it sounds like the cyst is not really connected to the prostate cancer, I never heard of anything like that. The PC as such is very treatable and a cure should be possible with surgery or radiation. But I am not a doctor, just a guy who had PC. It sound like your doctors want to check the cyst first and then recommend a treatment and this sound wise to me. PC is a waiting game and tough to handle, but to me it sounds like your doctors are on track. I am sorry that you have to handle this but this forum is the right place to be and I am sure others will give further advice. Good luck and take care",

      "Content": "Hello Fred, Well the facts are that your doctors are probably right, it takes longer time, both the incontinence and the ED. But I know the frustration and the panic can be strong at times. For me it took a year to get it to work but before that it was pretty much no sex at all. We tried a couple of times but it was not very good (too floppy). But now after 17 months we finally made it so that both me and Mrs could enjoy it. The earth did not move but still.... The worst part is when you stop believing that it will get better, that is when panic enters. But it will get better. Keep trying on your own, and maybe try Muse or injections. But don´t give up, you are very early out yet. Good Luck",

Also I think I can feel that the urine bladder is not in the same place, it feels different when it is full. I can also feel a difference in the bowels. I still have way more gas than before and get bloated very easy. When this happens it hurts in the lower bowels in a new way. It is not very painful, just a new sensation. My urine stream is stronger (which makes sense). And there still is pain in the general surgical area when I lift something. Not bad but it is there very often. All this now and then freaks me out but I guess it is normal. They did mess around rather much in there.",

      "Content": "Hi Pratoman, It is not the same down there. For me I am still sore in the lowest part of the uretra, I guess after the catheter. Also I think I can feel that the urine bladder is not in the same place, it feels different when it is full. I can also feel a difference in the bowels. I still have way more gas than before and get bloated very easy. When this happens it hurts in the lower bowels in a new way. It is not very painful, just a new sensation. My urine stream is stronger (which makes sense). And there still is pain in the general surgical area when I lift something. Not bad but it is there very often. All this now and then freaks me out but I guess it is normal. They did mess around rather much in there.",

I do not have any experience to offer however what made me choose as I did was as many have stated here the wider opportunities if further treatment is needed. I also like the fact that you will get a detailed analysis of the cancer afterwards. It is a difficult choice and a lousy christmas gift to get but good luck to you. Wilde",

      "Content": "Hello Tom, You are not alone in the agony of choice, I think most of us instinctively try to avoid surgery at first. It is invasive, it will hurt, there are side-effects no man wants and so on.... But remember a few things: 1. You are probably not in a hurry with a G6 and relatively low PSA, take your time to decide, read the stickies here and ask your questions. 2. Both surgery and radiation have similar success rates 3. With surgery the side-effects hit from day one and then gets better and better, with radiation it is the opposite which speaks for surgery if you are relatively young, radiation if not. 4. With surgery you get a detailed analysis of your tumor afterwards, biopsies are now and then incorrect 5. With surgery you get a second shot with radiation if the cancer reoccurs. By now you can guess what choice I made. But to be honest then I would say that I am happy with the results so far in getting the cancer out. Incontinence was only a minor issue for me, after a couple of months I was fine. ED is still an issue but it works with Viagra. I am now 53 years old. My tumor was a G7 and quite large so if I would have chosen radiation I would have been forced to do both seeds and external radiation and actually the side-effects from that scared me more. Try not to worry too much, you can fix this and a G6 can certainly be cured. Your first prio should be to get rid of the cancer and get cured. Whatever you choose try to get a surgeon/onchologist who are experienced and who you trust. Get a second opinion and read the stories here. When you have chosen don´t lock back.

As I understand it ductal is not common and there is not as much knowledge on it as on normal adenocarcinoma so in order to be cautious it is always a G4. I try not to think too much about it, the important thing is the T2. But do ask your surgeon, and I would be grateful if you post what he say, there is not much info on ductal adenocarcinoma available. Good Luck",

      "Content": "Hello Leach, Most important you are a T2 which is good. I also have a ductal component in my report and in Sweden that is always defined as a G4. As I understand it ductal is not common and there is not as much knowledge on it as on normal adenocarcinoma so in order to be cautious it is always a G4. I try not to think too much about it, the important thing is the T2. But do ask your surgeon, and I would be grateful if you post what he say, there is not much info on ductal adenocarcinoma available. Good Luck",

It is also considered more important here that the surgeon performs a certain amount of surgeries/years than the total number. It makes kind of sense. The minimum should be >25/year which is really minimum. The guy that did surgery on me performs more than 50/year, often 6/week.",

      "Content": "Hello Tom, You are not alone in the agony of choice, I think most of us instinctively try to avoid surgery at first. It is invasive, it will hurt, there are side-effects no man wants and so on.... But remember a few things: 1. You are probably not in a hurry with a G6 and relatively low PSA, take your time to decide, read the stickies here and ask your questions. 2. Both surgery and radiation have similar success rates 3. With surgery the side-effects hit from day one and then gets better and better, with radiation it is the opposite which speaks for surgery if you are relatively young, radiation if not. 4. With surgery you get a detailed analysis of your tumor afterwards, biopsies are now and then incorrect 5. With surgery you get a second shot with radiation if the cancer reoccurs. By now you can guess what choice I made. But to be honest then I would say that I am happy with the results so far in getting the cancer out. Incontinence was only a minor issue for me, after a couple of months I was fine. ED is still an issue but it works with Viagra. I am now 53 years old. My tumor was a G7 and quite large so if I would have chosen radiation I would have been forced to do both seeds and external radiation and actually the side-effects from that scared me more. Try not to worry too much, you can fix this and a G6 can certainly be cured. Your first prio should be to get rid of the cancer and get cured. Whatever you choose try to get a surgeon/onchologist who are experienced and who you trust. Get a second opinion and read the stories here. When you have chosen don´t lock back. Good Luck and don´t hesitate to ask questions.",

      "Content": "Hi David, You are on the right track, it is 50/50 between surgery and radiation. But get a second opinion is always a good thing. Whichever you choose you want to find a good radiation guy/surgeon that you trust and that can give good info on side-effects. The big differences are basically that with surgery you get all the negative things immediately and then it gets better, it hurts and you get more or less incontinent and impotent from day 1 but then it improves and for many of us in 12-24 months you are basically fine. You also get a detailed biopsy report on what type of cancer you had which has a value. With radiation the treatment normally is much less painful but takes a longer time and the side-effects appear way later but gets worse and worse with time. It is much about your personal preference and which doctor you trust. Good Luck",

And by get back I mean it works as before with Viagra. I think that many try too much too soon after surgery and get depressed. And believe me after 6 months I was really depressed also. But patience my friend, is a virtue and it will get better. Good Luck and take care",

However my tumor was of the size that the radiation lady told me that I would need both Brachy and external beam radiation and that made me go the other direction. It was really good to sit down with both a surgeon and a radiation specialist at the same time and walk through the pros and cons. Also my wife was there which was good. For me for some reason surgery just was less scary.",

Whichever you choose you want to find a good radiation guy/surgeon that you trust and that can give good info on side-effects. The big differences are basically that with surgery you get all the negative things immediately and then it gets better, it hurts and you get more or less incontinent and impotent from day 1 but then it improves and for many of us in 12-24 months you are basically fine. You also get a detailed biopsy report on what type of cancer you had which has a value. With radiation the treatment normally is much less painful but takes a longer time and the side-effects appear way later but gets worse and worse with time. It is much about your personal preference and which doctor you trust. Good Luck",

I have a few friends which I tell it all to, all the gory details, and then we can laugh about it. But they are very few.",

      "Content": "Hi Paddy and welcome here. I have no experience from a G9 and as the others have stated you probably should hit it good and hard from day one. As I understood it from my discussions (in Sweden) the higher the G-score the stronger the argument for doing radiation as first treatment. The argument being that higher G-scores often need follow up radiation after surgery anyway. On the other hand some argue that you should take away the bulk of the tumor to increase the odds of success. I strongly recommend you to listen to both a surgeon and an radiation oncologist and find one you feel you can trust. At the end of the day the trust and the personal belief in treatment is what will make the choice. Take care and Good Luck",

      "Content": "Hello BrightSky, I am sorry about your uncles situation. Chuck is giving you good advice. If you read some of the posts here you will see that most of us have had cancer but we are not doctors just guys, the other thing is that we tend to not sugarcoat anything since we all in som point of time really wanted to know what is going on. So I am sorry to sound blunt but your uncle needs treatment and he needs it now. Even if the latest peak in PSA may be caused by something else he is still living with a diagnosed PC and PSA >20 which means he is in a real hurry. I don´t know why he did not get treatment sooner, maybe he did not want it, maybe his doctor did not explain good enough, but the good thing is that his oncologist says it is still curable. I also think that he wants to hit it with all he got which is hormones and radiation. My guess would be that with a PSA >20 he believes that the tumor may be somewhat outside the prostate but still not metastased and if so surgery is a waste of time and effort since radiation will be needed anyway in that case. So maybe the road of hormones and radiation is a very wise choice. But it would for sure be a good idea to get a second opinion. But please do not waste too much time. Once again I apologize if I sound blunt but I would like to send a sense of urgency to your uncle. Good Luck and keep posting",

      "Content": "Hi SeaCock, And welcome, I don´t want to be negative here but on ED you probably need some patience. I have spared nerves on one side, on the other \"partly\" spared. I am pretty much exactly one year from surgery (and actually when I think about it exactly on the day one year from my last normal sex!) and today it works ok with Viagra but it took about 8 months to get close. The peeing will soon be gone but for sure leaking during sex is one of the last incontinence issues to master. I can still now and then feel a small squirt just by squeezing my wife's butt.... My point with this is: don´t give up. It will come back. It is also easy to actually lose the appetite for sex, (it is just not the same with a half erection and pee leaking.....) I would NEVER have thought that would happen to me before the cancer, but to a certain extent it has. But that is also getting better and better. I wish you a successful recovery",

But then ED comes sneaking up, and it is as you say, it sucks the joy out of you. And it is depressing. But for me it took 12 months to be somewhat ok and honestly it took until now to get close to before. But now I am there and it is not depressing me anymore. So try to be patient, try Viagra and the other helps, they will help sooner or later. Also Muse could be worth a try. Good Luck",

However (and remember I am not a doctor, just a prostate cancer guy) since you are young and have 4 of 12 identified as cancer I would go for a treatment and a cure right now. I am sorry to say this. Especially if your PSA stays >10. Take your time to study side-effects and find a urologist or oncologist that you trust. There are several threads here as well as the stickies at the top which all have good information. Good Luck",

      "Content": "Hi Trinity, The others have all given you the pros and cons so I will just give my view: You need treatment and you need it sooner than later. At 59 I would do surgery since you will handle the side-effects in the beginning and not have a gradual decline (You are too young to avoid this). The important thing is to get an experienced surgeon, this will reduce side-effects. But remember this is MY unprofessional view and I am sure there are differences of opinion which I really respect. Good Luck",

      "Content": "Hello Joe, and welcome. PSA can fluctuate, mine varied up and down between 5.4 and 6.5 in two months. I would not freak out yet, maybe you should take a new test rather soon. However (and remember I am not a doctor, just a prostate cancer guy) since you are young and have 4 of 12 identified as cancer I would go for a treatment and a cure right now. I am sorry to say this. Especially if your PSA stays >10. Take your time to study side-effects and find a urologist or oncologist that you trust. There are several threads here as well as the stickies at the top which all have good information. Good Luck",

The leg bag was a flexible \"tube\" that went on your thigh and had a pocket where the bag went. All very flexible. It worked like a charm but when you forgot to empty the bag and bent your leg it would squeeze the pee out of the bottom valve. Filled my slipper like that once... It seems to me like there are several solutions to catheter bags, some work well some not so much. What I am getting at is that it may be worth to check for different brands of bags",

And yet, it's important to mention it, from time to time, because it IS one of the possible experiences of recovery and it might be helpful to those going in with lots of fear. Chuck, it is a double-edged sword. Some guys have a smooth journey and some absolutely not. But I think all stories needs to be told for the guys starting their PC trip. With the risk that some of them are disappointed but some surprised at how smoothly it went. We were two guys having surgery the same morning in my hospital. The other guy went home the day after wearing JEANS, that is actually true. Very little pain for him. I stayed for 6 days...",

I tried Muse, which works but hurts and is a bother (you should use a condom because if Muse leaks into the lady parts she will hurt also and be very unhappy...) Now after 8 months I have stopped the Cialis and I work fine if I take a viagra. It is still getting better and I truly believe that I will get back to needing nothing at some point but I am fine with the Viagra. You need some patient in the ED game.. Good Luck",

      "Content": "Hello BrightSky, I am sorry about your uncles situation. Chuck is giving you good advice. If you read some of the posts here you will see that most of us have had cancer but we are not doctors just guys, the other thing is that we tend to not sugarcoat anything since we all in som point of time really wanted to know what is going on. So I am sorry to sound blunt but your uncle needs treatment and he needs it now. Even if the latest peak in PSA may be caused by something else he is still living with a diagnosed PC and PSA >20 which means he is in a real hurry. I don´t know why he did not get treatment sooner, maybe he did not want it, maybe his doctor did not explain good enough, but the good thing is that his oncologist says it is still curable. I also think that he wants to hit it with all he got which is hormones and radiation. My guess would be that with a PSA >20 he believes that the tumor may be somewhat outside the prostate but still not metastased and if so surgery is a waste of time and effort since radiation will be needed anyway in that case. So maybe the road of hormones and radiation is a very wise choice. But it would for sure be a good idea to get a second opinion. But please do not waste too much time. Once again I apologize if I sound blunt but I would like to send a sense of urgency to your uncle. Good Luck and keep posting",

      "Content": "Hello SW, Sorry to hear about your problems. I agree with ASA, you have had a higher than normal PSA for some time and a low fPSA which is indicative of PC, but certainly not proof. As I understand it you already had a biopsy that was negative for PC, have you had a second opinion on that biopsy? might be an idea. But your urologists plan seems to be very good. You certainly need to know what is going on in there. I don´t know anything about PCA3 so I cannot comment on that but a MR guided biopsy should find any suspicious things in there. Don´t worry, you have a plan and that is the best you can do. Good Luck",

      "Content": "Hello Mark, And welcome here, there are tonnes of experience from prostate surgery here and you already have been given good advice and if you also read the stickies you will get more. You mentioned that you never have had surgery before and it is probably easier to worry without a reference. I had experience from a hip replacement surgery before my prostate surgery so I was a little knowing what to expect. And compared to that the prostate surgery is not bad at all. You should expect to feel bad for a couple of days but it is days not weeks. Pain can be handled but not to 100% and bloating, bladder spasms, shoulder pains etc may happen. But very few have all of them and some (Chuck for example) have no issues whatsoever. If that will be the case for you it is good but in average we all have some issues. The important thing here is that after 2-6 days you will be basically fine. If the direct discomfort after surgery is calculated in days (or for some hours) the next hurdle is incontinence and here we are in average talking about weeks. But doing Kegels and keeping track will show progress and even if it is a negative experience it is not painful. I say this with all respect to the guys who suffer from long incontinence but my point is that it is not physically painful as the pain caused by the surgery as such. And when we talk about ED you can expect to count months instead of weeks. Once again I know that many are more lucky and some are not but on average months. But this also can be fixed with different methods. So don´t worry too much, the surgery is not bad. It is not fun but it will be ok after a few days. And looking back it really was over quickly and normal life came back for me I would say after five weeks. Good Luck",

For me the softeners does nothing since the problem is that the bowels just stop working. Walking helped after the prostate surgery however that is tricky after a hip-replacement. @Michael: Plumbing now solved and rehab ongoing, the surgeon has signed a three month sick-leave which I will use to some extend. Pain after a hip replacement is only bad for a couple of days, now it is just sore and I can manage fine hobbling around on crutches annoying my wife.",

The leg bag was a flexible \"tube\" that went on your thigh and had a pocket where the bag went. All very flexible. It worked like a charm but when you forgot to empty the bag and bent your leg it would squeeze the pee out of the bottom valve. Filled my slipper like that once... It seems to me like there are several solutions to catheter bags, some work well some not so much. What I am getting at is that it may be worth to check for different brands of bags",

And yet, it's important to mention it, from time to time, because it IS one of the possible experiences of recovery and it might be helpful to those going in with lots of fear. Chuck, it is a double-edged sword. Some guys have a smooth journey and some absolutely not. But I think all stories needs to be told for the guys starting their PC trip. With the risk that some of them are disappointed but some surprised at how smoothly it went. We were two guys having surgery the same morning in my hospital. The other guy went home the day after wearing JEANS, that is actually true. Very little pain for him. I stayed for 6 days...",

Swollen ankles are also common after surgery and as Chuck say it has probably to do with sitting in the car for a long time, but keep an eye on it and if it gets worse or causes pain call the hospital. It takes at least a week to be somewhat ok after the surgery, it is a mayor surgery after all. Good Luck",

At 59 I would do surgery since you will handle the side-effects in the beginning and not have a gradual decline (You are too young to avoid this). The important thing is to get an experienced surgeon, this will reduce side-effects. But remember this is MY unprofessional view and I am sure there are differences of opinion which I really respect.

I have noticed during my period that things improved in steps and some of them happened quickly. For example leaking getting out of the car stopped over a day, then nothing happens during a period. Also it is very individual, I would recommend doing the kegels, for me it felt as if the muscles \"woke up\" when I did kegels. So what I am trying to say is that even if it is a marathon improvements now and then happen quickly.",

I have been fully continent (meaning no pads, but just a squirt here and there, mostly stress related, not enough to need to wear anything). BUT.... Tonight, lying in bed, watching TV, I fell asleep for about 40 minutes. Suddenly, I woke up, and realized that I was wet. VERY wet. Soaked thru my briefs and gym shorts. There was even a small wet spot in the blanket covering me. WTH? I had a strong urge to pee, and got up, was able to control it, then, when in the bathroom,took the longest pee I've taken since the catheter came out No idea where this came from, I guess I'm not really continent. Very frustrating, and scary. Anyone experience this? Strange things happen, this morning I got out of bed and into the bathroom, stripped naked and stood in front of a mirror and stretched my arms upwards and to my horror saw pee running out on the floor. Felt nothing.......",

His dr told him that surgery would most likely cause the cancer to become super aggressive and did not recommend it. He also said by no surgery he would have 10 to 12 good years. He is currently 67. Hi Jorola, I am no expert but that sounds a little strange, His PSA is high but in no way extreme, and it is moving around a little but it does not seem to rise quickly. He is only 67 there is no reason as I can see whatsoever to not treat it. Has he had any scans showing the cancer has spread? If not I would check that and also get a second opinion from an expert. But I don´t know your fathers doctor or the results from the biopsy which may indicate something else. I strongly recommend you get those results. I also know how stubborn old men can get when it comes to their health and at some point it gets to you even if you are the strong and silent type of guy so maybe it is just wearing him down. My father although older is just like that. Good Luck",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by tmack1 Thanks, Wilde. That looks like the one encouraging outcome in addition to no spread to lymph nodes or seminal vesicles. Congratulations on passing 6 months successfully! I assume your PSA's are holding down there at <.1. My surgery was just 2 weeks ago and I'm actually amazed that I feel as good as I do physically. The mental strain from the path report is another issue! tmack Thanks, I am up for my 6 month test in a couple of weeks now. Fingers crossed.",

      "Content": "Hello Anwank, I was a little older than your husband and also had a little more aggressive cancer and I went for surgery. The important thing to remember is that prostate cancer will give your masculinity a hit, but you can take it with a little support. It felt like crap after surgery while recovering and being incontinent and impotent but it gets better, and also it is a psychological struggle to get over cancer, but it is certainly doable with a little support. My advice to you is to be patient with him and try to remember and tell him that things get better and all the negative stuff will go away. He may be depressed and moody but it will get better. And time flies, today I am basically fine and it feels like cancer never happened. Try to be patient and positive Good luck",

The advice you are given here are excellent and given by guys who are experienced so you are in the right place. The two things that stuck in me which helped a lot was: 1. You are not in a hurry, you have the time to make an informed decision, but with G7 you need to make a decision 2. Talk to an urologist AND an oncologist and if you do not have confidence in them find another. You need input from both sides. Good luck",

Now 6 months later I really have no incontinence issues apart from the fact that when I have to go, I have to go now. That is no issues but one, and it is stupid. Living in Sweden I am right now on a 5 week vacation and having spent a lot of time with my wife I have noticed that every single time I hug her and maybe squeezes her ass in a loving way I squirt. Every time...And it is embarrassing since she notices how I kind of freeze mid-hug and goes to the bathroom. It is really messy when it happens wearing swim-shorts. Due to ED we have not really tried to have sex yet but now I am getting a little concerned that I will just start squirting uncontrolled if we try it. Well since dignity is way behind me I am not that concerned but just wanted to ask if any of you guys have also experienced this little problem?",

Also headphones and some kind of music player or iPad can be good if you are in a shared room and have to stay for more than one night. I was with 4 other guys and man they could snore and talk in their sleep. Apart from that I guess you get what you need from the hospital. Good Luck and take care.

The advice you are given here are excellent and given by guys who are experienced so you are in the right place. The two things that stuck in me which helped a lot was: 1. You are not in a hurry, you have the time to make an informed decision, but with G7 you need to make a decision 2. Talk to an urologist AND an oncologist and if you do not have confidence in them find another. You need input from both sides. Good luck",

      "Content": "Hi guys, 10 days ago I had a planned hip replacement, all went according to plan but the pain after is really high so I took morphine (oxycontin) to handle it. Since I know that I don´t tolerate it well I took rather low doses and only for 4 days. After 4 days I hadn't´t pooped at all and the stomach started to swell. Long story short, after 6 days I had to go to the emergency room sick as a dog, they emptied my stomach from both ends and I had a cat-scan and what I had was something called \"paralyzed guts\" (translating from Swedish here...) which means your bowels stop working and just swell up to finally burst. This can be caused by morphine which was the case for me. And burst bowels is a very bad thing as I understand it. So a small advice to you guys having surgery, if you never had morphine before be aware of your stomachs and if they stop working take it seriously.",

      "Content": "Hi, and welcome here, you are in the right place to get information. There are several guys here with similar diagnosis as you, me being one of them. When I made my choice I leaned towards radiation but later changed my mind to surgery mainly because you get an answer weather you are cured quicker and because there is the opportunity to get radiation at a later stage. But that was my reasoning and there are others who reasoned differently and are happy. In either way (as others already have stated) you should try to find an experienced doctor who you also trust. I also think you should remember that with your diagnosis (3+4 confined) you have time to get informed but it does need treatment so when you have decided you probably should not wait. But your doctors can make that judgement better of course. Good Luck",

Worst case scenario is not that bad because I am using Muse and my surgeon strongly recommend wearing a condom to avoid injecting Muse into wife, which will be like injecting hot lava. That would put a stop to sex I guess. So I am going for that. I was more curious if any more than I had the butt-squeezing squirt issue.

      "Content": "I´m Baack! Had a bumpy road and came home today after 6 days in hospital. Surgery went well, no issues with bladder spasm and in the wake-up I felt fine, sigh leakage from the catheter but a young nurse rapidly washed my boys and I was fine. The surgen spared the nerves on one side and partly on the other side but given the size of the tumor he was happy. There was a small leak in the suture so I had to have a drain in place. The most remarkable memory was the handwritten note taped on the daVinci robot saying \"Do not unplug, batteries will drain!\" (True!) However the drain added one day in hospital to check that leakage stopped. But then came the hard part, I bloated severely, my digestive system shut down. Day three I looked pregnant and started vomiting and where given morphine against the pain in the bladder area where gas probably pressed the bruised areas. The drain was removed which did not hurt but felt straight unnatural. Day four a minor fart and more vomiting. Nurses actually at one point said \"we can see that you are in such pain that you should take more morphine\". No BM but clear fluid. I did walk around as much as possible, I did take laxatives. Day five monumental fart happened after actual doing toe-touches in bathroom and pain stopped however the doctors said that evenso the swelling was so big that if it did not go down I would need an x-ray of my abdomen. However on day five things continued to get out of me and in the evening yesterday I could eat and basically feel ok. Then I also realized that the pain from the surgery as such was very minor. And day six I was released. I recognize the stomach issues from my hip replacement and I believe that this is a side effect of surgery that now and then can happen but with a prostate removal you worry more because the pain is in the same area. So here I sit and watch TV with a bag at my leg and a pregnant stomach but feeling ok.",

      "Content": "I´m Baack! Had a bumpy road and came home today after 6 days in hospital. Surgery went well, no issues with bladder spasm and in the wake-up I felt fine, sigh leakage from the catheter but a young nurse rapidly washed my boys and I was fine. The surgen spared the nerves on one side and partly on the other side but given the size of the tumor he was happy. There was a small leak in the suture so I had to have a drain in place. The most remarkable memory was the handwritten note taped on the daVinci robot saying \"Do not unplug, batteries will drain!\" (True!) However the drain added one day in hospital to check that leakage stopped. But then came the hard part, I bloated severely, my digestive system shut down. Day three I looked pregnant and started vomiting and where given morphine against the pain in the bladder area where gas probably pressed the bruised areas. The drain was removed which did not hurt but felt straight unnatural. Day four a minor fart and more vomiting. Nurses actually at one point said \"we can see that you are in such pain that you should take more morphine\". No BM but clear fluid. I did walk around as much as possible, I did take laxatives. Day five monumental fart happened after actual doing toe-touches in bathroom and pain stopped however the doctors said that evenso the swelling was so big that if it did not go down I would need an x-ray of my abdomen. However on day five things continued to get out of me and in the evening yesterday I could eat and basically feel ok. Then I also realized that the pain from the surgery as such was very minor. And day six I was released. I recognize the stomach issues from my hip replacement and I believe that this is a side effect of surgery that now and then can happen but with a prostate removal you worry more because the pain is in the same area. So here I sit and watch TV with a bag at my leg and a pregnant stomach but feeling ok.",

Day five monumental fart happened after actual doing toe-touches in bathroom and pain stopped however the doctors said that evenso the swelling was so big that if it did not go down I would need an x-ray of my abdomen. However on day five things continued to get out of me and in the evening yesterday I could eat and basically feel ok. Then I also realized that the pain from the surgery as such was very minor. And day six I was released. I recognize the stomach issues from my hip replacement and I believe that this is a side effect of surgery that now and then can happen but with a prostate removal you worry more because the pain is in the same area. So here I sit and watch TV with a bag at my leg and a pregnant stomach but feeling ok.",

I dont know how they make this? Cut stomach or somehow different? I dont know. Hi Marve, I had the robotic surgery in Sweden in January and I stayed 6 nights in hospital. Catheter in for 2 weeks. This is longer compared to many of the US guys here. I guess the US guys just can take more pain compared to us European softies Good Luck",

The leg bag was a flexible \"tube\" that went on your thigh and had a pocket where the bag went. All very flexible. It worked like a charm but when you forgot to empty the bag and bent your leg it would squeeze the pee out of the bottom valve. Filled my slipper like that once... It seems to me like there are several solutions to catheter bags, some work well some not so much. What I am getting at is that it may be worth to check for different brands of bags",

      "Content": "Hi Bricks, I took Cialis 5mg fro the first months after surgery, this did not create any erections, but it is supposed to avoid the dreaded shrinkage. I tried Muse, which works but hurts and is a bother (you should use a condom because if Muse leaks into the lady parts she will hurt also and be very unhappy...) Now after 8 months I have stopped the Cialis and I work fine if I take a viagra. It is still getting better and I truly believe that I will get back to needing nothing at some point but I am fine with the Viagra. You need some patient in the ED game.. Good Luck",

I don´t think this is about any kind of hidden bad news, it is as Hamilton stated above, a different way of doing things in Estonia compared to US.

      "Content": "Hello I pulled my catheter 2 weeks ago. This is what I observed: Nights were dry almost from day one which is good. On burning sensation I had that too, I think it is from irritation from the catheter. Also I had no real sensation of needing to pee, but when it came a couple of days later it was very urgent, basically when it came there was an interval of one minute to get to the bathroom. Pain in the perineum is normal for some time after I think. I was told to do Kegels quite aggressively, three times/day from day one. I know this does not work for everybody but it worked for me. Also on all kinds of muscle tensioning I had to really concentrate not to leak, as sneezing, farting, spitting, raising from chair etc. But if I concentrated and tensioned the muscles it got better at say day 4. From what I have read here everybody have more or less problems in the beginning but it does get better. I would do the Kegels if I were you. Good Luck",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by Marve Lot of estonian people dont talk. This is our bad problem. And seems like doctors dont talk also. I was very angry, this is really bad attitude. Could it be something really bad? Biopsy wasnt so bad...is it possible that pathology is bad? I hope that not. I don´t think this is about any kind of hidden bad news, it is as Hamilton stated above, a different way of doing things in Estonia compared to US. The only way to get an answer is for you to get a copy of the pathology report and post it here or ask for a second opinion somewhere else.",

      "Content": "Hello I pulled my catheter 2 weeks ago. This is what I observed: Nights were dry almost from day one which is good. On burning sensation I had that too, I think it is from irritation from the catheter. Also I had no real sensation of needing to pee, but when it came a couple of days later it was very urgent, basically when it came there was an interval of one minute to get to the bathroom. Pain in the perineum is normal for some time after I think. I was told to do Kegels quite aggressively, three times/day from day one. I know this does not work for everybody but it worked for me. Also on all kinds of muscle tensioning I had to really concentrate not to leak, as sneezing, farting, spitting, raising from chair etc. But if I concentrated and tensioned the muscles it got better at say day 4. From what I have read here everybody have more or less problems in the beginning but it does get better. I would do the Kegels if I were you. Good Luck",

      "Content": "Hello Mark, And welcome here, there are tonnes of experience from prostate surgery here and you already have been given good advice and if you also read the stickies you will get more. You mentioned that you never have had surgery before and it is probably easier to worry without a reference. I had experience from a hip replacement surgery before my prostate surgery so I was a little knowing what to expect. And compared to that the prostate surgery is not bad at all. You should expect to feel bad for a couple of days but it is days not weeks. Pain can be handled but not to 100% and bloating, bladder spasms, shoulder pains etc may happen. But very few have all of them and some (Chuck for example) have no issues whatsoever. If that will be the case for you it is good but in average we all have some issues. The important thing here is that after 2-6 days you will be basically fine. If the direct discomfort after surgery is calculated in days (or for some hours) the next hurdle is incontinence and here we are in average talking about weeks. But doing Kegels and keeping track will show progress and even if it is a negative experience it is not painful. I say this with all respect to the guys who suffer from long incontinence but my point is that it is not physically painful as the pain caused by the surgery as such. And when we talk about ED you can expect to count months instead of weeks. Once again I know that many are more lucky and some are not but on average months. But this also can be fixed with different methods. So don´t worry too much, the surgery is not bad. It is not fun but it will be ok after a few days. And looking back it really was over quickly and normal life came back for me I would say after five weeks. Good Luck",

      "Content": "Hello Dom555, It may sound strange but it would be more worrying with PSA 33 and no symptoms whatsoever. A rectal exam normally does not hurt much apart from hurting your dignity. Without being trained in any way I would not worry until after an infection has been ruled out. And then not until a second PSA is high. There is not much good with prostate cancer but one thing is that you very seldom are in a huge hurry, it grows slowly and there is time to get educated and make a decision. Good Luck and try not to worry, plenty of experience to be found in here also for advice.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by Pratoman Everyone is different and every experience is different, I am 7 weeks out from RALP. I have been fully continent (meaning no pads, but just a squirt here and there, mostly stress related, not enough to need to wear anything). BUT.... Tonight, lying in bed, watching TV, I fell asleep for about 40 minutes. Suddenly, I woke up, and realized that I was wet. VERY wet. Soaked thru my briefs and gym shorts. There was even a small wet spot in the blanket covering me. WTH? I had a strong urge to pee, and got up, was able to control it, then, when in the bathroom,took the longest pee I've taken since the catheter came out No idea where this came from, I guess I'm not really continent. Very frustrating, and scary. Anyone experience this? Strange things happen, this morning I got out of bed and into the bathroom, stripped naked and stood in front of a mirror and stretched my arms upwards and to my horror saw pee running out on the floor. Felt nothing.......",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by Pratoman Everyone is different and every experience is different, I am 7 weeks out from RALP. I have been fully continent (meaning no pads, but just a squirt here and there, mostly stress related, not enough to need to wear anything). BUT.... Tonight, lying in bed, watching TV, I fell asleep for about 40 minutes. Suddenly, I woke up, and realized that I was wet. VERY wet. Soaked thru my briefs and gym shorts. There was even a small wet spot in the blanket covering me. WTH? I had a strong urge to pee, and got up, was able to control it, then, when in the bathroom,took the longest pee I've taken since the catheter came out No idea where this came from, I guess I'm not really continent. Very frustrating, and scary. Anyone experience this? Strange things happen, this morning I got out of bed and into the bathroom, stripped naked and stood in front of a mirror and stretched my arms upwards and to my horror saw pee running out on the floor. Felt nothing.......",

Eat stool softener and drink a lot. Walk around. When I read all other posts very many have some issue however not always the same. Be prepared for pain and you will be surprised if it does not happen. Good Luck",

      "Content": "Hi Dogdollar, as many of the other guys I had surgery for my PC, it is now 3 months ago. The months before surgery was stressful and I also had too much to drink during that time. But remember that your diagnosis is not too bad. It can be fixed and when it has been fixed you will be almost as good as new. Many of us have issues with minor incontinence and more or less ED but it can be handled. What helped me is the fact that my type of PC (3+4) is slow and there is time to decide, and to fix it. Today probably the stress and alcohol is hurting you way more than the PC. I believe that the stress will decrease the day you make a decision on treatment plan. Because then you are doing something about it and you are back in control. And treatment choice is very much a 50/50 choice between surgery and radiation and a matter of taste in side-effects. But both will have good odds of fixing you. Try to get educated and read everything in here and then make a decision. Then it will feel better Good Luck",

I discussed it with my doctors but since I have a steel hip joint it could not be used. However they said that it had no significant advantages over traditional radiation or brachytherapy. But listen to the experts. Most people here chose surgery, but not all, the success rates are equal and basically a matter of personal preference and trust in your surgeon or onchologist. Diets and other life-style-changes are fine before you get the cancer since being healthy decreases your risks of getting it at all, however when the cancer is there diets will not cure it, only surgery or radiation will cure it. I am sorry to say that there are no real easy ways to fix this, all methods have pros and cons, but it is certainly doable and many guys here will witness of that. And life will be good after treatment also, very much so compared to the alternative. Good Luck and keep posting, I am sure others also will give their opinions.",

There is no point to this post but one and that is that I am technically cured I guess, I have <0.1 in PSA but I still feel like I have cancer. Many have advised me to \"just define yourself as cured\" but I struggle with that. I prefer to be realistic and never stop being vigilant on the PSA and I am quite happy with that.

      "Content": "Originally Posted by Dogdollar Remember the old thought exercise, Schrodinger's Cat, where a cat is place in a box with a radioactive substance, a Geiger counter, a hammer, and a vial of poison? The box was rigged so that the radioactive material, which had a 50/50 chance of emitting radiation in the course of one hour, if the substance DID emit radiation it would pe picked up by the geiger counter, which in turn was rigged to drop the hammer onto the glass vile of poison and kill the cat......but, simply by observing the sealed box, tha exact state of the cat could not be determined, and so for all practical purposes, the cat was both alive and dead at the same time, until someone actually opened the box and observed the system. I find that having PCa is a lot like being Schrodinger's Cat.People, with all of their good intentions, congratulate you on being cured, because, in the here and now, you have had the cancer removed, and your PSA is non- detectable....but what the Pca patient himself deals with is the spectre of a re-occurrence, and the plain reality that no one is really a cancer survivor until the day they die of something else. Where you wind up finding the most comfort is in knowing that whatever the ultimate outcome, you have improved your chance for a good prognosis by leaps and bounds in taking the actions you have taken. Best regards, DD That is a really good comparison. It is exactly like that.",

      "Content": "When I just had gotten the news I had cancer I read a lot and in some place (I think it was here) a guy said that having PC was \"like a long very slow dance with death....\" I thought hm, that would make a great tattoo so two weeks ago I had my first tattoo which is just a guy having a slow dance with a female death. There is no point to this post but one and that is that I am technically cured I guess, I have <0.1 in PSA but I still feel like I have cancer. Many have advised me to \"just define yourself as cured\" but I struggle with that. I prefer to be realistic and never stop being vigilant on the PSA and I am quite happy with that. The dance with death feels ok and hopefully reeeeeeeeeally long and slow. Cheers comrades",

I am not freaking out just yet, I guess I will take a new test to make sure it is not a faulty test. But I really don't believe in that. So I guess radiation is in my future and my plan is to do it sooner rather than later. Right now I just want to vomit....",

I had surgery in January 2015 and I am today basically back to normal. A year passes quickly. You are young and should handle surgery well if you choose that. I strongly advice you to talk to a surgeon and an oncologist to get a grip of side-effects and make an informed decision. Don´t worry too much, this can be fixed. Good Luck",

There is no point to this post but one and that is that I am technically cured I guess, I have <0.1 in PSA but I still feel like I have cancer. Many have advised me to \"just define yourself as cured\" but I struggle with that. I prefer to be realistic and never stop being vigilant on the PSA and I am quite happy with that. The dance with death feels ok and hopefully reeeeeeeeeally long and slow. Cheers comrades",

      "Content": "Hello SW, Sorry to hear about your problems. I agree with ASA, you have had a higher than normal PSA for some time and a low fPSA which is indicative of PC, but certainly not proof. As I understand it you already had a biopsy that was negative for PC, have you had a second opinion on that biopsy? might be an idea. But your urologists plan seems to be very good. You certainly need to know what is going on in there. I don´t know anything about PCA3 so I cannot comment on that but a MR guided biopsy should find any suspicious things in there. Don´t worry, you have a plan and that is the best you can do. Good Luck",

I eat cialis 5mg every day which does not give any erections but it has increased the blood flow to the normal level which means that my penis looks like it used to do. Good enough for me",

I tried Muse, which works but hurts and is a bother (you should use a condom because if Muse leaks into the lady parts she will hurt also and be very unhappy...) Now after 8 months I have stopped the Cialis and I work fine if I take a viagra. It is still getting better and I truly believe that I will get back to needing nothing at some point but I am fine with the Viagra. You need some patient in the ED game.. Good Luck",

And yet, it's important to mention it, from time to time, because it IS one of the possible experiences of recovery and it might be helpful to those going in with lots of fear. Chuck, it is a double-edged sword. Some guys have a smooth journey and some absolutely not. But I think all stories needs to be told for the guys starting their PC trip. With the risk that some of them are disappointed but some surprised at how smoothly it went. We were two guys having surgery the same morning in my hospital. The other guy went home the day after wearing JEANS, that is actually true. Very little pain for him. I stayed for 6 days...",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by jorola No you read right on the numbers and no he has not had surgery. His dr told him that surgery would most likely cause the cancer to become super aggressive and did not recommend it. He also said by no surgery he would have 10 to 12 good years. He is currently 67. Hi Jorola, I am no expert but that sounds a little strange, His PSA is high but in no way extreme, and it is moving around a little but it does not seem to rise quickly. He is only 67 there is no reason as I can see whatsoever to not treat it. Has he had any scans showing the cancer has spread? If not I would check that and also get a second opinion from an expert. But I don´t know your fathers doctor or the results from the biopsy which may indicate something else. I strongly recommend you get those results. I also know how stubborn old men can get when it comes to their health and at some point it gets to you even if you are the strong and silent type of guy so maybe it is just wearing him down. My father although older is just like that. Good Luck",

As the others have said to track your PSA is important but no matter what you do have time to make an informed decision. The hardest part for you right now is probably to not worry and the upcoming hits your dignity would take. There is just no dignity in this game.

Worst case scenario is not that bad because I am using Muse and my surgeon strongly recommend wearing a condom to avoid injecting Muse into wife, which will be like injecting hot lava. That would put a stop to sex I guess. So I am going for that. I was more curious if any more than I had the butt-squeezing squirt issue. Once again thanks for your advice and willingness to share experiences.",

A biopsy even more but only exactly from where it is taken 4. If prostate cancer spreads - there is no cure, there is a lot of other stuff that can be done and time will get new treatments, but here and now no cure For me that said that I would maybe do AS if I had G6 in few cores and I would still do regular biopsies and PSA tests, but with G7...fix it now. Statistics is statistics, the problem is that no single case of PC are alike, and neither are side-effects from treatments. There was a point where I could have flipped a coin on radiation vs surgery and gone with it, and it probably would have been fine. I went for surgery and I will not look back, side-effects have been fine for me. I am sorry if I sound blunt but unfortunately there is no way of predicting a specific case, you may become incontinent, you may become impotent, the cancer may spread, and maybe not. Very many get cured and live with the side-effects in a good way. Good Luck and stay positive (even after listening to me..)",

If you never have had surgery there are some things you should know: It hurts after the surgery, and painkillers can handle it so that you can take it. Important thing to remember is that the pain is normal and does not mean something is wrong. Try to eat and walk as much as you can, that helps and getting your digestive system on track is important. The catheter and other practical stuff is nothing to worry about at all, if you read the stickies and stories here you will be well prepared. And the healing curve is steep, two weeks after surgery you will be pretty well back to normal. Feel free to post any questions here and Good Luck",

      "Content": "Hi, I had my surgery in January and was pretty much continent 6 weeks later. Now 6 months later I really have no incontinence issues apart from the fact that when I have to go, I have to go now. That is no issues but one, and it is stupid. Living in Sweden I am right now on a 5 week vacation and having spent a lot of time with my wife I have noticed that every single time I hug her and maybe squeezes her ass in a loving way I squirt. Every time...And it is embarrassing since she notices how I kind of freeze mid-hug and goes to the bathroom. It is really messy when it happens wearing swim-shorts. Due to ED we have not really tried to have sex yet but now I am getting a little concerned that I will just start squirting uncontrolled if we try it. Well since dignity is way behind me I am not that concerned but just wanted to ask if any of you guys have also experienced this little problem?",

Also headphones and some kind of music player or iPad can be good if you are in a shared room and have to stay for more than one night. I was with 4 other guys and man they could snore and talk in their sleep. Apart from that I guess you get what you need from the hospital. Good Luck and take care.

      "Content": "I am so sorry but I think that you should listen to the oncologist who should now best what the odds are for radiation. Cured is also a question about definition, at the end it is all about odds...Unfortunately it sound as if your husband still needs to hit it hard again and that he will have side-effects that will be hard on him, but the positive thing is that side-effects as incontinence is better handled the younger you are and he seems to have recovered quickly after surgery so there is hope that he can handle also the radiation well. Others have more experience on radiation but my small advice would be to not listen too much on the statistics, we are all very different and very many here have beaten the odds.",

Swollen ankles are also common after surgery and as Chuck say it has probably to do with sitting in the car for a long time, but keep an eye on it and if it gets worse or causes pain call the hospital. It takes at least a week to be somewhat ok after the surgery, it is a mayor surgery after all. Good Luck",

Packed my bag, loose pants, several underwear, iPad loaded with movies and books. Stored man-pads for several weeks, made guest bed with rubberized sheets, bought prune-juice and all kinds of fruits and soups. Filled car with gas and checked weather for tomorrow. There probably are astronauts less prepared for space..... Thank you all for your advice and support in this forum. See you on the other side.",

      "Content": "I´m Baack! Had a bumpy road and came home today after 6 days in hospital. Surgery went well, no issues with bladder spasm and in the wake-up I felt fine, sigh leakage from the catheter but a young nurse rapidly washed my boys and I was fine. The surgen spared the nerves on one side and partly on the other side but given the size of the tumor he was happy. There was a small leak in the suture so I had to have a drain in place. The most remarkable memory was the handwritten note taped on the daVinci robot saying \"Do not unplug, batteries will drain!\" (True!) However the drain added one day in hospital to check that leakage stopped. But then came the hard part, I bloated severely, my digestive system shut down. Day three I looked pregnant and started vomiting and where given morphine against the pain in the bladder area where gas probably pressed the bruised areas. The drain was removed which did not hurt but felt straight unnatural. Day four a minor fart and more vomiting. Nurses actually at one point said \"we can see that you are in such pain that you should take more morphine\". No BM but clear fluid. I did walk around as much as possible, I did take laxatives. Day five monumental fart happened after actual doing toe-touches in bathroom and pain stopped however the doctors said that evenso the swelling was so big that if it did not go down I would need an x-ray of my abdomen. However on day five things continued to get out of me and in the evening yesterday I could eat and basically feel ok. Then I also realized that the pain from the surgery as such was very minor. And day six I was released. I recognize the stomach issues from my hip replacement and I believe that this is a side effect of surgery that now and then can happen but with a prostate removal you worry more because the pain is in the same area. So here I sit and watch TV with a bag at my leg and a pregnant stomach but feeling ok.",

      "Content": "I´m Baack! Had a bumpy road and came home today after 6 days in hospital. Surgery went well, no issues with bladder spasm and in the wake-up I felt fine, sigh leakage from the catheter but a young nurse rapidly washed my boys and I was fine. The surgen spared the nerves on one side and partly on the other side but given the size of the tumor he was happy. There was a small leak in the suture so I had to have a drain in place. The most remarkable memory was the handwritten note taped on the daVinci robot saying \"Do not unplug, batteries will drain!\" (True!) However the drain added one day in hospital to check that leakage stopped. But then came the hard part, I bloated severely, my digestive system shut down. Day three I looked pregnant and started vomiting and where given morphine against the pain in the bladder area where gas probably pressed the bruised areas. The drain was removed which did not hurt but felt straight unnatural. Day four a minor fart and more vomiting. Nurses actually at one point said \"we can see that you are in such pain that you should take more morphine\". No BM but clear fluid. I did walk around as much as possible, I did take laxatives. Day five monumental fart happened after actual doing toe-touches in bathroom and pain stopped however the doctors said that evenso the swelling was so big that if it did not go down I would need an x-ray of my abdomen. However on day five things continued to get out of me and in the evening yesterday I could eat and basically feel ok. Then I also realized that the pain from the surgery as such was very minor. And day six I was released. I recognize the stomach issues from my hip replacement and I believe that this is a side effect of surgery that now and then can happen but with a prostate removal you worry more because the pain is in the same area. So here I sit and watch TV with a bag at my leg and a pregnant stomach but feeling ok.",

The advice you are given here are excellent and given by guys who are experienced so you are in the right place. The two things that stuck in me which helped a lot was: 1. You are not in a hurry, you have the time to make an informed decision, but with G7 you need to make a decision 2. Talk to an urologist AND an oncologist and if you do not have confidence in them find another. You need input from both sides. Good luck",

Luckily I had a hip-replacement a year ago and know how to take the shots. Also I am quite calm since the pain from the hip-replacement probably was way worse than what tomorrow might throw at me. Packed my bag, loose pants, several underwear, iPad loaded with movies and books. Stored man-pads for several weeks, made guest bed with rubberized sheets, bought prune-juice and all kinds of fruits and soups. Filled car with gas and checked weather for tomorrow. There probably are astronauts less prepared for space..... Thank you all for your advice and support in this forum. See you on the other side.",

      "Content": "Hi all, just took the energy drink which will be my last meal before surgery tomorrow and also took the Klexane-shot in my bellyfat. Luckily I had a hip-replacement a year ago and know how to take the shots. Also I am quite calm since the pain from the hip-replacement probably was way worse than what tomorrow might throw at me. Packed my bag, loose pants, several underwear, iPad loaded with movies and books. Stored man-pads for several weeks, made guest bed with rubberized sheets, bought prune-juice and all kinds of fruits and soups. Filled car with gas and checked weather for tomorrow. There probably are astronauts less prepared for space..... Thank you all for your advice and support in this forum. See you on the other side.",

      "Content": "Hi, and welcome here, you are in the right place to get information. There are several guys here with similar diagnosis as you, me being one of them. When I made my choice I leaned towards radiation but later changed my mind to surgery mainly because you get an answer weather you are cured quicker and because there is the opportunity to get radiation at a later stage. But that was my reasoning and there are others who reasoned differently and are happy. In either way (as others already have stated) you should try to find an experienced doctor who you also trust. I also think you should remember that with your diagnosis (3+4 confined) you have time to get informed but it does need treatment so when you have decided you probably should not wait. But your doctors can make that judgement better of course. Good Luck",

      "Content": "Hello I pulled my catheter 2 weeks ago. This is what I observed: Nights were dry almost from day one which is good. On burning sensation I had that too, I think it is from irritation from the catheter. Also I had no real sensation of needing to pee, but when it came a couple of days later it was very urgent, basically when it came there was an interval of one minute to get to the bathroom. Pain in the perineum is normal for some time after I think. I was told to do Kegels quite aggressively, three times/day from day one. I know this does not work for everybody but it worked for me. Also on all kinds of muscle tensioning I had to really concentrate not to leak, as sneezing, farting, spitting, raising from chair etc. But if I concentrated and tensioned the muscles it got better at say day 4. From what I have read here everybody have more or less problems in the beginning but it does get better. I would do the Kegels if I were you. Good Luck",

If your nerves where removed I believe that you need to try the injections or Muse (Bondil) which is inserted in the uretra. It works, it hurts a bit but it is worth it to have an erection again. Good Luck",

This is the only one with significant scar tissue, all others are visible but very smooth and without bumps or anything like that. It looks like a saturday night knife fight.

Without being trained in any way I would not worry until after an infection has been ruled out. And then not until a second PSA is high. There is not much good with prostate cancer but one thing is that you very seldom are in a huge hurry, it grows slowly and there is time to get educated and make a decision. Good Luck and try not to worry, plenty of experience to be found in here also for advice.",

      "Content": "Hello I pulled my catheter 2 weeks ago. This is what I observed: Nights were dry almost from day one which is good. On burning sensation I had that too, I think it is from irritation from the catheter. Also I had no real sensation of needing to pee, but when it came a couple of days later it was very urgent, basically when it came there was an interval of one minute to get to the bathroom. Pain in the perineum is normal for some time after I think. I was told to do Kegels quite aggressively, three times/day from day one. I know this does not work for everybody but it worked for me. Also on all kinds of muscle tensioning I had to really concentrate not to leak, as sneezing, farting, spitting, raising from chair etc. But if I concentrated and tensioned the muscles it got better at say day 4. From what I have read here everybody have more or less problems in the beginning but it does get better. I would do the Kegels if I were you. Good Luck",

      "Content": "Hello I pulled my catheter 2 weeks ago. This is what I observed: Nights were dry almost from day one which is good. On burning sensation I had that too, I think it is from irritation from the catheter. Also I had no real sensation of needing to pee, but when it came a couple of days later it was very urgent, basically when it came there was an interval of one minute to get to the bathroom. Pain in the perineum is normal for some time after I think. I was told to do Kegels quite aggressively, three times/day from day one. I know this does not work for everybody but it worked for me. Also on all kinds of muscle tensioning I had to really concentrate not to leak, as sneezing, farting, spitting, raising from chair etc. But if I concentrated and tensioned the muscles it got better at say day 4. From what I have read here everybody have more or less problems in the beginning but it does get better. I would do the Kegels if I were you. Good Luck",

      "Content": "Hi, in the beginning it is all about getting blood back into the penis, not really having sex. Without cialis there will be no erections whatsoever and that may lead to problems later and the dreaded shrinkage of the penis.....Normally a guy gets erections in his sleep which guarantees blood flow, after surgery this does not work automatically so cialis is needed. So the first goal should be to get something happening, not necessarily sex. My surgeon told me it was important to \"stretch things out a bit\" Later on some extra \"help\" may be needed to get back to 100% for example Viagra or Muse, but the important first thing is really to get blood flow back, sex will come back gradually. Good Luck",

      "Content": "Wayne, please listen to Chuck he is giving you good advice. And even if your total diagnosis is not the worst in the world you will sooner or later need treatment. It might not be a big hurry but at 62 a 3+4 cancer will certainly have the time needed to kill you. I am sorry to be blunt, I really am. I would strongly suggest to use the time you have to decide on a treatment and enjoy your days without side-effects, but unfortunately there are very few miracles and very few cancers go away. I am a strong believer in a healthy life-style and the good sides of religion, but I also believe that a healthy life-style might decrease the odds of getting cancer but NOT cure it if it occurs. I think this is often mixed for same. I think you should listen to yourself \" I have PCa, 4/12 cores positive, 10% PTI (small volume), Gleason score for 3, 3+3 and the forth 3+4\" These are the facts. Get another opinion from one of the institutions recommended here, and go from there. Good Luck and keep posting",

      "Content": "Hi Mik, you have a very similar case as I had. If the path says PT2.....which means the thing did not escape AND your PSA is undetectable you are basically fine for now. You just have to track PSA. Don´t worry about RT until you get the path report. And remember that the PSA needs some time to get out of your system so the first one may be detectable but not necessarily bad. Ask your Uro. This is a waiting game, try to relax and get well and wait for the PSA and path report to see what will come next. Good Luck",

      "Content": "Hello Frenchy, Sorry to hear about your diagnosis but welcome here. I think the reason there is not much about proton here is that it is not used very much. I discussed it with my doctors but since I have a steel hip joint it could not be used. However they said that it had no significant advantages over traditional radiation or brachytherapy. But listen to the experts. Most people here chose surgery, but not all, the success rates are equal and basically a matter of personal preference and trust in your surgeon or onchologist. Diets and other life-style-changes are fine before you get the cancer since being healthy decreases your risks of getting it at all, however when the cancer is there diets will not cure it, only surgery or radiation will cure it. I am sorry to say that there are no real easy ways to fix this, all methods have pros and cons, but it is certainly doable and many guys here will witness of that. And life will be good after treatment also, very much so compared to the alternative. Good Luck and keep posting, I am sure others also will give their opinions.",

I had 6 of 10 3+3 and 2 of 10 3+4. I don´t see a reason to get a second opinion, the 3+4 indicates that treatment is needed and assume that the second opinion gives a 3+3 only result you would never get peace of mind on which opinion is correct. And if higher, well treatment is then also needed. A 3+4 with moderate PSA and nothing felt on the DRE and no symptoms is as far as I see it curable and you now \"just\" have to decide what treatment you and your husband prefers. I also think that you have time to study before you decide. But an experienced urologist and/or onchologist of course have more knowledge than me. Also this forum have tonnes of info and experiences that helps a lot when deciding. Good Luck and take care",

      "Content": "Hi, in the beginning it is all about getting blood back into the penis, not really having sex. Without cialis there will be no erections whatsoever and that may lead to problems later and the dreaded shrinkage of the penis.....Normally a guy gets erections in his sleep which guarantees blood flow, after surgery this does not work automatically so cialis is needed. So the first goal should be to get something happening, not necessarily sex. My surgeon told me it was important to \"stretch things out a bit\" Later on some extra \"help\" may be needed to get back to 100% for example Viagra or Muse, but the important first thing is really to get blood flow back, sex will come back gradually. Good Luck",

      "Content": "Hi Dogdollar, as many of the other guys I had surgery for my PC, it is now 3 months ago. The months before surgery was stressful and I also had too much to drink during that time. But remember that your diagnosis is not too bad. It can be fixed and when it has been fixed you will be almost as good as new. Many of us have issues with minor incontinence and more or less ED but it can be handled. What helped me is the fact that my type of PC (3+4) is slow and there is time to decide, and to fix it. Today probably the stress and alcohol is hurting you way more than the PC. I believe that the stress will decrease the day you make a decision on treatment plan. Because then you are doing something about it and you are back in control. And treatment choice is very much a 50/50 choice between surgery and radiation and a matter of taste in side-effects. But both will have good odds of fixing you. Try to get educated and read everything in here and then make a decision. Then it will feel better Good Luck",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by Dogdollar Remember the old thought exercise, Schrodinger's Cat, where a cat is place in a box with a radioactive substance, a Geiger counter, a hammer, and a vial of poison? The box was rigged so that the radioactive material, which had a 50/50 chance of emitting radiation in the course of one hour, if the substance DID emit radiation it would pe picked up by the geiger counter, which in turn was rigged to drop the hammer onto the glass vile of poison and kill the cat......but, simply by observing the sealed box, tha exact state of the cat could not be determined, and so for all practical purposes, the cat was both alive and dead at the same time, until someone actually opened the box and observed the system. I find that having PCa is a lot like being Schrodinger's Cat.People, with all of their good intentions, congratulate you on being cured, because, in the here and now, you have had the cancer removed, and your PSA is non- detectable....but what the Pca patient himself deals with is the spectre of a re-occurrence, and the plain reality that no one is really a cancer survivor until the day they die of something else. Where you wind up finding the most comfort is in knowing that whatever the ultimate outcome, you have improved your chance for a good prognosis by leaps and bounds in taking the actions you have taken. Best regards, DD That is a really good comparison. It is exactly like that.",

I discussed it with my doctors but since I have a steel hip joint it could not be used. However they said that it had no significant advantages over traditional radiation or brachytherapy. But listen to the experts. Most people here chose surgery, but not all, the success rates are equal and basically a matter of personal preference and trust in your surgeon or onchologist. Diets and other life-style-changes are fine before you get the cancer since being healthy decreases your risks of getting it at all, however when the cancer is there diets will not cure it, only surgery or radiation will cure it. I am sorry to say that there are no real easy ways to fix this, all methods have pros and cons, but it is certainly doable and many guys here will witness of that.

It does not hurt and it is the only way to get an answer on what is going on. The free PSA suggests cancer but remember that with your low PSA it is probably very early found and/or low aggressive type, and you have time enough to get educated and make a decision. Many of the guys here have done surgery and it very often turns out successfully. The odds are high that you will be fine so read the guys stories here, read the stickies and once again remember that whatever is happening in there you have time to decide what to do and get back in charge of it. Good Luck",

      "Content": "Hi all, I took my 3.5 year PSA-test this morning and even if I have stopped worrying in advance of the test (as I used to) when I sit there with that needle in my arm all the old cancer fear pops up. My last two PSA:s were exactly 0.05 which in Sweden is considered measurable (not <0.05) so the test today is special since it will show if I have a rising trend or not. My urologist recommends to wait until 0.2 for further treatment but I am not sure I like to wait that far. So this afternoon I get the results. No point with this thread, just venting.",

      "Content": "Hello Jonno, I had a very similar trip as you when it comes to constipation and beeing basically totally clogged up. They kept me in hospital 6 days for that reason. As for you day 5 was really a low point. I tried to eat but vomited immediately. Day 6 things started to happen and 7 and ahead the stomach started to work. Beeing clogged up sounds like a minor issue to most people but when it happens and specially in combination with abdomen surgery it is no joke. It hurts like hell and you feel really miserable. And as you say painkillers make it worse. My father had the same problems after a heart by-pass surgery and he also confirmed that the surgery as such would have been quite fine if it wasn´t for the stomach problems. Good Luck",

I had surgery in January 2015 and I am today basically back to normal. A year passes quickly. You are young and should handle surgery well if you choose that. I strongly advice you to talk to a surgeon and an oncologist to get a grip of side-effects and make an informed decision. Don´t worry too much, this can be fixed. Good Luck",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by Dogdollar Remember the old thought exercise, Schrodinger's Cat, where a cat is place in a box with a radioactive substance, a Geiger counter, a hammer, and a vial of poison? The box was rigged so that the radioactive material, which had a 50/50 chance of emitting radiation in the course of one hour, if the substance DID emit radiation it would pe picked up by the geiger counter, which in turn was rigged to drop the hammer onto the glass vile of poison and kill the cat......but, simply by observing the sealed box, tha exact state of the cat could not be determined, and so for all practical purposes, the cat was both alive and dead at the same time, until someone actually opened the box and observed the system. I find that having PCa is a lot like being Schrodinger's Cat.People, with all of their good intentions, congratulate you on being cured, because, in the here and now, you have had the cancer removed, and your PSA is non- detectable....but what the Pca patient himself deals with is the spectre of a re-occurrence, and the plain reality that no one is really a cancer survivor until the day they die of something else. Where you wind up finding the most comfort is in knowing that whatever the ultimate outcome, you have improved your chance for a good prognosis by leaps and bounds in taking the actions you have taken. Best regards, DD That is a really good comparison. It is exactly like that.",

      "Content": "Hello Mary, Your husbands data are very similar to mine, 6 of 8 cores and some 3+4, I had 8 of 10 with 2 3+4. Now I have to agree strongly with Chuck. Many cores positive indicates a large tumour and 3+4 indicates somewhat aggressive type of cancer. The problem is that the biopsy cannot be detailed enough to say how close to the edge the tumor is (how close to escape to the outside). This is unfortunately a kind of digital situation, if you get it all out and it has not escaped the odds are very much in your favor, if not the odds go down quite fast. Not saying that it cannot be fixed if it escaped, just saying that it is easier before. My tumor was in aftersight bigger than expected and very close to the edge (positive margins) in two places. But now it is out an that feels good. Personally i sometimes can hear the bullet passing 1 mm over my head... I would not wait, I would treat it and sooner is better. Good Luck",

      "Content": "Hello Jonno, I had a very similar trip as you when it comes to constipation and beeing basically totally clogged up. They kept me in hospital 6 days for that reason. As for you day 5 was really a low point. I tried to eat but vomited immediately. Day 6 things started to happen and 7 and ahead the stomach started to work. Beeing clogged up sounds like a minor issue to most people but when it happens and specially in combination with abdomen surgery it is no joke. It hurts like hell and you feel really miserable. And as you say painkillers make it worse. My father had the same problems after a heart by-pass surgery and he also confirmed that the surgery as such would have been quite fine if it wasn´t for the stomach problems. Good Luck",

      "Content": "Hello Davis, I was in a similar situation 7 months ago and there are a few things that might help you, first of all the biopsy is not as bad as it sounds, just abandon all dignity concerns and do it. It does not hurt and it is the only way to get an answer on what is going on. The free PSA suggests cancer but remember that with your low PSA it is probably very early found and/or low aggressive type, and you have time enough to get educated and make a decision. Many of the guys here have done surgery and it very often turns out successfully. The odds are high that you will be fine so read the guys stories here, read the stickies and once again remember that whatever is happening in there you have time to decide what to do and get back in charge of it. Good Luck",

      "Content": "Hello Davis, I was in a similar situation 7 months ago and there are a few things that might help you, first of all the biopsy is not as bad as it sounds, just abandon all dignity concerns and do it. It does not hurt and it is the only way to get an answer on what is going on. The free PSA suggests cancer but remember that with your low PSA it is probably very early found and/or low aggressive type, and you have time enough to get educated and make a decision. Many of the guys here have done surgery and it very often turns out successfully. The odds are high that you will be fine so read the guys stories here, read the stickies and once again remember that whatever is happening in there you have time to decide what to do and get back in charge of it. Good Luck",

If you take a guy from the street and just make him take a PSA every 6 months he will be nervous too. My wife is like that just before the standard mammography also. The difference is that we know what we are talking about, we had the small peck on the cheek by death, and we are waiting for the deep kiss.... We just have to deal with it, you will be fine...",

      "Content": "Hello pjr, sorry about the worry you have to face. I had similar PSA and fPSA as your husband and as I had it explained the PSA could be slightly increased for several reasons but a fPSA <20% indicates cancer, however not necessarily aggressive cancer. I think you should see it as a reason to go for a biopsy, if the fPSA would have been >20% maybe a retest of the PSA would have been in order. Having said that a PSA of 6.5 and fPSA of 14.4% is not very high and if it is cancer there are good odds that it is curable. This can however only be confirmed by a biopsy so I suggest you do it. There probably is no hurry though. But if you are worried by all means get it done soon to get the confirmation what you are dealing with. Also tell him not to worry about the biopsy, a dentist normally will hurt you worse. (Dignity on the other hand of course have to be abandoned.......)",

      "Content": "Hi Wendy, not much to add to what already has been said but since I had similar biopsy results as your husband I may be an example what can happen. I don´t believe you want to do AS with a G7 and with a PSA of 20. The relatively high PSA may indicate that there is more going on and that the biopsy did not catch everything so I would not risk AS. Having said that the PSA varies between individuals and it may be that he has a low/medium grade tumor and that surgery will fix him without any big issues. The main reason I went for surgery is really the definitive biopsy results you get afterwards and then you will know much better what was going on. But when it comes to treatment success rates surgery and radiation is basically at par. As already have been advised a chat with both a urologist and an oncologist is strongly recommended. I had a talk with both at the same time and my wife was there also and that was really helpful. Good Luck and don´t hesitate to ask questions.",

And at the end of the day he did spare all nerves on one side and almost all on the other. Today I am glad that he did it that way, I am sure I would have been completely devastated if he would have said that nerve sparing was possible and during surgery changed his mind in the other direction.... It is very much about the trust you have in the surgeon and his/hers experience.",

What you do know is that your PSA is 6.1 which is higher than normal but can come from other issues than cancer. But if it is cancer 6.1 is not very high and indicates that it can be successfully treated. But one step at the time, do the biopsy and read all info here and the recommended book. Don´t worry too much, the biopsy is not bad and after that you will know what to do. Good Luck",

I had one issue with the leg bag and that was that all the three ones I got leaked when full and specifically if I placed it at knee height and bent my leg. This seemed to apply some pressure and it leaked. Since the pee was warm I didn´t notice until I had more or less filled my slipper. Pee all down the leg. The other time I forgot to open the drain valve to the big bag during night causing the leg-bag to be very full and leak down the bed. Friday will come soon enough and you will be happy to switch one pee-problem to another but I never missed the catheter, at least it did not hurt a bit to pull it out. Good Luck",

      "Content": "Hello pjr, sorry about the worry you have to face. I had similar PSA and fPSA as your husband and as I had it explained the PSA could be slightly increased for several reasons but a fPSA <20% indicates cancer, however not necessarily aggressive cancer. I think you should see it as a reason to go for a biopsy, if the fPSA would have been >20% maybe a retest of the PSA would have been in order. Having said that a PSA of 6.5 and fPSA of 14.4% is not very high and if it is cancer there are good odds that it is curable. This can however only be confirmed by a biopsy so I suggest you do it. There probably is no hurry though. But if you are worried by all means get it done soon to get the confirmation what you are dealing with. Also tell him not to worry about the biopsy, a dentist normally will hurt you worse. (Dignity on the other hand of course have to be abandoned.......)",

      "Content": "Hi Wendy, not much to add to what already has been said but since I had similar biopsy results as your husband I may be an example what can happen. I don´t believe you want to do AS with a G7 and with a PSA of 20. The relatively high PSA may indicate that there is more going on and that the biopsy did not catch everything so I would not risk AS. Having said that the PSA varies between individuals and it may be that he has a low/medium grade tumor and that surgery will fix him without any big issues. The main reason I went for surgery is really the definitive biopsy results you get afterwards and then you will know much better what was going on. But when it comes to treatment success rates surgery and radiation is basically at par. As already have been advised a chat with both a urologist and an oncologist is strongly recommended. I had a talk with both at the same time and my wife was there also and that was really helpful. Good Luck and don´t hesitate to ask questions.",

      "Content": "Hi Wendy, not much to add to what already has been said but since I had similar biopsy results as your husband I may be an example what can happen. I don´t believe you want to do AS with a G7 and with a PSA of 20. The relatively high PSA may indicate that there is more going on and that the biopsy did not catch everything so I would not risk AS. Having said that the PSA varies between individuals and it may be that he has a low/medium grade tumor and that surgery will fix him without any big issues. The main reason I went for surgery is really the definitive biopsy results you get afterwards and then you will know much better what was going on. But when it comes to treatment success rates surgery and radiation is basically at par. As already have been advised a chat with both a urologist and an oncologist is strongly recommended. I had a talk with both at the same time and my wife was there also and that was really helpful. Good Luck and don´t hesitate to ask questions.",

      "Content": "Hello pjr, sorry about the worry you have to face. I had similar PSA and fPSA as your husband and as I had it explained the PSA could be slightly increased for several reasons but a fPSA <20% indicates cancer, however not necessarily aggressive cancer. I think you should see it as a reason to go for a biopsy, if the fPSA would have been >20% maybe a retest of the PSA would have been in order. Having said that a PSA of 6.5 and fPSA of 14.4% is not very high and if it is cancer there are good odds that it is curable. This can however only be confirmed by a biopsy so I suggest you do it. There probably is no hurry though. But if you are worried by all means get it done soon to get the confirmation what you are dealing with. Also tell him not to worry about the biopsy, a dentist normally will hurt you worse. (Dignity on the other hand of course have to be abandoned.......)",

      "Content": "Hi Mike, As Chuck said progress is different for all, but I can understand your frustration. As I get it there are three steps of progress: Dry at nights Dry while walking Dry while doing unusual movements like standing up, sneezing... It sounds like you are somewhere between 1 and 2. I did Kegels a little different, I did 10 6 seconds hold, 10 2 seconds hold and 2 60 seconds hoooooold. This three times a day. I also have heard of guys only doing Kegels once a day, I think it is possible to overdo it. Maybe you should try some variants? But I am no expert so ask your urologist. I had a smoother incontinence journey than you but still it felt hopeless at times and what helped was weighing the pads to keep track of daily leakage and by doing that I could see progress even if it did not feel like that. Also progress comes in steps, so don´t get too worried, one day it just gets a step better. Good Luck",

I had one issue with the leg bag and that was that all the three ones I got leaked when full and specifically if I placed it at knee height and bent my leg. This seemed to apply some pressure and it leaked. Since the pee was warm I didn´t notice until I had more or less filled my slipper. Pee all down the leg. The other time I forgot to open the drain valve to the big bag during night causing the leg-bag to be very full and leak down the bed. Friday will come soon enough and you will be happy to switch one pee-problem to another but I never missed the catheter, at least it did not hurt a bit to pull it out. Good Luck",

As I get it there are three steps of progress: Dry at nights Dry while walking Dry while doing unusual movements like standing up, sneezing... It sounds like you are somewhere between 1 and 2. I did Kegels a little different, I did 10 6 seconds hold, 10 2 seconds hold and 2 60 seconds hoooooold. This three times a day. I also have heard of guys only doing Kegels once a day, I think it is possible to overdo it. Maybe you should try some variants? But I am no expert so ask your urologist. I had a smoother incontinence journey than you but still it felt hopeless at times and what helped was weighing the pads to keep track of daily leakage and by doing that I could see progress even if it did not feel like that. Also progress comes in steps, so don´t get too worried, one day it just gets a step better. Good Luck",

      "Content": "Hi Mike, As Chuck said progress is different for all, but I can understand your frustration. As I get it there are three steps of progress: Dry at nights Dry while walking Dry while doing unusual movements like standing up, sneezing... It sounds like you are somewhere between 1 and 2. I did Kegels a little different, I did 10 6 seconds hold, 10 2 seconds hold and 2 60 seconds hoooooold. This three times a day. I also have heard of guys only doing Kegels once a day, I think it is possible to overdo it. Maybe you should try some variants? But I am no expert so ask your urologist. I had a smoother incontinence journey than you but still it felt hopeless at times and what helped was weighing the pads to keep track of daily leakage and by doing that I could see progress even if it did not feel like that. Also progress comes in steps, so don´t get too worried, one day it just gets a step better. Good Luck",

When I got PC me and my wife decided that when all was done we would get at tattoo with the date I was cured as a reminder. Well that never happened since I cannot even today say I am cured. What you say sums it up perfectly \"stay the course and live life to the fullest\" Take care",

If you can get your fathers PSA-value and biopsy results it is easier to give better advice so try to get that information. With most prostate cancers you are not in a big hurry, you can take your time to get educated and your father can make an informed treatment choice. The book ddayglo recommends is also very good. Good Luck",

As I get it there are three steps of progress: Dry at nights Dry while walking Dry while doing unusual movements like standing up, sneezing... It sounds like you are somewhere between 1 and 2. I did Kegels a little different, I did 10 6 seconds hold, 10 2 seconds hold and 2 60 seconds hoooooold. This three times a day. I also have heard of guys only doing Kegels once a day, I think it is possible to overdo it. Maybe you should try some variants? But I am no expert so ask your urologist. I had a smoother incontinence journey than you but still it felt hopeless at times and what helped was weighing the pads to keep track of daily leakage and by doing that I could see progress even if it did not feel like that. Also progress comes in steps, so don´t get too worried, one day it just gets a step better. Good Luck",

Both will to some extent change you physically and in your age ED is hard to live with. So Fran´s advice is a good one, have as much sex as possible..now! I had worse cancer and had to have surgery and I still dream about my glorious autumn 2014 when sex was good. But don´t worry, surgery is (as many here will agree with) not as bad as it sounds, and also radiation will be another option that others also can give advice on.",

What I am trying to say here is that it is good to find these issues in time so that they can be fixed compared to find out when it is all too late... Good Luck",

      "Content": "Hi Rebern, Your Uro has a point. fPSA is a second indicator of cancer. I am really sorry to say this. My Uro (in Sweden) has a limit which says that fPSA<20% indicates cancer and if you have fPSA lower than this a biopsy is recommended. PSA can fluctuate and biking may affect it, but combined with a low fPSA I would recommend you to take the biopsy and get the issue either off your agenda or on and if so to start planning your treatment options. I am sure others here will also give more advice. I did my surgery in January and I am back on the bike now. It feels good. Good Luck",

Both will to some extent change you physically and in your age ED is hard to live with. So Fran´s advice is a good one, have as much sex as possible..now! I had worse cancer and had to have surgery and I still dream about my glorious autumn 2014 when sex was good. But don´t worry, surgery is (as many here will agree with) not as bad as it sounds, and also radiation will be another option that others also can give advice on.",

      "Content": "Hello Jlynn, The others have basically covered everything, just adding some reflections. Your husbands data are very similar to mine (and many others) I had G3+4 and PSA around 6. My tumour was bigger though. I did surgery in january. I went for surgery for two reasons, you get a very final analysis of the tumor and the cancer is out of you. I was very concerned about the side-effects, primarily incontinence, but that has worked out well, after roughly 5 weeks it was ok. As Shu says the plumbing is different and it will never be as before but my wife told me \"You are as continent as any woman who have had babies\" ED is an issue but still to early to judge. The majority in this forum have chosen surgery but I believe that is more due to gut feeling \"get it out of me!\" than radiation being less effective. Most guys here who chose radiation are very happy. The odds of success are as I understand it basically the same. Whatever you decide it is a good thing to get in shape before the treatment, do the Kegel exercises and enjoy the physical parts of a marriage as it may be affected for a period. You have plenty of time to decide so get educated and read the other guys stories here and read the stickies at the top. Good luck",

      "Content": "Hello Jlynn, The others have basically covered everything, just adding some reflections. Your husbands data are very similar to mine (and many others) I had G3+4 and PSA around 6. My tumour was bigger though. I did surgery in january. I went for surgery for two reasons, you get a very final analysis of the tumor and the cancer is out of you. I was very concerned about the side-effects, primarily incontinence, but that has worked out well, after roughly 5 weeks it was ok. As Shu says the plumbing is different and it will never be as before but my wife told me \"You are as continent as any woman who have had babies\" ED is an issue but still to early to judge. The majority in this forum have chosen surgery but I believe that is more due to gut feeling \"get it out of me!\" than radiation being less effective. Most guys here who chose radiation are very happy. The odds of success are as I understand it basically the same. Whatever you decide it is a good thing to get in shape before the treatment, do the Kegel exercises and enjoy the physical parts of a marriage as it may be affected for a period. You have plenty of time to decide so get educated and read the other guys stories here and read the stickies at the top. Good luck",

      "Content": "Hi Rebern, Your Uro has a point. fPSA is a second indicator of cancer. I am really sorry to say this. My Uro (in Sweden) has a limit which says that fPSA<20% indicates cancer and if you have fPSA lower than this a biopsy is recommended. PSA can fluctuate and biking may affect it, but combined with a low fPSA I would recommend you to take the biopsy and get the issue either off your agenda or on and if so to start planning your treatment options. I am sure others here will also give more advice. I did my surgery in January and I am back on the bike now. It feels good. Good Luck",

The last time which was the 12 month we also agreed that I will not see my surgeon for every coming PSA but have a phone follow-up with a junior doctor. I am fine with this as long as the PSA is undetectable. It seems like a 6 month interval is commonly recommended after 12 months. I don´t think you need to take it monthly. Good Luck",

      "Content": "Hello Dan, Yeah it´s a real party this game. But you should give the incontinence some more time and do the Kegel exercises, they work. On ED I would also give it more time. I am now 9 months away from surgery and it works with Viagra now but not as before...Still improving though. Constipation is also a real party, I had it and to be frank the sixth day I was ready to cry. Not joking. But you will get better, believe me. And your PSA is really good. If the ED gets too frustrating try Muse or the trimix injections, they work. Remember that even though there are guys who don´t leak at all and have erections like stallions immediately after surgery most guys don´t, but time heals and it gets better. Don´t give up and Good Luck",

I am now 9 months away from surgery and it works with Viagra now but not as before...Still improving though. Constipation is also a real party, I had it and to be frank the sixth day I was ready to cry. Not joking. But you will get better, believe me. And your PSA is really good. If the ED gets too frustrating try Muse or the trimix injections, they work. Remember that even though there are guys who don´t leak at all and have erections like stallions immediately after surgery most guys don´t, but time heals and it gets better.

I have never heard of anybody having issues after a biopsy (I may be wrong here) but I have heard several having issues with prostate cancer. You may have it or not, but a biopsy is the only way of knowing. It is your call but even if your urologist may be rude, the fact is that a biopsy may be needed. Good luck",

As you know I have been eating Cialis for about as long as you and as I understand it there are a spectrum of side-effects however all quite uncommon and not so severe. So you should be fine now that you have attention on the issues. I get dissy almost every morning for about ten minutes, normally while leaving for work. I am quite convinced that this is due to Cialis also, but my blood-pressure is fine so I just live with it. On ED however Cialis seems to be a small help for me...",

      "Content": "Hello all, from a nervous Swede.. I am rather new to this and would highly appreciate some advice. I had a high PSA/low free PSA quota identified by coincidence as a test done prior to a hip-replacement I needed. A kidney value was high and so a PSA was taken, later the kidney value was back to normal but PSA not. I had a biopsy taken on oct. 31 and had the results a couple of weeks later. 10 shots were taken, Gl 3+3 in 6 and Gl 3+4 in 2 of them. Urologist (who is very experienced) said that this is curable with both surgery as well as radiotherapy but, with the rather extensive tumour, if he were to operate he cannot guarantee that nerve-sparing will be possible. He will though give it a try. I have after this spoken to another experienced urologist as well as an oncologist and they say basically the same thing, it is curable. I decided on surgery, since I have already one hip replaced radiation is doable however Proton beam cannot be done if you have a steel hip.... I picked surgery basically with the reason that I will get a definitive answer on how bad it is. I do not like the fact that I have cancer pretty much in all of the gland so I want it out. But of course I am concerned on ED with few or no nerves spared. Today i received my date for surgery which will be jan 7th. Any comments or advice is highly appreciated",

      "Content": "Hello all, from a nervous Swede.. I am rather new to this and would highly appreciate some advice. I had a high PSA/low free PSA quota identified by coincidence as a test done prior to a hip-replacement I needed. A kidney value was high and so a PSA was taken, later the kidney value was back to normal but PSA not. I had a biopsy taken on oct. 31 and had the results a couple of weeks later. 10 shots were taken, Gl 3+3 in 6 and Gl 3+4 in 2 of them. Urologist (who is very experienced) said that this is curable with both surgery as well as radiotherapy but, with the rather extensive tumour, if he were to operate he cannot guarantee that nerve-sparing will be possible. He will though give it a try. I have after this spoken to another experienced urologist as well as an oncologist and they say basically the same thing, it is curable. I decided on surgery, since I have already one hip replaced radiation is doable however Proton beam cannot be done if you have a steel hip.... I picked surgery basically with the reason that I will get a definitive answer on how bad it is. I do not like the fact that I have cancer pretty much in all of the gland so I want it out. But of course I am concerned on ED with few or no nerves spared. Today i received my date for surgery which will be jan 7th. Any comments or advice is highly appreciated",

His dr told him that surgery would most likely cause the cancer to become super aggressive and did not recommend it....Hello Sawdustmaker, I had a similar diagnosis as you have and went for surgery. I would recommend to bring someone with you to the visit to the surgeon, even if you seems to be really well prepared it is a stressful meeting and hit is easy to forget to ask the questions you planned and even harder to remember the answers....",
