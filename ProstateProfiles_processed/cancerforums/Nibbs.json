      "Content": "Hi, My Dad was diagnosed with prostate cancer several years ago. At the time his PSA was 22 I think, maybe 20.... He had radiation treatment along with hormone shots. He was in remission and his PSA dropped to literally 0. After that there was a very slow rise, but doctors said it was normal. At his last appointment (3 months ago) it was 4. His doctor said that for his age (hes in his 60s) that was still normal but they would keep an eye on it. His last PSA test was this week and in the last 3 months it has risen to 90. I'm so scared the cancer is back. Obviously all the tests are being scheduled. Bone scan, CT scan, biopsy. They have started him on pills (hormone maybe?) and he will be getting the hormone shot this week. Is there anything more to do? I'm scared. I want it to be an infection....is there a high chance of that at all? Any stories here about PSA rising after treatment and such?",

      "Content": "Thank you for all the replies. It really means so much to me. Unfortunately I don't know his Gleason score....he has never talked about that so I feel he possibly doesn't know either. I'm planning to ask about it in the next few days, just to see if he knows. He did have a second PSA test done right away to double check the results were accurate since the jump was so big. He currently sees a urologist...I looked up the doctor and he seems to deal with prostate cancer quite a bit. I have met him and he seemed really knowledgeable and on top of things, however, after researching lately I feel more tests should have been done when the PSA started to rise at all. The reason he got another PSA test 3 months later was due to the original rise...but just the fact that it had risen to 4 already from 0 seems to me like it should have been immediately looked into. My dad has a friend who is a doctor (and is his GP) and told me how the doctors weren't worried, etc. I also went to 2 different doctor appointments with him (3 months ago) and they reassured us that it was only something to keep an eye on. I wish now I had done my own research. I find it so hard to deal with/think about that I have avoided it....and I really wish I hadn't. Using the PSA calculator I got a doubling time of .7 for him......I don't understand it very well though. I just want answers that can't be given yet I guess Still badly praying its an infection. It does seem to be a really rapid rise....I don't know. If cancer comes back and spreads, could it rise that fast? I guess it could also be a combination of cancer again and an infection or something else.",
