This can be a little tough, though, if it means you need to quit your job, lose your insurance, have no income as a result. It may just be possible to factor them in a least a little bit. I would imagine a lot of companies can grant you leave of some sort..you may not even need much more off than vacation time. But, if, for example, like me , you are a self employed farmer, you really can't just drop everything. Well, you can , but you essentially give up everything you live for so you can live some kind of life. Healthy, maybe,unhappy, most likely. So maybe you can get away with doing something more compatible with your life...not lifestyle..life that is effective. Think about it.",
