    "Content": "My dad was given a high PCA score at age 77, but am taking him to another Dr., as he gave us a 4 digit score. He's a remarkably inattentive MD The new Dr. can ask for clarification My dad does not know yet what he wants to do. He learned only today of the high PCA score. I think we need to learn more from published experiments, now found online. Thanks for this fine forum.",
