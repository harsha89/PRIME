Chuck is always a wealth of knowledge himself and wonderful person for support as well as others in this forum. My husband was just diagnosed at age 52. Gleason score 8. we did go to MD Anderson for his second opinion as well as treatment. We are still waiting on the second opoinon of his pathology slides from the biopsy. kInd of scary the waiting. waiting. waiting waiting... Oh I got side tracked! I meant to say up there before I got mind side tracked. ha ha That you are your own best health advocate and ESPECIALLY for those that you care about. Research about this till you think you cant anymore! Get the book they are talking about. Then be prepared to be strong and a wonderful support system for your father.",

      "Content": "Hi all! new to posting but have been lurking for some weeks! My husband was just diagnosed with prostate cancer. The details are below. Sorry TRIED to make this short! What I would LOVE is for some advice, help and whatever else you guys might think we should know from our \"brief\" medical history and the biopsy results below. He is 52 years old. Father died of colon/prostate cancer. PSA was at a 8 in August 2014 when we were referred to the urologist. PSA in January 2015 up to 12.6 per Urologist bloodwork. A Biopsy was ordered and completed. Results below. Also what we were told on Friday by the urologist is he has prostate cancer, 7 out of the 12 samples from the biopsy are positive with a Gleason score of 6, 7 and 8. I thought there was only one score but I am still learning.... Urologist told us to immediately have the prostate removed by the old fashioned surgery, cutting way which is what he does. He did not recommend the robotic way but if we decided on that he would refer us to one of his colleagues. As you can imagine we were in total shock from the results. I was not and still really am not educated on prostate cancer BUT I am a firm believer in being MY OWN HEALTH ADVOCATE and learning as much as I can. That is why I am on this board. This board is so welcoming and there is a WEALTH of knowledge. With all of that said I just need advice. The next step ordered by the urologist is bone and cat scan to be done in which we are waiting on the ok from the insurance company. The urologist said if we had not heard anything by Tuesday morning to call back and stay on this. But I do that anyway!!! Also we were thinking about getting a second opinion. We live in Houston, TX and MD Anderson is downtown plus several other locations. I did the online schedule thing and will call them on Monday. MY husband is on board with the md Anderson second opinion but I think he wants to do which ever comes first> the surgery or apt with md Anderson> if that makes sense. And we are full aware of the results from removing the prostate. My husband doesn't care about anything other than trying to get the cancer out. We have a 5 year old daughter! Hopefully I have included everything. any words of wisdom in what his diagnosis looks like or words of wisdom would be greatly appreciated.

We live in Houston, TX and MD Anderson is downtown plus several other locations. I did the online schedule thing and will call them on Monday. MY husband is on board with the md Anderson second opinion but I think he wants to do which ever comes first> the surgery or apt with md Anderson> if that makes sense. And we are full aware of the results from removing the prostate. My husband doesn't care about anything other than trying to get the cancer out. We have a 5 year old daughter! Hopefully I have included everything. any words of wisdom in what his diagnosis looks like or words of wisdom would be greatly appreciated. BIOPSY RESULTS A) Prostate biopsy designated left base: - Adenocarcinoma (Gleason combined score 4 + 3 = 7; 6mm; focal perineural invasion identified B) Prostate biopsy designated left base lateral: - Adenocarcinoma (Gleason combined score 4 + 3 = 7; 10mm; NO focal perineural invasion identified C) Prostate biopsy designated left mid: - Adenocarcinoma (Gleason combined score 4 + 3 = 7; 5mm; focal perineural invasion identified D) Prostate biopsy designated left mid lateral: - Adenocarcinoma (Gleason combined score 4 + 4 = 8; 10mm; NO focal perineural invasion identified E) Prostate biopsy designated left apex: - Adenocarcinoma (Gleason combined score 4 + 4 = 8; 2mm; NO focal perineural invasion identified F) Prostate biopsy designated left apex lateral: - Adenocarcinoma (Gleason combined score 4 + 3 = 7; 4mm; NO focal perineural invasion identified G) Prostate biopsy designated right base: - prostate tissue, no neoplasm identified.

      "Content": "So yesterday my husband had his first visit at MD Anderson. It was a rather pleasant visit for the situation at hand. We are moving forward with the schedule of robotic surgery prostate removal for April 1st. Which is our wedding anniversary BUT if they get the damn cancer that will be a great gift. Since the cancer is so aggressive of course he is having a MRI done to see if it has spread. The dr had a sense of humor and said not to worry for instance if its in the bladder he can make us a new one with intestines. ha ha So MRI on the 27th, surgery on the 1st then wait 8 weeks for total results. He said we have to wait 8 weeks for results for the body to heal. Then we go back and see if more treatment is necessary...hormone treatment, radiation I will say that the dr said its curable if the cancer has been caught but I have to tell you this damn waiting is HORRIBLE. Again thank you everyone for the advice, thoughts and support!",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by HighlanderCFH The 2013 does show that he was pretty close to normal, so it should still be valuable. As for going to Anderson, I agree with your thinking. I also was diagnosed by a uro in my local area. Actually he is a great uro/surgeon. But I still felt more confident going to a major medical center. In my case, it was Mayo Clinic. And, while I still have some guilty feelings at not sticking with the doctor who originally diagnosed me, I could not be happier with the decision to go to a huge medical clinic. You are doing the right thing, especially since you may not know a lot about the local doctor. But you DO know that MD Anderson is a top notch facility for medical care, including for prostate cancer. Your decision could not have been a better one. Good luck, Chuck THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU and did I say THANK YOU ha ha",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by ASAdvocate Certainly you need to choose an intervention, and doing it soonest is the best course. But, if you have an opportunity for another opinion within a few weeks, and you feel that you want it, then I would suggest that you do it. Acting promptly is required, acting immediately (like this week)...probably not. I agree. We under NO circumstances want to delay the treatment of this HOWEVER we were already waiting on the approval of the bone scan from the insurance company. Because of this it made the decision easier to go to MD Anderson. We finally got the call today of the bone scan approval after we had already made the apt with MD Anderson.
