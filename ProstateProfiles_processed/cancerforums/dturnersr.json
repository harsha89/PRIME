Don't panic you have a very curable case from what I see. My suggestion is surgery as it provided the greatest number of options. Having been just diagnosed and had surgery days ago- I wouldn't do it any other way. The biggest factor to consider is the surgeon and facility. You are on the right path.",

I've been trying to get up to speed on all this reading your posts. I am also try to be positive about extending my life even if it looks like loosing that pesky prostate gland. From what I know now it looks like my choice is the robotic Divinci. I just got the phone call Thursday and my sit down with the urologist I have now is on 12/5. So, in the mean time I'm trying to get an appointment with Dr. Pattaras from Emory. Does anyone have any experience with him. The doctor I am seeing now is from Rome, Dr. Gilbert I don't even know if he does the Di Vinnci as of yet. I can't help right now much as I am just thrown into this, but I will do anything I can to help anyone of you guys. As I am a disabled veteran I thought I was through health challenges but looks like it continues. However, I am up to the next chapter and many more. Thanks for your support and this forum. David",
