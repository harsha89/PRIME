    "Content": "As per wise advice of Dr. Part Walsh, prostate cancer surgery is extremely complicated and it behooves candidates of this surgery to look for the most experienced who have done three or four hundred of this surgeries before, do about 60 per year, and follow up on their patients to continuously improve their craft. Does anyone know which Dictors and hospitals meet this criteria in Southern California? How much will such surgery cost out of pocket ? I appreciate any insight on this.",
