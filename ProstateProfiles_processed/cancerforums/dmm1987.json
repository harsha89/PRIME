      "Content": "Thank you for the reply. I apologize for leaving out information. He is 60 years old and doesnt have any heart issues. I'd say he is just an average 60 year old overall health wise. You mentioned the doctor has no true way of knowing if its out of the prostate but the focus should be on if surgery is the best option. How do we determine if its the best if there is no way of knowing whether it is still localized to just the prostate? My father has been on hormone therapy for about 1 year and his PSA is now a 0. I think at one point he mentioned his PSA was an 8 when he started the hormone therapy. The doctor doing the surgery also advised my father to do radiation after he has healed from surgery because of the aggressiveness. Thank you for all of your information, I cant begin to express how much the time you took to give me your response really means. It really is helping with my overall stress level. I will be in contact with my father to talk about his biopsy samples because that I am not sure about. Thank you for your help so much.",

Without giving you a long, uninteresting story, one of the (if not the biggest one) reasons he is doing the hormone therapy is because when he was diagnosed last September, nobody outside of him knew and he was not going to do anything about it because he is uninsured and was quoted a price of 100,000 dollars by a doctor for the surgery (we think its because the doctor thought he was insured.) My brother found out about his cancer a couple months ago and has been going to the doctors appointments with my dad and they have since dropped the price considerably and my dad is open to surgery now. He was doing hormone therapy because he was thinking this was the end and he wasnt going to do surgery, basically it was a \"lets see how long I can last\" type of thing. So he has been doing the hormone shots and he has responded to them. So to answer your question, yes he was diagnosed 1 year ago. I believe his doctor is assuming that the cancer has affected the seminal vesicles but unless I misunderstood that was not something that could be determined until they did the surgery and if needed those could be removed if needed. He just had a hormone shot about a month ago and I believe has about 5 months until his next one, but unless something changes we are going to schedule his surgery very soon.",
