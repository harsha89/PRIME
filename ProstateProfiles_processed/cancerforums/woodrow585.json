      "Content": "This is my first time on the site and I didn't really know where else to go. One of my best friends told me like a week ago that her dad was diagnosed with prostate cancer. Yesterday she told me that it has spread to his bones and it only took one year, which I guess is rare because it usually takes 5 years for that to happen. She is a doctor by the way. I would give the world for her and I am a very empathetic person so this has hit me also. I have begun to research things about it and seeing how she is a doctor she uses a lot of words I don't know what they are. I am trying to learn more about it so I can continue to be there for her without her having to explain everything to me. I know that the cancer has metastisized and he hasopted to take the drugs and not do the castration. I really just need to get educated and learn what's the best way to be there for my friend. I know this will be one of the worst things she will ever have to go through and neither one of us really believe in god so I want to be there for her. What are some of the treatments and what will the meds do to him? How do I respond when she talks to me about her dad not being there anymore? what are some nice things I can do? I know I will still invite her to things and treat her like my friend but there is no ignoring what's going on. What are some do's and don't's? Any help that anyone can give me would be great and I appreciate it. Adam",
