      "Content": "I have been getting PSA tests for the last 10 years. Base line seems to be around 3.8 to 4. Free PSA was tested last fall for the first time. I am 65 years old with no direct family history (only a first cousin). Last year I went on Flomax and urine flow improved somewhat. Urine flow is still not what I would like and I recently doubled the flomax with some improvement. Last fall PSA was 4.2 and I decided to retest this spring. PSA was 5.5 and free PSA was 17%. Went on antibiotics for two weeks and retested PSA 4 weeks later. PSA was 5.2 with free PSA at 18%. DRE have always been normal but prostate was always judged somewhat large. Met with nurse practitioner with urologists office and she said if I were her relative she would advise a biopsy. I tend to be proactive as to my health and I decided to follow her advice. Had the biopsy last week and prostate was measured at 80 cm.(?) with no abnormalities noted. I get the results back tomorrow. I have been on a week long research campaign and found this web site. I would not be a good candidate for watchful waiting as I am not a patient person. Trying to anticipate all questions I should be prepared to ask tomorrow knowing that until the results come back I am likely overweighting the cancer risk but I think that is normal. I did find a useful prostate cancer evaluation calculator on the University of Texas site. My % numbers are 73% no cancer, 19% non aggressive and 8% aggressive. https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=...93756505,d.b2w Regards and I am glad I found this forum, Steve",
