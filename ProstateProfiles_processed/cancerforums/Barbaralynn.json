    "Content": "Hello Everyone, My husband has been dealing with high PSA levels for the past ten years. He has had several biopsies with the first one showing pre-cancer. His last biopsy was a saturation biopsy with 24 spots tested, all clear. That was about five years ago. He was told to continue PSA's every six months. His most recent PSA was 8.2 with a jump of 3 points since the last PSA. The doctor recommended a Multiparametric MRI which is being done next week. Here is where I need some help. We are fairly new in the Philadelphia area and need some recommendations for hospitals and doctors should the MRI show cancer. I don't care for the doctor we are currently with.",
