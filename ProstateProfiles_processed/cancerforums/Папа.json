      "Content": "Hellow, My dad, 77 year old, had his first ever PSA blood test in July. He is not in US or Canada and they do not do this test automatically and PSA testing is not offered to the patients. He had no symptoms, but my mom and I convinced him to do the testing. PSA was 85!!! he was referred o urologist who palpated about 1.5 inches tumor. Later gleason biopcy showed 4+4 score in 1 speciment out of 10. After my dad did every possible test: transrectal ultrasound, MRI, CT, PET/CT with choline, it turned out that the tumor they initially palpated was a benign cyst. He has cancer, but it is less then 1 cm capsulized in one lobe of prostate. No mets. Now, most probably, he is going to have da vinci. My concerns are: how comes that the \"fresh\" tumor has such a high Gleason and PSA? Also- is da Vinci right for him? Any additional testing we can do? Thank you everybody.",

      "Content": "Thank you all very much for your replies! I am not sure if the MRI was m3 or not. And yes, the cyst is growing directly in prostate. Just spoke to my family today: doctors think that he is a candidate for surgery. He is physically in good shape, walks a lot, swims, sometimes skips the elevator and walks up the 12th floor to the apartment. As for the health, apart from the cancer he has moments of the elevated blood pressure (up to 150-160) but it is well controlled with medication. What would be pre-op testing in US? He already did echo, ekg, venous Doppler, on some reason also gastroscopy. All is well. Anything else? What are the risks of da Vinci or robotic at his age? Sorry for naive questions, it is all new for my family. Ps: received his PSA score today-it is 14 now, down from 85. He had some medication injected about 4 weeks ago.",
