      "Content": "I was diagnosed with prostate cancer in Dec 2002 with psa @ 22 & gleason @6+7 . Treated with radioactive seeds and external beam radiation. All seemed well. 10/2011 had problems with vericose veins but found PSA over 1300. Prognosis 3 years. Bone scan showed widespread mestasis to bones.Began hormone therapy and moved to chemo shortly thereafter along with localized radiation to back and left hip. Chemo sucks. Began abriterone and prednisone therapy and PSA dropped to 3.1 but pain in back and left hip severe. Hydrocodone and morphine help but not wholly. Prognosis increased but no specific timeline. Cannot lift anything over 10 lbs. or pain increases. Periods of depression but family helps. Began palliative care . Still have good days but occasionally just can't seem to get out of bed . Is there anyone out ther with similar situation?",

      "Content": "The zitega (abriterone) along with the prednisone has done wonders for me. My psa which was 1300 22 months ago is down to 0.7 now. I haven't had any side effects from the zitega but the prednisone (a steroid) messes with me. Swollen feet and occasional feelings of tiredness are the worst. My pain is controlled with hydrocodone (vicodin) and morphine (both time release and immediate) Good luck with your therapy a nd remember everyone reacts differently to their drugs. Just don't overdo it when you feel good. T",
