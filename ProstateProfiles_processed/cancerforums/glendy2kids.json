      "Content": "Thank you so much for this forum! Been reading for a week or so since hubby got diagnosed. I'm the researcher in the family and learned much about my mother's metastatic breast cancer while I was her caregiver. It took her life 3 years ago. So...now on to taking care of the hubby. Started with routine physical and bloods tests showing a high PSA. It's wavered around 20. Took antibiotic to see if it was and infection- no change in PSA. Rectal exam not showing anything suspicious except for enlarged prostate. He is going to be 56 next week. He's healthy and on no meds. Had biopsy and came back as 3 out 14 cores cancerous. 2 are 3+3=6 (Right Apex, Left Lat Mid) but one is 3+4=7 (Left Mid). I actually drew up his prostate and placed the numbers in the diagram. He thought that was funny. I had to see it. Is going through with scans now. Had his ct of ab/pelvis/chest and will have his bone scan on Monday. Dr. is going to review results with us on Wed. I pray for no spread but still understand that he will be going through some sort of treatment. That's where I need all your wonderful advice/outlook. Left Lat Mid is 33%, Left Mid is 22% (the 3+4=7), and Right Apex is 8%. It seems not incredibly spread throughout but please let me know what you think treatment will be suggested. Since he's fairly young, I think I've understood that Active Surveillance isn't really an option and Watchful Waiting is for the elderly. (His dad who is 90 has been on WW for 17 years). I read somewhere that 30% of cases will progress within 5 years...so of course we'd like to nip this in the bud now and not later when it's worse. So, is DaVinci surgery the 1st and best option for him. Radiation is only done later, right, since you can't do it twice?? His outlook is great but he's never worried about anything. He hasn't researched much so I think he thinks he'll just be on Watchful Waiting like his dad. I thought that too, but not now. I just want a plan and he knows how I am and that I'll be his advocate. Thank you all! Any more info needed, let me know. Wendy",
