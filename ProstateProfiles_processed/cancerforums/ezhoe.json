      "Content": "Originally Posted by HighlanderCFH Hi ez, Welcome to the forum. We're very glad you found us, although it is also taboo to mention any other PC forums here. I'm wondering about your 2013 PSA of almost 14.0. That seems to be a pretty high PSA for just two 3+3 cores. How does this compare to your 2018 PSA? Glad to see you are doing your due diligence with the additional opinions. Will be hoping there are no additional -- potentially more aggressive -- tumors in there. Please let us know how those new opinions go. Chuck Thanks Got it on the rules, sorry. the PSA apparently, is high (over 21 for awhile) because the lesion is in the anterior TZ. I took Finasteride for a few months in 2015 and PSA dropped to 2.61. came back off the \"F\" and a few months later it was 15. now 17,Ed",

RO's I met with explained this would be a better choice for me as I have had BPH for several years with urinary problems. also the g4+3 tumor is in the Anterior Transition zone. they are saying Tomo is a gentler approach than say BBT or SBRT boost but just as effective. Did the simulation with tattoos 10/10/18. everything went smooth and crew seemed PRO.. Of all the RT's I researched, Tomotherapy was not on my \"Radar\". searching around the web I can see it,,but only a few west coast locations have it. anyone familiar or have had it done,, thoughts would be appreciated.

Welcome to the forum!!....I had pretty much the same treatment as you will have....I had the 6 month Lupron shot and then 45 fractions of the tomotherapy....9 weeks 5 days a week....81 Grys.....I was quite worried about the radiation because for years I had a weak stream...and I figured it would make it worse etc. ....but all in all, it went smoothly with really no problems....I tried to go in with a full bladder although my RO didn`t seem to care about that much ....the only thing that they harped on was STAYING STILL and not moving on the slab during the fractions....I had no fatigue....it was all pretty much a non event ....at the time I welcomed the 45 trips to town 15 miles away and when I got there I was in and out in usually 20 minutes ...I am so happy I chose Radiation therapy and the Tomotheray proceedure. coming up on 2 years now ....regained 80% sexual function and my testosterone bounced back after 6 months...my urine stream is about the same as pre treatment ....I take a flomax daily and do fine.... .so....I`m hoping you will have a similar experience as I had ....just so easy with no down time ....Good luck ....peace .....David Excellent results for you so far..

      "Content": "Originally Posted by HighlanderCFH Hi ez, Welcome to the forum. We're very glad you found us, although it is also taboo to mention any other PC forums here. I'm wondering about your 2013 PSA of almost 14.0. That seems to be a pretty high PSA for just two 3+3 cores. How does this compare to your 2018 PSA? Glad to see you are doing your due diligence with the additional opinions. Will be hoping there are no additional -- potentially more aggressive -- tumors in there. Please let us know how those new opinions go. Chuck Thanks Got it on the rules, sorry. the PSA apparently, is high (over 21 for awhile) because the lesion is in the anterior TZ. I took Finasteride for a few months in 2015 and PSA dropped to 2.61. came back off the \"F\" and a few months later it was 15. now 17,Ed",

I think it could be argued either way, it would have been better for the OCDX report to have come back as just FI. But the consideration is to get the best possible outcome and the short course of ADT is an option. Good luck to you and thanks for the info! Good point.. It will be a decision only you can make.. In my case it was a no brain-r.. too many risks to decline the ADT.. hoping for the best outcome for you. Ed",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by Jazzman Hello All, There is currently an ongoing trial on this which would be of great interest to me if there were any results yet, which unfortunately there aren't. My RO is saying there might be some benefit to me to do a 4 month course of ADT in conjunction with SBRT since my genomic score came back showing an unfavorable intermediate risk. He said it is my decision. I've read about all the bad side effects ADT causes, some pretty serious including possible liver problems. Of course, I don't even know if my insurance company would even pay for ADT given my biopsy results and of they did, if that would affect whether they would then approve SBRT. I was wondering of anybody with intermediate Ca had to make this choice and how they tolerated the ADT. Thanks First off I'm a total rookie on this, but if your stats are correct you are ..not. unfavorable intermediate risk.. the standard of care for UF risk includes at least short term ADT. if I plug in my stats to a risk program it shows 20% + chance of Lymph node and SV invasion, plus small chance of distant METS. so Adt would be strongly suggested. In your case you may not need ADT.. They are giving me Tomotherapy because of my history of BPH and several years of urinary issues. I got 6mo eligard shot 2 months ago and only 4 treatments of Tomo so far.. SE's are not horrible .. mostly night sweats good luck.. Ed",
