The nurse said the results were good, still expecting to be mailed. Now, my concern, I have severe pain in the Perineum (the area between the scrotum and the anus). The pain extends to my left leg and I feel pain when I get up and walk. The pain is somewhat tolerable but not totally gone with Percocet. No fever or high body temperature but still not comfortable with my situation. Any comments appreciated.",

      "Content": "After my prostatectomy I got severe Urinary Tract Infection (via the catheter I guess). I told the nurse I had severe pain (the doc was never accessible) and she said it is normal to have pain after the surgery up to 6 weeks so I suffered the pain until the follow-up. When I told my surgeon I still have severe pain and can't even walk normally he was surprised. They took a urine sample and the test results were ready the same day on line. My urine culture showed >100,000 CFU/mL Klebsiella pneumoniae. I got 14 pills of antibiotics (Ciprofloxacin) for one week only. I will have a new urine test one week after using all the pills to see if I will get rid of the infection. I must say the pain has reduced significantly during the week I was taking the pills but I was wondering if one week treatment is enough for such severe infection I had that totally slowed down my post surgery recovery. Has anyone had such an experience with urinary infection and what dose of antibiotics has resolved the condition?",

      "Content": "Yes, I do have access to other clinics and doctors. This is the Urology-Oncology clinic at the University Hospital where I had the surgery and I felt I was going to stick around for a while for all these follow-ups regarding the PSA and such but I see now that it is not in my best interest to keep going there. I was very satisfied with my urologist that performed the biopsy and discovered the PCa but he was doing only Cryotherapy of prostate and he referred me to the Oncology clinic's surgeon for the RP within the same hospital. Maybe I should return back to him, he was at least answering his messages online after all.",

I am really sorry to hear that your PSA number has elevated after the prostate surgery. The PSA findings in the blood may come from prostate tumors only. The abbreviation comes from Prostate Specific Antigen so your blood test results indicate that some leftovers from the originating tumor are still releasing such antigens in your blood. Only special tests like biopsy or imaging may detect now what exactly is going on in your body and to what extent your PCa has spread. The initial tests that detected the existing PCa that led to your prostatectomy were very important to tell the surgeon what had to be removed at the time of the surgery. My biopsy results were devastating, I had most aggressive malignant tumor in my prostate (Gleason score 4+5) which required immediate radical prostatectomy and everything around that might be affected with such an aggressive tumor. Besides the prostate and seminal vesicles, they had removed 22 lymph nodes. Everything removed was sent to detailed pathology examining in order to categorize the PCa stage and to anticipate the further healing process. You lack of more detailed tests, what was found and what was expected in future. I hope that after more tests are done you'll have more clear picture what options you have toward your healing. Right now without those test results it is difficult to say what are those options, even for more educated person as your doctor is.",

I am sorry you had your PSA level still high after your prostatectomy. I have my first post-op follow-up in a week when I will probably have the first PSA test after prostate removal. My path results were OK and confirmed the prior biopsy findings, Gleason Score 9 confined to the prostate with no malignancy found in any removed tissue. I am kind of anxious what the PSA would be. And yes, I am a Motorola guy, worked 15 years on cellular phones and currently on digital cable TV boxes. Motorola sold the cell phone busines to Google (Motorola Mobility) and then Google eventually sold it to Lenovo. The STB busines Motorola sold to Arris. I am wondering what has left from Motorola now, LOL.",

      "Content": "I found some more on this at the Department of Pathology, The Johns Hopkins Medical Institutions, Baltimore, Maryland, USA. \"Ductal adenocarcinoma of the prostate, previously referred to as endometrioid cancer, is typically diagnosed on transurethral resection. When treated by radical prostatectomy (RP), it pursues a more aggressive clinical course than usual acinar prostate cancer does. The significance of prostate cancer with ductal features found on needle biopsies from the peripheral zone is unknown. We reviewed 58 prostate needle biopsy cases with ductal adenocarcinoma for which we were able to obtain clinical information. Patients had a mean age of 69 years (range, 50-89 years) and had a wide range of levels of serum prostate-specific antigen (median, 7.9 ng/mL) and clinical stages. Six (10%) had metastases at the time of diagnosis. Cribriform or papillary structures or a mixture of the two patterns were seen in 86% of cases, whereas in the remaining cases, discrete glands composed of tall columnar cells were present. Stromal fibrosis accompanied the ductal carcinoma in 67% of the cases. A coexisting acinar carcinoma component was identified in 48% of the biopsy specimens. On biopsy, the ductal component composed a mean of 82% of the tumor. Of the 20 tumors treated by RP, 63% had extraprostatic spread of tumor and 20% had positive margins. Two (10%) cases showed seminal vesicle invasion, but none had lymph node metastases. The number of positive needle cores correlated with RP margin status (p<0.004) and with likelihood of clinical progression (p<0.02), but not with organ-confined status. Tumor volume calculated on the 11 extensively sampled RPs ranged from 0.15 cm3 to 20.3 mL (mean, 2.8 cm3). Two years after therapy, the actuarial risk of progression was between 34% (RP patients) and 42% (all patients). A shortened average time to progression was observed relative to a previous study group of men with acinar carcinoma. Serum prostate-specific antigen levels correlated with neither RP organ-confined status nor tumor volume. We conclude that prostatic ductal adenocarcinoma seen on needle biopsy implies more advanced cancer with a shortened time to progression.\"",

Stromal fibrosis accompanied the ductal carcinoma in 67% of the cases. A coexisting acinar carcinoma component was identified in 48% of the biopsy specimens. On biopsy, the ductal component composed a mean of 82% of the tumor. Of the 20 tumors treated by RP, 63% had extraprostatic spread of tumor and 20% had positive margins. Two (10%) cases showed seminal vesicle invasion, but none had lymph node metastases. The number of positive needle cores correlated with RP margin status (p<0.004) and with likelihood of clinical progression (p<0.02), but not with organ-confined status. Tumor volume calculated on the 11 extensively sampled RPs ranged from 0.15 cm3 to 20.3 mL (mean, 2.8 cm3). Two years after therapy, the actuarial risk of progression was between 34% (RP patients) and 42% (all patients). A shortened average time to progression was observed relative to a previous study group of men with acinar carcinoma. Serum prostate-specific antigen levels correlated with neither RP organ-confined status nor tumor volume. We conclude that prostatic ductal adenocarcinoma seen on needle biopsy implies more advanced cancer with a shortened time to progression.\"",

Whether to go for radical surgery or radiation therapy depends on several factors. - Hypertension and high cholesterol don't count if controlled (I do have both) - The age of the patient: the sixties are still acceptable for a surgery - The preliminary stage of PCa based on the Gleason score, body scans (main factor) It is normal to ask for a second opinion but after you have your father's CT and bone scans done. No doctor will perform a radical prostate surgery if the tumor has metastasized, hopefully your father's scans would come out negative. Also you father's Gleason score is something not to neglect, prostatectomy is usually recommended for such a score. I wish the best of luck to your dad!",

My path results were OK and confirmed the prior biopsy findings, Gleason Score 9 confined to the prostate with no malignancy found in any removed tissue. I am kind of anxious what the PSA would be. And yes, I am a Motorola guy, worked 15 years on cellular phones and currently on digital cable TV boxes. Motorola sold the cell phone busines to Google (Motorola Mobility) and then Google eventually sold it to Lenovo. The STB busines Motorola sold to Arris. I am wondering what has left from Motorola now, LOL.",

      "Content": "During my PSA monitoring period from 3.6 to 10.7 in the period of 5 years until I was diagnosed with PCa I was taking highly concentrated Saw Palmetto capsules of 1000 mg each. I don't know if that worsened (accelerated) my final Gleason Score to 9 or it helped keeping the tumor within the capsule successfully as it turned out after the prostatectomy but I know it shrunk the gland eventually and my symptoms were very mild. That gave me probably false sens of safety but who knows what exactly was the Saw Palmetto effect, positive or negative. I will never know. It is even more dificult to say what would be the effect of Saw Palmetto after a radical prostatectomy when PSA rises due to tumor spreading to other parts of the body.",

Hi and welcome to the forum, yet this is a place no one comes by choice. I had Saturation Transperineal Biopsy with totaling 52 samples out of which 7 came positive, some of them Gleason 7 and some of them Gleason 9. The surgeon wanted me to wait about 2 months before the surgery but he didn't say the reason was the biopsy. He wanted me to start a hormone therapy to shrink the tumor. It turned out he couldn't even notice prostate enlargement by performing a DRE. I told him I might not have health coverage after 2 months due to my company's work reduction in effect and I wanted to do the surgery ASAP. So it happened, I had Retropubic Radical Prostatectomy (classic open surgery) only one month after the Saturated Biopsy. It's been over 4 weeks now after the surgery and here is the outcome: -Final pathology results encouraging, no malignancy found in any tissue removed (except the prostate) -Urinary incontinence still present, dry in horizontal position though -ED still present, sometimes enlarged size but not enough for penetration -Pain in the perineum area where the biopsy was performed still present, extends to my left inner thigh, still must take pain killers, can't seat on the butt without a soft pillow I believe your case is not so urgent as mine was, so waiting 2 months before the surgery should not do any harm. My case was somehow extreme I think.",
