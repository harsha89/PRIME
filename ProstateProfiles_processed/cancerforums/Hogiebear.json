      "Content": "Hi Got the bad news Monday. I had a biopsy 3 years ago that was negative. My recent Biopsy was positive. My Urologist says I am a 6 on the Gleason scale. If the scan confirms that is hasn't spread beyond the prostate we will discuss treatment. He laid out a lot of options. I think he will recommend seed thing and radiation. 40 treatments for the full course. To say the least I am not feeling very encouraged. I'm 54 years old.",
