If the doctor (or nurse or lab tech) calls the patient, then he or she has a reasonable expectation that the person on the phone is actually the patient, and therefore is allowed to discuss test results. I know, it's crazy, but that's the world we live in now. The doc should have taken the time to explain this.",

      "Content": "The surgeon explained about the positive margin; he said that he has seen that type before and that it is rarely of any significance, but it is something to be aware of (he explained it in detail and even drew a sketch to make sure I understood). I did not see anywhere on the report a separate Gleason score for the positive margin, but I will double check. The surgeon said that I don't need to see him again unless I want to, that further follow-ups would be with my urologist... which is what the urologist had already told me. My next appointment with the uro is in 6 months, though I am welcome to come in any time if I feel the need. They did draw for a PSA yesterday, even though it's a bit early. They said that they would send me the results. He explained that if the PSA started creeping back up over time that I would probably want to do the radiation treatments. He was very thorough in making sure that I understood what that entailed and the reasoning behind it and how it works, though I already knew most of what he said from my earlier research. Replicant, I am not aware so far of any plans for a hyperspace bypass, but I have feelers out. If I hear anything I'll let you know. I seem to have misplaced my rabbit bones, but at least I know where my towel is.",

      "Content": "The surgeon explained about the positive margin; he said that he has seen that type before and that it is rarely of any significance, but it is something to be aware of (he explained it in detail and even drew a sketch to make sure I understood). I did not see anywhere on the report a separate Gleason score for the positive margin, but I will double check. The surgeon said that I don't need to see him again unless I want to, that further follow-ups would be with my urologist... which is what the urologist had already told me. My next appointment with the uro is in 6 months, though I am welcome to come in any time if I feel the need. They did draw for a PSA yesterday, even though it's a bit early. They said that they would send me the results. He explained that if the PSA started creeping back up over time that I would probably want to do the radiation treatments. He was very thorough in making sure that I understood what that entailed and the reasoning behind it and how it works, though I already knew most of what he said from my earlier research. Replicant, I am not aware so far of any plans for a hyperspace bypass, but I have feelers out. If I hear anything I'll let you know. I seem to have misplaced my rabbit bones, but at least I know where my towel is.",

      "Content": "Thanks guys! And... we were able to demonstrate last night that the Cialis seems to be working it's magic for me. It wasn't up to \"full power\" yet, but was sufficient to the task. Hopefully after a few days it will get even better. Doc said if that were to happen this soon it would be a very good sign, so of course I had to try it. Now I guess it's a waiting game to see if I develop intolerable side effects.",

      "Content": "Thanks Walnut. The back pain woke me up this morning as a nagging ache. As the day drug on it just got worse. I did some looking online and found several recommendations for Ibuprofen, so I gave that a shot. In about an hour and a half the pain was totally gone. I have seen mention on this forum and other places that for some guys the body adjusts and after a while the pain goes away on it's own. And sometimes not. I'm willing to give it a try for a few more days as long as the Ibuprofen does it's magic. I'll report back as appropriate.",

      "Content": "It is my understanding that the radiation treatments will cause most, if not all, of the prostate tissue to die eventually, over a period of 2 years or so. So at first I would think that fertility would not be greatly affected, but as more and more tissue dies off the prostate will function less and less, until eventually there will be no ejaculate and hence little to no sperm transport. Admittedly I am just guessing, hopefully someone who knows the facts will chime in.",

I did some looking online and found several recommendations for Ibuprofen, so I gave that a shot. In about an hour and a half the pain was totally gone. I have seen mention on this forum and other places that for some guys the body adjusts and after a while the pain goes away on it's own. And sometimes not. I'm willing to give it a try for a few more days as long as the Ibuprofen does it's magic. I'll report back as appropriate.",

      "Content": "A week ago last Friday night I suddenly experienced intense itching of the scrotum. Eventually I had to scratch it though I was careful. I had eaten my lunch in the park that day and figured I had probably sat in some chiggers (mites) or something. Soon after, it started swelling and eventually swelled up pretty big. I figured it was a reaction to the scratching and over the next couple days it returned to normal. Then later in the week I got an intense itch on the bottom of my right foot... followed by swelling. Over a couple of days it returned to normal. Then I realized that the week previously the same thing happened with my left foot. Today my right thumb started itching intensely followed by... yep, swelling. Now I can be pretty thick headed sometimes, but I'm starting to see a trend here. Does this sound familiar to anyone? Could this be related to my surgery? Wife thinks maybe it's something to do with my lymph system trying to find a new balance or something. If it happens again I'm going to call the doc, but I thought I would check with you folks to see if anyone else has experienced this. Maybe it's something totally unrelated. Thoughts?",

      "Content": "Hi all. I am almost 5 months post op now and doing fine, still in the zero club so far. I got very lucky with contenance, didn't have much trouble with that at all. I still usually use a thin light pad just in case for those little \"oops\" moments when I sneeze or something, but these days that rarely happens anymore. ED is still an issue, but recently I have had a few \"stirrings\" that are encouraging. My surgeon said that he was confidant that I would regain most of that function in time. My main question is about blood donation. I used to donate regularly, and I miss it. I have read in different places that the Red Cross will accept blood donations from us who have had the prostatectomy, provided the PSA remains undetectable for 12 months post op, though I haven't found anything about it on their site. Has anyone here confirmed or disproved this?",

      "Content": "Hello everyone. I had the DaVinci surgery 4 weeks ago today. Overall I think I am doing well. I have what are probably the normal aches, pains and twinges, and leak only a little every now and then. I wear a pad a day and a Depends overnight. Sometimes I think I am leaking more than I really am because the pad and briefs are so hot they make me sweat a lot. My urologist is satisfied with my progress so far, and I see my surgeon this Wednesday for his follow-up. Something that bothers me a good bit is urgency. I can urinate fine, and feel like I have emptied my bladder, but just a few minutes later feel like I need to go again. I can hold it ok, but sooner or later I have to run to the loo again. Sometimes I end up going 3 or 4 times an hour. This is very annoying, as it interrupts my work day. I find that it doesn't bother me so much if I stand up and walk around, but I have a desk job. I have one of those special cushions with the cut-out in front, and that helps some but not enough. I was wondering if this is pretty common or not. The worst thing about my surgery so far is that I had one heck of an allergic reaction to whatever scrub they used to clean the incision sites, as well as the adhesives on the tapes they used on me. It took a few days to develop, but once it got started it was like super-charged poison ivy. I have never had a rash like that before, and hope I never do again. It is only just now fading. You can bet I'll be asking the surgeon what chemicals they scrubbed me down with so I can put them on my allergies list. Did anyone else have that happen? I'll try to fill out my profile and signature as time allows. Thanks for the great forum. Art",

      "Content": "Thanks for the ideas fellows. Today I spent most of the morning kneeling in front of my desk on some makeshift knee pads, and that helped a lot. I was able to keep my loo trips down to once an hour or so. Then this afternoon I was dealing with an inspector and though I had to sit in an office chair I was so busy that I didn't notice \"the urge\" for the biggest part of the afternoon. This actually lasted until supper time when I got a little pepper up my nose and sneezed a few times. That blew my control, so to speak. Oh well. I see my surgeon tomorrow for his followup and discussion of my biopsy report. Wish me luck.",
