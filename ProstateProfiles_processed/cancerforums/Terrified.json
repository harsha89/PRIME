      "Content": "Hello everyone. I just had a quick question regarding platelet counts during radiation treatment for prostate cancer. Is this something that normally happens during radiation? I was trying to look for a thread that discussed this, but could not find one. My Dad is going through radiation treatment, to eliminate the 'small remaining cancer' that's on his seminal vesicle. A total of 37 sessions, we are currently on session 13. Everything on the blood test was good, the hemoglobin, and other things they tested. The only thing that raised some red flags was the platelet count, its at 118, down from 150. Is this something completely normal? Others have experienced? Note to Mod: If there's a thread speaking about this, can you kindly please move, so i don't clog the main forum window). Thank you!",

      "Content": "Hello everyone! I am headed back home and just wanted to say thank you to each and everyone of you in this forum. I found so much pertinent information from you guys that I should probably change my username. It\u0092s hard to mention each and everyone of you, but you know who you are. Three weeks ago, my head was spinning and didn\u0092t really have a solid idea of what PC is all about and how it\u0092s attacked. I know the saying of, ;if you were get one type of cancer, PC is definitely the one you can get and survive.; Other than that, I knew nothing about it except that it took my Grandfather back in 1996. Through extensive research and of course hearing your own experiences, I now believe and know that my Dad will be alright and will get so see his grandkids. Heck, now the pressure is on from my side to procreate. LOL. My Dad is now in his third week or radiation treatment. He is scheduled a total of 37 sessions and today will be his 16. As far as side effects, he hasn\u0092t really experienced any. Heck, his appetitive to eat has actually increased. Some say that it might come during the latter sessions, but we;ll be so close to the end, that we;re not worried about it. He did mention last week that he seemed like he might have had diarrhea but also mentioned maybe because it was the milk he drank. He is still exercising and playing 1- 1.5 hours of tennis. Heck, he even threw in an hour of bowling after his treatment on Thursday. So far so good and looking forward to putting this behind us and moving forward to the rest of our lives. Just as a recap: Dad was diagnoses with PC around December, after his doctor (who\u0092s a relative) noticed his PSA level was increasing, They decided to have the Davinci procedure and removed his prostate. They got all of the cancer removed with the exception of \u0091a little spread\u0092 on his seminal vesicle. Gleason score is 7 (3+4). He\u0092s had 3 PSA tests, the last one on April 11th (which is 2 months post-up) and is at 0.0. As mentioned, he is currently on session 16 of 37. For those that are debating whether to have radiation therapy immediately or wait, our doctors ideology is, \u0091why wait for something to happen when we can get rid of any remnants remaining, especially considering how healthy Dad is.\u0092 There have been some varying opinions on this. Some say to wait until the PSA goes up, some say, including (Sue), said if they could do it over again, going for radiation therapy is the way to go. Again, this is all going to be based on the patient and how aggressive you want to attack it. Its definitely hard to leave while he\u0092s going through this, but I think for the first time since diagnosed, he is really starting to get that he will be fine. As I said on my first post, I have NEVER ever seen my Dad so vulnerable until he heard that word, Stage III. But after explanation of what that means, and the \u0091good\u0092 Gleason score, he is starting to get it. Not as 'terrified' but still of course, concerned. So I\u0092ll stop blabbering. But THANK YOU to each and everyone of you that peruse, post, and hang out in this forum. You all have been more than kind and the information you provide for \u0091Terrified\u0092 sons like myself is invaluable. From the bottom of my heart, THANK YOU.",

      "Content": "Hello everyone, Thank you for taking the time to open this and read my forum post. It's funny, I found a couple of different sites that have forums, and it seems that this is the only thing that's putting my mind at ease, hearing of others experience. Safe to say, I am terrified, scared, depressed, sad, etc... I don't think there are enough words that I can explain how I am feeling. My Dad and I are super close, and seeing him battle this has been really sad. In December, my dad went in for a usual blood test. Since our family has a history of prostate cancer, he checked the box off to get his PSA test checked. The PSA test came back around 3-4, if I recall correctly. Not long after that, his primary doctor and surgeon (who happens to also be a relative said we need to attack this immediately). My Pops decided, along with the doctors to have the Davinci procedure (Robotics). This was performed towards middle of January. After the surgery, and a month after, he was still suffering from a little incontince (sp?). But as time went, his getting much better control of his bladder. The second PSA test came in at 0.3, which was a month after the surgery. This Wednesday, we went in to get the PSA level checked again and his results were 0.0. However, even though we are receiving great PSA scores, the doctor had informed us that some of the cancer (a very small amount) has spread to his seminal vesicle. The doctors are recommending that we attack this head on and have radiation and possible hormonal therapy. My Dad is 62 years old, great shape, plays tennis 4x time a week for about 1.5 - 2hours a day. Eats healthy, does not smoke, does not drink. The only thing that has ever sidelined him has been gout (high uric acid). Gout runs in the family as well because of our rich diet. Heck, yesterday, he played 2 hours of tennis at a tournament, still wearing his diapers and beat a 35 year old. We go back to the hospital on Tuesday to start what I believe is called a scan before scheduling his radiation. Also, forgot to mention, the radiologist and oncologist said we had a Gleason score of 7. Im not sure of the combination, as Ive seen some people put. And furthermore, which freaked me the hell out, along with my dad, the dreaded statement of, we were at or at Stage III. Some people mention, I really shouldn't be scare of the Stage, etc.. But as a concerned and freaked out son, how can one not? Oh I also forgot to add, that his MRI, body scans were all negative. This has been tough, really tough.... does anyone have similar experiences to this, and or our numbers?",

I believe this is a scan prior to starting / scheduling radiation treatment. Ugh, my stomach is in knots. So I have been telling my Pops some of your guys opinions regarding the aggressiveness of our actions. I gave him an analogy of 'we're trying to do a super reverse windmill slam dunk when all we need is a lay up.\" My question to you is this. Since the PSA is coming at 0.0, and with the seminal vesicle being effected, do we focus more on the PSA reading vs. the seminal vesicle? Im so confused. I believe the radiation is to attack the seminal vesicle spread? Can someone please enlighten me on this.... Again, in knots and so nervous about this scan.",

      "Content": "Hello everyone, Thank you for taking the time to open this and read my forum post. It's funny, I found a couple of different sites that have forums, and it seems that this is the only thing that's putting my mind at ease, hearing of others experience. Safe to say, I am terrified, scared, depressed, sad, etc... I don't think there are enough words that I can explain how I am feeling. My Dad and I are super close, and seeing him battle this has been really sad. In December, my dad went in for a usual blood test. Since our family has a history of prostate cancer, he checked the box off to get his PSA test checked. The PSA test came back around 3-4, if I recall correctly. Not long after that, his primary doctor and surgeon (who happens to also be a relative said we need to attack this immediately). My Pops decided, along with the doctors to have the Davinci procedure (Robotics). This was performed towards middle of January. After the surgery, and a month after, he was still suffering from a little incontince (sp?). But as time went, his getting much better control of his bladder. The second PSA test came in at 0.3, which was a month after the surgery. This Wednesday, we went in to get the PSA level checked again and his results were 0.0. However, even though we are receiving great PSA scores, the doctor had informed us that some of the cancer (a very small amount) has spread to his seminal vesicle. The doctors are recommending that we attack this head on and have radiation and possible hormonal therapy. My Dad is 62 years old, great shape, plays tennis 4x time a week for about 1.5 - 2hours a day. Eats healthy, does not smoke, does not drink. The only thing that has ever sidelined him has been gout (high uric acid). Gout runs in the family as well because of our rich diet. Heck, yesterday, he played 2 hours of tennis at a tournament, still wearing his diapers and beat a 35 year old. We go back to the hospital on Tuesday to start what I believe is called a scan before scheduling his radiation. Also, forgot to mention, the radiologist and oncologist said we had a Gleason score of 7. Im not sure of the combination, as Ive seen some people put. And furthermore, which freaked me the hell out, along with my dad, the dreaded statement of, we were at or at Stage III. Some people mention, I really shouldn't be scare of the Stage, etc.. But as a concerned and freaked out son, how can one not? Oh I also forgot to add, that his MRI, body scans were all negative. This has been tough, really tough.... does anyone have similar experiences to this, and or our numbers?",

      "Content": "Thank you for all the replies. We are going back to the hospital tomorrow for the 'prep' before scheduling the radiation. I forget what it was called, a scan? There will be a total of 33 days of radiation, at 15 minute intervals. I too am starting to get concerned about the possibility of maybe going a little too aggressive? Is there such a thing? I dont know but I did speak with my Dad and mentioned that we'll bring it up tomorrow re: we might be doing something thats not needed at this point. As mentioned in the previous posts, we are at 0.0 on the PSA but with some spread only to the seminal vesicle. All MRI, scans, were negative, Gleason 7 (I'll ask which combination it is). If I may ask, can someone explain why the 3+4 is better than the 4+3, or any other variations of a total of 7? Sincere thanks for all your time...",
