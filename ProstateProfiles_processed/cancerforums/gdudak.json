All previous HIFU threads have been locked so members can go back and read any of the posts, but will not be able to further comment there.

Furthermore, let it be clear that this is the ONLY thread for HIFU related discussion for now. Any new HIFU threads will either be moved to this one or will be deleted. All previous HIFU threads have been locked so members can go back and read any of the posts, but will not be able to further comment there. The other moderators/admins and I feel this is a necessary step to restore some peace and order in the Prostate Cancer Forum. I apologize for any inconvenience. Thank you for your understanding. MODERATOR'S NOTE: THESE COMMENTS ARE FROM 2009, BUT ARE STILL APPLICABLE TODAY, SO I COPIED THEM TO THIS NEW STICKY. WILL DO THE SAME WITH A FEW OTHER POSTS, FROM THE PAST, THAT MIGHT BE HELPFUL. ALSO UNDERSTAND THAT THERE WILL BE NO ARGUMENTS IN HERE. THE POSTS SHOULD ONLY REFLECT VALID INFORMATION, PRO OR CON, REGARDING HIFU, ALONG WITH PERSONAL EXPERIENCES. POSTS THAT FAIL TO DO ONE OF THOSE THINGS WILL BE DELETED. --CHUCK",
