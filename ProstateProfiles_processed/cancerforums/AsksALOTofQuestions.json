      "Content": "last night trolling the internet on prostate nodules, I came across one urologist who asserts that nodules present with infection, may go away as the infection is cleared up, and that the protocol is to wait to see if this happens, rather than jumping to a biopsy. http://www.wmfurology.com/pcaprost_nodule.htm This dials down my thinking from 100% rush to biopsy toward 95%...wondering if I should skip the private clinic urologist and wait for my end of August Urology appointment to see if my little friend is still there. The Canadian GP did say \"it is very small\". The big metric here is to avoid the risk of the cells migrating outside the walnut, right, and balance this risk against the risks of treatment? At what point, what are the thresholds or triggers... does one press the urgency button and rush into treatment? The psychological side is wanting to roll the dice asap and take the slightly favorable odds of reality ejecting me from this interesting club!",

      "Content": "Got my Free PSA ratio which was alarming.....10%. I think this tips me toward taking the private clinic appointment and getting the biopsy asap. My GP is in a \"don't worry be happy\" mode focusing on the 2.6 total PSA number, but I am concerned that my knowledge of the subject either now exceeds his and/or he has his foot on the brakes due to pressure on him from how the single payer system works in Ontario. The official lab report says that when total PSA is below 4 \"interpretive data is not available\" for the free PSA ratio, however I see research that suggests that free PSA is of particular significance when total is below 4, and the Sunnybrook online risk assessment is now giving me a risk of 63% for any kind of cancer and 40% chance of a Gleason greater than 7. Even if the nodule is from infection and could disappear, the risk assessment still has me with significant risk due to this free PSA 10% result, so the possibility of not getting a biopsy, even if the nodule shrinks, seems to be off the table. If I am doing a biopsy anyways, psychological management points me to reaching for the 37% chance that this is benign, sooner rather than later, in a couple of weeks rather than a couple of months.",

GP was doing PSAs but not DREs for annual physical. Any sort of palpable nodule irrespective of PSA, family history or Free PSA ratio, means I should biopsy asap, right? I need to know if there are cancer cells and what the Gleason Score is, right? I can't locate any protocol that calls for watchful waiting or patience when there is nodule. Otherwise no symptoms, UTI from new bike cleared up. The Ontario system generated a single payer (\"free\") first consult with a urologist end of August, but for $1000 I can get a consult and biopsy in Montreal in a few weeks. Is my impatience warranted?",

      "Content": "this is good feedback. I have to be careful to balance individual anecdote with playing the odds rationally. starting to feel like a poker game....is my little nodule friend holding aces or twos? I am being very aggressive with collecting no-risk information. PSAs out the ying yang, free PSA ratio, family history, palpations at the drop of a hat, but then trying to be slightly more cautious about biopsy, which does have slight infection and remote sepsis risk, both fixable, especially for a recent case of prostatitis, and then much much more skeptical regarding treatment. The Free PSA ratio result will dial up or dial down my attitude to this sooner or later biopsy question. Have you guys discussed the SunnyBrook risk assessment tool? http://sunnybrook.ca/content/?page=occ-prostatecalc My current focus is not so much about the risk of an aggressive cancer, it is more about the risk of delay if it is an aggressive cancer and what are the signposts for taking urgent action regarding metrics like nodule size, nodule velocity, PSA level and velocity etc. What are the signs of an imminent escape from the capsule?",

GP was doing PSAs but not DREs for annual physical. Any sort of palpable nodule irrespective of PSA, family history or Free PSA ratio, means I should biopsy asap, right? I need to know if there are cancer cells and what the Gleason Score is, right? I can't locate any protocol that calls for watchful waiting or patience when there is nodule. Otherwise no symptoms, UTI from new bike cleared up. The Ontario system generated a single payer (\"free\") first consult with a urologist end of August, but for $1000 I can get a consult and biopsy in Montreal in a few weeks. Is my impatience warranted?",

      "Content": "It just occurred to me that if there are a bunch of kooks out there massaging their prostates for entertainment, perhaps there would be a more practical application of this. I assume one would go reach under from the front, rather than around the side. I don't even have the courage to look at the youtubes. Another direction to go in would be to train the girlfriend/spouse to do it, again, following the model of female breast self examination. There are apparently medical things a guy can check for if doing the same for the gal, annally speaking here. Its like when my dental hygenist scans for cancer of the mouth when she is cleaning my teeth. Perhaps way too far in left field here...you could even ask one of the kinky prostate massage parlour people to let you know how your prostate feels, as a screen. Yes, sometimes I carry things too far ; - ) Approaches to problems are always evolving or going through paradigm shifts and change is always controversial, and often comes from unexpected directions. It also occured to me that with what is going on with robotics these days one could construct a mechanical device that would push small rods against the prostate wall from the colon, and very precisely measure the resistance, which would detect any abnormalities. Such a machine would take the same measurement over time and between different persons. A similar machine could be constructed to test for breast lumps. The device would overcome the human resistance to perform and have DREs performed on you, especially lets say in the case of Muslim men, and could be done as an inexpensive technician clinic test. As a general comment about the prostate scene, it strikes me that one should be very aggressive at collecting information through PSEs, DREs, Free Ratio, PCA3s, Biopsies (with closer attention to infection risk mitigation), with the intention of catching things very early, and then applying what science is telling us regarding diet and exercise during the watchful waiting period, with the hope of slowing or even reversing the disease and avoiding the side effects of medical treatment. Beyond this, every man and woman irregardless of detection of cancer or not, should consider themselves to be a pre-cancer patient and pay attention to what the science on diet and exercise is telling us about this disease. There appears to be three key risk areas. 1) A diet that is centered on artificial/processed foods, meat and animal products, which are micro-nutritionally non-dense and calorically dense (The China Study) 2) A diet that elevates and sustains the insulin response to nutritional sugars (glycemic wise), insulin being a growth stimulant for tumors and tumors being blood sugar feeders 3) A physical lifestyle that inhibits the natural healing movement of blood and lymph fluids as well as sleep pathology. Many studies appear to point to dramatic, non-subtle, outcome impacts of changes in the consumption of a single food, such as processed tomatoes by way of example. (for newbies, tomatoes appear to be the only food that is better for you cooked, with no loss of benefit if consuming canned or commercially processed). What if a person layered into their life all of the science-based diet and lifestyle changes indicated by research, well before they enter the prostate risk age window? Logic seems to suggest this, not only in respect of prostate cancer, but as well regarding all cancers and heart disease. I was a few years ago chatting with a very spry 90 year old in a shop on Sanibel, and I have acquired the habit of calibrating the intensity of my attention to the age of the person speaking, and this one fellow told me \"all of my friends who spend their retirement days on computers died young\".",

In the past, when I have had to deal with highly negative situations, I always had a lot of mental and cultural tools to turn to, based on this area of interest. Going through my prostate process here, it has been a good experiment at putting my toolset to work. My current area of reading is what could be called a Science-based \"faith\" that arises from a study of Quantum Physics, which opens our minds to the measurable strangeness of life, and this coupled with the very hard science related to NDEs, CIA remote viewing, lab measurement of ESP, that sort of thing, which ends up confirming, not negating, much of what religion has tried to communicate poetically. One way to introduce yourself to this way of thinking is by watching any youtube of Thomas Warren Campbell, NASA Physicist (retired).

Most people are settled in their ways and views, firmly athiest, religious/theist or spiritual, but there are usually a few in any crowd open to exploring new perspectives on things, or even desperately needing a new map for this human experience of living and inevitably dieing. The purpose of the post was to open a door for perhaps one person who might benefit psychologically from this unusual science-based alternative to the usual religious, new age, athiesm choice paradigm. Apart from being an excellent time killer, one of the areas of interest is the science behind the placebo effect and paying attention to that in healing. Another area to explore is the actual evidence for reincarnation and research that has been done under serious professional protocols, which can diminish our conviction that our existence ends at death, reducing fear. As with Pascal's Wager, even if this topic is absolute nonsense, which is a rational beginning presumption, the hypothesis is that it might help manage one's emotional relationship to the disease, which would be a huge benefit and provide a better mental environment for making rational decisions. PS: that's weird, I think Campbell actually lives in Huntsville, your town.",

      "Content": "I had very minimal blood in urine, ejaculate or stool, but I did find that sex in the first couple of weeks seemed to cause soreness the day after, in the prostate, similar to the soreness that I had the first day. My suggestion is that if you have soreness, pay attention to the possibility that it is correlated to sex the previous day. Maybe this was unique to me. Challenging movement with a fullish bladder putting pressure on the healing walls seems to be a no no. A couple days after the biospsy I bent over to frig with the mower, but my bladder was fullish and I was feeling some bladder urgency, and this seemed to trigger one of these soreness attacks for 24 hours. A couple of weeks after the biopsy, yesterday, feeling great, prostate soreness after sex gone, I did some vigorous digging in the garden with a spade. Maybe felt a bit of elevated bladder urgency and even some flow restriction that evening, but then woke up in the middle of the night with returned and elevated prostate soreness, but most alarmingly, nausea, severe weakness, and close to blacking out climbing the stairs to the washroom. No fever. Mild soreness and mild weakness when moving today. No fever. I wonder if with activity I am opening up the wounds between the urinary tract wall and the prostate and it is urine getting into prostate that is causing the soreness. Advil always seems to help. all comments or speculation welcome.",

      "Content": "I wonder if its like many things in life, where for many, the information will not be processed effectively and the reaction will be mostly emotional, or due to passivity the patient will defer to the doctor who is subject to their own prejudices and conflicts of interest, so at the mean, the cost benefit of testing is a wash, especially when looking backward in time. For the person who researches things to death, comes to forums like this, is very logical and mentally disciplined with making decisions and can control their emotions, will not defer to the authority of the white coats, ...having as much information as possible is beneficial, perhaps very beneficial. Looking forward rather than looking backwards, with newly emerging treatment and technology, I wonder if the cost benefit is dramatically shifting, especially with the latest technology in treatment to minimize side effects and invasiveness of treatment, even if that means a $25k expenditure. So what if the kids have a reduced inheritance or there is lien against the house at probate. That's what money is really for right...a rainy day!",

      "Content": "In addition to meds as directed by my docs, I keep some 100% Cranberry Juice (not the Cranberry Cocktail...not easy to find) and some Pomegranate Juice in the Fridge. I mix these two in a martini/wine glass, the sweetness of the Pomegranate cuts the bitterness of the Cranberry. The cranberry has long been established to suppress UTI infection and the Pomegranate is touted as an anti-cancer superfood by many. Can't hurt as a daily ritual, and there is also the placebo effect.",
