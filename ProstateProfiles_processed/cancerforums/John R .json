      "Content": "Hello, everyone. This is my first post. I\u0092m happy to have found this forum and have enjoyed reading several threads, such as Fairwind\u0092s about the newest treatment options to consider (or not) after Lupron fails. I, too, will soon likely have to decide what to do next. But my path to that point is a little different than his. I was diagnosed at age 54 in April 2011. A physical produced a 5.6 PSA, my urologist found a palpable tumor, and I had a biopsy post haste. The pathology results showed a crapload of cancer, with 3+4, 4+3, and 4+4 scores in the right lobe and 3+4 in the left. I decided on brachytherapy and met with a highly respected radiation oncologist. Before I could ask him any questions, he said that an MRI I\u0092d had with my physical (for a different issue) showed some swollen lymph nodes in my chest. Hold everything, as PC metastases up there would render brachy moot. A subsequent CT scan revealed, and I quote, adenopathy throughout the retroperitoneum and in the retroesophageal and retroaortic regions of the posterior mediastinum. Oh, and an enlarged prostate (no sh*t, Sherlock!). In I went for a node biopsy to determine whether it was PC or something else, such as lymphoma. When the RO told us it was the former, my heart sank. Brachytherapy or surgery were no longer options, as the horse had already left the barn, so to speak. The lymph nodes were near my aorta, esophagus, venae cava, and other dicey places, so radiation was out, too. He\u0092d treated 2,500 men for PC but had never seen it jump directly to lymph nodes in those areas. Mine is the Michael Phelps of prostate cancer, evidently. In the biggest fight of my life, I wasn\u0092t even going to get to throw any decent punches, really. My wife and I sat in our car in the parking lot and cried like babies. Worst time of our 33 years together, truly. A second opinion from UC-San Francisco confirmed the first and it was straight to Lupron, after a little Casodex appetizer. Fortunately, CT scans showed no bone or other metastases, and my PSA dropped quickly to <.05 and stayed in that neighborhood until December 2012, when it ticked up to .17. Six weeks later it was .30. Six weeks after that it was .99. Michael was swimming well! I went back on Casodex last April 2013, after which my next two 6-week PSAs were 1.33 (not bad, up 33%) and 2.29 (not good). My oncologist on Monday tripled my dose and ordered CT and bone scans that I\u0092ll get soon. We\u0092ll see. He mentioned Provenge and Zytiga as potential next-steps if the megadose doesn\u0092t do the trick. As charming as my side effects from Lupron and Casodex are, I\u0092m not certain I\u0092m in the market for many more, especially if their cause extends my life by only four to six months. OTOH, my insurance company said they\u0092d cover Provenge, so\u0085maybe it would be cool to have turbocharged lymphocytes! The common cold doesn\u0092t stand a chance, I\u0092m thinkin\u0092. One day at a time, right? Thanks for reading.",
