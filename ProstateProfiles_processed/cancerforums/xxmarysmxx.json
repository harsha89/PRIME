      "Content": "Hello all.. have not been on here for awhile. Maybe someone can give some advise on this. My husband had his prostate removed two years ago he was 48. His original PSA number was 7.6 and 6 samples from biopsy were confirmed. 40% of the prostate was cancer stage II and Gleason score of 7. Doc said it was an aggressive cancer that had almost broken into the bladder . His first year out he was undetectable. 2nd year PSA number starts rising got up to .16 when he started 39 days of radiation. Done with his 39 days and just had his first blood test. We see on the hospital portal PSA number is .07 which is good that it is done but Doc said anything over .04 is a concern. Also, his testosterone went way down to 110 it was already low at 175. Will treatment lower testosterone? He doesn't see the Doc until Monday. Has anyone gone through this? I really expected a negative number. Mary",
