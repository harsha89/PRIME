      "Content": "Hi everyone, I recently went to see my family doctor and a 5.9 PSA came up. I'm 48 years old and he told me I won myself a trip to the Urologist. My urologist indicated my PSA was 3.9 previously so his recommendation was to perform the prostate biopsy. I was told that this was an uncomfortable but not painful procedure, however my results did not match. It was a pretty painful procedure for me. I'm not sure if the local anasthetic did not work or they make you think its going to numb you more than it does. I felt all 12 samples being taken. Anyway, yesterday I got my results and I had 2 of 12 cores have cancer and 1 suspicious. My Gleason score is 6. My urologist recommends removal of the prostate for my age but I'm terrified of the side effects. I've been reviewing all the different treatment options and each seem to have upsides and downsides: Active Surveillance: Pros: Surgery is delayed until necessary, Present quality of life is mostly maintained Cons: requires constant PSA tests, and likely annual prostate biopsies Radiation: Pros: Less invasive procedure that surgery Cons: Potential Erectile dysfunction, Urinary incontinence, possible rectal dysfunction, chance of cancer returning Prostate removal Pros: Removal of prostate likely removes ability of Cancer to spread outside prostate Cons: Erectile dysfunction, Urinary incontinence, Impotence Proton Therapy Pros: Less invasive procedure that is less likely to damage healthy tissue Cons: Potential erectile dysfunction or urinary incontinence but seen in fewer cases I'm not 100% I have all these right but it seems recently a lot of people are favoring Proton Therapy but I haven't found a lot of testimonies outside of the actual centers performing the procedure. Obviously they are not going to have negative testimonies on their website. I just downloaded Robert Marckini's book \"You can beat prostate cancer and you don't need surgery to do it\" and some other books as well. I was hoping there are others out there who have been in my similar situation as me and find out which option they chose and results they had. I am getting 2nd and possibly 3rd opinions but I have a feeling each dr. will simply recommend what procedure they specialize in. Thanks and sorry for the rambling. Jerry",
