Either way I will have whatever they recommend as well. I have recliner's in my theater room but am not so sure how they might be for sleeping overnight.

Our bed is pretty high which will make getting in an out a little easier. I will have to see about that. Thanks guys!",

      "Content": "Greetings, I arrived home a few hours ago from my DaVinci Robotic Surgery. All went as expected and Dr. Esposito spared my nerves and said that everything including my prostate looked healthy. He did say that I had a large prostate but not an enlarged one. He feels that the pathology shouldn't hold any surprises. I go in this Monday to get the catheter removed. I am pretty sore and dealing with the catheter is no picnic but otherwise I am fine save for some minor discomfort. I have had two bowel movements, one at five AM this morning at the hospital and one just a little while ago. Neither produced much as I haven't really eaten anything solid since Monday afternoon. They had me on all liquids yesterday and today. They told me I could move to a semi-solid diet (pudding, creamy soups shakes etc.) one I passed gas. I did pass gas when I went this afternoon. It wasn't earth shaking but was a fair amount. I will gradually work my way into semi-solid foods and hope for a solid BM. The Hackensack University Medical Center, Dr. Michael Eposito and the team at the Jew Jersey Center for Prostate Cancer and Urology are top notch. I look forward to getting the catheter out and for a positive report on my pathology. Regards,",

      "Content": "Greetings, I just returned from the urologist and had the catheter removed after which I got the results of my pathology. Firstly, removal of the catheter isn't an especially pleasant experience but certainly not painful. In my case they had me lie on the table while they deflated the Foley's balloon. Saline was then introduced into my bladder until it felt pretty full. At that point I held my breath, exhaled and they pulled it out. I was then directed to urinate into a receptacle (looked like a measuring cup) and asked to stop then start the flow, which I did with no trouble. I brought along a pad which I put on, got dressed and met with the surgeon. My pathology report was exactly what they expected save for the presence of cancer on the other side. It was fully contained in the prostate capsule, my margins were negative and my Gleason remained 7 (3+4). The only change was the upgrade of my staging from T1c to T2c. He said that I couldn't have asked for a better outcome and I of course agree. I go back in 90 days for a follow up PSA. I urinated when I got home and it was painless. I did a quick Kegel while doing so and it was fine. I will see how things go tonight but right now control seems very good. I am a 6 days post-op and feel good. I haven't required any pain meds and have been using Extra Strength Tylenol to manage the soreness. I have been regularly moving my bowels and have been drinking plenty of water. I have pretty much returned to my regular diet but in smaller amounts. I predominantly eat plenty of protein, fruits, fiber etc. and limit fried foods and high fat. It is indeed nice to be on the other side. For those just beginning this process please know that while this isn't anything that any of us would want it is important to seek good advice and the support you will find on this forum is a good starting point. From there depending on your option/decision about treatment you have lots to consider but know that there are plenty of encouraging experiences and those of us who are willing to share. Contact me anytime. Regards,",

      "Content": "Greetings, I just returned from the urologist and had the catheter removed after which I got the results of my pathology. Firstly, removal of the catheter isn't an especially pleasant experience but certainly not painful. In my case they had me lie on the table while they deflated the Foley's balloon. Saline was then introduced into my bladder until it felt pretty full. At that point I held my breath, exhaled and they pulled it out. I was then directed to urinate into a receptacle (looked like a measuring cup) and asked to stop then start the flow, which I did with no trouble. I brought along a pad which I put on, got dressed and met with the surgeon. My pathology report was exactly what they expected save for the presence of cancer on the other side. It was fully contained in the prostate capsule, my margins were negative and my Gleason remained 7 (3+4). The only change was the upgrade of my staging from T1c to T2c. He said that I couldn't have asked for a better outcome and I of course agree. I go back in 90 days for a follow up PSA. I urinated when I got home and it was painless. I did a quick Kegel while doing so and it was fine. I will see how things go tonight but right now control seems very good. I am a 6 days post-op and feel good. I haven't required any pain meds and have been using Extra Strength Tylenol to manage the soreness. I have been regularly moving my bowels and have been drinking plenty of water. I have pretty much returned to my regular diet but in smaller amounts. I predominantly eat plenty of protein, fruits, fiber etc. and limit fried foods and high fat. It is indeed nice to be on the other side. For those just beginning this process please know that while this isn't anything that any of us would want it is important to seek good advice and the support you will find on this forum is a good starting point. From there depending on your option/decision about treatment you have lots to consider but know that there are plenty of encouraging experiences and those of us who are willing to share.

      "Content": "Greetings, I arrived home a few hours ago from my DaVinci Robotic Surgery. All went as expected and Dr. Esposito spared my nerves and said that everything including my prostate looked healthy. He did say that I had a large prostate but not an enlarged one. He feels that the pathology shouldn't hold any surprises. I go in this Monday to get the catheter removed. I am pretty sore and dealing with the catheter is no picnic but otherwise I am fine save for some minor discomfort. I have had two bowel movements, one at five AM this morning at the hospital and one just a little while ago. Neither produced much as I haven't really eaten anything solid since Monday afternoon. They had me on all liquids yesterday and today. They told me I could move to a semi-solid diet (pudding, creamy soups shakes etc.) one I passed gas. I did pass gas when I went this afternoon. It wasn't earth shaking but was a fair amount. I will gradually work my way into semi-solid foods and hope for a solid BM. The Hackensack University Medical Center, Dr. Michael Eposito and the team at the Jew Jersey Center for Prostate Cancer and Urology are top notch. I look forward to getting the catheter out and for a positive report on my pathology. Regards,",

      "Content": "Greetings, I wanted to put together the events surrounding my prostate cancer, treatment, and recovery for those that may find it of interest. I was very fortunate to catch it early and after surgery my recovery has been excellent. Read on to see the final outcome. Early May 2013, I got the news from my urologist in response to my second biopsy due to elevated PSA levels (with the last result being 6.6) that I had prostate cancer. A little background on my PSA history is that I was biopsied two years ago after a PSA of 6.9 (prior to that my levels were within normal range). The result of that biopsy was inconclusive, meaning 9 cores looked normal, three looked different than the other 9 but not cancerous. Going every six months for DRE/PSA afterward my PSA danced around from 4.4, 5.5, and 6.8. That is when I decided to have the second biopsy. The biopsy showed one core out of 12 positive for adenocarinoma, 5%, a Gleason score of 7 (3+4) and a localized stage rating of T1C. After looking at the applicable options and conferring with an oncologist I opted for the surgery. I felt that given my age, good health and presentation that surgery would be my best chance for cure. The NJ Center for Prostate Cancer and Urology, specifically Dr. Michael Esposito was recommended to me through a trusted physician. After looking into them and Dr. Esposito we were pleased with his pedigree and set up an appointment. The meeting went very well and we were pleased with him and his experience (over 4,000 Robotic procedures performed). I was scheduled for the DaVinci Radical Robotic prostatectomy on July 30th at the Hacksensack University Hospital in Hacksensack NJ. Dr. Epositio recommended that I begin Kegels right away (this was in late May) and put me on 5mg daily dose of Cialis. I wasn't having any erectile issues but he said it would get the bllod flowing to the nerves. As part of their pre-op testing I had an ultrasound of my bladder followed by a Cystoscopy (not a very pleasent experience!). I went in for surgery on the morning of July 30th (Tuesday) and all went as expected. Dr. Esposito spared my nerves and said that everything including my prostate looked healthy. I was pretty sore and dealing with the catheter was no picnic but otherwise I am felt save for some minor discomfort. I didn't have any issues with constipation and followed the instructions given to me by the docter and hospital. On the following Monday I went and had the catheter removed. Removal of the catheter isn't an especially pleasant experience but certainly not painful. In my case they had me lie on the table while they deflated the Foley's balloon. Saline was then introduced into my bladder until it felt pretty full. At that point I held my breath, exhaled and they pulled it out.

I was scheduled to go back in 90 days for a follow up PSA. When I got home I felt one or two drips of urine into the pad which I kept on for the rest of the day and that night. The next day I continued to wear the pad but didn't have any leaking. By the following day I was no longer wearing the pad and haven't since. 13 days post-op I returned to work (I am a NY State Trooper, First Sergeant) and felt good enough to go back to jogging (started on the treadmill) three days later. I have full sexual function and didn't encounter any erectile related issues. Orgasms aren't as intense as they were before the surgery but that has noticeably improved. I continue to do Kegels (one set daily) and enjoy each and every time I urinate (like a firehose!). On November 5th I went for my 90 day follow up/PSA and my PSA level is 0. I am so very grateful to The Hackensack University Medical Center, Dr. Michael Eposito and the team at the New Jersey Center for Prostate Cancer and Urology. I would also like to thank the members of this forum who are simply outstanding. Sharing your experiences and expertise with those just coming into the knowledge that they have or may have this disease is invaluable.

      "Content": "Greetings, I got the news from my urologist on Monday. This was my second biopsy in response to elevated PSA levels. I am about to turn 49 and my last PSA was 6.6. I was biopsied two years ago after a PSA of 6.9. The results of that biopsy was inconclusive, meaning 9 cores looked normal, three looked different than the other 9 but not cancerous. Going every six months for DRE/PSA my exam consistently yielded normal results but my PSA danced around from 4.4, 5.5, and 6.8. I decided to have another biopsy and this time one core came back positive with 5%, a Gleason score of 7 and a localized stage rating of T1C. Sooo here I sit. I have made an appointment with an oncologist to assess my options. My urologist is also a surgeon and his recommendation is radical removal of my prostate. To me this seems excessive giving my presentation. I have been looking at some of the alternatives and am trying to learn a bit more about them prior to seeing the oncologist on May 20th. I would love to hear from everyone that has anything to offer especially if they began this process in a similar situation. Regards, Ralph",

I was biopsied two years ago after a PSA of 6.9. The results of that biopsy was inconclusive, meaning 9 cores looked normal, three looked different than the other 9 but not cancerous. Going every six months for DRE/PSA my exam consistently yielded normal results but my PSA danced around from 4.4, 5.5, and 6.8. I decided to have another biopsy and this time one core came back positive with 5%, a Gleason score of 7 and a localized stage rating of T1C. Sooo here I sit. I have made an appointment with an oncologist to assess my options. My urologist is also a surgeon and his recommendation is radical removal of my prostate. To me this seems excessive giving my presentation. I have been looking at some of the alternatives and am trying to learn a bit more about them prior to seeing the oncologist on May 20th. I would love to hear from everyone that has anything to offer especially if they began this process in a similar situation. Regards, Ralph",

I saw a new test on the news this morning where they genetically test the biopsied cancer cells and supposedly can better predict just how aggresive they are. I didn't get the name of the test but your urologist might know. Greetings, Thanks jfd. Based upon my discussion with my urologist his only interest seems to be to get me on the operating table. At this point I am seriously considering a switch but there is no rush until after I have settled on treatment, had it done and need to continue with follow ups. Regards,",

      "Content": "Hey Bob, I guess everyone is a little different. I am in law enforcement and physically fit (for an old guy of 49). I returned to work 13 days after surgery and was able to return to my workout regimen (running at least) 3 days after that. I was able to resume situps etc. about four weeks after that. For clarification I am a supervisor so I don't go on active patrol. I have an office and split my time between administrative duties and and being out and about. At 7 weeks out I wouldn't think that cartwheels are in order however depending on your health/fitness level prior to surgery I would expect that an average or light work day wouldn't send you the depths of crashing and burning. Give it a bit more time and if you're not feeling like progress is being made give your doctor a call. Regards,",

The only thing that I noticed is that orgasms haven't been nearly as intense as they were before the surgery. I have noticed that this seems to be gradually improving so I am hopeful that in time that returns. Regards,",

      "Content": "Greetings, I am 19 days post-op from DaVinci surgery having had the operation on July 30th. I had the catheter removed on August 5th. I am fortunate in that I have been dry since the day following the removal of the catheter. I have good control over holding back my urine even when my bladder is full but finding a bathroom when it's really full is of course essential. I drink lots of water during the day which is something I always did and trips to the bathroom to let it out haven't increased. I seem to have recovered quickly and returned to work this past Monday (August 12th). I have limited physical activities and won't be returning to bike riding until late September. I went for a short run on the treadmill this past Thursday (August 15th) and felt fine. I then went for a two mile run with my daughter yesterday and that went fine but I will still need to ease back into any distances. I have been able to achieve erections with manual stimulation and getting anywhere near my wife elicited similar responses but I knew that the real test would be trying to have intercourse. Last night we tried things out and it was as it always has been in terms of arousal, stiffness, duration and so forth. The one thing I have noticed is that the orgasm isn't as fulfilling in that the buildup to climax is less intense. I certainly don't want to complain as I am happy that everything is working. I still have to be careful when sitting on hard surfaces and I will avoid any heavy lifting for the next several weeks. Otherwise I feel about as close to my pre-surgery self as possible given the circumstances. I am truly blessed and hope that my progress continues. For those that continue to improve and manage the side effects of surgery I hope that your recovery moves swiftly. For those just starting out on their journey please know that there is hope of a quick and relatively unimpaired recovery. Thanks to all that have shared their stories. Best regards,",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by JustSlappy Ralph, Winter, Both of you had just one positive core, with 5% involvement, and T1c, but rapidly rising PSAs. Am I reading that corrrectly? Seems like you both had a small amount of a very non-aggressive cancer. Did you consider active surveillance or some form of radiation or perhaps some other treatment? thanks, slappy 5 of 12 positive cores, T1c, 4.5 PSA, 5%, 10%, 20%, 40% & 50% involvement. No treatment yet. Greetings, JustSlappy, Initially I did briefly consider AS, followed by radiation. The deciding factors for me were my Gleason score of 7 (3+4) which really isn't \"very non-aggressive\" and with my presentation the greatest chance for cure was surgery. I looked at radiation as more of a \"remedy\" that could leave open the possibility for re-occurrence not to mention other longer time issues especially given my age. That isn't to suggest that either treatment is wrong for anyone else however that is how I looked at it. For me removal of the prostate and therefore the cancer gave me the best shot at putting this completely behind me. I see my surgeon tomorrow for my fist visit and figure ill be getting things removed in october. I hope i can follow your lead ! gsteve, best of luck tomorrow and I hope you are as happy with your first visit to your surgeon as I was with mine. We were VERY impressed with him and immediately felt confident and assured. THAT is an important component going into this. I hope you follow my lead as well and wish you all the very best.

      "Content": "Originally Posted by JustSlappy Ralph, Winter, Both of you had just one positive core, with 5% involvement, and T1c, but rapidly rising PSAs. Am I reading that corrrectly? Seems like you both had a small amount of a very non-aggressive cancer. Did you consider active surveillance or some form of radiation or perhaps some other treatment? thanks, slappy 5 of 12 positive cores, T1c, 4.5 PSA, 5%, 10%, 20%, 40% & 50% involvement. No treatment yet. Greetings, JustSlappy, Initially I did briefly consider AS, followed by radiation. The deciding factors for me were my Gleason score of 7 (3+4) which really isn't \"very non-aggressive\" and with my presentation the greatest chance for cure was surgery. I looked at radiation as more of a \"remedy\" that could leave open the possibility for re-occurrence not to mention other longer time issues especially given my age. That isn't to suggest that either treatment is wrong for anyone else however that is how I looked at it. For me removal of the prostate and therefore the cancer gave me the best shot at putting this completely behind me. I see my surgeon tomorrow for my fist visit and figure ill be getting things removed in october. I hope i can follow your lead ! gsteve, best of luck tomorrow and I hope you are as happy with your first visit to your surgeon as I was with mine. We were VERY impressed with him and immediately felt confident and assured. THAT is an important component going into this. I hope you follow my lead as well and wish you all the very best.

      "Content": "Greetings, I am 19 days post-op from DaVinci surgery having had the operation on July 30th. I had the catheter removed on August 5th. I am fortunate in that I have been dry since the day following the removal of the catheter. I have good control over holding back my urine even when my bladder is full but finding a bathroom when it's really full is of course essential. I drink lots of water during the day which is something I always did and trips to the bathroom to let it out haven't increased. I seem to have recovered quickly and returned to work this past Monday (August 12th). I have limited physical activities and won't be returning to bike riding until late September. I went for a short run on the treadmill this past Thursday (August 15th) and felt fine. I then went for a two mile run with my daughter yesterday and that went fine but I will still need to ease back into any distances. I have been able to achieve erections with manual stimulation and getting anywhere near my wife elicited similar responses but I knew that the real test would be trying to have intercourse. Last night we tried things out and it was as it always has been in terms of arousal, stiffness, duration and so forth. The one thing I have noticed is that the orgasm isn't as fulfilling in that the buildup to climax is less intense. I certainly don't want to complain as I am happy that everything is working. I still have to be careful when sitting on hard surfaces and I will avoid any heavy lifting for the next several weeks. Otherwise I feel about as close to my pre-surgery self as possible given the circumstances. I am truly blessed and hope that my progress continues. For those that continue to improve and manage the side effects of surgery I hope that your recovery moves swiftly. For those just starting out on their journey please know that there is hope of a quick and relatively unimpaired recovery. Thanks to all that have shared their stories. Best regards,",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by ddayglo Had Davinci on 7/18. Follow-up next week. I know before surgery when havig a PSA test we are not supposed to do anything which could raise the level. But now that my prostate is out, I'm assuming it doesn't matter, right? I'm almost wondering if I should do everything I was told not to do before checking PSA level, like bike riding, giving my semi-limp friend a \"helping hand\", etc. Almost do everything I can to raise whatever PSA level there may be to find it sooner. And I do plan on talking to the Dr about what I can do to wake by \"lil buddy\" up some more. Greetings, I went for my three month follow-up on November 5th and my PSA was 0. Prior to that I didn't do anything that I wouldn't normally including sexual activity, running etc. It will be fine and best of luck. Regards,",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by ddayglo Had Davinci on 7/18. Follow-up next week. I know before surgery when havig a PSA test we are not supposed to do anything which could raise the level. But now that my prostate is out, I'm assuming it doesn't matter, right? I'm almost wondering if I should do everything I was told not to do before checking PSA level, like bike riding, giving my semi-limp friend a \"helping hand\", etc. Almost do everything I can to raise whatever PSA level there may be to find it sooner. And I do plan on talking to the Dr about what I can do to wake by \"lil buddy\" up some more. Greetings, I went for my three month follow-up on November 5th and my PSA was 0. Prior to that I didn't do anything that I wouldn't normally including sexual activity, running etc. It will be fine and best of luck. Regards,",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by RonnyB I am attending a program at Vancouver Prostate Centre for newly diagnosed patients on Dec 11th. At that program there will be specialists in urology and radiation oncology. They want my lab reports before attending to assess my situation. I am Stage 2B Gleason 4 +4 =8 Biopsy 6 out of 12 samples positive. PSA 7.6. Bone Scan Negative.62 years old I am leaning towards Davinci as I am on my own with no family near me. I hear recovery is quicker and less invasive surgery. I would like your opinions before I attend this seminar. Much Thanks, Ronny B Hi Ronny, I assume your question is for opinions on either the Davinci Robotic or Open radical prostatectomy procedures. I had the Davinci done on July 30th of this year and was back at work on August 12th. The Davinci is less invasive than the open however the recovery time in either case will depend on the individual. I wouldn't say that one procedure is better than the other but is determined by what you as the patient want and of course the skill/experience of the surgeon. You might want to pick up Dr. Walsh's book on prostate cancer as well. What are your questions? There are many here who can provide at least some answers that you seek. Regards,",
