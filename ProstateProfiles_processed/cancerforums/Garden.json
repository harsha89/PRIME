He wants to do a bone scan and an MRI quickly. However, my husband developed an infection from the biopsy and is running 102-103 temp. Doc said he needs to clear up before tests can be done. If temp is not down by tomorrow, dr may put him in hospital to treat it. We are considering going to MD Anderson for assessment. Would appreciate any advice on a. Should we go ahead and do bone scan and mri before MD Anderson? It might be faster. Or, would it be better to wait and have MD Anderson do testing? b.

      "Content": "My husband received result today from his biopsy. See above. I don\u0092t have a copy of the specifics yet. The doctor told us it is an aggresive cancer. He wants to do a bone scan and an MRI quickly. However, my husband developed an infection from the biopsy and is running 102-103 temp. Doc said he needs to clear up before tests can be done. If temp is not down by tomorrow, dr may put him in hospital to treat it. We are considering going to MD Anderson for assessment. Would appreciate any advice on a. Should we go ahead and do bone scan and mri before MD Anderson? It might be faster. Or, would it be better to wait and have MD Anderson do testing? b. Anyone had experience with aggressive prostate cancer and can share how you handled it? Really lost right now and just looking for some ideas for direction. Thanks so much.",
