      "Content": "Thanks for that. He has been seeing an oncologist and urologist alongside exploring alternative treatments. His oncologist has already told him that they will keep an eye on it and that he can choose to have palliative chemotherapy. The PC had metastisized before he was given hormone therapy in the first place which was only meant to be palliative in nature. His PSA was back down to 1.4ish last summer (down from 124) due to the hormone therapy, but then the cancer became hormone resistant and started growing again. His oncologist has advised him to wait on the chemotherapy as his own immune system is still working on it. It this good advice? I don't know, I have been trying to learn as much as possible,",

      "Content": "Hi all, Someone very close to me was diagnosed with prostate cancer in 2010. His prognosis was poor, but the hormone therapy was very successful and initially looked like it would slow the cancer down for sometime. Unfortunately the cancer became hormone resistant late last year and his psa is really moving quickly upward. I have been doing some research on diet and came across Jane Plant's work. I am just trying to get my head around the programme for people with active prostate cancer and would really love to hear if anyone has tried this. Thanks loads, Sandy",

      "Content": "Hi blank, Hi lancepeace, The Plant Programme is essentially a vegan diet with fish/chicken/eggs up to 3 servings per week-ish. The variations recommended for those with active cancer has increased veg with decreased grain and loads of variety of types of fruit and veg, loads of fresh organic stuff, all really healthy. Prof Jane Plant gives a case study of a man with recurring prostate cancer and a psa of 70 who felt this was successful in getting his psa back into normal range and I was hoping to hear about some real experiences. I am writing because someone I care about has prostate cancer which has become active again and now resists hormone therapy. His last psa reading was 58. Really would like to find something to slow it all down..... Thanks for the responses. Also, Chicago Prostate Center? Is that local for you? I'm from Chicagoland, but now in Surrey. Sandy",
