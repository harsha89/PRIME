      "Content": "My cancer was diagnosed when the nurse practitioner in my urologist office felt some bumpy areas on my prostate,plus some slight swelling.He reccommended a biopsy.The biopsy came back with 3 of the twelve areas with cancer cells(80 pct,90 pct,and 10 pct)I was started on LUPRON but a short time later a bone scan showed metastases in my ribs vertebrae and shoulder.I did not like my first urologist and switched to the head of oncology at Mt. Sinai Hospital in Miami Beach.I have had 6 rounds of Docetaxel,with my PSA jumping at least one point until it reached 7.66.I then started Zytiga (2860 for first copay).After one week of Zytiga my PSA dropped to 1.45. I was ecstatic, and my oncologist was surprised.Next blood work showed a jump to 2.57.I will be getting ct scan and bone scans soon.It is great to converse on the computer with other brothers with prostate cancer.Keep going strong.",
