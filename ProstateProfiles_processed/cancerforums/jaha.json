      "Content": "I\u0092m due to have my third three month Lupron injection in approx two weeks. I had my psa and testosterone tested a few days ago. Psa was 0.1 and testosterone was 0.2. As my testosterone is below the castrate level, is it necessary to have the next injection as planned. It\u0092s obvious that the three month Lupron injection suppresses the testosterone longer than three months. Would it not be better to monitor the testosterone and apply the injection when a rise is indicated. One other point how long can one expect before psa is reduced to undedectable when on HT. As my last two psa readings have been 0.1 I did expect the latest to below 0.1.",

      "Content": "Hi Replicant Thanks for your inquiry, I had my last Lupron injection April 2013, at that point my Psa was 0.074 and testosterone was 0.2. Since then my psa remained about <0.1 until November when it crept up to 0.2, by April this year it had gone up to 0.3 this was in line with the rise in testosterone. My urologist has recommended I now continue with Lupron, so I will have an injection within the next week, so it's back to hot flushes etc. I have also been on Advodart for the last 18 months, which has restricted the amount of free testosterone.",
