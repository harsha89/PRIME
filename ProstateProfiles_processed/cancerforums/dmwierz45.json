      "Content": "I would echo what Djin said. I am in a similar boat to you, and had genomic testing. I was on the fence about ART, but my Decipher score of 74 pushed me over to the side of doing radiation. While my cure percentages were around 30% based on two uPSA's of 0.01, my Urologist told me \"If some of the tumor survived, and it is dormant, thes Decipher tests indicate you are at an increased risk of it growing to a point where it will be a problem, and if it grows, the odds of metastasis are higher than what we thought prior to receiving the genomic results\". While I didn't view this as \"good\" news, it's news I needed to hear, and news that could save my life, if it eliminates what may be left of my tumor.",

I discussed my decision with my Urologist yesterday, and he responded \"That's probably a wise choice\". Prior to yesterday, he had specifically refrained from directing me one way or another.

      "Content": "Originally Posted by Michael F Hi dm! Touch base with FB mikesimm who just competed RT at MDA. Mike has a 'similar' profile: pT3 & Decipher = .78 He had to make a decision about whether to commit to RT or wait for a definitive rising PSA. https://www.cancerforums.net/threads...-for-SRT/page2 I fully agree with Dj's comments. I am in now way suggesting otherwise. However, IF me, I would have a 3 decimal uPSA done now and repeated in June to see if there is any trend. IMO, IF both are < 0.01ng/ml & the 2nd result is ≤ the 1st, I would seek another expert RO's opinion before commencing RT. That is just me personally as I have never had a uPSA result < 0.017 following RP over 7 years ago. Re \"That's probably a wise choice:\" That statement magnificently provides 100% antipodal medical-legal indemnification!!! MF ps Good luck with the repair next week! Go easy and be sure to let it fully heal. Michael, thanks for your input. Since receiving my most recent PSA result, and my Decipher number shortly thereafter, I found myself going through the \"What if I didn't do it, and the cancer came back in 5 years? Would I wonder if ART would've stopped this from happening, and what's the downside risk to doing radiation now?\" scenario, over and over in my mind. The only downsides I can see are the potential side effects, right?",

      "Content": "Another, thanks for your reply. I actually had a very severe case of bladder spasms and urinary retention a day after they took my catheter out the first time. So bad I ended up in the ER and they put another catheter in for two weeks. This pain is nothing like that pain, in location, type of pain, and certainly severity. It seems to radiate from the end of my urethra, but examination by my Uro shows there's nothing of concern there. It's more of a twinge, and like I said, resembles the feeling one gets when they experience the shiver at the end of urination, only more intense, and longer lasting. I do tend to drink a lot of water, so I've cut back somewhat on this. Seems counter-intuitive, but these days, intuition isn't worth a heck of a lot, as I'm in uncharted territory, urologically speaking. I also drink a lot of carbonated water (San Pellegrino), so on the off chance that something in this delicious refreshment is adding to my issues, I'm going to plain water for now. Thanks again.",

      "Content": "Another, thanks for your reply. I actually had a very severe case of bladder spasms and urinary retention a day after they took my catheter out the first time. So bad I ended up in the ER and they put another catheter in for two weeks. This pain is nothing like that pain, in location, type of pain, and certainly severity. It seems to radiate from the end of my urethra, but examination by my Uro shows there's nothing of concern there. It's more of a twinge, and like I said, resembles the feeling one gets when they experience the shiver at the end of urination, only more intense, and longer lasting. I do tend to drink a lot of water, so I've cut back somewhat on this. Seems counter-intuitive, but these days, intuition isn't worth a heck of a lot, as I'm in uncharted territory, urologically speaking. I also drink a lot of carbonated water (San Pellegrino), so on the off chance that something in this delicious refreshment is adding to my issues, I'm going to plain water for now. Thanks again.",

      "Content": "Busby, I returned to work at three weeks post-op, so have been seated much of the day since then, but my perineal pain extended to maybe 8 weeks. Sorry you're having this issue. I had some tumor attachment to my pelvic floor, though, which required a bit of scraping of the floor, and my Urologist told me this likely exacerbated my pain in this area (The major muscles of the pelvic floor all attach to the perineum, as I understand it). He also mentioned that this pain can last 6-12 weeks for some men. Like Dave, I also used/use a foam donut I purchased on Amazon (https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0...?ie=UTF8&psc=1, and found this to make a BIG difference to my discomfort whilst sitting in my office chair. I'm coming up on 11 weeks post-op, and I still have occasional discomfort, but almost no pain.",

      "Content": "Just had my 6 week post-RALP uPSA and office visit with my Uro. My wife and I initially ran into my doctor in the waiting room, and he greeted us very straight-faced. Uh oh. 15 minutes later he walks into the exam room with a big smile on his face, reaches out and grasps my hand very firmly, and asks \"have you seen your PSA number?\". I replied \"No\". He says \"Well, it's good news: your uPSA is 0.01\" Phew... So, due to a number poor-risk factors, I'm now in the \"uPSA every 6 weeks, with follow-up\" until 6 months post op. My Uro says it's still possible I'll be looking at radiotherapy after I've had a chance to heal from my RALP, due to the high risk, aggressive nature of my cancer, and my poor risk factors, but all things considered, we're cautiously positive. Sure could've been a lot worse news. We're still awaiting the Decipher results, which were ordered a week after my RALP. Will review these, along with my next uPSA test, in March.",

      "Content": "Just had my 6 week post-RALP uPSA and office visit with my Uro. My wife and I initially ran into my doctor in the waiting room, and he greeted us very straight-faced. Uh oh. 15 minutes later he walks into the exam room with a big smile on his face, reaches out and grasps my hand very firmly, and asks \"have you seen your PSA number?\". I replied \"No\". He says \"Well, it's good news: your uPSA is 0.01\" Phew... So, due to a number poor-risk factors, I'm now in the \"uPSA every 6 weeks, with follow-up\" until 6 months post op. My Uro says it's still possible I'll be looking at radiotherapy after I've had a chance to heal from my RALP, due to the high risk, aggressive nature of my cancer, and my poor risk factors, but all things considered, we're cautiously positive. Sure could've been a lot worse news. We're still awaiting the Decipher results, which were ordered a week after my RALP. Will review these, along with my next uPSA test, in March.",

      "Content": "Like Busby, I also had a bout of VERY painful retention, approx. 36 hours after my first catheter was removed. My Urologist told me mine was only the second case of this severity he's seen in his career, including stints at the NIH and Cleveland Clinic, so I guess we're just \"lucky\"? I had one bout of excruciating pain that lasted about 45 minutes, took a Norco, then went to bed. 3 hours later, same thing happened, so I called my doctor and he directed me to the ER. When there, they took a CT and did a blood test, and ended up putting in another catheter, and this second one stayed in for 2 weeks. All has been relatively well in the 3 weeks since the second cath was removed. Good luck to your husband. The pain associated with this is something NOBODY should experience, and I hope he's had his one episode.",

If swelling and discoloration persist, it may be the sign of an infection. Abnormal swelling that feels soft, mushy, and painful may the indication of a developing abscess. Abscesses, walled-off collections of pus, are often warm to the touch and may be accompanied by the enlargement of nearby lymph nodes. Abscesses should never be squeezed If the abscess is not properly drained and is allowed burst under the skin, the infection can spread through the bloodstream and cause a potentially life-threatening blood infection known as sepsis. While a little drainage following an injection may be normal (caused by medication leaking out of the needle track), any discolored or abnormal discharge should be looked at immediately. If, on the other hand, the bump is small and you're not sure if it's an abscess, take a pen and draw a circle along the border. If it starts to expand beyond the border or fails to go away in several hours, call a doctor and have it looked at as soon as possible.\" What can it hurt to contact your Urologist?",

      "Content": "Like Busby, I also had a bout of VERY painful retention, approx. 36 hours after my first catheter was removed. My Urologist told me mine was only the second case of this severity he's seen in his career, including stints at the NIH and Cleveland Clinic, so I guess we're just \"lucky\"? I had one bout of excruciating pain that lasted about 45 minutes, took a Norco, then went to bed. 3 hours later, same thing happened, so I called my doctor and he directed me to the ER. When there, they took a CT and did a blood test, and ended up putting in another catheter, and this second one stayed in for 2 weeks. All has been relatively well in the 3 weeks since the second cath was removed. Good luck to your husband. The pain associated with this is something NOBODY should experience, and I hope he's had his one episode.",

The fact that I am on statins, and need an annual physical to get my prescription refilled (with cholesterol blood test) resulted in my PCa being detected last September. In the words of one Uro I saw \"Had you not had your physical in September, and had waited another year, you would be in far graver situation right now with regards to your aggressive, high-risk (G9) prostate cancer\". So, in essence, being on statins directly and positively influenced my life expectancy and overall PCa prognosis.",

      "Content": "Busby, pay attention to your body. Just over a day after I had my catheter removed (6 days post RALP), I experienced excruciating pain when I tried to urinate. It was so bad, it brought me to the floor. Lasted about 45 minutes. The first time it happened, I took a Norco and went back to bed. Got up 3 hours later to urinate, and it happened again. Was so bad we considered calling 911. Contacted my Urologist, and he told me to go to his hospital's ER. Once there, they did a CT of my abdomen, and determined my bladder was spasming due to urine retention. He reinstalled a catheter, which brought immediate relief, and this second cath stayed in for two weeks. The second cath removal went much better, and I am almost two weeks cath-free. Urologist posited that post-op edema was causing my bladder and urethra to seize up. As I understand it, urine retention can devolve into a serious issue, if untreated. Beware of using the Hydrocodone too much. My Urologist instructed me that opiod-induced constipation can exacerbate the abdominal pain.",

      "Content": "Busby, pay attention to your body. Just over a day after I had my catheter removed (6 days post RALP), I experienced excruciating pain when I tried to urinate. It was so bad, it brought me to the floor. Lasted about 45 minutes. The first time it happened, I took a Norco and went back to bed. Got up 3 hours later to urinate, and it happened again. Was so bad we considered calling 911. Contacted my Urologist, and he told me to go to his hospital's ER. Once there, they did a CT of my abdomen, and determined my bladder was spasming due to urine retention. He reinstalled a catheter, which brought immediate relief, and this second cath stayed in for two weeks. The second cath removal went much better, and I am almost two weeks cath-free. Urologist posited that post-op edema was causing my bladder and urethra to seize up. As I understand it, urine retention can devolve into a serious issue, if untreated. Beware of using the Hydrocodone too much. My Urologist instructed me that opiod-induced constipation can exacerbate the abdominal pain.",

I made this call based on my high Gleason score, several high risk factors, and my pT3aN0 pathological state....My Uro says it's still possible I'll be looking at radiotherapy after I've had a chance to heal from my RALP, due to the high risk, aggressive nature of my cancer, and my poor risk factors, but all things considered, we're cautiously positive. Sure could've been a lot worse news....He says \"Well, it's good news: your uPSA is 0.01\" Phew... So, due to a number poor-risk factors, I'm now in the \"uPSA every 6 weeks, with follow-up\" until 6 months post op.
