      "Content": "I am 47 years old and had my prostate out about 14 months ago. My psa before surgery was 4.1. My Gleason was 3+4. Bone scan was clean. Lymph nodes were clean. No positive margins. No growth into the outer lining. After surgery my PSA dropped to 0.02, but went up to 0.05 the following month. Six months in it was 0.07, and remained there for the next three-month test. Three months later (1 year after surgery) it was 0.11. I go in in a couple weeks for another test. I will obviously talk to my uralogist and consult an oncologist if it continues going up. If it is up, how long should I wait before looking at salvage radiation? Thanks for any thoughts.",

      "Content": "Hello, I had my prostate removed in December 2012. My PSA went down dramatically (from 4.1 to 0.02), but then went back up slightly, leveling off at about 0.07. In my last PSA test in December 2013 (one year after surgery), it went up to 1.1. I know that salvage radiation can help improve survival when PSA goes up, if you do it early, that is within 2 years of PSA rising again or prior to it reaching 1.0. Given the fact that my PSA never really vanished, what are your thoughts? Thanks, John",
