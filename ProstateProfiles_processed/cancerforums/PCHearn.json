I'm not sure whether that is a good thing or a bad thing. The question now is whether to go back to the Mayo Clinic (or somewhere) and repeat those tests. Maybe they will find something to \"shoot at\" during the radiation treatments.",

      "Content": "Hi. I haven\u0092t been on here in about 14 months. I have some previous posts explaining how I got here, and my results at the Mayo Clinic. This post is just kind of a recap of my PSA history and where I am right now in my journey. Please see my signature below. My urologist had been doing my PSA tests in the lab in his office until the end of 2016. In Jan 2017, he started sending them out to another lab. In Jan 2017, he told me that my PSA was .2, and he gave me the exact same number in Jul 2017. Since he had always given me a 2-digit number, I assumed he meant .20, but I was wrong. The new test he was using only went out one place. So I didn\u0092t know whether it was .20, .25, or .29. It makes a big difference. I was furious. I immediately stopped seeing that doctor, and made an appointment at the Mayo Clinic. They do a different type of PSA test and in Jul 2017 they said my PSA was .17. I know you have to have the exact same test from the same lab three times in a row to determine a real pattern, but the good news was that my PSA was probably closer to .20 than .29. I started having my family doctor do my PSA tests \u0096 same test and same lab \u0096 every three months. It was the ultra-sensitive PSA test. In Oct 2017, my PSA was .215. OK, it was a little higher than I had hoped, but it was just the first ultra-sensitive test using this lab. In Jan 2018, it was .213. Interesting. I knew my PSA was not going down, but maybe it was just going to stay level. That would be great. In Apr 2018, it was .230. Crap. And in Jul 2018, it was .261. Time to get serious. I know that .2 is/was considered the magic number to determine if the prostate cancer has returned. Some folks use .03. But my PSA progression had been so slow, and it\u0092s been almost 12 years since my surgery. I was hoping that maybe, just maybe, it would continue to be very slow. I was in no hurry to have salvage radiation therapy. During the last year, I have met with four radiation oncologists, three local in Oklahoma City and one at the Mayo Clinic. I\u0092m finalizing plans to start SRT.",

Here are the numbers for different Gleasons: 3+3 = 5% 3+4 = 17% 4+3 = 35% 4+4 = 37% 9 or 10 = 76% The experience of the surgeon makes a huge difference too.",

      "Content": "Hi. I haven\u0092t been on here in about 14 months. I have some previous posts explaining how I got here, and my results at the Mayo Clinic. This post is just kind of a recap of my PSA history and where I am right now in my journey. Please see my signature below. My urologist had been doing my PSA tests in the lab in his office until the end of 2016. In Jan 2017, he started sending them out to another lab. In Jan 2017, he told me that my PSA was .2, and he gave me the exact same number in Jul 2017. Since he had always given me a 2-digit number, I assumed he meant .20, but I was wrong. The new test he was using only went out one place. So I didn\u0092t know whether it was .20, .25, or .29. It makes a big difference. I was furious. I immediately stopped seeing that doctor, and made an appointment at the Mayo Clinic. They do a different type of PSA test and in Jul 2017 they said my PSA was .17. I know you have to have the exact same test from the same lab three times in a row to determine a real pattern, but the good news was that my PSA was probably closer to .20 than .29. I started having my family doctor do my PSA tests \u0096 same test and same lab \u0096 every three months. It was the ultra-sensitive PSA test. In Oct 2017, my PSA was .215. OK, it was a little higher than I had hoped, but it was just the first ultra-sensitive test using this lab. In Jan 2018, it was .213. Interesting. I knew my PSA was not going down, but maybe it was just going to stay level. That would be great. In Apr 2018, it was .230. Crap. And in Jul 2018, it was .261. Time to get serious. I know that .2 is/was considered the magic number to determine if the prostate cancer has returned. Some folks use .03. But my PSA progression had been so slow, and it\u0092s been almost 12 years since my surgery. I was hoping that maybe, just maybe, it would continue to be very slow. I was in no hurry to have salvage radiation therapy. During the last year, I have met with four radiation oncologists, three local in Oklahoma City and one at the Mayo Clinic. I\u0092m finalizing plans to start SRT.",

      "Content": "Hi. I haven\u0092t been on here in about 14 months. I have some previous posts explaining how I got here, and my results at the Mayo Clinic. This post is just kind of a recap of my PSA history and where I am right now in my journey. Please see my signature below. My urologist had been doing my PSA tests in the lab in his office until the end of 2016. In Jan 2017, he started sending them out to another lab. In Jan 2017, he told me that my PSA was .2, and he gave me the exact same number in Jul 2017. Since he had always given me a 2-digit number, I assumed he meant .20, but I was wrong. The new test he was using only went out one place. So I didn\u0092t know whether it was .20, .25, or .29. It makes a big difference. I was furious. I immediately stopped seeing that doctor, and made an appointment at the Mayo Clinic. They do a different type of PSA test and in Jul 2017 they said my PSA was .17. I know you have to have the exact same test from the same lab three times in a row to determine a real pattern, but the good news was that my PSA was probably closer to .20 than .29. I started having my family doctor do my PSA tests \u0096 same test and same lab \u0096 every three months. It was the ultra-sensitive PSA test. In Oct 2017, my PSA was .215. OK, it was a little higher than I had hoped, but it was just the first ultra-sensitive test using this lab. In Jan 2018, it was .213. Interesting. I knew my PSA was not going down, but maybe it was just going to stay level. That would be great. In Apr 2018, it was .230. Crap. And in Jul 2018, it was .261. Time to get serious. I know that .2 is/was considered the magic number to determine if the prostate cancer has returned. Some folks use .03. But my PSA progression had been so slow, and it\u0092s been almost 12 years since my surgery. I was hoping that maybe, just maybe, it would continue to be very slow. I was in no hurry to have salvage radiation therapy. During the last year, I have met with four radiation oncologists, three local in Oklahoma City and one at the Mayo Clinic. I\u0092m finalizing plans to start SRT.",

      "Content": "Hi. I haven\u0092t been on here in about 14 months. I have some previous posts explaining how I got here, and my results at the Mayo Clinic. This post is just kind of a recap of my PSA history and where I am right now in my journey. Please see my signature below. My urologist had been doing my PSA tests in the lab in his office until the end of 2016. In Jan 2017, he started sending them out to another lab. In Jan 2017, he told me that my PSA was .2, and he gave me the exact same number in Jul 2017. Since he had always given me a 2-digit number, I assumed he meant .20, but I was wrong. The new test he was using only went out one place. So I didn\u0092t know whether it was .20, .25, or .29. It makes a big difference. I was furious. I immediately stopped seeing that doctor, and made an appointment at the Mayo Clinic. They do a different type of PSA test and in Jul 2017 they said my PSA was .17. I know you have to have the exact same test from the same lab three times in a row to determine a real pattern, but the good news was that my PSA was probably closer to .20 than .29. I started having my family doctor do my PSA tests \u0096 same test and same lab \u0096 every three months. It was the ultra-sensitive PSA test. In Oct 2017, my PSA was .215. OK, it was a little higher than I had hoped, but it was just the first ultra-sensitive test using this lab. In Jan 2018, it was .213. Interesting. I knew my PSA was not going down, but maybe it was just going to stay level. That would be great. In Apr 2018, it was .230. Crap. And in Jul 2018, it was .261. Time to get serious. I know that .2 is/was considered the magic number to determine if the prostate cancer has returned. Some folks use .03. But my PSA progression had been so slow, and it\u0092s been almost 12 years since my surgery. I was hoping that maybe, just maybe, it would continue to be very slow. I was in no hurry to have salvage radiation therapy. During the last year, I have met with four radiation oncologists, three local in Oklahoma City and one at the Mayo Clinic. I\u0092m finalizing plans to start SRT.",

Here are the numbers for different Gleasons: 3+3 = 5% 3+4 = 17% 4+3 = 35% 4+4 = 37% 9 or 10 = 76% The experience of the surgeon makes a huge difference too.",

I was just hoping to generate some general discussion about post surgery rise in PSA. I realize that for a lot of people, it's simple. They had RP. Their first post surgery PSA is 1+ and it's doubling quickly. No doubt, it's time to take action. Then there are other folks who had little or no rise in PSA for a long time. And now it's going up very slowly. Sometimes it IS sort of tricky to decide when (or if) to start salvage radiation. What would the trigger be?",

      "Content": "This is a general question. I know that certain things can impact your PSA score. Since I have had my prostate removed, I\u0092m really asking about PSA after surgical prostate removal. But I don\u0092t want to get into the details of my PSA results. I\u0092d rather discuss this in general terms. Using a different lab can impact your PSA. By how much? 10%? 20%? If you had a PSA of .50 using one lab, and you had your next test done at a different lab, and let\u0092s assume there wasn\u0092t any REAL/ACTUAL change, would you expect the number to be between .45 and .55? Between .40 and .60? I know these are small numbers, but small numbers are important when you have had your prostate removed and you\u0092re wondering if you still have cancer. Exercising, having sex, and other activities right before the sample is taken can impact your PSA. Again, I\u0092m curious by how much? But I\u0092ve also heard that those activities will only affect your PSA if you still have a prostate. True or false?",

      "Content": "Michael F Thanks for the reply. As I said in my first post in this thread, I didn\u0092t want to get into the details of my PSA results. I\u0092d rather discuss this subject in general terms. That was because of the other thread you mentioned, where I\u0092ve gotten a lot of great replies about my specific situation. My URO surgeon was not the one who said he uses the PSA number 1.0 to start radiation. That was the first radiation oncologist I went to. But he also said I need to go ahead and get it scheduled. My URO surgeon said for me not to worry and that it\u0092s not time to take any action. And not surprisingly, that was the last time I will ever see him. You said \u0093Your PSA is in a range where some of the newer PET Scan technologies should be able to pinpoint the location(s). Consider going to one of the \"PC Meccas\" such as MD Anderson for a consultation and formulation of a solid game plan.\u0094 In my other thread, where I\u0092m discussing my specific situation (not a general discussion about PSA), I posted a few days ago that I\u0092m currently scheduled at the Mayo Clinic to have a Choline PET scan followed by a 3T MRI. And yes, I know that with a Gleason 6, and no PSA increase for several years, and not doubling every 10 months, I am truly blessed compared to a LOT of others on this forum. I plan to do my research, put a plan together, carry out the plan, and KILL this cancer this time.",

      "Content": "Southsider - Thank you for the input. I have another thread about my specific situation (see It's Back). I was just hoping to generate some general discussion about post surgery rise in PSA. I realize that for a lot of people, it's simple. They had RP. Their first post surgery PSA is 1+ and it's doubling quickly. No doubt, it's time to take action. Then there are other folks who had little or no rise in PSA for a long time. And now it's going up very slowly. Sometimes it IS sort of tricky to decide when (or if) to start salvage radiation. What would the trigger be?",

      "Content": "Let me start by saying that I wish I had found this site 11 years ago, instead of last month. I\u0092m 69 years old. At about age 55, each time I would have my annual physical done, my family doctor (who I no longer use) would do the DRE and say something like \u0093that doesn\u0092t feel right, but since your PSA is only about 1, you\u0092re OK.\u0094 At age 58, I went to a urologist because I thought I had an enlarged prostate. He did the DRE and said \u0093you need a biopsy now.\u0094 So at age 58, with a PSA of 1.75, I was diagnosed with prostate cancer (see signature for biopsy results). I thought \u0093Oh no, my life is over.\u0094 I researched my options; active surveillance, radiation, or surgery. After much soul searching and discussions with my wife, I decided to have surgery. I chose a local urologist who had not done very many DaVinci procedures, but I liked his bedside manner. I had the surgery right after Christmas 2006 (see signature for surgery results). I had the usual incontinence issues, but they cleared up after a while. I had the usual erectile problems, but they haven\u0092t cleared up. Bummer. Since I had positive margins, my urologist discussed the pros and cons of having radiation following my surgery. I decided to wait and hope the cancer would not come back. Six months after surgery, my PSA was zero. Yea! Six months later, it was .01 and I was worried. I know, a .01 doesn\u0092t mean anything. Six months later, and it hadn\u0092t changed. OK. Six months later, and it was zero again. Yea. Life is good. Six months later and it was still zero. OK, I was seeing a pattern and I liked it. Six months later and it was back to .01 but I was not worried. A year later, 2011 and 4 years after my surgery, it was .02. Hmmm. Still not significant. One year later (2012) it was at .04 and I did NOT like where this was probably heading. As you can see from the PSA numbers in my signature below, my cancer is back. My number is at the \u0093magic\u0094 .2 that\u0092s used to define the recurrence of prostate cancer. The good news is that my Gleason was 6 (3+3). And that my PSA didn\u0092t really start going up until about 4-5 years after surgery. And that my PSA is not doubling every year (yet). So now what? My urologist, the same one who did the surgery, told me not to worry and it\u0092s not time yet to take action. I asked him for the name of the radiation oncologist he would recommend (when the time was right) and I went to see him. He explained IMRT and the associated hormone therapy. He said he uses the PSA number 1.0 (after surgery) as the latest time to start the radiation treatments. He said it\u0092s not urgent, but I need to go ahead and get it scheduled. My brother also has/had prostate cancer and also went with the DaVinci surgery. He had his surgery done at MD Anderson about 3 years ago. So far, so good. I went to see the local urologist he uses for check-ups each year. I wanted another opinion from another urologist. He reminded me that my Gleason was 6 (3+3), and my PSA didn\u0092t really start going up until about 4-5 years after surgery, and my PSA is not doubling every year (yet). He recommended active surveillance. He said in my situation, he would use the PSA number 10.0 (after surgery) as the latest time to start the radiation treatments, unless my numbers start doubling in a year or less. And he reminded me that a Gleason 6 (3+3) almost never metastasizes. I asked that urologist which radiation oncologist he would recommend, and made an appointment with him. As it turns out, he worked at ProCure, the proton therapy place here in Oklahoma City. This is good because I wanted to meet with someone to discuss proton therapy. He said even though he works at ProCure, he recommends IMRT for salvage radiation therapy. Like the previous radiation oncologist, he said he uses the PSA number 1.0 (after surgery) as the latest time to start the radiation treatments. He said it\u0092s not urgent, but I need to go ahead and get it scheduled. He does not recommend hormone therapy before or during radiation treatments. OK, I\u0092ve seen two urologists and two radiation oncologists. Both urologists said wait. Both radiation oncologists said get it done. I\u0092m sorry this post is so long. I wanted to give you guys enough information so that you can provide me some good advice. I have several questions. Lets\u0092 start with should I wait or should I get it done?",

He did the DRE and said \u0093you need a biopsy now.\u0094 So at age 58, with a PSA of 1.75, I was diagnosed with prostate cancer (see signature for biopsy results). I thought \u0093Oh no, my life is over.\u0094 I researched my options; active surveillance, radiation, or surgery. After much soul searching and discussions with my wife, I decided to have surgery. I chose a local urologist who had not done very many DaVinci procedures, but I liked his bedside manner. I had the surgery right after Christmas 2006 (see signature for surgery results). I had the usual incontinence issues, but they cleared up after a while. I had the usual erectile problems, but they haven\u0092t cleared up. Bummer. Since I had positive margins, my urologist discussed the pros and cons of having radiation following my surgery. I decided to wait and hope the cancer would not come back. Six months after surgery, my PSA was zero. Yea! Six months later, it was .01 and I was worried. I know, a .01 doesn\u0092t mean anything. Six months later, and it hadn\u0092t changed. OK. Six months later, and it was zero again. Yea. Life is good. Six months later and it was still zero. OK, I was seeing a pattern and I liked it. Six months later and it was back to .01 but I was not worried. A year later, 2011 and 4 years after my surgery, it was .02. Hmmm. Still not significant. One year later (2012) it was at .04 and I did NOT like where this was probably heading. As you can see from the PSA numbers in my signature below, my cancer is back. My number is at the \u0093magic\u0094 .2 that\u0092s used to define the recurrence of prostate cancer. The good news is that my Gleason was 6 (3+3). And that my PSA didn\u0092t really start going up until about 4-5 years after surgery. And that my PSA is not doubling every year (yet). So now what? My urologist, the same one who did the surgery, told me not to worry and it\u0092s not time yet to take action. I asked him for the name of the radiation oncologist he would recommend (when the time was right) and I went to see him. He explained IMRT and the associated hormone therapy. He said he uses the PSA number 1.0 (after surgery) as the latest time to start the radiation treatments. He said it\u0092s not urgent, but I need to go ahead and get it scheduled. My brother also has/had prostate cancer and also went with the DaVinci surgery. He had his surgery done at MD Anderson about 3 years ago. So far, so good. I went to see the local urologist he uses for check-ups each year. I wanted another opinion from another urologist. He reminded me that my Gleason was 6 (3+3), and my PSA didn\u0092t really start going up until about 4-5 years after surgery, and my PSA is not doubling every year (yet). He recommended active surveillance. He said in my situation, he would use the PSA number 10.0 (after surgery) as the latest time to start the radiation treatments, unless my numbers start doubling in a year or less. And he reminded me that a Gleason 6 (3+3) almost never metastasizes. I asked that urologist which radiation oncologist he would recommend, and made an appointment with him. As it turns out, he worked at ProCure, the proton therapy place here in Oklahoma City. This is good because I wanted to meet with someone to discuss proton therapy. He said even though he works at ProCure, he recommends IMRT for salvage radiation therapy. Like the previous radiation oncologist, he said he uses the PSA number 1.0 (after surgery) as the latest time to start the radiation treatments. He said it\u0092s not urgent, but I need to go ahead and get it scheduled. He does not recommend hormone therapy before or during radiation treatments. OK, I\u0092ve seen two urologists and two radiation oncologists. Both urologists said wait. Both radiation oncologists said get it done. I\u0092m sorry this post is so long. I wanted to give you guys enough information so that you can provide me some good advice. I have several questions. Lets\u0092 start with should I wait or should I get it done?",

      "Content": "Thanks to all of you for your quick replies. Michael F - \"you can excise your URO MDs from your opinion pool.\" I agree. I like both URO MDs, but active surveillance (AS) is not for me. So their job is done. Jim215 - \"It would be a damn shame to guess wrong now.\" I've seen it said on this forum, that there is no wrong decision. I'm not sure I agree. I believe AS would be the wrong guess for me. MichiganMan16 - \"I would be acting....yesterday.\" As both radiation oncologists said, it\u0092s not urgent, but I need to go ahead and get it scheduled. I agree. It's time to get er done. But I need a plan. I know the experience of a surgeon is critical. But, how important is to choose the right radiation oncologist? Would I have better results if I go to an \u0093expert\u0094 location? Like MD Anderson, John Hopkins, Mayo Clinic, etc? There would be some inconvenience having to live for two months in another city during the SRT. But if it will produce better results, I\u0092ll do it. However, if all SRT is about the same, and the results will be the same if I have it done in a facility two miles from my home, then that\u0092s a better choice for me. Those of you who have had SRT, or are wise in this area, please let me know what you think. Thanks in advance.",

      "Content": "Let me start by saying that I wish I had found this site 11 years ago, instead of last month. I\u0092m 69 years old. At about age 55, each time I would have my annual physical done, my family doctor (who I no longer use) would do the DRE and say something like \u0093that doesn\u0092t feel right, but since your PSA is only about 1, you\u0092re OK.\u0094 At age 58, I went to a urologist because I thought I had an enlarged prostate. He did the DRE and said \u0093you need a biopsy now.\u0094 So at age 58, with a PSA of 1.75, I was diagnosed with prostate cancer (see signature for biopsy results). I thought \u0093Oh no, my life is over.\u0094 I researched my options; active surveillance, radiation, or surgery. After much soul searching and discussions with my wife, I decided to have surgery. I chose a local urologist who had not done very many DaVinci procedures, but I liked his bedside manner. I had the surgery right after Christmas 2006 (see signature for surgery results). I had the usual incontinence issues, but they cleared up after a while. I had the usual erectile problems, but they haven\u0092t cleared up. Bummer. Since I had positive margins, my urologist discussed the pros and cons of having radiation following my surgery. I decided to wait and hope the cancer would not come back. Six months after surgery, my PSA was zero. Yea! Six months later, it was .01 and I was worried. I know, a .01 doesn\u0092t mean anything. Six months later, and it hadn\u0092t changed. OK. Six months later, and it was zero again. Yea. Life is good. Six months later and it was still zero. OK, I was seeing a pattern and I liked it. Six months later and it was back to .01 but I was not worried. A year later, 2011 and 4 years after my surgery, it was .02. Hmmm. Still not significant. One year later (2012) it was at .04 and I did NOT like where this was probably heading. As you can see from the PSA numbers in my signature below, my cancer is back. My number is at the \u0093magic\u0094 .2 that\u0092s used to define the recurrence of prostate cancer. The good news is that my Gleason was 6 (3+3). And that my PSA didn\u0092t really start going up until about 4-5 years after surgery. And that my PSA is not doubling every year (yet). So now what? My urologist, the same one who did the surgery, told me not to worry and it\u0092s not time yet to take action. I asked him for the name of the radiation oncologist he would recommend (when the time was right) and I went to see him. He explained IMRT and the associated hormone therapy. He said he uses the PSA number 1.0 (after surgery) as the latest time to start the radiation treatments. He said it\u0092s not urgent, but I need to go ahead and get it scheduled. My brother also has/had prostate cancer and also went with the DaVinci surgery. He had his surgery done at MD Anderson about 3 years ago. So far, so good. I went to see the local urologist he uses for check-ups each year. I wanted another opinion from another urologist. He reminded me that my Gleason was 6 (3+3), and my PSA didn\u0092t really start going up until about 4-5 years after surgery, and my PSA is not doubling every year (yet). He recommended active surveillance. He said in my situation, he would use the PSA number 10.0 (after surgery) as the latest time to start the radiation treatments, unless my numbers start doubling in a year or less. And he reminded me that a Gleason 6 (3+3) almost never metastasizes. I asked that urologist which radiation oncologist he would recommend, and made an appointment with him. As it turns out, he worked at ProCure, the proton therapy place here in Oklahoma City. This is good because I wanted to meet with someone to discuss proton therapy. He said even though he works at ProCure, he recommends IMRT for salvage radiation therapy. Like the previous radiation oncologist, he said he uses the PSA number 1.0 (after surgery) as the latest time to start the radiation treatments. He said it\u0092s not urgent, but I need to go ahead and get it scheduled. He does not recommend hormone therapy before or during radiation treatments. OK, I\u0092ve seen two urologists and two radiation oncologists. Both urologists said wait. Both radiation oncologists said get it done. I\u0092m sorry this post is so long. I wanted to give you guys enough information so that you can provide me some good advice. I have several questions. Lets\u0092 start with should I wait or should I get it done?",

      "Content": "Do Gleason patterns transition from one pattern to a higher pattern? Or once a 3, always a 3? Can a pattern 3 left untreated long enough, become a pattern 4? Or is a pattern 4 a completely different \"animal\" than a pattern 3? When a person is diagnosed with a pattern 4, for example, could it have been a pattern 3 before it was a pattern 4? Even briefly? Or did it develop originally as a pattern 4, and will forever be a pattern 4? I have the same questions pertaining to patterns 4 and 5. I realize that we're not doctors, but what do our forum brothers think?",
