      "Content": "My dad (age-71) has been diagnosed with prostate cancer since 2011 and he did robotic surgery to remove his prostate. After surgery doctor recommended him to go through hormonal therapy. He has been taking Eligard every six month. But after some months, although he is taking Eligard, his PSA started to increase and reached 20. In 2013, he started to get abdomen pain and back pain. So doctor suggested him to do MRI and CT scan. In scan it was found that the cancer has spread to his lymphnode and some lymphnodes in some area are swollen. Three months ago doctor prescribed medicine to freeze the swollen lymphnode, which he has taken and his psa has dropped from 20 to 5 within 3 months. His swollen lymphnode has not grown since then. But he still has back and abdomen pain. So last week , doctor has also suggested him to do biopsy and so he did the biopsy. Now he is waiting for the biopsy result. But we want know whether it is useful to adopt surgery, chemotherapy , radiotherapy or hormonal therapy to treat swollen lymph node. Which way will be more effective? Any of your suggestions and experiences will be valuable for us and are more than welcome.",
