      "Content": "Thanks for acceptance in to this much needed Group. I have not seen this question anywhere and as an extremely concerned partner with a guy that will ask little to no questions to Urologist...I am even more hyper-vigilant with Prostate education. Today's consultation after labs taken from last week. I sent a couple questions for him to ask her and we did get some much needed info back that was previously not mentioned. Specifically - she has been testing his free-PSA which is trending low along with a bouncing PSA since early 2014. He is 50 with one negative biopsy last year. Adopted so no family hx. Anyone here with fPSA labs that go low like his within 2 yr span? The up and down PSA not sure about. Biopsy I knew was not 100% reliable. We did not expect a consultation after his check-up last week as the DRE was good and she gave no reason to expect labs to come back less than stellar. As a spouse I now think to the horrible pains that have woken him up periodically and see the presumed BPH symptoms return. Dr. wants to wait another month to repeat labs because he has had colonoscopy, polyp and hemorrhoids removed. Instinct tells me there is cause to be very concerned but I'm of the type that I prefer to not delay in resolving serious problems. I realize however that this is his journey and I should just assist with this situation. Simply put, he wants his nether regions to be left alone for awhile so I know another biopsy he prefers delayed or avoided. They are both hoping inflammation caused the increased PSA but lower fPSA? I don't think so. Uggghhhgg....any input or experience to help me put this in perspective appreciated. Part of me wants to rush him in for biopsy due to suspect signs/labs...the other says calm the heck down and trust the process. We can deal with PC of slow growth - aggressive I will have to really put on my big girl pants for to keep him positive. THANK YOU in advance.",

      "Content": "Thank you for the prompt replies fellas. I agree with and appreciate all of the points. suggestions and support. Sure helps to bounce this stuff off those in the know. I did include a request for Velocity, PS3 and a couple other tests to consider today at consultation. Urologist stated she \"wasn't sure\" about the newer ones. I'm thinking she doesnt use those diagnostic tools usually which is a concern when wanting all avenues covered - however she has been proactive so far so we'll see. It was actually his request to wait a month and give his insides a break. She agreed saying Insurance would not permit a 2nd biopsy for 6 weeks anyway. From now Mz. Bossy here will be going to visits as I know the docs really enjoy the spouses that aren't physicians but play one on TV (old school phrase.) It does seem to help having another there to remember all this info too. On a lighter note, huge football fans here and reading the threads in this forum reminds me of analyzing my fantasy football league stats. Maybe it's easier to focus on the numbers and medical \"plays\" than obsessing about the vast unknown and personal part of it. Odd maybe, but works for me when trying to appear the positive and confident Leader of Our League.",
