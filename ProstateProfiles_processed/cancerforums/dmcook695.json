      "Content": "Hello all! My head is in a tailspin as I was just told late last night that my father was going in for a biopsy this morning and has ended up with a dx of probable prostate cancer. He has been dealing with what his primary thought was cystitis for the last 6 weeks. His PSA at that time was 2.4 and a CT scan showed the bladder looked normal, although we haven't been told if any of the prostate was caught on the x-ray (I'm kind of guessing that doesn't even matter). Basically the surgeon told my mother that we need to wait until Wed. for the biopsy results but the tissue did not look good. He said he did a very slight TURP to give him a little relief but wanted to handle the tissue as little as possible. My brother who is an MD and mother who is a nurse said they will both be shocked if biopsy comes back negative. So I'm up researching anything I can find and stumbled across this site, looking for anything hopeful. I guess my mind is already thinking about staging and what we are dealing with going forward. I thought the fact that his PSA was 2.4 was a good thing, but have come across several articles stating that it could be an indicator of a more aggressive type tumor? My dad is 79 and generally healthy but has a history of BPH and has had ongoing symptoms of this, just worsening over the last 6 weeks. Any thoughts? Wednesday seems like an eternity away at this point! Thanks!",

      "Content": "Well we are a week out from my fathers diagnosis and what a roller coaster ride! I finally got to read through my dads medical records today and I'm so confused. Everything just doesn't add up but I guess every case is different. My dad was diagnosed last week Gleason 9 but his PSA is only 2.4. He went for a second opinion/surgery consult, but was told he wasn't a candidate because he is stage 4 and was recommended to have ADT/radiation. He sees the radiology oncologist in the morning. My question relates to his bone scan. It's stating mets to the scapula, rib and cervical spine. However he has no lymph node involvement nor seminal vesicle involvement. His calcium level is totally normal. CT scan showed unremarkable bladder, although path report showed involvement in the neck of the bladder. I'm wondering how common are false positives on these bones scans? Is it possible to have mets to the bone with basically no other surrounding organ involvement but the bladder neck? Both doctors have been very encouraging and given my dad optimistic outlooks but we are still trying to wrap our heads around this. Dad looks great and feels good so that's a huge plus! And again, so thankful to have found this board!",

      "Content": "A somewhat encouraging visit today with the radio onc. He is sending my dad for another bone scan on Monday as he believes it could be a false positive due to trauma- didn't say it wasn't mets but feels it needs further investigation. My dad has had numerous back no neck problems as well as back surgery so we are hopeful. Consultant33, I do remember that the tumor was adenocarcinoma. And I feel the same- thankful that my brother has been able to speed up the process somewhat but still feels it's taking so long to get started! Seeing uro md. again on Monday and hopefully starting ADT on Monday and then back to radio onc on Thurs. So thankful for all the input and can't say enough how thankful I am to have found this board. You guys are the best!",

      "Content": "I had posted earlier that the radio onc was sending my dad for a follow up bone scan to rule out mets to bone. The good news is that every suspicious spot on the scan actually was a false positive and no bone mets were found. That was the good news. The horrible news is that the scan is now showing mets to the lungs and liver. He has been referred to a medical oncologist to start chemo ASAP (which actually means a week from today and seems too long in my opinion). The doctor called my brother this morning (also a doctor) and told him about the mets and that he felt the prognosis was not good. However, I attended the appointment with my parents and sister and brother and when my brother point blank asked him about the prognosis and life expectancy in front of my dad, the doctor said that we just don't know until we see how the cancer responds to chemo. Does anyone have any experience with this and mets to the soft tissue? And again this seems so atypical bc I have read numerous places that prostate cancer tends to follow a certain path such as prostate, surrounding organs, bones and then distant organs. But I guess every case is different. Just exhausting being on this roller coaster! I want off! Thanks again for all the support. You guys are great.",
