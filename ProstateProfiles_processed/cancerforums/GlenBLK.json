      "Content": "Originally Posted by Otago Glen, you sound terribly confused about the situation. Your posts, if they can be understood, indicate you have not had a DRE. I find it almost impossible to believe that a urologist examined you, and indicated to you that he might do a biopsy and yet he had not yet done a simple DRE. You also failed to indicate what your second PSA is. Though I'm not sure it will be meaningful if you are still suffering from a inflamed prostate. Personally if I was you, I'd slow the entire procedure down before I'd let them do a biopsy. You need to learn more about your particular situation. Either you were not told the facts or you don't fully understand them, or you are mistaken. What was your second PSA? As others have indicated, infections or inflammations can take some time to calm down. Not all of them are bacterial based and as such do not respond to antibiotics. Figure out if you did or did not already have a DRE done by the urologist. This is no small matter. BTW, before the last PSA, was any exam preformed that same day, prior to drawing the blood? For that matter what was done, if anything, on the day they took blood for the first PSA? Also what is your complete history of PSA's. Sounds like you have had 2 done, but we've only heard the results of the first one, right? Getting a biopsy is not something you want to do, like getting a simple test, unless it is really called for. And I'm not saying that just because of the pain and possible infection. Thanks for the reply I will try to be clear. I have had two rectal exams by the colonoscopy specialist who both said my prostate felt inflamed so my psa was done 10 minutes after! He then said he will tell my doctor to refer me to a urologist. The urologist looked at the data and gave me antibiotics for a month and did another psa. I went back a month later and this urologist just listened to my symptoms and said do you want a TRUS as you PSA is marginally high at 2.4. So I am a bit confused as nothing has been clear and both urologist did not do a dre! I think on Monday I will call up and get a clear answer. Please explain why I should not have a biopsy.",
