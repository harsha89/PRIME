So the biopsy killed me and came here, gleason (who is this gleason guy anyway) 3+4 T1C and then doc said dont worry all good we just use the robot surgery, but first a pelvic scan or whatever it was, which was also killing me because id thought cancer was out and i didnt want to take it. So i came here and this person called HighlanderCFH gave me some nice words and told me to man up and do all exams so thats what i did. I promised to get back with the results so here i am, all good, no problem, ready for the surgery in 15 days. Im not sure if the waiting will kill me first, but i just wanted to say thanks, really thanks, i am now in god's hands, and also doc's hands too, so as a believer, i just expect to make a good comeback and start seeing life from another point of view.

      "Content": "Mr Highlander I appreciate your help, now im worried why the doc said 2 sides, maybe i didnt understand good since i was just complaining when he was explaining. But i double checked and its T1C and psa no more than 8. Now that you say that cancer is in the prostate (something the doc also mentioned) ok maybe that could be and im just being paranoic. One last questions, since im stil not that old to meet jesus (next year i was expecting to become 60), why does everybody sound so optimistic? My doc, my girls, you (that dont even know me), all say theres solution, inside the prostate, outside the prostate, in the bones, not in the bones, because my numbers are not that bad. When they say they are good, does that mean i might see the man landing on the moon again or not that good? thank you for your time stranger, this is like my first time on a internet forum right after my girls said i should read more about others experience, been strange so far, but not regreting it, at least im not figthing this time hah",

I was diagnosed a t2c 3+4 if i recall good and soon i have to take the pelvic scan to check if theres any cancer there. Doctor said its just a normal procedure and that i shouldnt worry, that everything should be just fine before surgery with a robot, and this is a normal procedure. Im actually terrified because the doc sounded really , how to say, like if this werent a big deal, so in a few days im having this exam then results. What could i expect? 60 years old, t2c 3+4, both sides, found in 15% of the biopsy. Im really sorry for my english but i will do my best to answer questions regards luis",

To be honest im really dumb with numbers because i hate to read exams over and over but i just did because im old and paranoid but yes it is t1c and no more than 8. For the bone scan they said they will inject me something to make clear images, myself being a farmer, you know we dont really like too much numbers and explanatios because we only know how to work the land. My girls looked for a doctor that has made hundreds of surgerys with that robot or whatever it is (because i said i dont want to the be the rabbit this time) and the doctor is confident, maybe the one not being confident here is me because this is chinese to me but i know cancer is one evil enemy so i respect it.

      "Content": "Mr Highlander I appreciate your help, now im worried why the doc said 2 sides, maybe i didnt understand good since i was just complaining when he was explaining. But i double checked and its T1C and psa no more than 8. Now that you say that cancer is in the prostate (something the doc also mentioned) ok maybe that could be and im just being paranoic. One last questions, since im stil not that old to meet jesus (next year i was expecting to become 60), why does everybody sound so optimistic? My doc, my girls, you (that dont even know me), all say theres solution, inside the prostate, outside the prostate, in the bones, not in the bones, because my numbers are not that bad. When they say they are good, does that mean i might see the man landing on the moon again or not that good? thank you for your time stranger, this is like my first time on a internet forum right after my girls said i should read more about others experience, been strange so far, but not regreting it, at least im not figthing this time hah",
