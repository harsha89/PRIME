      "Content": "Hello everyone. My father just got diagnosed with PC on 3/17/15 after a biopsy. The very next day he went in for abdomen/pelvic CT and entire body bone scan, we didn't want to wait a second to get the staging process started. We are supposed to receive the test results back tomorrow to learn what stage is his cancer. I am out of my mind worried as I am reading the information given to me and not retaining or comprehending any of it. I thought maybe coming here and having things explained in layman terms could be helpful to prepare to meet with the doctor tomorrow. My daddy is 59 yrs old and has history of PC - his father died from PC complications to his lungs. Daddy is in really good health, he works a physically demanding job, his only other health issue is high blood pressure which is being managed, and other than elevated PSA he has not experienced any \"symptoms\". Due to the PC history in his family combined with elevated psa, doctor recommended a biopsy. A 12 pt biopsy was done, this is the diagnosis; I see an 8, 9 Gleason and one part on the prostate graph doesn't even have a score just says ASAP ( 1. Benign prostatic tissue 2. Right medial Mid: Prostatic adenocarcenoma, Gleason score 6 (3+3), involving aproximately 10% of the 15mm biopsy core 3. Right medial apex: Prostatic adenocarcenoma, Gleason score 6 (3+3), involving aproximately 3% of the 14mm biopsy core 4. Right lateral base: Prostatic tissue with a small focus of atypical glands, highly suspicious for carcinoma (this is the area marked ASAP 5. Right lateral mid: Prostatic adenocarcenoma, Gleason score 7 (3+4), discontinuously involving aproximately 15% of the 15mm biopsy core 6. Right lateral apex: benign 7. Left medial base: benign 8. Left medial mid: Prostatic adenocarcenoma, Gleason score 7 (3+4), discontinuously involving aproximately 25% of the 17mm biopsy core 9. Left medial apex: benign 10. Left lateral base: Prostatic adenocarcenoma, Gleason score 9 (4+5), discontinuously involving aproximately 60% of the 14mm biopsy core 11. Left lateral mid: Prostatic adenocarcenoma, Gleason score 8 (4+4), involving aproximately 20% of the 15mm biopsy core 12. Left lateral apex: Prostatic adenocarcenoma, Gleason score 6 (3+3), discontinuously involving aproximately 70% of the 14mm biopsy core From what I have read so far about Gleason scores, this is not at all good news, this is advanced stage, no? Like stage 3 or 4 cancer? Daddy's PSA has been elevated over the last 2 years between 4 and 6. I don't know how to make sense of this, do I go into this meeting tomorrow prepared to hear my dad has t3 or t4 advanced stage cancer? Or does the fact that his PSA is not through the roof still speak volumes about his stage? Do we walk in there with hope that \"we still caught it early enough\"? Or do we need to start using that 3.5yr/5yr mark as our new reality? I am so confused. Have any of you had the same test results as my dad? What questions do you wish you had asked your doctor at the time he was informing you of your cancer stage? I have millions of questions in my head but cannot verbalize a single one to ask the doctor tomorrow... My dad doesn't speak English well and he relies on my help through this process, and I... I am falling apart and I am scared that I won't ask the right questions to help him tomorrow. What questions would you ask? Thank you kindly for your time",

Due to the PC history in his family combined with elevated psa, doctor recommended a biopsy. A 12 pt biopsy was done, this is the diagnosis; I see an 8, 9 Gleason and one part on the prostate graph doesn't even have a score just says ASAP ( 1. Benign prostatic tissue 2. Right medial Mid: Prostatic adenocarcenoma, Gleason score 6 (3+3), involving aproximately 10% of the 15mm biopsy core 3. Right medial apex: Prostatic adenocarcenoma, Gleason score 6 (3+3), involving aproximately 3% of the 14mm biopsy core 4. Right lateral base: Prostatic tissue with a small focus of atypical glands, highly suspicious for carcinoma (this is the area marked ASAP 5. Right lateral mid: Prostatic adenocarcenoma, Gleason score 7 (3+4), discontinuously involving aproximately 15% of the 15mm biopsy core 6. Right lateral apex: benign 7. Left medial base: benign 8. Left medial mid: Prostatic adenocarcenoma, Gleason score 7 (3+4), discontinuously involving aproximately 25% of the 17mm biopsy core 9. Left medial apex: benign 10. Left lateral base: Prostatic adenocarcenoma, Gleason score 9 (4+5), discontinuously involving aproximately 60% of the 14mm biopsy core 11. Left lateral mid: Prostatic adenocarcenoma, Gleason score 8 (4+4), involving aproximately 20% of the 15mm biopsy core 12. Left lateral apex: Prostatic adenocarcenoma, Gleason score 6 (3+3), discontinuously involving aproximately 70% of the 14mm biopsy core From what I have read so far about Gleason scores, this is not at all good news, this is advanced stage, no? Like stage 3 or 4 cancer? Daddy's PSA has been elevated over the last 2 years between 4 and 6. I don't know how to make sense of this, do I go into this meeting tomorrow prepared to hear my dad has t3 or t4 advanced stage cancer? Or does the fact that his PSA is not through the roof still speak volumes about his stage? Do we walk in there with hope that \"we still caught it early enough\"? Or do we need to start using that 3.5yr/5yr mark as our new reality? I am so confused. Have any of you had the same test results as my dad? What questions do you wish you had asked your doctor at the time he was informing you of your cancer stage? I have millions of questions in my head but cannot verbalize a single one to ask the doctor tomorrow... My dad doesn't speak English well and he relies on my help through this process, and I... I am falling apart and I am scared that I won't ask the right questions to help him tomorrow. What questions would you ask? Thank you kindly for your time",

      "Content": "Hello everyone, This community has been very kind to me following my father\u0092s diagnosis and surgery 2 years ago. I hope to receive some of your guidance again. Daddy is, thank God, still in the zero club. Robotic surgery was over 2 years ago. My dad has this rash that appears on his groin every 4months or so, accompanied by fever and shivers. His PCP prescribes him antibiotics and it clears up in about 48hrs. Says PCP told him that it\u0092s due to drainage from prostate surgery accumulating... (A few months after surgery, my dad had a very neglected abcess in his abdomen that almost killed him because it was misdiagnosed as diverticulitis. Can\u0092t honestly remember the diagnosis, something about drainage from his lymph nodes after surgery) I didn\u0092t realize until today that this happens to him so often, I thought it was a thing in the past I was wondering if anyone else has experienced this following their surgery? I am worried that it is happening so often and so long after the surgery Are we looking at another \u0093corrective\u0094 surgery? Your insight is very much appreciated",
