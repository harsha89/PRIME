      "Content": "I don't have any questions, answers, or words of wisdom, just need a little support. I posted here a month ago or so. My husband at that time was a Gleason 5+3=8. Right: 4 cores of 6 positive, 25% involved by tumor. Left: 3 cores of 6 positive, 2.0% involved by tumor. Prostate size 75 grams.. Bone scan and CT were negative. Da Vinci surgery on Nov 23. Final Path; 1) Left peripheral margin, biopsy; positive 2)Apical margin, positive 3) Posterior apical margin, negative 4) Left peripheral margin, negative, 5) apical margin, negative 6) prostate gland, Adenocarcinoma, Gleason score 4+5=9. Tumor quantification; right and left lobes, percentage of prostate involved by tumor 80% Extraprostatic extension: present. Seminal vesicle invasion: present, right and left Margins: Focally positive for malignancy (apical, bladder neck, anterior lateral) 7)Right lateral biopsy: negative Lymph nodes, (4) right pelvic, 1 node positive (3.8 MM) 9)Lymph nodes, (7) left pelvic, 4 nodes positive (largest focus 10MM) Prostate size 82 grams. Pathologic staging: pT3b pN1 We are in for a battle! We have not made a plan written in stone just yet. We will wait for husband's body to heal and for a 3 month PSA to really develop the plan. Dr said with this path. report, he doubts that his PSA will be 0 in three months. He will more then likely will be starting ADT. Words of encouragement needed!",
