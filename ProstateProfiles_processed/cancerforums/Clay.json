    "Content": "Greetings. I just got my annual PSA test back. Went from 0.9 to 8.8. That's not a typo. I asked my doctor if it could be some kind of mistake and he said the lab double-checked and got the same result. I am symptom free and I had a clean digital exam a few months before the PSA test. I didn't do anything before the test (sex, bike-riding) that is known to change the result. Any idea what could cause this? Thanks!",
