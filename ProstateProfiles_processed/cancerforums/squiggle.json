      "Content": "Thank you so much for your detailed reply Replicant very helpful and informative and thank you too Bravehardon, thats exactly how Dad feels. He had been told there were clear margins post surgery. His PSA has slowly been going up since surgery, 6 months ago it was 0.04 and now 0.18. At least his surgeon was on the ball on Monday suggesting radiation now rather then letting it get any higher. He met with the radiologist today and found her very informative, open and understanding spent about an hour discussing the treatment and feels more positive. It didnt help that yesterday he learned his last sibling had terminal lung c/a. But his radiologist said he should stick to his routine playing golf etc and radiation times can be set around his schedule and also that it shouldn't affect him having his grandchildren around. So now he just has to have bone scan MRI and mapping possibly done in first week of January. He feels better knowing that he can be independent hates to be mollycoddled. He did ask what would happen if this didnt work and was told that this is plan A and there are about another 5 or 6 plans.",

      "Content": "Hi advice wanted My dad's cancer has recurred any my family naturally are devastated. Though I knew it would happen as his level was considered to be gleason 7 (4+3) stage 2c pre surgery but was revised to gleason 9 (5+4) on examination of operative samples. It was considered to be very aggresive at the time. Post operatively he had levels of 0,01 doubling to 0.02, and continuing to double until 18month post op level was 0,18 He has been referred to radiology, he is 70 and scared and angry as he feels that it wasnt all removed. What can I do to help him? He is worried that it has spread and where it has gone along with the side effects of radiology 5 days per week for 7 weeks testing in Jan start Feb. What are possible side effects? Where could it have spread to? Will he be able to drive to treatments or will it tire him out? What is life expectancy post radiology? Can he be around his grand children during 7 weeks of radiology? What did you find useful being done for you by your family. Any advice/ suggestions or bare fact reality welcomed. I was a nurse years ago but never in this area so all advice/experience welcome. Plain spoken truth welcome as I need to know facts as I am his go to for advice and I need to be ready. I am trawling relevent sites on internet for advice Thanks in advance for any advice offered",
