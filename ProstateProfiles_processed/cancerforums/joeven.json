My PSA dropped from 893 to 0.08 when last tested, I did change my life style no alcohol, any sweets as cancer loves sugar, red meat maybe a couple of times a month.

      "Content": "Hi everyone I am half way through my forth chemo session, my last one was a bit hair raising as my Tempreture went up to 38.3 after a hospital visit they told me I had neptrippena very low white cell count after three days and lots of tests and medication I was released. My chemo has been reduced by 20% as a result of the hospital visit, since then I ve had my forth chemo but my Tempreture is always around 36.1 or 36.2 it does get higher through the day but only to about 36.6/7 does anyone else have this problem ? I feel fine and maybe because of the reduced chemo I am more active except for the stomach pains and shoulder pains so if anyone knows please let me know. Thanks",

      "Content": "Hi everyone I live in Manchester England. Some on here know me, but a quick ruin down. Diagnosed in July 2016 Gleason 9 stage T4 PSA 893. I was offered because of my condition a choice of two trials, After a lot of research I choose Stampede, fortunately I was not on the watching group. I had lots of tests blood, scans, x-Ray etc, I had metastistic in my bones, shoulder, ribs, pelvis. At the start I was given hormone tablets followed by a monthly injection, I had a bout of breathing problems which at one point I thought this is it, taken to A and E given lots of tests and scans, I was given a blood thinning injection which helped, a couple of days later breathing better, I put it down to stress and hormone injection. Struggling with my shoulder I had a cortisone injection helped a bit, but I managed to get radiotherapy just one session, that helped a lot, although later it burnt under my arm but steroid cream helped heal it, still have a problem with it but tolerable. I trawled the net checking on anything that would help me, I changed my eating habits stopped drinking only drank pomegranate, orange juice and water, then I read about how different supplements could help, the main being pomi-t which can take up to six months to work into your system then there is omega 3, garlic, b12, turmeric, green tea, pomegranate and grape seed extract, all of which are good for the prostate, how much they work is another thing. My PSA started to tumble going down in a couple of months to single digits, by this time I was put on Prostap 3, three monthly injections, my next attack on this desease was with chemotherapy docetaxel, six sessions every three weeks, the first was an eye opener, two days nothing I thought what was all the fuss about, then wham every bone in my body for 8/10 hours felt like it was on fire, it knocked the stuffing out of me fatigue, tired, wow. All this time lots of loo trips and mega hot flushes, sleep was a thing of the past. Every chemo session I had my blood checked my PSA still kept falling, then on the third session my Tempreture went up to 38.2 you are told to take your Tempreture twice daily and I kept a record of mine,went to hospital, again the tests seems I had neptrippena and a small virus, I stayed there for three days, given drips tablets, and monitored and tested regularly, bit frightening but I was in good hands. After that I had a discussion with my consultant who dropped my dosage by twenty per cent to avoid another episode, I got used to the chemo, although developed tingly fingers and feet and scratchy eyes lost a lot of hair, minor problem, weak and had chemo brain, short term memory loss, which has got better now. I finished the chemotherapy in January. My PSA had dropped to 0.08, I had a little time to recover then beginning of March I started my radiotherapy, twenty sessions over four weeks, I finished the last one yesterday March 31st, in that time I have had at the moment two bad days, we're getting to the toilet was imperative about fifty or more times on both occasions. While all this was going on I had my heart checked as I suffered a lot of chest pain, seems I had acid reflux and was told to avoid certain drinks, I got some Meds for that and also for the hot flushes which both have helped. At the moment I still suffer with my shoulder the most rib pain not bad, back more like a bad back which I hope to have some sort of treatment on radiotherapy or whatever else can be done,eyes better, hands slowly getting better although I get tingly fingers ( pins and needles as we say here ) feet still feel like some one has sown a leather strap on them, not as strong as I used to be, still have the odd bout of breathing problems which I seem strangely concerned about as I used to breath through both nostrils but now which ever way I lie say on the left I breath through the right nostril and vice versa, had everything checked all ok. Hope to start excersise in a few weeks when the effects have worn off from the radiotherapy, do a bit of walking but get tired quickly if I over do it. Had my bloods taken this week, as I suffer from gout and borderline diabeties plus check my liver etc, all good even my PSA is down to 0.07 not much but surprises me as after radiotherapy it can spike. As quality of life goes the last nine months have not been the best, I am hoping that in the future, ( as I plan to be about to get my hard earned pension next month ) I will be more mobile and get a holiday, as my loving wife who constantly worries about me just going shopping, let alone any household chores,deserves a break. This was not everything side effects on chemo I was not lucky with, radiotherapy was better. If this helps anyone of what to expect great.",

Six sessions of docetaxel, followed by twenty sessions of radiotherapy, with three monthly hormone injections of Prostap. It seems the hormone injection has weakened my back they did an X-ray to make sure no involvement with PC. I had pains every so often from the shoulder to the neck and have had a scan of that area with no sign of cancer, the next step there is to have an endoscopy. My PSA is done every three months by the hospital plus I also get the doctors to check it every six months as I have gout and borderline diabeties, they all show the PSA down before this one it was 0.07, now it's 0.04, I suffer from a few side effects still my back, hot flushes, acid reflux, the odd headache, like rhumitism in my hands, and feet still like they've got a leather skin sown on them, lots of toilet visits, tiredness and muscle fatigue. But Iam still fighting this dammed thing and will do as long as I can. Joe",

It has been used-with people who are on the Stampede trial and the results are very positive, I do not know if this is yet trialed in America as I live in England, but for us advanced PC with metastistic it could be one of the most important finds.

      "Content": "Originally Posted by ChemoMan Hi You have what we in the lymphoma forum call \"the noise\". This is the little voice in your head that says \"cancer\" every time you feel something out of the ordinary. It gets loudest at around two years after treatment. Chances are you are suffering longterm side effects from the chemo. That stuff is really toxic and quite capable of producing those symptoms. As always if you are really concerned you should talk it over with your doctor. Chances are that something else could be at play and a doctor can investigate that for you. Congratulations on achieving NED...long may it last Hi I have a number of side effects still going on the latest being some type of arthritis in my fingers, whenever something new happens I am at the docs, for this I am seeing people who specialise in finding out if it is arthritis and how to proceed. My main thing is staying away from sugar sweets etc I have one lolly every so often that's as near as I get, i am partial to spicy food but try to limit that as I have acid reflux anther side effect. I am very easy going and I would be a liar if I said maybe twice a day I get depressed but only for a minute and that's the hormone doing that. Being on a Stampede trial I am monitored every three months, they always ask me about quality of life, which I give not great scores to as I have a number of things going on, hoping to get a chest X-ray see if any things happening and another back X-ray as Iam only 65 and thought I should be making in roads to this back pain. So keep you informed. Joe",

      "Content": "Hi everyone Been a while since I ve been on, my question to any one who knows, has electricity been used as a cure for PC in any form, if so do they know the results and what were the findings ? I had a X-ray on my back was giving me more pain than usual and was told I had it in my spine and pelvis, went for my blood check up a few days ago told them and they said it was in most of my bones from the early scan when diagnosed 20 months ago, at the time I was only told it was in my shoulder which I had RT on and my upper rib. To say I was taken back was an understatement, I go for an MRI tonight on my back see if there's any damage. My PSA is still very low at 0.07 a slight rise from 0.04 with all my organs still in good shape although liver very slightly higher but still within normal range. Thanks for looking if you have any info would be grateful Joe",

My wife had time out looking after me while I had the chemo as everyone knows it can hit you like a brick and some times you need some one there to stop you doing things you thought were easy before, not now. My wife ( bless her, ) is back part time but constantly texts me checking how I am doing it's very very hard on her. We'll see my specialist about my radiotherapy this Friday so if anyone knows some questions to throw at him just let me know, thank you.",
