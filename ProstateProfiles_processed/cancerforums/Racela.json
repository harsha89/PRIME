I agree with neutronbob that Zytiga is way over priced and any study that gives me 4 months over a sugar pill does not give me a warm and fuzzy feeling. Also this becomes a cost issue if it falls under part D medicare drugs instead of part B.If you have already gone the homone therapy route I am not sure if this will do much for you.

I am now signing up for a phase two study of XL184, it shows promise of actually getting into the bones and improving scan results and Alk Phos, which is funny as I have been following Alk-phos for over a year.
