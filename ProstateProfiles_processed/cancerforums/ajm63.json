      "Content": "Thanks for all of the info. Much appreciated. I didn't mean to imply that I was in a rush to get treatment. That said, with my current work schedule and upcoming travel commitments the end of the year would be best time for surgery (if I opt for that route), but as many of you have mentioned I can likely take another year to decide on treatment without any change in long term prognosis. I am in SoCal and have standard HMO insurance. Pretty good treatment options in the area but I will likely choose to work within the restrictions of my insurance. The urologist I was referred to is very experienced and has performed well over 500 open surgeries (about 30 to 40 a year). Still I wouldn't let him touch me unless I feel fully confident on his capabilities. Problem of course is that there are no guarantees - even the best surgeons have bad days and the worst still have long lists of satisfied clients they can direct you to. He is very reasonable and letting me decide on what to do (no pressure at all) and if I choose robotic will refer me to a robotic specialist, or a radiation oncologist if I choose that path. I'll have to discuss some of the other options like Targeted Focal Therapy, which didn't come up - of course my last visit was when I got the bad news so I wasn't quite all there when options were discussed. I haven't really seriously been considering radiation for a couple reasons. I am not real comfortable with radiation (don't know where that hang up is coming from) and I am interested in a 30 year solution to the problem (one can always hope) and I haven't found any literature documenting the effectiveness of radiation over this time period. I have read posts in this forum with guys at a similar age to me opting for brachytherapy that been very satisfied with the results. I have also read about possible recurrence when using radiation and that surgery is very difficult after radiation. I imagine that radiation treatments available today are more advanced that those used in some of the 5 yr old papers I read. Anyone have a strong or negative positive opinion about radiation treatment in a 51 year old? I'll definitely take another look at this option. I'll look more into the second opinion on the pathology report - had thought too much on it with 5/12 positive although it probably would be a good idea to confirm the G3+3. Regarding Open versus Robotic surgery - I have read a few white papers and what I have gathered is that the skill of the surgeon is the most important factor and that the only advantage to robotic is reduced recovery time. Incontinence and ED issues seem to be similar with both techniques and at least one paper had a slight (probably statistically insignificant) edge to open in these regards. Any other ideas on this? Thanks again for all the info. I'll definitely post my final decision and hopefully excellent results.",

      "Content": "Hello all. This is my first post. I am 51 and have recently been diagnosed with PCa. Vital stats are as follows: 3/09 PSA 2.2 4/10 PSA 3.1 no PSA in 2011 to 2013 tests as testing age changed. 5/1/14 PSA 4.7 6//26/14 PSA 6/free PSA 7% (Different assay method than previous PSA tests) Biopsy 10/14 5 of 12 cores positive, both sides (<5% on 2, 5% on 2, 10 % on 1), 2 cores ASAP, G 3+3= 6 on all cores Some family history (grandfather - had late stage prostate cancer when he passed but did not die from it, cousin - surgery in mid 50's, cousin - very low grade identified in early 60's during another procedure - AS) I have been doing quite a bit of research since the 7% free PSA test in June and have come down to surgery (open or robotic) or AS. From what I can tell I fit most of the AS criteria except for the fact that 5 cores were positive. Therefore, I have come to the conclusion that given that I am 51, the cancer will likely become a problem down the road, so I might as well deal with it now while the long term prognosis is best. Therefore, I am leaning heavily towards surgery in the near future. Am I missing something? I have discounted radiation because I would rather save that option for later if the cancer comes back. Additionally, I have friend who had a recurrence a number or years after the seed implants (problem was fixed again but still.) Anyway, I have found the posts here quite useful, and would welcome any other advise. Thanks in advance.",
