      "Content": "Much thanks to Highlander, ASAdvocate, and ddayglo for well-considered input. I did receive the 2 pathology reports upon my request even though they were marked This result is not viewable by the patient (which may just mean they were not to be put up on the mychart system). 1st biopsy 1/15/13 OF 12 CORES 1 in right side HGPIN 4 in right benign but inflamed; 1 benign Exactly same in left 2nd biopsy 3/15/16 No HGPIN, but inflammation and atrophic changes in 6, some \u201cfocal chronic inflammation or focal acute and chronic inflammation. 6 benign Uro says HGPIN from 1st biopsy probably still there somewhere needle didn't go in 2nd biopsy. My plan is evolving to; - ask for another PSA test once my prostate recovers from the recent biopsy - push for a free PSA test - inquire about a 3T MRI scan but I suspect this may only be available after a PCa diagnosis. Dana Farber in Boston has a good machine. - consider getting a 2nd opinion on my slides from Dr. Epstein (may have to pay the $300 myself but maybe Medicare will pay) - moderate life style changes such as more soy (edamame), tomato sauce, fish, chicken, exercise. I like these anyway. Less refined grains, sugar, red meat etc. Thanks again for the responses.",

      "Content": "This is my first post. I do not have a dx (yet), but I am really grateful to all those that have come before me and contributed all the knowledge and kind comments that these forums contain. I knew practically nothing about PCa until I started doing the research when I was scheduled for a 2nd biopsy after rising PSA and high PCA3. Dr. Walsh\u0092s book is very helpful too so thanks for that suggestion. Cancer is a terrible, devious disease and is a formidable foe to the best scientists, doctors, and patients. Progress is being made, but it seems to take forever, in spite of the billions of dollars spent every year. I was disappointed that I never hear of fund raisers or advertising regarding prostate cancer like some of the other cancers and diseases. Anyway, I was motivated to make a large contribution to the Prostate Cancer Foundation. It seems the newest research they help fund is the frontier of cures and treatments \u0096 immunology and gene splicing. After a rising PSA to 5.2 and suspicious DRE in 2013, the first biopsy revealed no cancer but some atypical cells or HGPIN. PSA went down a bit but began to rise in 2015 to 6.8. DRE was negative this time. PCA3 was 45 \u0096 high risk for cancer and potential for aggressive cancer. 2nd 12 core biopsy a week ago revealed no cancer but inflammation. Good news all around; I thought rising PSA may have been from inflammation and would go down. But when I got home and checked Dr Walsh\u0092s book etc, it turns out not all inflammations are the same. In the prostate, they often lead to HGPIN and then PCa, sometimes of the aggressive variety. Uro wants to track me due to concern of high numbers; so come back in 6 months. She said since my biopsy came back clean, there is no need for a 2nd pathologist to view it; her lab always has 2 of them look at each sample anyway. This makes sense to me. Now I am thinking \u0096 is this smart? I don\u0092t mind some form of active surveillance, but I certainly don\u0092t want to let a potentially aggressive cancer get a strong foothold. If in the very tiny area of my enlarged (100g) prostate they found potentially precancerous cells on both biopsies, isn\u0092t it possible or likely that somewhere else the needle didn\u0092t sample there is cancer? Here is where I can use some advice 1. my uro is very good but doesn\u0092t tell me a lot of what she is seeing or thinking. I think I should ask her for a copy of the pathology reports from both biopsies. Do uro\u0092s usually provide them to patients? I would also like to ask her what her overall assessment of me is and what her plans are. 2. why doesn\u0092t she give me more screening tests like the newer 4K, latest MRI, etc. I asked her about free PSA and she said that doesn\u0092t add any value. Now that I am post-biopsy, I know that changes the thinking some since most testing is done to determine if a biopsy is warranted. If she is concerned about insurance (Medicare and supplemental) and cost of testing, I can go out of pocket for the peace of mind.",

      "Content": "Lymphoedema If the cancer spreads to the lymph nodes it could lead to a condition called lymphoedema \u2013 caused by a blockage in the lymphatic system. The lymphatic system is part of your body\u2019s immune system, carrying fluid called lymph, around your body. If it is blocked, the fluid can build up and cause swelling (lymphoedema). Cancer itself can cause the blockage, but so can some treatments such as surgery or radiotherapy. Lymphoedema in prostate cancer usually affects the legs, but it can affect other areas, including the penis or scrotum (which contains the testicles). Symptoms in the affected area can include: swelling pain, discomfort or heaviness inflammation, redness or infection tight, sore skin. Lymphoedema can affect your daily life. You might find that you are less able to move around and it\u2019s harder to carry out everyday tasks. Some men find it knocks their confidence. IT IS HUGELY MIS-SHAPEN AND SWOLLEN; VERY OBVIOUS - SO PROBABLY NOT WHAT YOUR FRIEND HAS. NOT VERY COMMON; I HAVEN'T SEEN IT MENTIONED ON THIS FORUM.",
