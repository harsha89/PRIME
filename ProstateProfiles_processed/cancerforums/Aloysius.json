You can now ease your mind sime by knowing you can decide to treat it should it at any time indicate progression or higher gleason grade discovered on future biopsy. Thanks. Met with Dr. slipperyfinger today. Confirmed watchful waiting path...return for PSA in 2 months. Gonna address oversized prostate (125cc) with a combination of diet and medication. Surprisingly, I don't have serious affects from enlarged prostate. but it limits my options. I take Effexor. There's a rare but potentially severe side effect of the medication...prostatitis and/or enlarged prostate. Gotta talk with my shrink about this issue. Al",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by LIBMRDUCKS Hi Aloysius, sorry I do not have for sure answer for you, but I'm guessing that parts f,h, and i are a poor attempt to describe the 3 cores that are positive. Part (f) is the (LA) core, Part (h) is the (RM) core, and Part (i) is the (RA) core. I have never seen the \"ERG POSITIVE\" or \"PTEN\". It is possible the pathologist trained outside the U.S. or Canada and these are interpretative of his language. I would get a 2nd opinion from a different pathologist and see if the terminology clears things up, for all of us that stumped. I wish you the best of luck. Rob I have since found out those are related to genetic markers. New technology. Went to the radiation oncologist yesterday. Explained it. Leaning towards watchful waiting. Thanks for the replies.",

You can now ease your mind sime by knowing you can decide to treat it should it at any time indicate progression or higher gleason grade discovered on future biopsy. Thanks. Met with Dr. slipperyfinger today. Confirmed watchful waiting path...return for PSA in 2 months. Gonna address oversized prostate (125cc) with a combination of diet and medication. Surprisingly, I don't have serious affects from enlarged prostate. but it limits my options. I take Effexor. There's a rare but potentially severe side effect of the medication...prostatitis and/or enlarged prostate. Gotta talk with my shrink about this issue. Al",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by LIBMRDUCKS Hi Aloysius, sorry I do not have for sure answer for you, but I'm guessing that parts f,h, and i are a poor attempt to describe the 3 cores that are positive. Part (f) is the (LA) core, Part (h) is the (RM) core, and Part (i) is the (RA) core. I have never seen the \"ERG POSITIVE\" or \"PTEN\". It is possible the pathologist trained outside the U.S. or Canada and these are interpretative of his language. I would get a 2nd opinion from a different pathologist and see if the terminology clears things up, for all of us that stumped. I wish you the best of luck. Rob I have since found out those are related to genetic markers. New technology. Went to the radiation oncologist yesterday. Explained it. Leaning towards watchful waiting. Thanks for the replies.",

Well, that's easy for them to say, isn't it?? I leak a couple pints a day, and I THINK it's getting better........but not fast enough. Depends (not the diapers) work great..I swear one will hold a 6 pack. I'm also trying medication for overactive bladder. Try to avoid irritants like caffeine and alcohol. We lost one sphincter with the prostate which doesn't help. Without the restriction of an oversized prostate, plus the loss of one sphincter, some of us have problems. Do your exercises, cut back on irritants, it will improve....or so I'm told.",

      "Content": "Regaining continence is a person by person situation. After 4 months, I'm still not anywhere near continent..others have better results, and even worse results. I've been taking Myrbetriq for overactive bladder, and it seems to help. Before starting it, I believe I could pee on the ceiling..now, just to the top of the door. Just too much pressure. I can't cough or lift anything without an issue. I had a huge 130g prostate which restricted flow for years. Bladder became a world class athlete to overcome restriction. Now, bladder just merrily does its thing with no restriction. Kegels helped with normal retention, but \"urge incontinency\" still remains. Real frustrating. I've gone from 6 pads to 2-3 daily, IF I don't cough or pick up anything heavy. Walking makes the situation worse, as does vibration from riding the mower, or going out fishing in the ocean.",

      "Content": "Like Highlander, I had a huge prostate...130 gms. After 4 months, I still have incontinence issues. Recently I started on a bladder control medication..Myrbetriq. My local doc said that since the bladder is a muscle, it builds up strength to force drainage through an oversize, restrictive prostate. After surgery I think I could pee on the ceiling. As such, It's often difficult for the remaining \"shut-off\" valve to work effectively with such overwhelming pressure from the bladder. The first couple months were miserable...the control circuits still worked, but shut-off was ineffective. Recently, I've gotten significantly better. Why? Exercise, time, Myrbetriq? Dunno. After surgery I was pretty pissed off (oops, Freudian slip?) Everyone says \"it will get better\". Great. Easy for YOU to say...you're not peeing down your leg. Well, it IS getting better, but I'm pretty impatient. However, I've got a client with a good attitude. He asked me what I had for breakfast..\"ham sandwich\". Beer after dinner? \"hell yes\". did I enjoy them? \"you bet\". Well, if I hadn't had surgery, I eventually wouldn't be enjoying those, would I? Hmmm...he's gotta point. A competent surgeon retains the nerves which control incontinence and impotency. As undesirable as it sounds, time (sometimes a lot of time) does seem to allow these functions to return.",

      "Content": "Like Highlander, I had a huge prostate...130 gms. After 4 months, I still have incontinence issues. Recently I started on a bladder control medication..Myrbetriq. My local doc said that since the bladder is a muscle, it builds up strength to force drainage through an oversize, restrictive prostate. After surgery I think I could pee on the ceiling. As such, It's often difficult for the remaining \"shut-off\" valve to work effectively with such overwhelming pressure from the bladder. The first couple months were miserable...the control circuits still worked, but shut-off was ineffective. Recently, I've gotten significantly better. Why? Exercise, time, Myrbetriq? Dunno. After surgery I was pretty pissed off (oops, Freudian slip?) Everyone says \"it will get better\". Great. Easy for YOU to say...you're not peeing down your leg. Well, it IS getting better, but I'm pretty impatient. However, I've got a client with a good attitude. He asked me what I had for breakfast..\"ham sandwich\". Beer after dinner? \"hell yes\". did I enjoy them? \"you bet\". Well, if I hadn't had surgery, I eventually wouldn't be enjoying those, would I? Hmmm...he's gotta point. A competent surgeon retains the nerves which control incontinence and impotency. As undesirable as it sounds, time (sometimes a lot of time) does seem to allow these functions to return.",
