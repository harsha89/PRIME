      "Content": "None of us have a magic word for you. What we do have is lots of empathy and understanding. Yeah, I know....that is nice for about as long as it takes you to read it. What I might offer as words to use as you mentally struggle with the inadequacy issues: (1) as you know, women are usually different in the sexual needs area than men. We are not far removed from the animal instincts in our genes; however, women usually seem to appreciate more of the intimacy - hugs, stroking, closeness. Whether you can perform or not, don't deprive her of that much. If you're anything like me, when I snuggle, I want more That's normal. If you both want more, then TOGETHER figure out how to scale that proverbial mountain. It may require thinking outside the box you have been comfortable in. I doubt anyone wants us to get too specific here, but if you look around the internet, I bet there is a plethora of details. If your wife is understanding, she will help. If she's not comfortable with that, then you may have to talk to her a few times before she'll consider what ever ideas you've come up with. I am not the authority, but my ED issues have been in my face for almost 2 years now and my wife has been awesome. We've figured out a way - when she's ready - how to be just as intimate as we were before. I'd be willing to bet there have been quite a few who've read your post but did not feel comfortable responding. Please understand that is pretty normal too. Don't be further discouraged by that. WE ALL HAVE TO FACE THIS ISSUE. Some for longer than others. I'm too new to it to offer much, but I encourage you to talk to your Urologist (and maybe your regular doctor, depends on whom you have a good relationship with). There are ways to help. When you get discouraged or in a depression, try to talk to yourself....out loud if it helps. But you can and should put all of this into perspective each time you feel down. You are alive. You are relatively healthy. You have a great wife. You live in a \"great country\" (okay, I couldn't help myself!). Look around. There are those much worse off. Try to count your blessings and then do something active, whether that is releasing some endorphins by exercising, working around the house/yard, visiting a neighbor/friend/relative, or volunteering. Maybe your wife or a friend can be a sounding board whenever needed to help you get re-started. Once you develop a mechanism to cope, I can assure you it gets easier. BTDT. Wish you the best. Let us know how you're doing. Richard",

      "Content": "I was diagnosed with PC on January 5th after a biopsy on Dec 28th that showed cancer in 10 of 12 core samples. I was advised to not consider Active Surveillance but undergo some kind of treatment. I've consulted with 2 surgeons, an IMRT and IMPT Radiation Oncologists. After doing a lot of reading here, seven books, many YouTube videos, etc., I have decided that FOR ME, the Intensity Modulated Proton \"Pencil\" Beam Therapy is best. I am fortunate to not only have Seattle Cancer Care Alliance nearby, but also a friend that is a Project Manager with Varian, a manufacturer of such equipment. I will be utilizing SpaceOAR hydrogel to protect the rectum. I have elected to start a hormone treatment (for 4-6 months), which will begin soon. The actual radiation treatment is expected to begin in March. I wanted to thank everyone on this forum. It has been my constant reading companion for many nights. I feel so indebted that I MUST do my part to be as much of a resource to those who will come after. You guys are awesome! Richard",
