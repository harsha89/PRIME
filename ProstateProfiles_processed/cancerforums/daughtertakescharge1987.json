    "Content": "Hi, I'm new to this forum (and forums in general) so forgive me if I'm doing this wrong -- my 65 year old father was just diagnosed with stage 4 metastatic prostate cancer, it has spread to lymphs and the bones in his left shoulder and forearm. He is pretty much computer illiterate so I have decided to take the reigns and do the research for him. His PSA levels were 1053.6 ng/mL which seems INSANELY high, and the doctors have him on Lupron depot every 6 months and have him scheduled to start chemo in August. He is also very poor and is on every government program for assistance that he has been able to qualify for. We are trying to be as hopeful and optimistic as possible, and not enough time has passed since starting treatment to see if it is having any effect, but I would like to know if anyone has been in a similar situation, or has any comments at all based on what little information I have provided. Im trying to stay positive and learn as much as I can but his situation is seeming pretty bleak. When I asked for the prognosis his oncologist mumbled something like \"it could be months or years\" and I really have no idea what that means. I know every patient is different but are we actually looking at a possibility of death in a few months? Any suggestions or advice or opinions or ANYTHING would be so so appreciated. Thank you all!",
