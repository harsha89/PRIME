      "Content": "Originally Posted by RobLee Hi Jeff, I'm sorry that you have to go thru this again, but you have your head on straight and your wife is on board with you, so you are already way ahead of most others going into this. A good sense of humor, a good support network, and the self confidence of having previously survived another cancer will all make your journey thru prostate cancer much easier. As others have noted, yours is currently a rather innocuous form of PCa, and you certainly do have time to wait and see if it progresses any further. I know that once you've had cancer, anything that hurts sends your mind into the \"is it coming back\" tailspin. So the best I can say at this point is, don't worry too much about it. But beware of taking it too lightly. My Urologist kept me in the dark for several years, during which time my cancer progressed to the point where it became \"very high risk\" and required multiple follow up procedures over the past eighteen months. In a significant number of cases, once the prostate has been removed and examined in the pathology lab, additional tumors are found, and in some cases worse or much worse. Fortunately your PSA is relatively low, though a bit on the high side given your age. BTW my wife was diagnosed with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma one year ago just before Christmas. It was a crazy time for us both, and very stressful for me as this happened right in the midst of my own cancer treatment. Additionally I became very concerned while she underwent R-CHOP as she started watching toxic online videos about how (as you mentioned) chemo would kill her rather than the cancer. We are both still bombarded by anecdotal tales of miracle cures and how we not only caused our own cancers by eating wrong, but can cured be by eating differently. In the end, she also required only six of eight infusions, plus - as she had spinal tumors, also had a radiation boost and needed spinal injections following each infusion. If you have the time you may want to read our blog linked at the bottom of my sig, or at least the first and last chapters. Yes, you can drive yourself nuts doing TOO much online research. Both my wife and I have really had to dial it back lately. If anything, our cancers have brought my wife and I even closer than ever. You are very fortunate to have a head start on your PCa and a very understanding wife. You are a champ for what you have been thru already and I'm sure you will breeze thru this one with flying colors. Good luck! I also did interthecal chemo for my lymphoma. That was not a great experience. Deciding to do the stem cell transplant is a lot like deciding which treatment to choose. I have looked at your blog, and I was inspired by your fight. You both are in my prayers. Jeff",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by RobLee Hi Jeff, I'm sorry that you have to go thru this again, but you have your head on straight and your wife is on board with you, so you are already way ahead of most others going into this. A good sense of humor, a good support network, and the self confidence of having previously survived another cancer will all make your journey thru prostate cancer much easier. As others have noted, yours is currently a rather innocuous form of PCa, and you certainly do have time to wait and see if it progresses any further. I know that once you've had cancer, anything that hurts sends your mind into the \"is it coming back\" tailspin. So the best I can say at this point is, don't worry too much about it. But beware of taking it too lightly. My Urologist kept me in the dark for several years, during which time my cancer progressed to the point where it became \"very high risk\" and required multiple follow up procedures over the past eighteen months. In a significant number of cases, once the prostate has been removed and examined in the pathology lab, additional tumors are found, and in some cases worse or much worse. Fortunately your PSA is relatively low, though a bit on the high side given your age. BTW my wife was diagnosed with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma one year ago just before Christmas. It was a crazy time for us both, and very stressful for me as this happened right in the midst of my own cancer treatment. Additionally I became very concerned while she underwent R-CHOP as she started watching toxic online videos about how (as you mentioned) chemo would kill her rather than the cancer. We are both still bombarded by anecdotal tales of miracle cures and how we not only caused our own cancers by eating wrong, but can cured be by eating differently. In the end, she also required only six of eight infusions, plus - as she had spinal tumors, also had a radiation boost and needed spinal injections following each infusion. If you have the time you may want to read our blog linked at the bottom of my sig, or at least the first and last chapters. Yes, you can drive yourself nuts doing TOO much online research. Both my wife and I have really had to dial it back lately. If anything, our cancers have brought my wife and I even closer than ever. You are very fortunate to have a head start on your PCa and a very understanding wife. You are a champ for what you have been thru already and I'm sure you will breeze thru this one with flying colors. Good luck! I also did interthecal chemo for my lymphoma. That was not a great experience. Deciding to do the stem cell transplant is a lot like deciding which treatment to choose. I have looked at your blog, and I was inspired by your fight. You both are in my prayers. Jeff",

      "Content": "Hi guys, I am 55, Diagnosed last week with prostate cancer. PSA in October was 6.2(that was after DRE), retested November was 5.4. went to urologist and he did biopsy. Only 1 of 12 had cancer showing in 40%. 2 others with abnormal cells. Gleason scor of 3+3. I am a non-hodgkins survivor 12 years out, so I have been through this before. However there was only chemo for me, no choices to be made. I am leaning towards surgery, but worried if the side effect. Have a friend who went through radiation 6 years ago, and swears by it. He said his doctor was very against surgery. Talked to another friend who did surgery and said he is back to normal and never considered radiation. I am an avid cyclist and would hope that I will still be 10 years from now. I still enjoy romance with my wife and am concerned about that. I read synopsis of the book 'the Big Scare' and that did nothing but scare me away from surgery. Any words of wisdom would be helpful.",
