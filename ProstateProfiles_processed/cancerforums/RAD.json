      "Content": "I had a terrible night with a Foley catheter after my biopsy, which is why I asked my surgeon about a supra pubic catheter instead. Said no problem. Some docs who will give you a supra pubic will still leave a Foley in for one day; mine says no need. The supra pubic has an external valve that you leave \"open\" for a few days for drainage, then you close to let your bladder fill, try to pee normally, and re-open the valve if you are unsuccessful. Apparently most guys are peeing normally and can leave the valve closed by the time it is removed 1 week post op. This my plan, unless during surgery my doc sees any reason not to go this way. Surgery 3/1/17. Bob",

I personally am unsure if I would want to or not but my \"T\" is so low I feel crappy all the time. Both of my surgeons (RP and implant) said I should go back on TRT. I also feel like crap. My G.P. will not prescribe anything for this. Thinks it's a mistake. My endocrinologist indicated earlier that he'd need to see about 3 years of undetectable PSAs before he would consider it. I don't know what to do. There are obviously some endo's who would do this.",

      "Content": "I was diagnosed with major depression about two years ago, and was prescribed bupropion. It was like a miracle. I never knew how dark the cloud was that I was living in until I was able to get out of it. Point is, I have medication to help me in my battle with depression, and it has been a great ally. I wouldn't say I am cured, the battle never really ends, but it is certainly easier to deal with with an ally at my side. Six years ago I lost my son to bipolar depression. He fell so far so fast that the medications he was prescribed only Seemed to soften his despair while crushing his mania and grinding him into a numb being. He fought hard, but eventually the fear and pain became too much. I don't bring this up for pity, but rather to address the seriousness of depression. It was painful to see him so sick; medication can't always \"fix everything\". Now I have been diagnosed with prostate cancer and am headed for surgery on March 1st. The issues of my current intermittent ED and the anxiety about future results have unleashed my depression to some extent, and I have just started with a counsellor. (And continue my medication). Having seen how depression has affected me in the past, and having watched how it can literally be a fatal illness, I'm determined to draw on whatever resources I can to help me through this passage. Counseling is helping, and additional meds may be in store. Talking to friends who have suffered with depression and with friends who have had prostate cancer helps me stay centered without going down mental rat holes that are hard to climb out of. I wish you the best in dealing with your depression and in reclaiming your old self. And in the event we can't adequately accomplish this, I hope we have the wisdom to accept the things we cannot change, and the courage to change the things we can. I picked that up in a drug rehab 35 years ago, and have sort of pulled it out of my back pocket from time to time as a \"cheat sheet\" to help me get through difficult situations. Recently I have sort of stepped inside of that saying, and am actually trying to live by it. I view things coming down the pike each day with a eye toward sorting them out according to whether or not I can change them. Any that land in the \"cannot change\" pile lose much of their power to bend my thoughts into twisted knots of guilt, fear, helplessness and hopelessness. They can still have that effect, but I have the power to -- with effort -- overcome them. Didn't mean to get preachy, but wanted to share a little of my journey and what has helped me. Your depression is real, and you are to be commended for reaching out. My hunch is there are lots of guys on this forum who share your concerns and feelings. I'm sure your courage may inspire others to reach out for a hand or to lend a hand. And then think about how you may have already been a catalyst in their progress. It's all pretty cool. Own it. I look forward to your reply. And please feel free to private message me if you'd like to discuss any of this, or anything more about your journey. Bob",

      "Content": "Hi, I'm new here, and grateful that this forum exists. Three weeks post op, and very bummed by the positive margin in Px. Had to stop TRT upon diagnosis, and now am at 50ng/DL -- practically castration level. Fatigue, loss of interest, loss of libido and depression all side affects. And all of them combined depressing when it appears unlikely any doc would prescribe TRT with positive margin. Was having erectile issues even with Cialis, etc. when my testosterone was up in the 500's. Injections seem to be in my future. Ugh. First post op PSA will be end of May. Anyone have a similar experience? Anyone have any suggestions? Thanks. RAD",

      "Content": "SunnyFL, I totally get your pain. I had a fusion Biopsy on January3rd, and was catheterized twice with straight caths since I couldn't pee. They hurt a lot going in, a little coming out, but it was all quick. Since I still couldn't pee, they put in a Foley Catheter and sent me home, to return in the morning for removal. It was the worst night of my life, from a physical pain standpoint. Biopsy results 7 of 13 cores with various % and Gleasons (two 4+3), so went to see surgeon for RALP at Penn. I had stumbled upon an ad on line for \"Catherless RALP\", and did further research. When I told him of my extreme pain from the Foley and asked if he would use a supra pubic catheter instead, he said \"sure\", not a problem. It might be a good idea for you to do some research and discuss this option with your surgeon, if your headed for surgery. I'll keep you posted after my surgery on 3/1. Bob",
