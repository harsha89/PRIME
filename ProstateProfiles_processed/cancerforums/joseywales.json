      "Content": "Hello, I was recently diagnosed with the following stats: PSA - 22 Biopsy - positive on all 12 cores. Percentages ranged from 2% to 3 at 100%. Gleasons on the left side were all 3+4=7. The right side had two 3+4+7s and 4 3+3=6. Perineural invasion present on the left side. Ultrasound showed that capsule appeared intact. CT - negative Bone scan - negative Staged at T2c, N0, M0 My urologist recommends robotic surgery with a backup of radiation it the surgery does not get it all. He said things are 'probably' contained and that he would do the surgery soon. He said that my age and fitness level should help with recovery and side effects. The surgeon seems to be experienced and apparently has an outside consulting firm evaluate all of his outcomes each year. The urologist said it costs the surgeon 30K a year. I take that as a fairly good sign of someone who is meticulous. He has been doing robotic surgery since 2007 and does about 5 per week. After reviewing things the surgeon said, \"Well it looks like early stage confined cancer. \" He said there is approximately a 70% probability of containment. At 49 I'm not thrilled by the prospect of surgery and side effects. Part of me just want's to get the darn thing out. Last week we set surgery for March 8th. Last night I got a call from local survivor. He recommended I make the drive to MD Anderson and ask for a second opinion on treatment and inquire about Proton Therapy. I made a call today and they said that based on my stats I am a potential candidate for proton treatment, but the earliest appointment that have is April 1. I'm torn between my urologist's opinion that I need surgery soon and my desire to get another opinion at MDA and review all options??? How dire is my situation with these stats? What are your experiences with surgery or proton therapy? Everything I've read says to take your time making a decision. Thanks in advance for your help. Josey",

      "Content": "Hello, I was recently diagnosed with the following stats: PSA - 22 Biopsy - positive on all 12 cores. Percentages ranged from 2% to 3 at 100%. Gleasons on the left side were all 3+4=7. The right side had two 3+4+7s and 4 3+3=6. Perineural invasion present on the left side. Ultrasound showed that capsule appeared intact. CT - negative Bone scan - negative Staged at T2c, N0, M0 My urologist recommends robotic surgery with a backup of radiation it the surgery does not get it all. He said things are 'probably' contained and that he would do the surgery soon. He said that my age and fitness level should help with recovery and side effects. The surgeon seems to be experienced and apparently has an outside consulting firm evaluate all of his outcomes each year. The urologist said it costs the surgeon 30K a year. I take that as a fairly good sign of someone who is meticulous. He has been doing robotic surgery since 2007 and does about 5 per week. After reviewing things the surgeon said, \"Well it looks like early stage confined cancer. \" He said there is approximately a 70% probability of containment. At 49 I'm not thrilled by the prospect of surgery and side effects. Part of me just want's to get the darn thing out. Last week we set surgery for March 8th. Last night I got a call from local survivor. He recommended I make the drive to MD Anderson and ask for a second opinion on treatment and inquire about Proton Therapy. I made a call today and they said that based on my stats I am a potential candidate for proton treatment, but the earliest appointment that have is April 1. I'm torn between my urologist's opinion that I need surgery soon and my desire to get another opinion at MDA and review all options??? How dire is my situation with these stats? What are your experiences with surgery or proton therapy? Everything I've read says to take your time making a decision. Thanks in advance for your help. Josey",

      "Content": "Brothers, At my cancer conference I asked my doctor about activities or foods I should avoid. He said, \"Don't worry about anything.\" I started doing a bit of reading and made an appointment with a nutritionist. I know diet is not going to cure my cancer, but if there are things that contributed to it it seems logical to slash them. Dairy and red meet seem like good candidates. I weighed in at 123lbs clothed. That's a little light for me. Body fat was estimated at 16.8 and BMI at 19.8 Here's what the nutritionist said: I'd like to get you up to 130 or 135 pre-treatment because you will lose some weight with any treatment. Let's try to add lean muscle Reduce cardio and increase weight training. Eat lean protein. Eat more fruits and vegetables. Drink plenty of water. Eat two eggs for breakfast. Eat legumes, but no more than 8oz per meal. Chicken and fish are good. Eat wild caught fish over farm raised. Have half a protein shake in the morning and half in the evening. Continue with B12 and multi-vitamins. Add D3 and probiotics. The goal is to consume 70-80g of protein per day. Whole grains are good. I asked about eggs, because I had heard some mixed things about them. She said they were good. I asked about sugar. \"Sugar feeds cancer,\" she said. My uncle, who had throat cancer had already told me this and I thought it odd she did not bring it up. I asked about sugar in protein shakes. She said, \"Get one with Stevia.\" So, here are my questions: I had heard that grains in general cause inflammation and inflammation is not good. What can you tell me about whole grains? It seems like if cancer loves sugar it would love stevia just as much. Am I incorrect in this hypothesis? I haven't had good luck finding much on eggs. MDA's website says they have gotten a bad rap but are good for you. I know they contain a lot of choline and had read something about choline being used in PET scans because it goes to the cancer. I did some reading. Even broccoli contains choline. What can you tell me about eggs? If anyone has any thoughts or recommendations, please let me know. Thanks! Josey \"When things look bad, and it looks like you're not gonna make it, you've gotta get mean. I mean mad dog mean, because if you lose your head in a fight you neither win nor live. That's just the way it is.\"",

      "Content": "Brothers, After a bit of research, I'm proceeding with the neoadjuvant treatment recommended by the team at MD Anderson. It will be a six month shot of Lupron, combined with Zytiga and Prednisone. The pharmacist took some time to answer my questions and I feel like I have a better understanding of the treatment. According to her... Lupron shuts down hormones. Zytiga is a chemo drug that effects an enzyme at the hormone receptor sites of cancer cells. It will block androgen reception. This will stop growth and may shrink the tumor. Prednisone will help counteract the side effects of Zytiga. The overall goal is to shrink the cancer prior to surgery to reduce the probability of positive margins. From what I've read, it may knock out any free floating cancer cells before they settle in and begin to grow. The left side of my prostate is 80% cancer and it 'abuts the capsule along almost the entire side.' All of the doctors at MDA said they did not recommend me going straight to surgery. Even though they could not see any obvious extension, I believe their experience and intuition are guiding them here. I've read several article lately about using neoadjuvant treatment in intermediate and high risk cases. It seems to be gaining some traction and acceptance. I've read the ADT thread but would appreciate any additional advice or tips. While I'm not looking forward to this treatment, I am optimistic that it will be effective. Take care, Josey",

      "Content": "Djin, I'm pleased to hear that your research has shown some positive results with nAT. That was sort of my thought based on what I read: it probably wouldn't hurt anything (other than maybe six months without sex) and might help considerably. In terms of imaging, so far I've had two negative bone scans, a negative CT and most recently, an MRI. They mentioned another bone scan and MRI pre-surgery to check out their handiwork. I asked about a PET scan in an online message, but got no response. One thing that had irked me a bit is that I had to call my specialty mail order pharmacy to get a consult on the Zytiga and Prednisone. The pharmacist walked me through things. When I asked about sexual side effects she said kind of sheepishly, \"yeah you will probably have issues.\" NO ONE, not my doctor or pharmacist brought up low libido or ED issues. Its like they all knew about it but didn't want to say anything. IF I had not done some research I would have walked into it blindly. That really rubs me wrong. Have any other FBs encountered this lack of information from medical professionals regarding ADT??? Thanks, Josey",

      "Content": "Brothers, I started the Zytiga and Prednisone last Tuesday. Man, it can be tough to choke down four 250mg tablets! On Thursday I met with an oncologist in Lubbock. He was great. There was some confusion so I could not get my Lupron shot that day. He asked a lot of questions and whenever I could not answer them he would say, \"This is irregular.\" After about three instances of this he commented that he had worked with MDA in the past and that the way things are being handled is abnormal. I'm so thankful to have a team at MDA working on my treatment, but something is going on. Maybe they are just overworked? I'm not bashing them, just trying to figure things out. The local oncologist said he liked the treatment approach and was encouraging. He indicated that he would contact MDA to get things lined out. I asked him about sexual side effects and we discussed low dose viagra. He doesn't think 6 months will be long enough to develop 'atrophy' and wrote me a script of low dose viagra for 'performance' should I find it necessary. On Monday I met with an oncology nurse for patient education. Upon asking me some questions she was shocked by the lack of information. I explained that I visited MDA over spring break and that they had worked to fit me in to their schedule. Having read the HT thread here and a book on ADT I was fairly well prepared. It just wasn't a very cheerful conversation The nurse who gave me the 3 month Lupron shot was so damn cheerful I almost couldn't take it. I discretely wiped away a single tear when no one was looking. The local cancer center has me set up for a bone density scan next week as well as a series of appointments for monitoring blood chemistry. MDA has an appointment set up for me in July, just after my second and hopefully final three month Lupron shot. So here I am, waiting to see what cards I draw for side effects and praying that this treatment will shrink the cancer and be worth the trouble. Take care Brothers, Josey",

      "Content": "Djin, I'm pleased to hear that your research has shown some positive results with nAT. That was sort of my thought based on what I read: it probably wouldn't hurt anything (other than maybe six months without sex) and might help considerably. In terms of imaging, so far I've had two negative bone scans, a negative CT and most recently, an MRI. They mentioned another bone scan and MRI pre-surgery to check out their handiwork. I asked about a PET scan in an online message, but got no response. One thing that had irked me a bit is that I had to call my specialty mail order pharmacy to get a consult on the Zytiga and Prednisone. The pharmacist walked me through things. When I asked about sexual side effects she said kind of sheepishly, \"yeah you will probably have issues.\" NO ONE, not my doctor or pharmacist brought up low libido or ED issues. Its like they all knew about it but didn't want to say anything. IF I had not done some research I would have walked into it blindly. That really rubs me wrong. Have any other FBs encountered this lack of information from medical professionals regarding ADT??? Thanks, Josey",

      "Content": "Brothers, After a bit of research, I'm proceeding with the neoadjuvant treatment recommended by the team at MD Anderson. It will be a six month shot of Lupron, combined with Zytiga and Prednisone. The pharmacist took some time to answer my questions and I feel like I have a better understanding of the treatment. According to her... Lupron shuts down hormones. Zytiga is a chemo drug that effects an enzyme at the hormone receptor sites of cancer cells. It will block androgen reception. This will stop growth and may shrink the tumor. Prednisone will help counteract the side effects of Zytiga. The overall goal is to shrink the cancer prior to surgery to reduce the probability of positive margins. From what I've read, it may knock out any free floating cancer cells before they settle in and begin to grow. The left side of my prostate is 80% cancer and it 'abuts the capsule along almost the entire side.' All of the doctors at MDA said they did not recommend me going straight to surgery. Even though they could not see any obvious extension, I believe their experience and intuition are guiding them here. I've read several article lately about using neoadjuvant treatment in intermediate and high risk cases. It seems to be gaining some traction and acceptance. I've read the ADT thread but would appreciate any additional advice or tips. While I'm not looking forward to this treatment, I am optimistic that it will be effective. Take care, Josey",

      "Content": "Brothers, I'm using a tablet while i travel and cant seem to access my settings to update my signature. I have 3 cores at 100% and two in the 80s on the left side. They reviewed my biopsy slides and upgraded these 5 cores from 3+4=7 to 4+3=7. Two cores on the right side went from 3+3 to 3+4. ☹ Both doctors said they have me at the upper end of intermediate risk or the low end of high risk. I think the upgraded biopsy and risk is why they are wanting to do presurgical treatment. The overall impression i get is that they have concerns that something has escaped and want to be proactive. They rated options in order of their preference as follows: 1 zytigia+lupron + prednisone ,then surgery 2 apalutamide trial, then surgery 3 surgery They said they felt like pretreatment with lupron alone was not a good option and said they did not recommend immunotherapy. If insurance doesnt cover zytigia, The clinical trial would cost me travel and lodging for about 10 visits to Houston. The oncologist wasnt particularly keen on the trial initially because he likes dual modes of action, but said it would be worth a try. I dont find that very encouraging. Am i being to pessimistic? Will hormone therapy knock out floating cancer and small metateses? Will it shrink the existing tumors in the prostate? At the end of the day I'm asking the same question: if it appears confined, why not do surgery now? Im up in the air about things. I called mda and asked about having the imaging center in lubbock fedex another bone scan disk. They were adamant that they wanted to do a scan here. I will ask about the more accurate pet/axuim scans. Thanks, Josey",

      "Content": "Brothers, I was prowling around on the web and came across this abstract. I thought it was interesting. Josey Fasting and Caloric Restriction in Cancer Prevention and Treatment. Brandhorst S1, Longo VD2,3. Author information Abstract Cancer is the second leading cause of death in the USA and among the leading major diseases in the world. It is anticipated to continue to increase because of the growth of the aging population and prevalence of risk factors such as obesity, smoking, and/or poor dietary habits. Cancer treatment has remained relatively similar during the past 30 years with chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy in combination with surgery remaining the standard therapies although novel therapies are slowly replacing or complementing the standard ones. According to the American Cancer Society, the dietary recommendation for cancer patients receiving chemotherapy is to increase calorie and protein intake. In addition, there are no clear guidelines on the type of nutrition that could have a major impact on cancer incidence. Yet, various forms of reduced caloric intake such as calorie restriction (CR) or fasting demonstrate a wide range of beneficial effects able to help prevent malignancies and increase the efficacy of cancer therapies. Whereas chronic CR provides both beneficial and detrimental effects as well as major compliance challenges, periodic fasting (PF), fasting-mimicking diets (FMDs), and dietary restriction (DR) without a reduction in calories are emerging as interventions with the potential to be widely used to prevent and treat cancer. Here, we review preclinical and preliminary clinical studies on dietary restriction and fasting and their role in inducing cellular protection and chemotherapy resistance.

He said surgery would be a good course of action and proposed a clinical trial for Apalutimide. The lead for the trial visited with us but said I wouldn\u0092t be eligible because my PSA was over 20. We decided to do another PSA. My first one in December was 25. My last one in January was 22. Today it was 18. The trial lead and oncologist were perplexed. The oncologist, Dr. Zarita, said he wasn\u0092t so sure the trial was the best fit. He said \u0093I want to see you cured\u0094. \u0093It looks contained, but at your age we want to do all we can to knock it out.\u0094 He checked another trial but it was full. He consulted with Dr. Pisters. They agreed that a course of Lupron alone probably wouldn\u0092t be optimal. They are proposing Lupron and Zytigia for four to six months followed by surgery. The question is if my BCBS insurance will cover Zytigia? If it won\u0092t and I can\u0092t handle the cost, he feels like the Apalutimide trial might be a decent backup plan. He also said we could proceed with surgery, but feels like some pre treatment would help. I think the idea is to hit it hard early in case small amounts have escaped the prostate rather than do surgery and see what happens later. Personally, I like the idea of hitting hard early. I\u0092m not thrilled about HT, but the plan seems sound. Has anyone here done the Zytigia and Lupron combo pre surgery? Does this sound reasonable? Too aggressive?

      "Content": "Fbs, I met with Dr. Pisters this morning. They said that based on the MRI, they are not seeing anything obvious outside the prostate. He said surgery would be a good course of action and proposed a clinical trial for Apalutimide. The lead for the trial visited with us but said I wouldn\u0092t be eligible because my PSA was over 20. We decided to do another PSA. My first one in December was 25. My last one in January was 22. Today it was 18. The trial lead and oncologist were perplexed. The oncologist, Dr. Zarita, said he wasn\u0092t so sure the trial was the best fit. He said \u0093I want to see you cured\u0094. \u0093It looks contained, but at your age we want to do all we can to knock it out.\u0094 He checked another trial but it was full. He consulted with Dr. Pisters. They agreed that a course of Lupron alone probably wouldn\u0092t be optimal. They are proposing Lupron and Zytigia for four to six months followed by surgery. The question is if my BCBS insurance will cover Zytigia? If it won\u0092t and I can\u0092t handle the cost, he feels like the Apalutimide trial might be a decent backup plan. He also said we could proceed with surgery, but feels like some pre treatment would help. I think the idea is to hit it hard early in case small amounts have escaped the prostate rather than do surgery and see what happens later. Personally, I like the idea of hitting hard early. I\u0092m not thrilled about HT, but the plan seems sound. Has anyone here done the Zytigia and Lupron combo pre surgery? Does this sound reasonable? Too aggressive? What are the odds insurance will cover it? Meanwhile, the darn bone scan data that was sent ended up being un-viewable. They want to do another bone scan on me Wednesday! Thanks, Josey",

      "Content": "FBs, I'm headed to MD Anderson for an MRI and consultation. I learned that I will have an endorectal coil for the MRI. Thankfully, I was knocked out for the biopsy as I don't think I would have handled that process very well awake. Can anyone tell me about the coil? They said there will be a balloon around it that they will inflate. How large is the coil? How uncomfortable is this process? I'm having scans with and without contrast so I think I will be in there for awhile. Should I ask for something to relax me? They said I could ask for something to relax me if I was claustrophobic and they could do it under general anesthesia if required. I don't want to wig out as squirming around will not be an option. On one level I find these questions completely hilarious. I know I'm going to have surgery at some point and will likely have some pre-surgical/post-surgical treatment, but I'm a little squeamish about having a probe and balloon in place for what could be over an hour.
