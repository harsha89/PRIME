      "Content": "My husbands PSA has been going up. The first time he was checked his PSA was 2.6 on 1-11-16. The next year 3.4 2/27/17. This year 4.1 6-12-18. His DRE the Urologist said he didn\u0092t feel any lumps or harden areas. The Dr did a K4 test and the blood work should be back next week. The Urologist recommends a Biopsy that is scheduled for July 10 due to the PSA numbers.My husband has no symptoms other than ED once in while. The Urologist said from the exam that he estimates my husbands prostate to be a 35 cc. My husband has been having low back pain for a while. By my husbands PSA numbers is this a slow or rapid rise? Could this just be BPH ? Thanks for any responses",

      "Content": "My husbands PSA has been going up. The first time he was checked his PSA was 2.6 on 1-11-16. The next year 3.4 2/27/17. This year 4.1 6-12-18. His DRE the Urologist said he didn\u0092t feel any lumps or harden areas. The Dr did a K4 test and the blood work should be back next week. The Urologist recommends a Biopsy that is scheduled for July 10 due to the PSA numbers.My husband has no symptoms other than ED once in while. The Urologist said from the exam that he estimates my husbands prostate to be a 35 cc. My husband has been having low back pain for a while. By my husbands PSA numbers is this a slow or rapid rise? Could this just be BPH ? Thanks for any responses",
