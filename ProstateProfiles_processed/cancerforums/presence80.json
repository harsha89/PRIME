      "Content": "My dad has his prostate removed about 3 years ago and put on hormone treatment to keep his PSA at bay since after the removal, he still had a rising PSA. The hormone treatment was effective at keeping his PSA at close to zero, but last year his PSA rose swiftly and in short time it was discovered that he had growths in his liver. He was immediately put on chemotherapy. The first chemo medication \"Taxotere\", was not effective, so his oncologist used a treatment called AN-1, which was in phase 2 trials. That too proved ineffective and it was halfway through this treatment where my dad's condition significantly worsened. He is experiencing pain in his pelvic area, hip, lower back and lower abdomen. He also has severe swelling in both legs to the point where he can't walk. He says the pain is excruciating at times (10 on a scale of 1-10). He is being treated at the USC Norris Cancer Center and his oncologist stated that the chemotherapy is not working and things are not looking good. It almost seems like she is giving up. She has him on an anti-androgen pill called Xtandi (enzalutamide), that he started taking two days ago. We had to admit him to the hospital because his pain was unbearable. We want to try taking him to another cancer center (City of Hope) to see if he has other options, but his condition is declining rapidly. The doctor stated that he has growths in his bone in addition to in his liver. His skin is yellowish, his urine is dark and he is starting to seem more aloof. I know these are all symptoms of liver issues, and I'm getting more worried and depressed. The radiologists are going to treat his hip area in hopes of shrinking the growths there that may be causing the pain and swelling. Has anyone ever had a family member go through something similar? I'm looking for help and support. I want to fight to the bitter end to help my father. Tomorrow's Father's Day and it looks like we will be spending it in the hospital. Thank you and God Bless all of you.",
