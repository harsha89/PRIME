Havent had any pain killer stronger than tylenol since 6 pm day of surgery. Havent even needed tylenol the last 2 days. Its day 4 (not including day of surgery) and have a couple questions 1. I havent had a bowl movement yet. Thought I was close a couple of times, but nothing yet. I've been eating regular food since thursday night, and been taking stool softners. Is this normal for it to take this long? I dont feel any discomfort in that dept at this point. At what point should I use a laxitive to get things moving? 2. I will get my cath out this coming wed. I understand after it comes out I'll be leaking a lot, should I take some of the Depends underwear to wear home, or use a Depend ultra guard in my regular underwear? I live 2 hours from the drs office so wondering what to take with me. 2 questions I never thought I would be asking on the internet, lol...........",

      "Content": "This is fresh on my mind, as I had mine done 17 days ago. one thing to remember is strong prescription pain killers can cause constipation, so you want to get off of those as soon as possible. In my case (and lots of other that I read about) there wasnt any really sharp pain after surgery, just being uncomfortable with the gas that they used to inflate me to make more room during surgery. I didnt take anything stronger than tylenol after 6 pm the day of surgery, I didnt need it. If you can get up and walk the evening of surgery it will help get rid of that gas. As for getting out of bed, I found that I had to get up differently. I would roll over on my side at the edge of the bed, then sit up SIDEWAYS and swing my legs down to the floor at the same time, rather than the traditional way of sitting straight up then swiveling around and putting my legs down. As for what you need to have on hand, you will need to keep taking stool softner for several days. make sure you have enough tylenol or advil. I had them give me a script for oxycontin, in case I needed it, but I never did. They will probably give you a script for an antibiotic to start taking when they remove the cath in a week. I would also get one package each of some incontinence products. get a box of the light sheilds, one of the maximum guards, one of the full briefs, and a box of the absorbant bed liners. Everyone is different on how dry they are after cath removal, so you wont know what you need until that time. When you go back for cath removal in a week take some of the max guards with you and leave the rest at home. When you get home with the cath they will send you home with a leg bag a large bag for nighttime. as soon as I got home I put the large bag on and left it on all week and never left home. I had some sweat pants that snapped up the side, so I could route the tube out the side of the sweats about mid thigh, and carried the bag around in a bucket. I usually had to empty the bag out once in the middle of the night. Just remember not to overdo it when you get home, walk some but get plenty of rest. You should not pick up anything over 10 lbs for the 6 weeks after. putting on socks was the hardest thing, my wife did that for me the first few days.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by ljames I keep reading how important it is to exercise and have a low BMI and generally keep excess weight off when dealing with PCa. I know this is generally good advice for most conditions, by is there a reason why it's important for PCa in particular? I had Da Vinci surgery 7 weeks ago. I was suprised when I was completely continent upon cath removal, and have been dry since. The only time I consiously kagel since surgery is if I cough. I know I'am very fortunate from what I have read, and I wonder what I owe that good fortune to, and if it would help others facing surgery. I had a very experienced surgeon, and Because I had an intermediate risk cancer, I was able to put off my surgery for 2 months due to some things going on in my life, and I spent that time practicing Kagels. And even though I'am not ripped like I was when I was 18, I'am in fairly decent shape for my age. At my job I spend a lot of time climbing ladders, getting up and down off my knees working on things. I wonder if that was working on my pelvic floor muscles all these years and didnt know it. I wonder if its a combination of all of the above, plus maybe some dumb luck thrown in. I know there is no guarantees, but I think it is worth getting in shape and doing Kagels before surgery, it sure cant hurt....",

Things are still changing in the sex dept for me as time goes on. 5 weeks ago I was dissapointed on how things were going in that dept. Things are working much better now, they changed a lot in the last month. Not like they were before, but much better. still have to use viagra and/or a pump. My point is your husband is still healing and hopefully things will improve. Orgasms are much different for me now. I actually feel it more in my legs now. He should mention it to his surgeon, but things may get better. I know its hard to be patient, I felt the same way",

Was able to pass some gas in the night, much better next day and went home. took only tylonol after 6 pm day of surgery Day 2 feeling ok, no pain, just some discomfort. Doing plenty of rest with some walking mixed in. Getting used to the cath and figuring out how to operate while carrying my \"little buddy\" in a bucket around with me. Everything so far is just as described by those who have gone before. Thanks for the info I knew what to expect.

I felt GREAT for a few minutes and the next thing I knew I was waking up in the recovery room. Piece of cake. Make sure you have a Netflix subscription so you can binge watch your favorite shows and enjoy not having to get up to go to the bathroom for 7 days! Yep, not only did I subscribe to netflix for the first time, I have never seen the Lord of the Rings trilogy or the hobbit movies, I never could find the time, so all 6 dvds are sitting on a shelf waiting to be played.",

Wed night I went for short walk in hospital, couldnt sit upright in chair due to gas pressure in abdomin. Was able to pass some gas in the night, much better next day and went home. took only tylonol after 6 pm day of surgery Day 2 feeling ok, no pain, just some discomfort. Doing plenty of rest with some walking mixed in. Getting used to the cath and figuring out how to operate while carrying my \"little buddy\" in a bucket around with me. Everything so far is just as described by those who have gone before. Thanks for the info I knew what to expect. Will go back next wed for cath removal and hopefully find out the path report on the prostate.",

      "Content": "Here I sit with my date with Mr Da Vinci scheduled for wed morning. I scheduled it after Thanksgiving thinking I could enjoy the holiday then go have it done. I would now advise others to alter that planning some because: 1. Thanksgiving is the kickoff of the cold and flu season. Families gather together to share holiday cheer and each others colds. After spending much of the time listening to everyone hacking and coughing I spent most of the weekend wondering if I was going to come down with something in time for surgery. Last year my nieces boyfriend showed up for Thanksgiving dinner running a 101 temp and infected us all. I had forgotten about that. So far I'am doing ok.... 2. Many on these boards have advised guys going for surgery to have as much sex as possible in the days before. Thats hard to do with a house full of family who usually arent there. I've been trying to lure my wife back to a bathroom, much like guys on an airplane trying to entice their girls back to the bathroom to join \"the mile high club\". The above would also apply to Christmas or Easter, while much of what I typed was firmly toung in cheek, there is some truth to it, and wish I had a week or so in between the holiday and surgery. Today I've been building my nest in the spare bedroom, recliner and tv are prepaired for when I come home. Thanks to everyone for their advice, I'll see you on the other side....",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by rmotacek1 Good luck on Wednesday. It will be over before you know it. I remember the nurse giving me a \"coctail\" shot right before getting wheeled in. I felt GREAT for a few minutes and the next thing I knew I was waking up in the recovery room. Piece of cake. Make sure you have a Netflix subscription so you can binge watch your favorite shows and enjoy not having to get up to go to the bathroom for 7 days! Yep, not only did I subscribe to netflix for the first time, I have never seen the Lord of the Rings trilogy or the hobbit movies, I never could find the time, so all 6 dvds are sitting on a shelf waiting to be played.",

      "Content": "Here I sit with my date with Mr Da Vinci scheduled for wed morning. I scheduled it after Thanksgiving thinking I could enjoy the holiday then go have it done. I would now advise others to alter that planning some because: 1. Thanksgiving is the kickoff of the cold and flu season. Families gather together to share holiday cheer and each others colds. After spending much of the time listening to everyone hacking and coughing I spent most of the weekend wondering if I was going to come down with something in time for surgery. Last year my nieces boyfriend showed up for Thanksgiving dinner running a 101 temp and infected us all. I had forgotten about that. So far I'am doing ok.... 2. Many on these boards have advised guys going for surgery to have as much sex as possible in the days before. Thats hard to do with a house full of family who usually arent there. I've been trying to lure my wife back to a bathroom, much like guys on an airplane trying to entice their girls back to the bathroom to join \"the mile high club\". The above would also apply to Christmas or Easter, while much of what I typed was firmly toung in cheek, there is some truth to it, and wish I had a week or so in between the holiday and surgery. Today I've been building my nest in the spare bedroom, recliner and tv are prepaired for when I come home. Thanks to everyone for their advice, I'll see you on the other side....",
