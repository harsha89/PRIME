      "Content": "As you asked, my opinion is this. If, when you married your wife, she was a smoker then you accepted that at the time. Obviously she still continues to smoke or has taken it up since your marriage. Now you need to quietly negotiate where she wants to smoke, where you wish her not to but not in a confrontive way. You can not now demand that she do this or that in the way that you want her to do. Maybe a solution if she agrees would be for her to do so in a certain room away from where you are and if she is smoking there you don't go in there at those times. She may agree to smoke outside as many do these days, she may not as this is her house too. You also have the choice to leave the room she is smoking in. Why do you feel that your wishes should be the priority when marriage is a joint effort of give and take? Don't demand. Phrase your sentences with I feel, when this happens, I feel and would like you to consider... etc etc She may be refusing as she feels defensive with the way you are going about it. Good luck and best wishes.",

If you do not want to do the normal testing procedures and want to trust to a dog to smell your bum then go right ahead but don't ask about it here in a forum that trusts in conventional screening methods. For the record, my dog knew about my tumour but that was in conjunction with other medical diagnostic methods. Just decide how you want to be tested and do it then find a forum that supports how you wish to diagnose then proceed if needed.",

I am also grateful to have the knowledge about what this time of waiting can be like and how useless and energy draining freaking out can be so I am not going to do that either.Of course though, concern is different.

I think I will strangle him or at least slap his head between 2 bricks. His worry about his psa prompted me to start this thread. I am so pleased I didn't go googling. Told him there were many reasons why it could be raised. Will update when we get we know anything just to put an ending here should it be something else, which it probably will be.",

      "Content": "...well, that's what I recon. Hubby had a PSA test due to frequent urination. Age 49. Call from Doc's surgery says want to see him..urgent. Doc has never has used the word urgent before, even with my tests, diagnosis and treatment. Due to this I am expecting him to tell us high PSA plus or minus a UTI. Did ask hubby to ask for free PSA reading but he didn't. A DRE was not performed either, doc saw no need. I wasn't going to tell hubby till lunchtime tomorrow, a couple of hours before the appointment as he is a farmer, can take time off when needed but tomorrow arvo he is getting some stuff in the truck am and pm. Rats,, had to tell him so he could schedule the trips better. Have printed out a few reputable site's advice on high PSA's..other things it can mean as he has never believed anything I say unless it is backed up by someone else, after 21 years I am used to that. No more printed info as that is where we are at the moment. He went deeply into a black hole with my diagnosis but he did pull himself out of it a few weeks later and was so fantastic during my treatment. I, of course will be his rock if needed, just as he was mine. We now hurry up and wait, lol. Used to that..which is actually a good thing. Already know the fun of that. Will let you know when I know more and if anything eventuates from this I will be using your experiences and opinions. Hubby won't join..not his thing and I will play it anyway he wants to should further tests reveal cancer. At the moment of course and even after the appointment tomorrow we won't know much. Again, BLAAAAK! He will not handle this at all well for a while. Oh well. Hope it turns out to be infection.",

I know enough from being here on the boards long enough to know that I know nothing. I also am someone who mostly practices what they preach so I am not going researching until I actually know there is something to research about. I am also grateful to have the knowledge about what this time of waiting can be like and how useless and energy draining freaking out can be so I am not going to do that either.Of course though, concern is different. We will just plow through till we have some answers. He is asleep now, which is good.",

      "Content": "I also like to look at it from another angle..when we heard about others with cancer before we had it. What were our reactions? Did we want to know the nitty gritty? Did we continue with them as normal or did we back away, not sure what to do so we justified it by thinking that by saying or doing nothing at least we weren't making things worse as we just might add to their misery by talking about it? Did we step up to the plate, maintain normal contact, sit back and hope like heck there would be good news but never instigateing contact? Some people can not and do not want to confront their own mortality so they block it out until they, or someone they love faces it. They then and only then can see what needs there really are and how what they perceived to be the right thing either was, or was not right, depending on their outlook.",

Utrasound thought it was ok but only because of my previous cancer they wanted to just make sure it was. Thyroid scan, needle biopsy all good. The biopsy is painless..they numb you well and it is done under the guidance of an ultrasound. Edit..re read your post, you know this. Fine needle biopsies are next to useless for diagnosing my kind of cancer but have close to 100% success rate with thyroid. Not meaning to sound too blase but my thoughts on if I had a thyroid cancer then it was so mild compared to the one I had. I figured worst case scenario yep, cancer..have it out...do the low iodine diet (worst bit of the whole thing to my mind)..have the glow in the dark pills in hospital isolation a few days then meds the rest of my life which about a gazillion of the population are on for high or low Thyroid levels anyway.",

For the last 5 of those years he ran her and her family ragged. It got to the stage that she could no longer lift him up from the floor after a fall. We had to make the decision that he needed 24hr care. He did NOT want this. Tried every imagined emotional blackmail and manipulation on my sister. She eventually had to place him in care. He hated it for a couple of years then told her that she had indeed done the right thing. He had 24hour care. It was so hard for both of them to accept. She was there daily for the first couple of years. I was there when I could travel the 1600 kilometers. This may have to be considered in the future for the best situation for him, and your family.",

For the last 5 of those years he ran her and her family ragged. It got to the stage that she could no longer lift him up from the floor after a fall. We had to make the decision that he needed 24hr care. He did NOT want this. Tried every imagined emotional blackmail and manipulation on my sister. She eventually had to place him in care. He hated it for a couple of years then told her that she had indeed done the right thing. He had 24hour care. It was so hard for both of them to accept. She was there daily for the first couple of years. I was there when I could travel the 1600 kilometers. This may have to be considered in the future for the best situation for him, and your family.",
