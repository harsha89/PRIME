      "Content": "My H was diagnosed last year with PC at age 50. He went from PSA 3.6 in November to 5.3 six months later. He had DaVinci surgery about a month later. At that point, I thought things were in the clear. Gleason score increased from 6 to 7 post surgery (3+4), but the surgeon didn't recommend radiation post surgery, PSA was not detectable, and while he had some side effects with leakage, etc., we went back to our lives. But last month's PSA test showed a small rise. It from 0 to .06 in six months. Second PSA two weeks later was .07. Still, his urologist said we would just do another PSA test in six months. So I read up on prostate cancer, not just surgery, and find out a lot about doubling time, time to recurrence, etc. I read through my H's pathology report. Turns out his tumor volume was 25% and he had 3 positive margins. To me, those aren't good numbers. If his PSA is rising like it is, waiting six months for another PSA test could let it rise above .1, but I've read that salvage radiation is most effective if it's done before the PSA rises over .1. Needless to say, I'm not impressed with the urologist and his relaxed attitude. To me, it seems like my H has aggressive prostate cancer. But maybe I'm wrong?!? I will also say that I've read that diet can play a role in both the occurrence and aggressiveness of prostate cancer. Well, my H has a pretty bad diet. He probably went for the first 45 years of his life without voluntarily eating a vegetable. He hates them. Loves deli meat, eats lots of nuts, never has eaten a salad in his life. I used to encourage him to eat better, but he says that salad makes him wretch. He finally is listening to me about his diet, but his version is to drink V-8 and maybe get in a bowl of vegetable soup once or twice a week. He also has a persistent cough. I'm just here looking for perspectives. The recurrence has caught me off guard, and I want to be better informed.",

I asked him if he is having his PSA checked during radiation and he said he's not. He then went on to tell me that you don't start hormone therapy during radiation, only before. I hadn't mentioned hormones, so I know he was being defensive and wanting to shut me down. Here's my concern - I don't think his doctors are being honest with him. His cancer has recurred in less than 1 year and his psadt is less than 3 months. Based on this chart from Johns Hopkins, he can't be cured. His chances of surviving 15 years are about 1%. How can they suggest to him that radiation could cure him in this case? http://urology.jhu.edu/newsletter/pr..._cancer829.php",

      "Content": "Hi everyone, My H was diagnosed at age 50 with prostate cancer in April 2014. Don't recall his exact numbers, but he went from ~3.6 to ~5.3 at his next check. Had Davinci RP in late May 2014, PSA after was undetectible. Pathology report indicates G7 (3+4), 3 positive margins, grade T2c. PSA rechecks every 3 months. His cancer recurred in less than a year. PSA of .06, a retest two weeks later was .07, and 3 months later it's .15. That means his doubling time is less than 3 months. He started salvage radiation last week. His oncologist said he was on the fence about hormone therapy with the radiation, so my H has opted for no hormones. Wanting to know if others have had early recurrence and rapid doubling time. Did your doctor tell you hormone treatment was 50/50? I've read that early recurrence and PSADT <3 months could indicate distant mestastices, and that hormone therapy with radiation could knock out both. Thoughts on where he is in treatment and the advice he's been given?",

      "Content": "My H was diagnosed last year with PC at age 50. He went from PSA 3.6 in November to 5.3 six months later. He had DaVinci surgery about a month later. At that point, I thought things were in the clear. Gleason score increased from 6 to 7 post surgery (3+4), but the surgeon didn't recommend radiation post surgery, PSA was not detectable, and while he had some side effects with leakage, etc., we went back to our lives. But last month's PSA test showed a small rise. It from 0 to .06 in six months. Second PSA two weeks later was .07. Still, his urologist said we would just do another PSA test in six months. So I read up on prostate cancer, not just surgery, and find out a lot about doubling time, time to recurrence, etc. I read through my H's pathology report. Turns out his tumor volume was 25% and he had 3 positive margins. To me, those aren't good numbers. If his PSA is rising like it is, waiting six months for another PSA test could let it rise above .1, but I've read that salvage radiation is most effective if it's done before the PSA rises over .1. Needless to say, I'm not impressed with the urologist and his relaxed attitude. To me, it seems like my H has aggressive prostate cancer. But maybe I'm wrong?!? I will also say that I've read that diet can play a role in both the occurrence and aggressiveness of prostate cancer. Well, my H has a pretty bad diet. He probably went for the first 45 years of his life without voluntarily eating a vegetable. He hates them. Loves deli meat, eats lots of nuts, never has eaten a salad in his life. I used to encourage him to eat better, but he says that salad makes him wretch. He finally is listening to me about his diet, but his version is to drink V-8 and maybe get in a bowl of vegetable soup once or twice a week. He also has a persistent cough. I'm just here looking for perspectives. The recurrence has caught me off guard, and I want to be better informed.",

      "Content": "Hi everyone, My H was diagnosed at age 50 with prostate cancer in April 2014. Don't recall his exact numbers, but he went from ~3.6 to ~5.3 at his next check. Had Davinci RP in late May 2014, PSA after was undetectible. Pathology report indicates G7 (3+4), 3 positive margins, grade T2c. PSA rechecks every 3 months. His cancer recurred in less than a year. PSA of .06, a retest two weeks later was .07, and 3 months later it's .15. That means his doubling time is less than 3 months. He started salvage radiation last week. His oncologist said he was on the fence about hormone therapy with the radiation, so my H has opted for no hormones. Wanting to know if others have had early recurrence and rapid doubling time. Did your doctor tell you hormone treatment was 50/50? I've read that early recurrence and PSADT <3 months could indicate distant mestastices, and that hormone therapy with radiation could knock out both. Thoughts on where he is in treatment and the advice he's been given?",

      "Content": "As I've said before here, my H doesn't want to talk about his cancer, at least not the important things. I asked him if he is having his PSA checked during radiation and he said he's not. He then went on to tell me that you don't start hormone therapy during radiation, only before. I hadn't mentioned hormones, so I know he was being defensive and wanting to shut me down. Here's my concern - I don't think his doctors are being honest with him. His cancer has recurred in less than 1 year and his psadt is less than 3 months. Based on this chart from Johns Hopkins, he can't be cured. His chances of surviving 15 years are about 1%. How can they suggest to him that radiation could cure him in this case? http://urology.jhu.edu/newsletter/pr..._cancer829.php",

      "Content": "My H was diagnosed last year with PC at age 50. He went from PSA 3.6 in November to 5.3 six months later. He had DaVinci surgery about a month later. At that point, I thought things were in the clear. Gleason score increased from 6 to 7 post surgery (3+4), but the surgeon didn't recommend radiation post surgery, PSA was not detectable, and while he had some side effects with leakage, etc., we went back to our lives. But last month's PSA test showed a small rise. It from 0 to .06 in six months. Second PSA two weeks later was .07. Still, his urologist said we would just do another PSA test in six months. So I read up on prostate cancer, not just surgery, and find out a lot about doubling time, time to recurrence, etc. I read through my H's pathology report. Turns out his tumor volume was 25% and he had 3 positive margins. To me, those aren't good numbers. If his PSA is rising like it is, waiting six months for another PSA test could let it rise above .1, but I've read that salvage radiation is most effective if it's done before the PSA rises over .1. Needless to say, I'm not impressed with the urologist and his relaxed attitude. To me, it seems like my H has aggressive prostate cancer. But maybe I'm wrong?!? I will also say that I've read that diet can play a role in both the occurrence and aggressiveness of prostate cancer. Well, my H has a pretty bad diet. He probably went for the first 45 years of his life without voluntarily eating a vegetable. He hates them. Loves deli meat, eats lots of nuts, never has eaten a salad in his life. I used to encourage him to eat better, but he says that salad makes him wretch. He finally is listening to me about his diet, but his version is to drink V-8 and maybe get in a bowl of vegetable soup once or twice a week. He also has a persistent cough. I'm just here looking for perspectives. The recurrence has caught me off guard, and I want to be better informed.",
