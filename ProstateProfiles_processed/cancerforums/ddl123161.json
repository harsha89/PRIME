With my results what they are, I'm not sure even if it came back with a lower Gleason score that I would do anything different, unless the one that was done is completely out of whack. With a 3+4 and 3 out of 12 cores positive does it really make any sense to have it checked out by another lab? That along with my 10.5 PSA and 7.5% fPSA. Thanks again for everyone's help and support!!",
