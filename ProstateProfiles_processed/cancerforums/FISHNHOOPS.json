Mine acted differently than most cases ive read about. your psa is supposed to be in normal range with ductal cancer . Mine was 16.3 at the time of surgery. When my biopsy came back the gleason score was 8. They didn't know it was ductal till the pathology report came back. I had it for two years finally got the biopsy. This is supposed to be an aggressive cancer but after surgery it was all contained negative margins the doctor said great news we got it all but theres a 68% chance it will come back because its ductal. Don't see how that's possible if all scans and tests were negative. I treated this naturally with supplement for two years which between that and God I believe it kept it contained. First 3 month psa was undetectable. Hoping for the same the next test.",
