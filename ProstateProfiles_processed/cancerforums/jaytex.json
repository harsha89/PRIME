      "Content": "Hello, first time posting here. I've been reading the other posts to find information. Here is my story, I just turned 41 last month and a week after my birthday I got this strange pressure below my belly button at the belt line. So I immediately made a appointment to see my physician. She tells me it could be some type of infection. I'm givin some antibiotics and I'm told to call if I get any complications. Well three days later I'm at work and finishing off my 6th bottle of water and noticed I had not urinated. So I call the doc, she tells me to go to ER. She said it could be a kidney stone... I get to the ER, wait for 5 hours and they tell me I have acute protatisis. I'm given flomax by the ER nurse and given instructions to see a urologist. The next day I see my doc again and she says that it's not uncommon for someone my age to have this. I'm like ok, what's the next step. She tells me they have to do a blood test for the prostate to see if there are other problems....but they can't do it now because the prostate is enlarged. Skip a week or so and they finally schedule me to see a specialist for late October. Meanwhile I'm left in the dark about how long this lasts and the other symptoms that are occuring. My left lower back feels sore and my left testicle feels sore. This is not everyday but mostly in episodes. I'm also on some kind of prostate rollercoaster because some days I can urinate easily but then I have to get up several times at night to go, or it's very limited urination and a very unpleasant feeling over my prostate area. I was also advised not to exercise as this could aggitate the situation. How long can these symptoms last? And are the symptoms described put me at greater chance to be dxed for prostate cancer? Thanks for any information.",

      "Content": "Thanks for the responses. I've had these symptoms for a month. The antibiotics seem to have no effect, but my doctor is confident they will work. I'm kind of ultra paranoid because someone I know has PC, and he seemed perfectly healthy although he's 17 years older than me. This is a great forum and now I know where to come if I need support and answers.",
