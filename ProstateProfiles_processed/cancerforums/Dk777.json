      "Content": "Hi,been a off and on lurker. A little info. My dad never went to the doctor,but got a real bad case of hives at the age of 67,so we took him there kicking all the way. They did a psa without him knowing. Two days later they called him and said it was a 19. He just said they r just trying to get my money. He refused to listen to there calls or letters. 10 years later at the age of 77 he felt pain in his leg and started dropping pounds. two months later down 40lbs and he was a small guy from the start. I took him to the doctors. test showed bone cancer all through his body and psa of 900. He died 4 months later a very painful death. He would call out to me and say save me why he was in hospice. He would say there not feeding me or giving me water and making me take pills.He was a mans man and never cried a day in his life,but during those 4 months I watched him cry everyday. Me,at age 38 I started having chronic prostatitis,never found any bacterial kind. My psa at 38,39 and 40 was 0.6,but they found a bump on my Dre,so they did a biopsy at age 40. it was clear and for the next 5 years my psa stayed around 0.6. At age 45 I was having a lot of sex and in a flare of prostatitis when I went to see the doc again for psa. It came back at 7.9. He right away wanted to do another biopsy, I said lets wait and see if it comes down. He said no,its cancer. I told him I wanted a second opinion. he then called me all the time and sent me letters say I probably have cancer and gonna die like my dad if I don't get the biopsy. Well,I went to another doctor and my psa was 1.7 at that point. He said u r fine,come back and see me in a 6 months. Over the next 5 years no bumps and my psa was 1.9,2.0,1.7,2.2. Then about a year and a half ago he did a dre and ultra sound and a pca3 test and psa. .Psa came back at a 2 and nothing on ultra sound but some calcifications and pca3 was a 22 with a cut off point of 35. So he said your good,see you in a year. Hi died before that year was up. So now finally to my question. For the last 4 months I have had what I hope is prostatitis,but its very different this time. Pain in the normal areas,like privates and hurts when I pee or have sex,but I also now have bad pains in my butt and legs all the time. My dad had dry cum at the end before he knew he had cancer. I now have very decreased sperm fluid,about half I would say. Now this is so stramge, I had a dre which was normal about 4 days before psa and sex about 36 hours before psa and now after 5 years of it being in the 2 range it is back down to 0.6. Doc said prostate was a little enlarge,but u r fine. see you back in a year. I ask him why the drop.he just said,be happy. Any idea why it did this? Should I be worried about any of my symptoms going on 4 months now with new butt and leg pain? Thanks for your time.",

      "Content": "Hi, Yes all 3 doctors where urologists. My work isn't very physical and I don't sit or drive long. My regular doctor also suggested I see a back doctor to rule out any problems there. They did a MRI, on my upper back and lower back. Lower back was fine, no problems. Upper back had a little arthritis and degenerative . They said my upper back wouldn't be causing the problems in my buttons and legs. Only my lower back would do that. It's weird, cause I fell like I can't ejaculate and when I do its just a little. Also when I do ejaculate or pee It burns a little, but I feel stabbing pain in prostate area and butt at the point of ejaculating. I have also been checked for std, s. My dad's fate does scare me at times. It's in the back of my head. This is just the longest I have had it if it is prostatitis and the symptoms are very different this time with the extra pain and lack of fluid. I have read some people do have these symptoms with it. Thanks for your help. I'm glad it's back down to 0.6 after 5 years of being in the 2 range, but these symptoms are very hard to live with. I know it's nothing like you are all going through. I feel for you all.. My symptoms are getting up to go to bathroom 5 times a night. Pain in penis, testicles, area below it and my butt both sides, my hips and down front and back of both thigh. Ejaculating makes it worse.",
