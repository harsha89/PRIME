      "Content": "My condolences to you and your family! PS is scary, but the road is well-traveled. There can be some comfort in that. Everyone's story is different and my situation is extremely different than your father's, so I can't offer much in terms on experience. My approach was surgical, so I can't tell you much about chemo. There can be some spread in Gleason score, as they no doubt got the data through a biopsy. My biopsy showed a 7 (of the 4+3) variety). After surgery, they examined the organ and it showed a score of 6. My urologist said that the score changes in about 30% of cases. Surprising, really, given all they know about the disease. As I understand it, the lymph system can be how disease moves throughout the body. I suspect that the Chemo will be after all the disease. Is there radiation treatment being planned as well? That, I think, is more targeted. What I really want to share is my experience with my daughters. One is a nurse and the other is away at college. When I was diagnosed (last spring) the nurse was very calm and accepting. My daughter at college had a hard time but didn't really let me know. I'm sure that your dad is trying to protect you. He doesn't want to burden you more than he has to. He's probably also struggling himself. Like it or not, sometimes we males cope better with silence. I would encourage you to respect that, as best you can, but be honest with him about your feelings. Seek support from other families who are going through the same thing. We all have an expiration date. Cancer makes us recognize this truth. So make sure that you and your family experience the joy in every moment. Whether we have a day remaining or 80 years, we can make each day count. Your father has to deal with cancer, but don't let it be the center of all that you do. I don't know if you are a praying family, but we are and I'll say one today for your and yours. Wishing you all the best!",

      "Content": "Looking for some suggestions on the ED journey. Had RP surgery in May '17. Nerves were spared. I have been on Sidafil (3 times weekly; 0.2 mg) since then. Have erectile response with or without medication, with considerable fullness, but nothing that would allow penetration. Best case response is still less than 90 degrees. Was wondering if anyone had any suggestions about positions that might increase the odds for penetration. We've been experimenting a bit, but there is certainly frustration and the leakage doesn't help. Any other suggestions? When did people first try a pump or injections?",
