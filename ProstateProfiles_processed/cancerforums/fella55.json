      "Content": "Hello all, I am a 52 year old male. My father passed from PCa at 74 years old. He was diagnosed in 1993 when he was 58 after an abnormal DRE. He had a radical prostatectomy with positive margins but no lymph node involvement. The doctor told him that the disease would probably return and it did. He had a rather poor outcome form his RP being completely incontinent and impotent. Watching him live with the disease and ultimately pass from it had a profound impact on me, and I am frankly terrified of the disease to the point that as I get close to the age at which he was diagnosed I am becoming more and and more obsessed with it. I am convinced I am going to end up in the same boat as my dad and I am admittedly borderline paranoid about it. I started getting PSA tests in 2006 at the age of 41 the following are my results over the years. 17-Oct-06 --- 1.61 24-Oct-07 --- 1.84 29-Oct-08 --- 1.60 01-Feb-10 --- 1.74 04-Jan-11 --- 1.85 09-Jan-12 --- 1.88 09-Feb-13 --- 1.87 05-Feb-14 --- 1.78 16-Feb-15 --- 2.28 23-Mar-15 --- 1.81 23-Feb-16 --- 2.18 17-Mar-16 --- 2.40 03-Aug-16 --- 1.80 01-Feb-17 --- 1.50 05-Oct-17 --- 1.90 As you can see I started with a quite high PSA (relative to the median which I think is 0.6). From what I have read, this means that I have a much higher chance of getting Prostate cancer and that it would like be more aggressive. As you can see my PSA has generally bounced around sometime quite a bit over the years. I don't understand why my PSA is higher that the median. Does it mean that there is a latent cancer there? In addition I recently started taking statins and a daily aspirin. I have read that this can artificially lower my PSA. In fact the 1.5 score on 1 feb 17 was a month after I started this regime. My doctor insists its coincidence and that a causation can't be drawn. My most recent test scored a 1.9 up from 1.5. I am concerned that if indeed statins/aspirin as masking a rise in PSA that this could actually be a higher numbers. I'm not sure if I should push my doctor to send me to a specialist and if I should insist of getting a biopsy at this point, or am I being too paranoid? I know so many people are in a much worse situation that I am in, but I have also read about folks who had fairly low PSAs, but who ended up with a nasty case of PCa. Thank you for your patience and your advice and forgive me my anxiety.",

      "Content": "Thank you everyone for taking the time to respond. I like the suggestion on asking for a PHI test. I will ask my doctor about it today as I have an appointment. @DavefromMD my doctor has been quite proactive on PSA tests and is checking me every 6 months for now. My sense is that he is going to suggest I go yearly. He has also sent my blood draw to three separate labs each of the last three times so that we can see a consistent number. Two of the labs agreed and one was very different. For example on my latest round of tests, I received a 1.9, 2.0, and 1.43. The 1.43 must have used the WHO assay which can show up to a 23% difference. This really shows the importance of consistency getting results from the same lab or from labs that use the same assay. We also did a PCa3 about 6 months ago on which I scored a 9. In reading everyone's response to date, I realise that I should take a deep breath. I think I am doing everything I can do, and what I really want which is the certain knowledge that I don't have PCa simply doesn't exist. But then again there really is no certainty about anything in life Thank you all again for your patience",
