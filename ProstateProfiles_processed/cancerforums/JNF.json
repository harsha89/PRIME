      "Content": "Dr Snuffy Myers claims positive, sometimes curative, results when there are fewer than five nodes involved. As to the standard scans, by the time the cancer shows it has been working for some time. Myers and other specialists now use some scans that show the cancer much sooner. I suggest you seeks out an excellent prostate cancer oncologist immediately. I would also suggest investigating hormone therapy while the cancer is minimal. It can begin before the radiation and will both weaken the cancer that will be radiated and that which the radiation can not reach if it has spread. It is now more the domain of the oncologist.",

Throughout the treatment period I missed three days of work and one was for a colonoscopy. For details, check out HDR at www.cetmc.net run by Dr Jeffrey Demanes. He has been doing HDR since 1981 and publishes 15 year statistics. He runs the rad-onc for prostatre cancer at UCLA. I would strongly suggest you research the radiation method (both permanent seeds and HDR) as the long term results are on par with surgery and the side effects are normally fewer and less serious.",

You are too high risk and would ruin his success ratio. I was in the same boat, being high risk. My urologist would not operate as he did not think it would be curative. He believed I would need radiation in addition to surgery and he would not subject me to the additional risks and side effects of surgery and radiation when surgery would not solve the problem. The thought that you can use radiation as a back up is a red herring excuse to operate. Salvage radiation is used to reach the cancer the surgery could not get. But the damage to the nerves has already been suffered from the surgery. Start with radiation as it will eradicate the cancer as effective or more so than surgery and will get all the areas the surgery misses from the start. Before you make any decisions, see at least two radiation oncologists that do both brachytherapy and external beam. You should also see a medical oncologist that specializes in prostate cancer. You are high risk and a urologist alone will not be suffecient. For brachytherapy radiation research use the following websites: for Hoigh Dose Rate brachytherapy www.cetmc,com, the website of Dr jeffrey Demanes the HDR pioneer that heads the brachytherapy department at UCLA. For permanent seedts use www.prostrcision.com the website of Dr Frank Critz whi pioneered the use of IMRT and adjuvant permanent seeds. Both methods are better for advanced high risk cancer than surgery and leave far less side effects. I was PSA 59, 12 of 12 cores positive, and G7.

      "Content": "I had HDR procedures December 6 amd 13, 2010. I had it in conjunction with IMRT and HT as I am higher risk than you. You look like a great mono candidate according to Demanes' information on his website. I am very happy that I used HDR and I am in Atlanta where the premier permanent seed clinic is. I looked at them but between Demanes and my med-onc I bought into the better accuracy and fewer side effects of HDR. My procedures were well tolerated. My side effects from the first procedure was basically painful urination for two days. The second time they used a different preparation for the catheter and there was no burning. Sitting on hard chairs was tough for about three weeks as it felt like I was sittting on a golf ball. There is a little bit of internal bleeding and the blood follows gravity. For about three weeks my penis and scrotum were black and swollen.....looked pretty wierd. This went away after a few weeks. For the physical aspects a little pain relief was good as well as a warm bath each evening. I was on a number of meds for awhile. Levaquin was used to ward off any infection. I was on a steroid for six days to reduce swelling. Also UTA to numb the urinry tract and Flomax to help the flow. No ED, but the first several ejaculation were dark brown. Volume is also reduced, but sex works well and enjoyable. I am guessing that the dark semen will stop pretty soon. Overall, all went well. Also remember that I was undergoing IMRT so I was at greater risk of side effects than you will be with monotherapy. I would strongly sugggest HDR and you are with two of the pioneers. My urologist and rad-onc have done about 1,000 as a team and have the system down pat. They are both young, uro is 43 and rad-onc is late 30's. I had my first round of visits over the last two weeks, saw my rad-onc today. I am two months post treatment and first PSA was <0.10. Remember that I am on HT so this is to be expected. When I told my oncologist I was considering HDR he said ...\"great...permanent seeds are last century...HDR is 21st century....more accurate, more effective, and less side effects.\" Best wishes and let me know in any way I can help, Jack",

      "Content": "I used high dose radiation brachytherapy for a number of reasons. As I understand, it allows for a more conformal dose of radiation both in shape and strength to deliver a more effective radiation cloud with reduced side effects, it delivers a very high dose in a short period of time that can have a different kill effect when compared to the low dose, and it does not leave the pellets in the body. First it does this by using CT scanning to confirm and adjust the delivery catheter placements before the radiation is introduced. I had 15 catheters inserted. This improves on the placement compared to using ultrasound only which can be a few mm off in accuracy. Second, the radiation pellet is delivered through each catheter based on a calculated dwell time. The length of time the pellet stays in any one position determines the radiation dose delivered in that position. This can be different different among the catheters and within any catheter. Thus, more dose can be more specifically tailored to where the docs want it delivered. Third, since the HDR is delivered in multiple procedures (mine was in two procedures one week apart) the rad-onc and urologist can change the approach each time to meet the treatment plan. Since the pellets are not left in the body, there is no possible seed migration or unintended radiation delivery resulting from the body's normal changes over the long period of time the permanent pellets are radioactive. Weight gain or loss, fluid retention changes, prostate size changes, and other changes over the many months the permanent pellets are radioactive can change the delivery dose from what was intended and cause hot and cold spots which can reduce effectiveness and increase side effects. My med-onc supports HDR over permanent seeds based on improved technology and accuracy. He said \"permanent seeds are last century....HDR is 21st century\". You might think of it like open surgery versus robotic surgery. Some of the best information I found to make my decision is at www.cetmc.com. The site is that of Jeffrey Demanes, the HDR pioneer that runs brachytherapy at UCLA. HDR brachytherapy is also used for many other cancers than just prostate cancer including breast, head and neck, lung, soft tissue, bile duct, and women's reproductive organ cancers. Also check the Prostate Cancer Research Institute (www.prostate-cancer.org) website as there are several papers on HDR.

      "Content": "It is a Red Herring regarding no surgery after radiation that didn't work. If the radiation didn't work the surgery would not have worked either as surgery removes a much smaller area than radiation can cover. Brachytherapy and IMRT have proven to be as effective as surgery in lower risk cases and in intermediate and advanced cases more effective than surgery and with less onerous side effects. Major radiation clinics have 10 and 15 year experience statistics. On another website there is a compilation of several thousands of studies that indicate the effectiveness. I will retrieve it and add to a post. Major institutions like Johns Hopkins and MSK have been much more surgicaly oriented over the years and thus have more statistical history for surgery. The advancements in radiation in the last ten years have greatly improved the effectiveness and reduced the side effects. Before you decide on treatment seek several different opinions from both methods and see a medical oncologist who will neither operate nor radiate. Rule of thumb is that in the low risk cases use the method that results in the least side effects. In intermediate and high risk cases seek the method that gives the best cancer control. I was high risk and my surgeon-urologist said no surgery as it wouldn't be effective. He advised HDR Brachytherapy and IMRT. After several other opinions I agreed with his assessment and was so treated.",

      "Content": "I had HDR procedures December 6 amd 13, 2010. I had it in conjunction with IMRT and HT as I am higher risk than you. You look like a great mono candidate according to Demanes' information on his website. I am very happy that I used HDR and I am in Atlanta where the premier permanent seed clinic is. I looked at them but between Demanes and my med-onc I bought into the better accuracy and fewer side effects of HDR. My procedures were well tolerated. My side effects from the first procedure was basically painful urination for two days. The second time they used a different preparation for the catheter and there was no burning. Sitting on hard chairs was tough for about three weeks as it felt like I was sittting on a golf ball. There is a little bit of internal bleeding and the blood follows gravity. For about three weeks my penis and scrotum were black and swollen.....looked pretty wierd. This went away after a few weeks. For the physical aspects a little pain relief was good as well as a warm bath each evening. I was on a number of meds for awhile. Levaquin was used to ward off any infection. I was on a steroid for six days to reduce swelling. Also UTA to numb the urinry tract and Flomax to help the flow. No ED, but the first several ejaculation were dark brown. Volume is also reduced, but sex works well and enjoyable. I am guessing that the dark semen will stop pretty soon. Overall, all went well. Also remember that I was undergoing IMRT so I was at greater risk of side effects than you will be with monotherapy. I would strongly sugggest HDR and you are with two of the pioneers. My urologist and rad-onc have done about 1,000 as a team and have the system down pat. They are both young, uro is 43 and rad-onc is late 30's. I had my first round of visits over the last two weeks, saw my rad-onc today. I am two months post treatment and first PSA was <0.10. Remember that I am on HT so this is to be expected. When I told my oncologist I was considering HDR he said ...\"great...permanent seeds are last century...HDR is 21st century....more accurate, more effective, and less side effects.\" Best wishes and let me know in any way I can help, Jack",

      "Content": "I used high dose radiation brachytherapy for a number of reasons. As I understand, it allows for a more conformal dose of radiation both in shape and strength to deliver a more effective radiation cloud with reduced side effects, it delivers a very high dose in a short period of time that can have a different kill effect when compared to the low dose, and it does not leave the pellets in the body. First it does this by using CT scanning to confirm and adjust the delivery catheter placements before the radiation is introduced. I had 15 catheters inserted. This improves on the placement compared to using ultrasound only which can be a few mm off in accuracy. Second, the radiation pellet is delivered through each catheter based on a calculated dwell time. The length of time the pellet stays in any one position determines the radiation dose delivered in that position. This can be different different among the catheters and within any catheter. Thus, more dose can be more specifically tailored to where the docs want it delivered. Third, since the HDR is delivered in multiple procedures (mine was in two procedures one week apart) the rad-onc and urologist can change the approach each time to meet the treatment plan. Since the pellets are not left in the body, there is no possible seed migration or unintended radiation delivery resulting from the body's normal changes over the long period of time the permanent pellets are radioactive. Weight gain or loss, fluid retention changes, prostate size changes, and other changes over the many months the permanent pellets are radioactive can change the delivery dose from what was intended and cause hot and cold spots which can reduce effectiveness and increase side effects. My med-onc supports HDR over permanent seeds based on improved technology and accuracy. He said \"permanent seeds are last century....HDR is 21st century\". You might think of it like open surgery versus robotic surgery. Some of the best information I found to make my decision is at www.cetmc.com. The site is that of Jeffrey Demanes, the HDR pioneer that runs brachytherapy at UCLA. HDR brachytherapy is also used for many other cancers than just prostate cancer including breast, head and neck, lung, soft tissue, bile duct, and women's reproductive organ cancers. Also check the Prostate Cancer Research Institute (www.prostate-cancer.org) website as there are several papers on HDR. Demanes is a featured speaker at the Prostate Cancer Conference in September in LA.",

      "Content": "I had HDR procedures December 6 amd 13, 2010. I had it in conjunction with IMRT and HT as I am higher risk than you. You look like a great mono candidate according to Demanes' information on his website. I am very happy that I used HDR and I am in Atlanta where the premier permanent seed clinic is. I looked at them but between Demanes and my med-onc I bought into the better accuracy and fewer side effects of HDR. My procedures were well tolerated. My side effects from the first procedure was basically painful urination for two days. The second time they used a different preparation for the catheter and there was no burning. Sitting on hard chairs was tough for about three weeks as it felt like I was sittting on a golf ball. There is a little bit of internal bleeding and the blood follows gravity. For about three weeks my penis and scrotum were black and swollen.....looked pretty wierd. This went away after a few weeks. For the physical aspects a little pain relief was good as well as a warm bath each evening. I was on a number of meds for awhile. Levaquin was used to ward off any infection. I was on a steroid for six days to reduce swelling. Also UTA to numb the urinry tract and Flomax to help the flow. No ED, but the first several ejaculation were dark brown. Volume is also reduced, but sex works well and enjoyable. I am guessing that the dark semen will stop pretty soon. Overall, all went well. Also remember that I was undergoing IMRT so I was at greater risk of side effects than you will be with monotherapy. I would strongly sugggest HDR and you are with two of the pioneers. My urologist and rad-onc have done about 1,000 as a team and have the system down pat. They are both young, uro is 43 and rad-onc is late 30's. I had my first round of visits over the last two weeks, saw my rad-onc today. I am two months post treatment and first PSA was <0.10. Remember that I am on HT so this is to be expected. When I told my oncologist I was considering HDR he said ...\"great...permanent seeds are last century...HDR is 21st century....more accurate, more effective, and less side effects.\" Best wishes and let me know in any way I can help, Jack",

      "Content": "It is a Red Herring regarding no surgery after radiation that didn't work. If the radiation didn't work the surgery would not have worked either as surgery removes a much smaller area than radiation can cover. Brachytherapy and IMRT have proven to be as effective as surgery in lower risk cases and in intermediate and advanced cases more effective than surgery and with less onerous side effects. Major radiation clinics have 10 and 15 year experience statistics. On another website there is a compilation of several thousands of studies that indicate the effectiveness. I will retrieve it and add to a post. Major institutions like Johns Hopkins and MSK have been much more surgicaly oriented over the years and thus have more statistical history for surgery. The advancements in radiation in the last ten years have greatly improved the effectiveness and reduced the side effects. Before you decide on treatment seek several different opinions from both methods and see a medical oncologist who will neither operate nor radiate. Rule of thumb is that in the low risk cases use the method that results in the least side effects. In intermediate and high risk cases seek the method that gives the best cancer control. I was high risk and my surgeon-urologist said no surgery as it wouldn't be effective. He advised HDR Brachytherapy and IMRT. After several other opinions I agreed with his assessment and was so treated.",

      "Content": "I agree with Newporter. As I understand, the radiation bounce is typically in the 18-36 month range after seeing the PSA steadily decline. Your PSA looks to be steadily increasing just after radiation. I would seek another opinion. There is some great information about PSA post-radiation bounce on www.prostrcision.com, the website of Dr Frank Critz. He pioneered LDR Brachytherapy and Adjuvant IMRT and his clinic has treated more than 15,000 men. He has very good information explaining what the PSA should do after treatment and how the bounce shows up.",

      "Content": "You are high risk, as was I. My uro would not operate because the nomograms indicated a very high probability that surgery would not be curative. He was not going to subject me to the risks and side effects of both surgery and radiation. I had a combination of High Dose rate brachytherapy and IMRT external beam radiotherapy. Added to this is a three year course of hormone therapy. So far my PSA has gone from 59 to <.1 in the first 100 days. I am approaching two years fom the radiation and have no side effects or problems with urinary, bowel, or sexual functions. The above advise is excellent and indicates that you should seek multiple opinions from urologists, radiologists, and medical oncologists. JohnT's point about the nerve bundles is very important.",

Due to the narrow beam it is not as effective for intermediate, advanced, multi-focal, or to cover the areas just outside the gland. The IMRT/IGRT are generally better for these situations. Even where Proton Beam is indicated it has not proven to be any bettter than IMRT/IGRT in cancer effectiveness and it about three times as expensive. We are seeing more insurance companies declining to cover Proton Beam due to it's higher cost and similar effectiveness.",

The treatment success is the same with surgery or radiation, but the radiation has fewer and less severe side effects. With brachytherapy you can choose between low dose permanent seed radiation and high dose temporary radiation. I went with the HDR and am very pleased with the procedure and results. In all, I missed two days of work due to HDR and I also had 25 IMRT sessions. You look like an excelent candidate for HDR.
