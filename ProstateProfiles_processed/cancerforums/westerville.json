      "Content": "Hi, Eligard is the generic form of lupron. You mentioned taking casodex now, it should have been given two weeks prior to the eligard to stop any T flare. I had a shot of eligard in october and just waiting on my psa test results after 3months so I then may be able see if it works for me. I have an appointment Jan 3rd to see Dr. Charles \"snuffy Myers in Virginia. He will put me on triple blockage adt3 with the added avodart. I am gleason 4/5=9 also and have been having trouble getting the right treatment. I understand your complaint about been diagnosed earlier. My family doctor keep telling me psa numbers were wonderful only to find out after going to a urologist and having a biopsy that the reason my numbers were wonderful was because my cancer is aggressive and doesn't produce much psa. Well I hope you just got a bad batch of eligard and it is working for you and me now. Have a nice holiday, Westerville",
