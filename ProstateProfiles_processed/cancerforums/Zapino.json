The urologist gave him one month antibiotics cure and repeat PSA after. I choose to make an MRI 01.2018 multiparametric MRI 3T: prostate volume 27 cc Moderate hipertrophyc transitional area multicystic/ mutinodular Periferic area- in the middle 1/3 of left lobe oval , meniscoidale area of maximum 10 mm- PIRAD 4 whitout contact with prostatic capsula. No lymph node increased in dimension Seminal vesicles with simetric reduces distension with moderate T2 hipointense content. 02.2018 fusion biopsy 12 cores + 3 target from suspected area. 6/15 positive cores Target 1: 5 mm Gleason 3 pattern from 12 mm Target 2: 6 mm gleason 3 pattern from 9 mm Target 3: 13 mm gleason 3 pattern from 13 mm Left lobe : appex 10 mm gleason 3 from 10 mm Middle 7 mm gleason 3 pattern from 14 mm Lateral appex 3 gleason 3 pattern from 14 mm. No extraprostatic extension, no perineural invasion, no angiolymphatic invasion, no necrosis. 29.02.2018 PSA after antibiotic 3,760 The URO said that is 50% probability the cancer to be exceed capsula to the appex because of the less tissue in that rea. Is possible to be such an advanced cancer with Gleason 6 and normal PSa? Does that MRI description of seminal vesicles corresponds to an invasion at that level? Which should be the therapeutic approach in your opinion? Is there a chance of curative treatment or at least 15 years survival? Thank you all for existing. Sorry about my english is not my native language we are located in Eastern Europe. Sincerely yours , a very worried daughter.",
