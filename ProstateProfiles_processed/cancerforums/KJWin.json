      "Content": "Originally Posted by Otago Two weeks is really too short of a time... If the jump up is temporarily caused by some version of prostatitis... even asymptomatic prostatitis, then two weeks is not enough time to allow it to calm down. A jump from under 2, to over 8, is much more likely caused by such a inflammatory situation than by cancer. However, given your father's experience, I doubt you or your doctor are willing to wait 3 months. So go ahead and get the test... two weeks is NOT waiting too long by any means. Good that at age 40 you got a benchmark measurement of your normal psa, which assuming this latest one is due to a \"itis\" of some sort, will leave you with a mark from which to judge future psa results. Let us know the results. I would love to find out that this is all caused by some inflammatory situation. I've been reading articles all over the place looking for another cause which fits my symptoms, or lack thereof. I think the two week retest was more to validate the accuracy of the first test rather than see if something had changed in me in two weeks. In the meantime, I went in for the urinalysis earlier today and the results came back amazingly quickly. Everything looks to be within normal ranges. WBC was 0/HPF which seems to rule out asympomatic prostatitis (though that's based on my poor use of Google rather than a discussion with the urologist since their office is closed). Also, unrelated, I realized as I was looking up test results that I was wrong about my initial PSA a year ago... it was 1.8 not 1.35. Not sure how I messed that up. I am currently swinging wildly between \"it must be something else, just need to figure out what\" and \"it must be cancer\". Waiting and not knowing is terrible. Thanks all for listening - it helps to have a place to vent/share. Jason",

      "Content": "August of last year I posted in this thread about high PSA. The last year has been interesting and I could use some advice. The short history: Father died a couple years ago of aggressive prostate cancer at the age of 66. Doctor recommended annual PSA. 06/12/2015 PSA 1.80 DRE normal, prostate \"small\" 08/15/2016 PSA 8.02 08/29/2016 PSA 7.32 09/13/2016 PSA 4.79 10/13/2016 PSA 3.81 Ordered free/total PSA but lab only does the free test if above 4. 01/09/2017 PSA 2.55 DRE normal, prostate \"small\" 04/10/2017 PSA 3.26 The doctor has recommended late last year that we monitor every three months. The high number and subsequent drop seems to point to something other than cancer as the cause which made me very happy. The latest result came in higher than the previous three month test and the doctor has ordered another test in six weeks. He says he recommends a biopsy if the next result doesn't go back down. I realize this last test isn't actually that much higher than the previous one but the direction was distressing and honestly I'm more concerned now that the doctor is talking about biopsy again. Presumably he wouldn't be thinking about that unless he thought there was a good reason. So, I have a couple questions. First, if it were you would you go get a second opinion at this point or just keep going and possibly get the biopsy? Second, does a biopsy seem reasonable at this point? I'd like to know the free/total number because that seems like it might be informative but apparently the lab will only do the breakdown for results over 4. Thanks for any words of wisdom that you can provide! Jason",
