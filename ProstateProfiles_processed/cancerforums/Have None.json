      "Content": "I meet with a second surgeon yesterday about having an RALP. When I told him I had a 30 core fusion biopsy at NIH last month he said that having saturation biopsy\u0092s causes more stress on the gland and increases inflammation. The increased inflammation then cause the nerve bundles to bond with the prostate more, making separation more difficult with the need to sometimes cut some of the nerves. The surgeon suggested waiting at least 10 weeks before having surgery and take a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) like Motrin 4 times a day for a few weeks. Has anyone had surgery after a saturation biopsy, if so what was your experience and what were you told by the Surgeon? On a second Note: I had a TRUS at the doctors office. 3 cores came back positive 3+3 3+3 3+4 The cores were reread at NIH and came back all 3+3\u0092s Second opinions do count\u0085 So do Fusion Biopsy\u0092s I had a 3T MRI with a rectum coil and a Fusion Biopsy 3 months after my first. The MRI showed 3 spots they wanted to target during the Fusion Biopsy plus the standard 12 cores. My latest results came back with a 4+3 on one of the cores.
