      "Content": "Hi guys, I am new to the site and would like to hear from you, more experienced, about a very tough decision to make. Here is my situation: DOB: 1977 (41 years now) Diagnosed: 05/2018 biopsy showed 3/12 adenocarcinomas 2 G6 and 1 G7 (4+3) DaVinci surgery: 07/2018 (good recovery for ED and continence) Final report: Gleason 4+3; no lymph nodes involved; no surgical margins; perineurial invasion present and focal extra capsular extension PT3a. Post surgery PSAs: 08/18-0.06; 11/18-0.07; 01/19-0.1; 01/01-0.08 (2 wks after the first PSA). Consulted 3 oncologists here in Brazil and they are divergent about the next step. 1 of them suggested to wait for a clearer signal of recurrence. The other two suggested Pelvic RT as adjuvant for the surgery and are in doubt about initiating ADT for 6 months, considering my age, prognosis, etc. They say it is controversial and the studies that showed benefit in combined ADT+aRT were focused in more adverse pathological findings than mine. I just started the RT sessions last week but I am dying here trying to decide whether to start or not the ADT, considering its side effects and everything. What do you think about the best approach in this case? Starting ADT with such a low PSA would be good to increase the chances of cure or just a palliative treatment that can contribute to an earlier castrate resistance disease? Thanks in advance Mauricio",
