Today is the beginning of the new world order. I got some of those Depends, you know, the package with the studly, verile guy half my age who just left the gym. That made me feel better. The next ones will be the ones with the older guy with a little paunch. That'll make me feel better too! I\u0092m on my 3rd pair of briefs for the day. I\u0092m encouraged by the fact that I can stop and start and have a sense of urgency. Best of luck! Keith",

Minimal incontinence, ED still an issue but possible with VED. I am seeing my radiological oncologist next week to discuss if I should have adjuvant radiation or wait until i have any rise in PSA. Question is should I have RT now or wait? Thanks, Keith",

      "Content": "Let me begin by saying that I am overwhelmed by the comments after my first post on the forum. They all were welcoming, compassionate, insightful and savvy. There was hard data, links to information and relevant studies, and thoughts based on personal experience and knowledge. It was clear that the consensus opinion was simply, \u201csooner is better\u201d! To that end I took a few steps today. I investigated the possibility of being referred to an outside urologist for a second opinion or the possibility of treatment. There is the Veterans choice program which evolved from the fact that vets were forced to wait unreasonable amounts of time before getting appointments at the VA. This also included those where the distance from a VA facility created an undue hardship for the veteran or the VA is unable to provide care in a reasonable amount of time. I don\u2019t meet the criteria for this because I was able to get the \u201cinitial\u201d appointments within 30 days. The need for subsequent treatment does not alone have the 30 day window as a qualifying factor. The 30 day rule does not apply in the waiting period for treatment after the initial exam. Also I was offered a surgery date of December 13th for open surgery but wanted to have the daVinci robotic surgery with first available date being January 29th which is over 8 months from my original request for a urology consultation. The fact that treatment was offered within a reasonable amount of time may have been a factor in not being sent out for Community care. I made an appointment with the most highly rated/recommended urologist in the Twin Cities for an initial appointment on November 19th. He has done well over 4000 procedures and was one of the first to be trained and certified in the daVinci process. His surgical schedule could be as early as the last week of December. He does not take VA insurance but does accept Medicare. I don\u2019t know what kind of co-pays and costs there might be but it is a secondary factor. I still have my VA schedule as an option. I\u2019m in Washington\u2007DC thru next Tuesday as I like being here at the Vietnam Wall for Veterans Day. When I get home I\u2019ll dig into some of the links and studies suggested. A few questions asked of me; I\u2019m 71 years old and was in Vietnam from August 1967 until June 1968. My PSA was 12.7 in August 2018 but hadn\u2019t had any recent PSA tests as my chronic BPH was thought to account for any increases in PSA. Again I can\u2019t thank all of your for your welcoming, compassionate responses to me first post. Despite my unintentional qualification for membership it\u2019s my kind of club!

There was hard data, links to information and relevant studies, and thoughts based on personal experience and knowledge. It was clear that the consensus opinion was simply, \u201csooner is better\u201d! To that end I took a few steps today. I investigated the possibility of being referred to an outside urologist for a second opinion or the possibility of treatment. There is the Veterans choice program which evolved from the fact that vets were forced to wait unreasonable amounts of time before getting appointments at the VA. This also included those where the distance from a VA facility created an undue hardship for the veteran or the VA is unable to provide care in a reasonable amount of time. I don\u2019t meet the criteria for this because I was able to get the \u201cinitial\u201d appointments within 30 days. The need for subsequent treatment does not alone have the 30 day window as a qualifying factor. The 30 day rule does not apply in the waiting period for treatment after the initial exam. Also I was offered a surgery date of December 13th for open surgery but wanted to have the daVinci robotic surgery with first available date being January 29th which is over 8 months from my original request for a urology consultation. The fact that treatment was offered within a reasonable amount of time may have been a factor in not being sent out for Community care. I made an appointment with the most highly rated/recommended urologist in the Twin Cities for an initial appointment on November 19th. He has done well over 4000 procedures and was one of the first to be trained and certified in the daVinci process. His surgical schedule could be as early as the last week of December. He does not take VA insurance but does accept Medicare. I don\u2019t know what kind of co-pays and costs there might be but it is a secondary factor. I still have my VA schedule as an option. I\u2019m in Washington\u2007DC thru next Tuesday as I like being here at the Vietnam Wall for Veterans Day. When I get home I\u2019ll dig into some of the links and studies suggested. A few questions asked of me; I\u2019m 71 years old and was in Vietnam from August 1967 until June 1968. My PSA was 12.7 in August 2018 but hadn\u2019t had any recent PSA tests as my chronic BPH was thought to account for any increases in PSA. Again I can\u2019t thank all of your for your welcoming, compassionate responses to me first post. Despite my unintentional qualification for membership it\u2019s my kind of club!
