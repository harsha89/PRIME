What does it mean when the patient is getting Zometa infusion once a month for two years? Is this still experimental to give to prostate cancer patients who have cancer metastisized to the backbone? Is it used to prevent metastesis? Also received a Lupron shot and hadn't had one of those for a while, what does this mean? Also I wouldn't mind knowing the best place to find the answers to these questions, I keep ending up reading an advertisement or a drug company site which I'm skeptical of the information since they want everyone to use their drug of course.......",
