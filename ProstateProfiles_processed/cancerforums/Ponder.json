With Stage 4 prostrate cancer, I have blindly followed the advice and treatment of Boise\u0092s cancer experts. Nothing seems to work. It must be me. I have asked the local experts to review the drug trials on file with the FDA. Survival rates of patients taking the drugs looks like a lucky person flipping a coin. In almost every case, life expectancy of patients taking the drug is just a few months longer than the control group taking the placebo. Speak up experts -",
