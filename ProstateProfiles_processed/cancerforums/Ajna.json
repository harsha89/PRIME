      "Content": "Hi I have had an MRI on my prostate and my consultant has said their are a number of different small areas of very non-specific changes in the prostate and to some degree in the bone around where the spine meets the pelvis! He is going to review this at a regular meeting with his team and get back to me on how they wish to proceed. Can anyone tell me what on earth this means please? My psa is 1.7. What is a non- specific change? Thanks.",

      "Content": "Thanks for the replies. What do I do if they decide the prostate is ok and don't want to do a biopsy? The letter also says there is an inflammed area where the spine joins the pelvis which may be why I am experiencing pain so an orthorpedic opinion may be an option once they are happy with the prostate!
