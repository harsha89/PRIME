      "Content": "Thank you, all. I had pretty much decided to get the biopsy before posting ... just because that's who I am. Faced with a personal crisis like this, I have to know and I have to do something. But in this case I wanted to be sure I wasn't doing the wrong thing. This is the key ..... Originally Posted by Replicant Catalona and other influential doctors say that a rise of more 0.4 or more in one year is reason to suspect cancer. BPH (benign enlargement) can cause PSA to rise, but much more gradually than that. Prostatitis, on the other hand, causes much larger and sudden spikes (3.0 or greater rise in one year). So you don't fall into either category according to that thinking. Your PSA velocity is apparently too fast for BPH to be the cause, too slow for prostatitis. I have a strong 'feeling' it's cancer. But I have to know, and I have to do something. And the sooner the better.",
