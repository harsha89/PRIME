      "Content": "Hi everybody. It's been an interesting, sometimes comical, week following my DaVinci RP on July 14. Here are some vignettes of some of the happenings: Day 2 of being home: The large sticker on my leg that held the catheter tube in place came off. My wife and I tried everything to try to get it to stay on. We finally held in on with some athletic wrap. It looked hilarious. Day 3 of being home: I kept having pains in my lower abdomen like I had a UTI. Thankfully, reading posts on this forum relieved my fears. Day 4 of of being home: In the middle of the afternoon, I noticed that the pain in my abdomen was increasing and no urine was in the catheter tube. I shifted positions on my couch, gave the catheter a little \"turn\" near my little buddy and voila! The clear tube began filling the bag! It was a bit unnerving, but what a relief! Day 5 of being home: During surgery, the 7 incision spots from the surgery were sealed with the surgical super glue material. It seems I'm allergic to it. My incisions are raised and red and really itchy. Benadryl cream and tablets seemed to help a bit. I had my first BM, which was a relief, but also a bit painful in the catheter area. Days 6 and 7 of being home: More UTI pain, and it's getting difficult to find a comfortable lying/sitting position. Day 8 (Today): Back to the doc to rid my life of this vile serpent from hell. Removing it wasn't painful, just slightly uncomfortable, and just for a few seconds. I'm glad I took a pad with me to the doctor's office (again, thank you, forum members!). I've had leaks throughout the day, but nothing too significant. That is, except when I was changing clothes and lifted my leg onto a table to put on a sock. Bad idea. I guess that's why they invented mops. Here's my final pathology report: Gleason 3+4 Cancer in left and right lobes Tumor size: .9 cm Margins free from tumor No cancer in 7 pelvic lymph nodes Weight: 56 grams Staging: pT2c, pN0, pM-n/a Overall, it wasn't a week I'd like to re-live, but I'm thankful that I was able to be home and most of all that the cancer hasn't spread past the margins. My doc said he'd check my PSA every 3 months for 4 years. My surgeon, Dr. Kevin Art at St. Joseph East hospital in Lexington, KY is fantastic and so very capable. I can't recommend him enough. The hospital staff were also wonderful. From what I'm reading, I'm entering the recovery stage where patience is needed the most. I'm thankful we have each other to journey together. Bernard",

      "Content": "I have just been diagnosed with PC. My father has a friend who is highly skeptical of modern medicine. Here are some claims his friend made to warn me about treatment. I'd love to know what you all think of this! \"Over 50% of all biopsies are false positives and biopsies do not tell the real issues. If you had a little balloon full of poison jelly and you poked a hole in that little balloon (biopsy)...then the poison jelly could leak out. That is exactly what happens with a biopsy...the cancer leaks out and then spreads. Dr. Allan Spreen, one of the head researchers for the National Institute of Health (NIH) told the doctors that biopsies was the reason for people dying from cancer...the biopsy was spreading the cancer cells and he proved it to them. He was told to sit down and shut up that cancer was the bread and butter of the medical profession.\" \"The best way to detect cancers is by Thermography ...infra red photography that delineates temperature variables to a 1,000th of a degree F.\" \"There has never ever...NEVER EVER... been anyone cured of cancer via radiation, surgery, chemo, or the big pharma medicines. They do not want a cure...they want an endless stream of $$$$. Most people have no idea what having \"cancer in remission\" means. It just means that the cancer has not grown in two months in succession based on PSA protein reading. You can be on deaths door step and have cancer in remission.\" \"Modern medicines...and especially oncologists... use massive scare tactics to make people do as they say.\"",

I even have great days and not so great days. I'm going through 2-3 pull ups a day (I call them 'man wraps') because I'm still too freaked out to go with just pads. While all of this is frustrating, I know its most likely temporary and I continue to focus on the fact that the cancerous prostate is long gone! After reading the sticky post about the Mayo kegel regimen, I've been following that process. All the best to you!",

I'm 5 weeks post-op from my DaVinci surgery and have found this community to be incredibly helpful and supportive. As you read posts, remember that your experience will be your own. Let us know how we can help. Ask lots of questions, and be at peace. There's definitely quality of life after prostate removal. Keep the faith! Bernard",

      "Content": "Hi everybody. It's been awhile since I've posted anything to the forum, but I've been lurking! My daVinci RP was in mid-July 2016. So far, I've had one post-surgical PSA test that put me in the \"Zero Club.\" I'm so thankful. Continence is great, and physically I'm doing just fine. ED is still an issue, though, and that's the reason for my post. I had no idea of the psychological toll of not having an erection for 6 months. I'm thankful I don't have cancer anymore. I'm thankful that incontinence is gone. In the reality of this new normal I suppose I'm grieving for life as it used to be. I'm already tired of pumps and the thought of possible injections. I'm working out five days a week and work is as busy as it has always been. It's not like I'm sitting around the house pondering these things and feeling sorry for myself. I'd cherish any counsel from you brothers who have been in this situation far longer than I have. As always, thank you! Bernard",

      "Content": "It seems like so much longer than 3 weeks ago that the surgical robot got to know me really well. My recovery has been interesting, anxiety-ridden, and sometimes humorous. I have good days and bad days. It's like taking two steps forward and one step back. At least that's still making progress. One day I'll be dry, and another day I'll be leaking like crazy. I do a lot of standing when I work (I'm a graduate-school professor), and I notice most of the squirts while I'm on my feet rather than sitting. I've been going to work for a couple of hours a day this week and I'm zonked by the time I get home. As many have posted, a majority of the leaking seems to come in the evening, when muscles are tired, but hardly at all when I sleep; although I do find myself having to get up to go to the bathroom 2-3 times a night. For those of you who are dreading the post-surgery life, I can say that 3 weeks out, my body has become accustomed to the new normal quite well, and I see improvements every day - and the doc did a miracle job with the nerve-sparing technique... Now for the big question: On the day my catheter was removed (day 8 after surgery), my doctor was concerned that the 7 incision points were a bit puffy and warm. He prescribed the antibiotic Bactrim for a week as a precaution. Although it caused some loose stools, I didn't have any issues with it. That is, until 2 days after I finished the prescription. I woke up at 1:30am this morning with a terrible burning itch. I had large, raised hives all over my body, from the top of my head to my feet. In the morning, my wife took me to my primary care doc and he shot me up with Prednisone and gave a script for tablet form. Since that injection, I've been leaking like a busted pipe. I know this medicine is nasty stuff, but does anyone know if Prednisone has been known to affect incontinence or recovery from Prostate removal? Again, I'm thankful for this very helpful community.",

The symptoms should go away after the medicine is out of the body. I've been up since 6am and I'm already on my third Depends at 4:30pm (I call Depends a 'man wrap').

      "Content": "My doctor texted me this morning and told me that the steroids will actually impair healing. Do I want to heal from the surgery or have burning, itching hives? I think I'll go with the hives. Hopefully Benadryl will do the trick. However, I discovered that taking Benadryl at night has its own risks! I believe somebody shared a similar situation on another post about taking NyQuil before bedtime and flooding the mattress! http://www.cancerforums.net/threads/...-the-Titanic!?",

      "Content": "Great post MF. Thanks for the info. According to my pharmacist, a common side effect of Prednisone for folks with incontinence issues is an increase in the incontinence. The symptoms should go away after the medicine is out of the body. I've been up since 6am and I'm already on my third Depends at 4:30pm (I call Depends a 'man wrap'). Before the Prednisone, I was going all day with just one.",
