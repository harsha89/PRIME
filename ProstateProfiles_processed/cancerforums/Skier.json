I personally have chosen surgery, after a long talk with the urologist who performed the biopsy. After a weekend of thought with my wife, we came to the surgery conclusion based on a few things brought up by my urologist. One, (and these are his words) you take the side effects up front, and at 52 you can accomodate them and get over them easier. His experience is that at your age (and mine), the side effects after robotic nerve sparing surgery are transient and most of his patients have gotten over them. Also, you will have a definitive pathology report after the surgery. His assessment of radiation is the same as the above post, as after a number of years, the side effects of radiation can make things worse. Just my thought processes and how I came to my decision. It's a tough thing to go through. Hang in there. According to my doc, this thing is close to 100% cureable at our age that there is in the cancer world.",

Radical prostatectomy, from what my urologist said, is simply the removal of the prostate. There won't necessarily be any castration or hormones, only in extreme case where the cancer has spread. He says the risk of long term incontinence is low in younger, active men (like you or I) if the nerves get spared. The risk of long term ED is going down too. Posters on this forum state a 50% chance of incontinence, but my urologist says in his experience, within the last few years that has dropped way down, and mostly in older, overweight, sedentary men. My doc did mention HIFU. It's not offered here in the US, but he does have references and indicated it looks promising, although his take on it was he likes more long term information. As for the depression. I'm over the initial shock and bad mood from my diagnosis. Right now I'm trying to be confident and get things over with, since I've made my treatment decision. I can relate to the stress from being laid off. I was in that boat several years ago, and the stress is immense. If you can get by on your wife's salary, I'd volunteer, maybe find a part-time position, and concentrate on getting well. I'm proud of you for getting on the bike. I haven't been able convince myself to ride mine due to bad thoughts of what's happening down there in the saddle region. Keep the exercise going if you feel better.",
