    "Content": "Hi, I've had most of these symptoms for a while but they've happend at different times and was never able to describe it well for my doctors. I've been soon some research and it's starting to sound like I need to ask my doctor to check for. I have problems with weak stream and dribbling. I also have some leakage throughout the day. I strain to get all the urine out and always feel like I need to pee. No blood or painful urination. I do get dull Pain behind my right testicle and pain in my right hip especially when walking fast or running. I've also recently began having lower back pain that's been pretty severe a couple of times. Hernia was ruled out. Anyone have any ideas?",
