      "Content": "This is my first post and like most others, I have a lot of questions about being newly diagnosed with Prostate Cancer Stage2. I had a biopsy done two weeks ago and was called in for the results. My doctor has me scheduled for a CT Scan and bone scan on December 30 to ensure the cancer has not metastasized. My questions is this, how could he diagnose me with stage 2 if he has not yet ruled out the spread of cancer to other areas? My PSA is 8.7. Out of 12 biopsies 7 came back positive. My Gleason scores were 7's 8's and one 9. Previous PSA around one year ago was 4.6.",

The urologist told me it was Stage 2 and gave me a lot of paperwork to read about it. Do you understand the CaPStage Risk Assessment? Mine shows 96.6% above average with the baseline being 8.8%? The node involvement: 998.1% increased risk? I don't understand what any of this means. Originally Posted by HighlanderCFH Hi Easco, Welcome to the forum.

It is important to realize that a biopsy report is ONLY a guess. They can be wrong in about 20% of the cases. The abdominal CT and bone scans will help give a clearer picture on what the actual staging is. Was it the urologist who told you it is stage 2 -- or was it on the pathologist's report? Good luck with those scans. Hopefully they will further suggest you are only stage 2 and you can then hope for curative treatment. Good luck! Chuck",

Good luck with those scans. Hopefully they will further suggest you are only stage 2 and you can then hope for curative treatment. Good luck! Chuck",
