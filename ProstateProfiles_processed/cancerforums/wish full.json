If your doctor has sent them over you should be all right. I didn't want to take the chance when I got my second opinion. Hoping for the besr Dennis",

      "Content": "Hi Guys, I haven't been on here for quite a while due to not having any issues with Brachytherapy. I would like to give you my experience with this procedure. You can see by my signature where I'm at with PSA, so I'll start with Procedure done on 7/10, 2014. One month after procedure PSA 3.3 and having urgency and leakage and trouble urinating. Changing a pad once a day. On 9/6 PSA 1.1, still some problems with the same symptoms as before. On 12/5 PSA .5 with no symptoms for the last couple of months. Never any ED problems after the first couple of months. I know of one person who had brachytherapy about 12 years ago without any problems. I would like to start a thread to ask for people who have had brachytherapy at least 5 years ago to share there experience? I see a lot of people on here who had surgery and still talking about it years later. I would like to know if they have ED problems I went to Emory University for my treatment and the chairman of the urology department recommended brachytherapy. So I went with it. Not all people are a candidate for this procedure. Well. I wish the best for anyone who has Prostate Cancer",

      "Content": "I had an MRI with out contrast and with it. I wish I could of had one with a rectal coil but not offered in my area. Could someone give me there opinion on these results? Rounded area of T2 signal hypointensity within the left central zone with dimensions as above with adjacent focus of T2 signal hypointensity measuring 1.4cm X 0.7 X 1.5 cm extending into the left base peripheral zone adjacent to the bladder. There is no corresponding restriction of diffusion or rapid contrast washout. Findings suggest possible carcinoma in this area of the peripheral zone with one out of three positive parametric findings placing probability at approx. 50%. There is no evidence for extracapsular extension or regional metastatic disease. I don't understand the one out of three positive parametric findings. I've looked on the internet and can't understand the explanation. Any help would be appreciated. Waiting for biopsy which could take more than week. The periprostatice fat is preserved with no evidence for extracapsular tumor extension. The seminal vesicles are normal in appearance. NO pelvic lymphadenopathy is identified. No aggressive bony lesions identified in the visualized portions of the pelvis. The bladder is unremarkable. Thanks",

Prostate, right base, core biopsy: benign prostatic glands and stroma with chronic inflammation. Prostate, left base, core biopsy: adenocarcinoma of prostate, Geason score 3+3=6 involving approx. 5% What I'm really concerned about is the prostate covering the Apex and being high grade. I see this as a possible apex margin due to the amount and being high grade. Anyone familiar with this? You were right Walnut that MRI I had was useless.

      "Content": "Originally Posted by Mikla wishful, you should really consolidate all your posts to some degree and put your info in your signature in order to make it easier for folks to reply. Unfortunately, you have joined our club. Your biopsy appears to say you have Gleason 7 (3+4) with three cores positive with a max involvement of a core of 20%. The \"High grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia\" or HGPIN looks like another read on that core or another from that area. It means they found tissue that may be a precursor to cancer, but cannot be called cancer. It does not mean that the cancer they found on the apex is \"high grade\"... your Gleason score is what is important. By NCCN guidelines you are Intermediate Risk. I would suggest that you have your slides sent out for a 2nd opinion to validate the scores. In some cases the scores are changed... and if changed down, then AS would be an option. Regardless, if the score remains 3+4, you are still in an excellent position for successful treatment (or even AS dependent on your age). What did your urologist recommend? Still no need to panic, you have time to think through this and what you want to do. Best of luck and keep us updated. Hi Mikla, I'm not sure on what you mean about consolidating my posts. Can you explain? that to me",

      "Content": "Hi, I'm new on this site and was looking for information from you. I first had PSA in 2008 that was 1.74 and 2009 1.61. I did get Dre I think that is the abbreviation for those two years. I didn't test until oct 2012 which was 3.1. I did not get the DRe test. Then in March 2 2014, I got the test and got 4.9 with no Dre. The first thing that comes to mind has it spread. I've been reading the posts and really don't see that many people saying they had cancer that spread with that number. I realize that the number is 1.8 difference. By the way I'm 65 years old. I know there are different prostate cancer that spread faster. I hope I can hear from you. If you need any more information I can supply you with that. I'm suppose to go the doctor at the end of the month. I wish I could find a doctor who would do the DRE test for me I think that would solve some problems. I could get the Free PSa done tomorrow if that would tell me anything. Please help thanks Wishfull",

      "Content": "Well, with my MRI results and my PSA number I decided to go with the saturated biopsy. Had that this morning and the doctor took a sample of 40. Does taking that many samples make a difference with my Gleason score? Now what I need to be doing is deciding on who will do the surgery. I read some where in here that a doctor had done 6000 prostate surgeries. Now you're taking about experience. I live in the Atlanta area and would travel if it meant getting someone with the many surgeries . Will get the results of my biopsies in a week and will let you know.

      "Content": "Hi, I'm new on this site and was looking for information from you. I first had PSA in 2008 that was 1.74 and 2009 1.61. I did get Dre I think that is the abbreviation for those two years. I didn't test until oct 2012 which was 3.1. I did not get the DRe test. Then in March 2 2014, I got the test and got 4.9 with no Dre. The first thing that comes to mind has it spread. I've been reading the posts and really don't see that many people saying they had cancer that spread with that number. I realize that the number is 1.8 difference. By the way I'm 65 years old. I know there are different prostate cancer that spread faster. I hope I can hear from you. If you need any more information I can supply you with that. I'm suppose to go the doctor at the end of the month. I wish I could find a doctor who would do the DRE test for me I think that would solve some problems. I could get the Free PSa done tomorrow if that would tell me anything. Please help thanks Wishfull",

Then in March 2 2014, I got the test and got 4.9 with no Dre. The first thing that comes to mind has it spread. I've been reading the posts and really don't see that many people saying they had cancer that spread with that number. I realize that the number is 1.8 difference. By the way I'm 65 years old. I know there are different prostate cancer that spread faster. I hope I can hear from you. If you need any more information I can supply you with that. I'm suppose to go the doctor at the end of the month. I wish I could find a doctor who would do the DRE test for me I think that would solve some problems. I could get the Free PSa done tomorrow if that would tell me anything. Please help thanks Wishfull",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by malbaby Hi wish full. The following is my own personal opinion. Your particular situation obviously depends on what stage your cancer is at. There are a lot more people on this forum with greater knowledge than me. Once I had decided on having treatment....the choice is between surgery and bracchytheraphy, I chose bracchy because it is less invasive and the risks of complications are less. Post bracchy I have experienced urgency, frequency, dysuria and poor stream. I currently take Flomax which helps with alleviating the problems. I often think, did I make the right decision in having treatment, but then I think that I could be much worse off if I ended up with cancer spreading to other areas of my body. The question to ask yourself and your doctor is....what are the consequences in not having any treatment versus lifestyle post treatment. Hi malbaby, I understand your concern. What it really weird I have these problems right now after having a saturation biopsy. It's been now about two weeks. It seems like it came from the catheter. I'm going to ask my Doctor about that and see what he says How long ago did you have treatment? Good luck.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by RobertG Like you, I had a recommendation from my urologist which I appreciated. We are very similar people - younger (50s) and still very active in sports. He said if it were him, he'd choose brachytherapy partly because of the incontinence issues with surgery which are difficult to deal with in high impact sports like running. I then had a doctor friend of mine do a little research for me and he made the same recommendation. He said that it was clear that the results for brachytherapy are getting better and better over the years, so it is important to look at newer data. My own research supported this, some of the internet searches came up with stuff from the 90s or early 2000s which heavily leaned towards surgery, but if you look at data in the last 10 years or so brachytherapy looks like a very solid option. I would be concerned about the doctor saying that surgery is an option after brachytherapy. My understanding is that it is much riskier than surgery without radiation and not often done. I made my choice on the assumption that it would not be a likely salvage option. Thanks for the reply. I feel that it should be the same. I go on Thursday for consultation and will let you know.",

      "Content": "Thank you for the information. The pathology report on the first line has it showing cancer at the apex. Is the base and apex considered the same? Mikla, I want to send out the slides for a second opinion just to make sure. We talked about removing the prostate and should be moving in that direction. I had the MRI on a 1.5 siemens. I'm not so sure that this is the best equipment at this time. I don't have a lot of confidence that the tumor is confined, especially at the apex. I would like to have the MRI done on a 3.0 with rectal coil again to verify that. Also, does anyone know of a good surgeon in the Atlanta area?. I asked my doctor how many he has done and the only think he would say is a lot. I live close to the cancer center here in Newnan, Georgia, so I would like to send my slides to that facility, if they will accept them.",

Prostate, right base, core biopsy: benign prostatic glands and stroma with chronic inflammation. Prostate, left base, core biopsy: adenocarcinoma of prostate, Geason score 3+3=6 involving approx. 5% What I'm really concerned about is the prostate covering the Apex and being high grade. I see this as a possible apex margin due to the amount and being high grade. Anyone familiar with this? You were right Walnut that MRI I had was useless.

      "Content": "Originally Posted by Mikla wishful, you should really consolidate all your posts to some degree and put your info in your signature in order to make it easier for folks to reply. Unfortunately, you have joined our club. Your biopsy appears to say you have Gleason 7 (3+4) with three cores positive with a max involvement of a core of 20%. The \"High grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia\" or HGPIN looks like another read on that core or another from that area. It means they found tissue that may be a precursor to cancer, but cannot be called cancer. It does not mean that the cancer they found on the apex is \"high grade\"... your Gleason score is what is important. By NCCN guidelines you are Intermediate Risk. I would suggest that you have your slides sent out for a 2nd opinion to validate the scores. In some cases the scores are changed... and if changed down, then AS would be an option. Regardless, if the score remains 3+4, you are still in an excellent position for successful treatment (or even AS dependent on your age). What did your urologist recommend? Still no need to panic, you have time to think through this and what you want to do. Best of luck and keep us updated. Hi Mikla, I'm not sure on what you mean about consolidating my posts. Can you explain? that to me",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by Mikla wishful, you should really consolidate all your posts to some degree and put your info in your signature in order to make it easier for folks to reply. Unfortunately, you have joined our club. Your biopsy appears to say you have Gleason 7 (3+4) with three cores positive with a max involvement of a core of 20%. The \"High grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia\" or HGPIN looks like another read on that core or another from that area. It means they found tissue that may be a precursor to cancer, but cannot be called cancer. It does not mean that the cancer they found on the apex is \"high grade\"... your Gleason score is what is important. By NCCN guidelines you are Intermediate Risk. I would suggest that you have your slides sent out for a 2nd opinion to validate the scores. In some cases the scores are changed... and if changed down, then AS would be an option. Regardless, if the score remains 3+4, you are still in an excellent position for successful treatment (or even AS dependent on your age). What did your urologist recommend? Still no need to panic, you have time to think through this and what you want to do. Best of luck and keep us updated. Hi Mikla, I'm not sure on what you mean about consolidating my posts. Can you explain? that to me",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by Mikla wishful, you should really consolidate all your posts to some degree and put your info in your signature in order to make it easier for folks to reply. Unfortunately, you have joined our club. Your biopsy appears to say you have Gleason 7 (3+4) with three cores positive with a max involvement of a core of 20%. The \"High grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia\" or HGPIN looks like another read on that core or another from that area. It means they found tissue that may be a precursor to cancer, but cannot be called cancer. It does not mean that the cancer they found on the apex is \"high grade\"... your Gleason score is what is important. By NCCN guidelines you are Intermediate Risk. I would suggest that you have your slides sent out for a 2nd opinion to validate the scores. In some cases the scores are changed... and if changed down, then AS would be an option. Regardless, if the score remains 3+4, you are still in an excellent position for successful treatment (or even AS dependent on your age). What did your urologist recommend? Still no need to panic, you have time to think through this and what you want to do. Best of luck and keep us updated. Hi Mikla, I'm not sure on what you mean about consolidating my posts. Can you explain? that to me",

      "Content": "Thank you for the information. The pathology report on the first line has it showing cancer at the apex. Is the base and apex considered the same? Mikla, I want to send out the slides for a second opinion just to make sure. We talked about removing the prostate and should be moving in that direction. I had the MRI on a 1.5 siemens. I'm not so sure that this is the best equipment at this time. I don't have a lot of confidence that the tumor is confined, especially at the apex. I would like to have the MRI done on a 3.0 with rectal coil again to verify that. Also, does anyone know of a good surgeon in the Atlanta area?. I asked my doctor how many he has done and the only think he would say is a lot. I live close to the cancer center here in Newnan, Georgia, so I would like to send my slides to that facility, if they will accept them.",

He said if I were you and with all the information that you have given me I would go with the brachytherapy.
