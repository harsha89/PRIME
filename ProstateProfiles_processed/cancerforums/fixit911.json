I asked for a second PSA that came back 5.7, he reccomended 3rd PSA to see if it continued downward - third PSA came back 9.3 ( I also was careful to do EVERYTHING I could to make sure this one was lower, no sex, no masturbation, salads, tomatoes, I even sat on pillows for a month...when he again wanted to biopsy I asked if there was anything else. He sent me for a 4K score test -- it came back at 13 which I am told is intermediate risk for AGGRESSIVE cancer. I'm terrified, don't know what to do next, have heard about adverse effects of biopsy and honestly am having a hard time even registering this is happening.

      "Content": "Hello, so I'm 52 y/o male, my primary care referred me to a urologist surgeon because my PSA was 8.7 - the Urologist immediAtly recommended a biopsy. I asked for a second PSA that came back 5.7, he reccomended 3rd PSA to see if it continued downward - third PSA came back 9.3 ( I also was careful to do EVERYTHING I could to make sure this one was lower, no sex, no masturbation, salads, tomatoes, I even sat on pillows for a month...when he again wanted to biopsy I asked if there was anything else. He sent me for a 4K score test -- it came back at 13 which I am told is intermediate risk for AGGRESSIVE cancer. I'm terrified, don't know what to do next, have heard about adverse effects of biopsy and honestly am having a hard time even registering this is happening. I don't know anyone who has been through this and I'm scared - I won't lie. What should I do? ANY info appreciated. Thank you.",
