      "Content": "Welcome to the forum user 326, but sorry that you have to be here. I was diagnosed with PC last year and the initial biopsy showed Gleason 3+3. I was referred to the Uro by my PCP since my PSA was at 5.1. I was fearful about what to do and like you, had no symptoms and my DRE was normal. However, I had an open RP last September and glad I did. My final pathology report was upgraded to Gleason 7, 3+4. This frequently happens, about 25% of the time. The message is, the initial 12 core biopsy does miss things and you must consider that. The point being, you are already at the 3+4 level and have been so for over a year. Your cancer needs to be treated NOW. Do not be fearful of an open RP -- it's really not that bad. I was just 2 nights in the hospital. If you've found a URO who has years of experience get it scheduled ASAP -- these doctors get booked months in advance in many cases so you need to sit down with your URO and agree on a plan ASAP -- you have no time to lose! Best of luck and keep us posted!!",

My last annual physical a few months ago showed my PSA rose from 2.8 to 5.1 over one year. My PCP recommended I see a urologist based on this. Prostate cancer history in the family so I wasn't too surprised but I am frightened by it all. My Dad and 2 of his brothers had it. The urologist repeated the PSA test and results were 4.5, still too high so he recommended a biopsy. The DRE was normal. The biopsy results showed 5 cancerous cores out of 12, 4 on left side one on right. Gleason score for all of them were 3+3 (6). CAT scan show no invasion beyond the prostate. Doctor said \"you could let this go for 10 years but by then it likely would no longer be treatable\". I asked what his recommendation would be, he stated \"Have it removed -- but there is no hurry, go home and think it over\". That was 6 weeks ago and I've been mulling this over. Can't pull the trigger so to speak for the surgery, I haven't scheduled it yet. He does radical removal and does not do the robotic assisted type.

      "Content": "Gentlemen, thanks for all your opinions and advice. I really need \"somebody to talk to\" about my situation that understands. My friends keep asking me \"why aren't you in the hospital yet getting that cut out!\". I guess you've all heard that. As far as my family history, my Dad had his PC back in the early 90's and had 30 external radiation treatments. He was then about 70. He lived until he was 94 and died of complications of dementia. His younger brother contracted PC at age 74 and had Brachy therapy and is 82 now, doing fine. His other brother contracted PC when he was about 65 and this was in the early 70's. he wound up dying from it as there was no PSA test then (as I recall) and his PCP didn't recognize the symptoms until it was too late. I'm a bit leery of radiation treatment in any form, since my understanding is once you have that you can no longer have prostate region surgery should you need to. Supposedly, they only option is \"salvage\" which does not sound too attractive. I don't know if my reasoning makes sense. By the way, my doctor is affiliated with UPMC (University of Pittsburgh) and can refer me to an RO, robotic surgeon (he only does open). if I wish. Anyway, I'll let you know what my plans will be.

My last annual physical a few months ago showed my PSA rose from 2.8 to 5.1 over one year. My PCP recommended I see a urologist based on this. Prostate cancer history in the family so I wasn't too surprised but I am frightened by it all. My Dad and 2 of his brothers had it. The urologist repeated the PSA test and results were 4.5, still too high so he recommended a biopsy. The DRE was normal. The biopsy results showed 5 cancerous cores out of 12, 4 on left side one on right. Gleason score for all of them were 3+3 (6). CAT scan show no invasion beyond the prostate. Doctor said \"you could let this go for 10 years but by then it likely would no longer be treatable\". I asked what his recommendation would be, he stated \"Have it removed -- but there is no hurry, go home and think it over\". That was 6 weeks ago and I've been mulling this over. Can't pull the trigger so to speak for the surgery, I haven't scheduled it yet. He does radical removal and does not do the robotic assisted type. He's 60 and has done many over his career as has his partner (another Urologist) who assists him in surgery (they assisted for each other). Any thoughts? Comments appreciated.",

My friends keep asking me \"why aren't you in the hospital yet getting that cut out!\". I guess you've all heard that. As far as my family history, my Dad had his PC back in the early 90's and had 30 external radiation treatments. He was then about 70. He lived until he was 94 and died of complications of dementia. His younger brother contracted PC at age 74 and had Brachy therapy and is 82 now, doing fine. His other brother contracted PC when he was about 65 and this was in the early 70's. he wound up dying from it as there was no PSA test then (as I recall) and his PCP didn't recognize the symptoms until it was too late. I'm a bit leery of radiation treatment in any form, since my understanding is once you have that you can no longer have prostate region surgery should you need to. Supposedly, they only option is \"salvage\" which does not sound too attractive. I don't know if my reasoning makes sense. By the way, my doctor is affiliated with UPMC (University of Pittsburgh) and can refer me to an RO, robotic surgeon (he only does open). if I wish. Anyway, I'll let you know what my plans will be. Thanks again.",

However, I was doing this for more than 10 years prior since I had BPH, so nothing new for me. Limiting your fluid intake 3-4 hours before you retire helps. During the day, if I move around, bend over, do any stuff that requires lifting (nothing heavy, but bending) I leak. Things have improved very much since those first few weeks after cath removal, when I was dripping and using 5-6 pads per day when awake. I'm down now to 1-2 during the daytime. It just takes time -- my Doc said this was quite a jolt to my bladder (the surgery) and that's what causes these problems. It will pass, every week will be better. Good luck!",

This was a \"standard PSA\" test and result came back <0.1. I'll be seeing my Doc for a follow up visit on the 29th and see what he has to say. As I understand it, this is \"non detectible\" for the standard test. I will ask him about the wisdom of getting a \"ultra\" PSA test done in the future. I've been reading up on those and some Docs say that it's \"too much information of little use\" and that trying to get hard repeatable numbers below 0.1 is very difficult. Some of this info (from the web) was 4-5 years old and things may have changed by now.",

      "Content": "Well, it will be 7 weeks on Friday the 17th since my RP. Visited the hospital lab a couple days ago for a PSA test. My results came today. This was a \"standard PSA\" test and result came back <0.1. I'll be seeing my Doc for a follow up visit on the 29th and see what he has to say. As I understand it, this is \"non detectible\" for the standard test. I will ask him about the wisdom of getting a \"ultra\" PSA test done in the future. I've been reading up on those and some Docs say that it's \"too much information of little use\" and that trying to get hard repeatable numbers below 0.1 is very difficult. Some of this info (from the web) was 4-5 years old and things may have changed by now.",

Please advise your husband that there are some things he should not do within 3-4 days prior to a PSA test. No sexual activity, no strenuous exercise especially bicycle riding. He should check with his Doc to see what other things may be prudent to do / or not do especially if he has a DRE (rectal exam) before that test. If he suffers from BPH (enlarged prostate) that can also influence the results. Also, make sure that the same lab repeats the test, different labs can have varied results. Good luck.",

      "Content": "Hello VHT: Your family history is similar to mine. My father was diagnosed with PC at age 75, however elected to start beam radiation treatments upon diagnosis. Long story short he died at the age of 94 and not from PC, it was complications of dementia / Alzheimers disease. He had two brothers, both of which had PC. One is still alive and well at age 84 (diagnosed at age 75) and the other passed in his 60's back in 1973, years before the PSA test was used. It was caught too late. I was diagnosed in May of this year and had a RP on September 29th. The key is finding the PC early and making a plan together with your Uro to treat it. Your father I believe from your story likely falls into that category. As for you, since your father and grandfather both had PC, that puts you at higher risk. I had a PSA test as part of my annual physical for that last 25 years and I would urge to do the same. Hopefully you are already doing that. Best of luck to you and your father both, Caddy",

Get a 2nd opinion. I had mine removed when I was 68. Some doctors have an arbitrary \"cut-off\" of 70 years of age for RP surgery. However, the main factor is your overall health -- not the age number. Those health factors can lessen your chances for a successful outcome.",

My last annual physical a few months ago showed my PSA rose from 2.8 to 5.1 over one year. My PCP recommended I see a urologist based on this. Prostate cancer history in the family so I wasn't too surprised but I am frightened by it all. My Dad and 2 of his brothers had it. The urologist repeated the PSA test and results were 4.5, still too high so he recommended a biopsy. The DRE was normal. The biopsy results showed 5 cancerous cores out of 12, 4 on left side one on right. Gleason score for all of them were 3+3 (6). CAT scan show no invasion beyond the prostate. Doctor said \"you could let this go for 10 years but by then it likely would no longer be treatable\". I asked what his recommendation would be, he stated \"Have it removed -- but there is no hurry, go home and think it over\". That was 6 weeks ago and I've been mulling this over. Can't pull the trigger so to speak for the surgery, I haven't scheduled it yet. He does radical removal and does not do the robotic assisted type. He's 60 and has done many over his career as has his partner (another Urologist) who assists him in surgery (they assisted for each other). Any thoughts? Comments appreciated.",

      "Content": "Hello bigalcalbisque! First, I know where you're coming from since we appear to be on the same schedule. Had my RP on September 29th and just had my first follow up appointment last week. Was I anxious? You bet I was. I did get my PSA results before seeing the Doc so I had the chance to mull them over prior. Fortunately, my reading was <0.1, which is \"zero\" on the standard test. Doc did not have too much to say, other than his standard procedure was to test PSA every 3 months for the first year. My next appointment is March, 2018. So, don't worry, you're on the \"other side\" now and done with surgery. It's all downhill from here.",

One of my uncles chose Brachytherapy -- but he was 76 years old at the time....Hello VHT: Your family history is similar to mine. My father was diagnosed with PC at age 75, however elected to start beam radiation treatments upon diagnosis....My father was diagnosed with PC at age 75, however elected to start beam radiation treatments upon diagnosis. Long story short he died at the age of 94 and not from PC, it was complications of dementia / Alzheimers disease....One of my uncles chose Brachytherapy -- but he was 76 years old at the time. I'm 68 and had RP and glad I did....Once you have radiation, it's more difficult to have surgery. That's due to the effect that radiation has on the tissues....",
