He goes in for his bone scan next Monday. He is talking to someone who had proton therapy at Loma Linda and had a good experience with it. He wanted me to do some research on it for him, so I was wondering if anyone out there has had this or considered doing it? We are praying and hoping that the bone scan is clean. I am beside myself with worry as he is my only surviving parent, so it is hard for me to read some of this information.",
