      "Content": "About 90 days ago I had a PSA test and a DRE everything was normal for me. I have had the PSA evaluated yearly since I was maybe 27 I am now 40. In any case, I went to switch doctors and they did a standard chem 30 and the PSA came back at 17 and 1.5 for free. About 10 days prior too, I had been on vacation and I had a very sexually active weekend and rode a bicycle(which I hadn't done for 10 years). I also had tried out Viagra for the first time. I was pretty sore from the extra activities. I also ended up with a UTI(redimed tested). There is no prostate cancer on either side of the family. I suggested to my doctor we wait 6 weeks and retest. From what I read online so far, I think this is still the proper direction. I discussed this with the physician, she had no idea. If I go to a urologist they make money by performing procedures not giving advice or opinions. Any opinions?",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by Jim215 Using the same logic with respect to urologists making money via tests and \"procedures\", then if you have the misfortune to break a leg you would probably want to avoid seeing an X-ray technician because they earn money taking X-ray snapshots to determine the severity of the injury. Might want to review much of the coming out documentation on the huge over treatment of many cancers including prostate. One of 1000's of articles: http://www.cnn.com/2014/07/18/health...-overtreament/ Microbial diagnoses is way different then something physically damaged.",
