I have also read a follow up study that tends to discount the increased incident of more active cancer. I am somewhat concerned about the sexual side effects, especially the loss of libido. Seems to occur in about 3% of those taking it, but the effect diminishes with time. Comments??",

      "Content": "Just got my biopsy results from MDA after MRI and Fusion biopsy they are: MRI RESULTS: Marked benign prostatic hypertrophy , limiting assessment for prostate cancer in the peripheral zone. Possible tumor to left of midline and another in the left mid gland.( both of the areas tested negative in the biopsy) No extraprostatic extension, seminal vesicle invasion, or lymphadenopathy. BIOPSY RESULTS: 13 Cores all negative, most show focal atrophy. 1 core Gleason 3+3, less than 1.0MM focus. Note: This is the same location that had a High Grade PIN in October 2011. Both the MRI and Ultrasound showed a very large prostate at~96cc. I am 74 years old and otherwise in good help. MDA recommends AS. I will meet with my local Uro. to discuss the situation next month. My thoughts that might push me toward surgery vs. AS: 1. I am in good health now so would be to my benefit to get it done now, rather than wait 2 or 3 years. 2. If in several years, I were upgraded to an 8, chances are they would push for seeds. With such a large prostate, they would require the drugs that shrink it which takes another 6 months or longer and make you feel terrible. 3. With this large prostate, cancer or not, I will probably require some sort of procedure to cure urine retention. I would really like both pro and con comments. What are your thoughts??",

      "Content": "shu246 and Joe1. You are right; this is a tough decision. Not even sure I could convince a surgeon to do the Da Vinci. What I didn't mention is that I have had 7 biopsies over 12 years and the prospect of 3 or 4 more as a part of AS is not very appealing. As far as PSA, I am now in the 10+ range. It has taken probably 6 years to go from 4 to 10. If I elected to go with AS, with my large prostate, I would probably need to take Proscar at some point which has a significant risk of destroying libido. If my cancer were upgraded at a later date, my only option would be external beam radiation. Not my favorite form of treatment. I seem to have found myself in the never, never land between age, low Gleason score, and a massive prostate. Not a great place to be.",
