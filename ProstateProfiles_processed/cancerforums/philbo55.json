      "Content": "It's incredible how much energy it takes to fight pain. It's been a week since I started a new round of hormone therapy and I'm impressed how fast it is working and how much energy I now have. Chronic pain can really wear out the most positive person. My late wife was the epitome of positive and funny. She had the most brilliant mind, travelled the world, sailed from Japan to Alaska in a 28 foot boat, juggled, performed magic, professor of computer science; spoke several languages, was a PADI level 5 diver. She was diagnosed with stage 4 ovarian cancer at the age of 44. She went to relaxation groups, reached out beyond her comfort zone always challenging herself during her battle. She dressed up as a fairy princess and gave out scores of special shooting stars she made by hand to all the cancer patients at the hospital. Every year she tithed 10% of her income to charity. She researched her disease and could talk to her physicians at their level. She sat on a patient hospital committee to help improve the system for fellow cancer patients and wanting more women to know about the disease and early detection she co-founded the Ovarian Cancer Alliance Canada which has now grown to become Ovarian Cancer Canada. A week before she passed away at the age of 47, she got out of bed to go see a nephew in a play. Like a comet passing I was so lucky to have had the time I did with her. So many lessons learned and life is so rich when it is lived in the present. It is a pity when friends and family run away from us when we have so much to teach them about living. A year after Deb passed I was diagnosed with my cancer and so another journey began \u0096 my own. Her family disappeared as did all her friends and supporters when I shared my own news. I do now have friends and support. It just made me bitter and angry being abandoned at my vulnerable hour. I have forgiven them now of course; dying over a long time seems to have benefits of wisdom and forgiveness. I realize I have had cancer in my life since 1996. It\u0092s been an interesting journey, difficult, painful too. This is my fourth reoccurrence and each time while I was suffering in pain - I\u0092d think that this would be the time I wouldn\u0092t make it. The pain makes me bitter, bending, moving, makes me short tempered - I swear more and kinda negative -think about funeral plans, well the memorial anyway. Sheesh I\u0092m still here and now that I\u0092m feeling better I aim to hang around a longer. Thanks for reading.",

You can also use a condom catheter from a local medical supply. It connects via a tube from the condom to a bag on your leg. Not knowing your age or other specifics like your PSA it is impossible to provide you with help. Glad to hear you are scheduling the biopsy. Let us know the results and good luck to you!",

      "Content": "Thanks for sharing! I thank God for each day, I make an effort to laugh, find happiness by being in the present. What do you attribute the numbness to? I was having pain in the right groin for over a year PSA in 2011 Sept. was 2.4 a year later it is 17. I have had difficulty sleeping on the right side for 2-3 years before this lump appeared, (inguinal) in July. I have been walking a lot over the past year to exercise and had lost 60 lbs. gained over last hormone therapy regime. In August the lump in my groin was same but hurt like the dickens. My abdomen would throb and that lump felt like a knife whenever I had to push while sitting on the pot. While walking i noticed that my right leg felt weak and often coming out of the shower I would stub my foot on the stall. I had strange bouts with pain in the penis shaft, mid back, testicles. I started sitting with my hand cupping myself just to nurse the pain. Was sleeping a great deal to escape pain. This is the first time in 3 times that I have looked forward to having hormone therapy. Oh and I also noticed that my arthritis is better when on hormone therapy. Thanks for reading.",

      "Content": "I am fairly new to this forum. I have been battling PC for 13 years. I was 44 widowed and not a happy camper to be facing my own battle, PSA 19.5, Gleason 3+4. I was terrified because, as a sexual addict, I stood -no pun intended, to lose my main attraction. I told the doctor I'd wait to start treatment for 90 days, (knowing the side effects of Hormone therapy, (no sexual desire, no erections). I bought lots of Viagra and proceeded to wear out all my contacts so to speak. Of course after the hormone therapy and RRP I bought a vacuum pump and watched lots of porn. (I had the nerve sparing procedure) and of course I am a sexual addict so it is important that I keep what I have in length, ( you lose what you don't use). I endured all that was thrown my way and not with endless aplomb. I learned how to inject my penis with a pharmaceutical drug that produces erections; suffered allergic reactions, penis became so hard that I thought it was going to explode - i kid you not. Picture bald man running aimlessly around his apt. screaming -first time I have ever cried having an erection. It took all my strength, and a toke or two, to push that syringe and release the plunger the next time I tried it. Many years later and I am experiencing erections without much effort. I have had to adapt, grow and change as this is a chronic illness, if you are not cured. And there lies the rub. Chronic VS Cure. I certainly respect anyone who is a survivor and I am not judging opinion - rather I am floating ideas. I guess I can add that my perspective is clouded as I am a survivor. After my initial treatment my PSA fell to undetectable levels and stayed that way. My doctor never said I was cured. I know people here have said that if you are cancer free 5 years or 8 years, without a serious rise in PSA, they use the cure word. I'm not sure if that is true or not. For me it came back in the eighth year of my surgical anniversary. I must add there are so many variables that affect outcomes; diet, age, immune system, Gleason score and the list goes on plus everyone's different anyway. I had 33 radiation treatments and two years later it returned. I just finished losing 60 pounds i had gained from the last hormone therapy, bought some tailored jeans and finally fit in my sports car again when I discovered my PSA had jumped from 2.4 year before to 17. I have started the HT again and cheese cake is looking pretty good. The news is that it has spread to my lymph nodes, right inguinal and 3 right side illiac ones plus one almost encasing the right distal ureter and a node on posterior of bladder. My doctor gave me one of those kits, called a chronic illness kit, helps you organize all your wishes, bank acct info, will etc. That was harsh and she did her best not to cry giving it to me. It was quite the moment. The thing is, stay positive wherever you are in your journey with this disease. It's certainly OK to be scared too. Research, learn, reach out to others and live each day in the present - and be thankful for the present it is. Don't let your choices haunt you, it's a journey not a destination. It's all you can do.",
