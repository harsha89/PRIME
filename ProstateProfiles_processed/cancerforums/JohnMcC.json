    "Content": "Questions follow a brief summary of my Pca history and current situation. MY PROSTATE CANCER HISTORY TO DATE I had a prostatectomy last August. The pathology report said Gleason 3+5, positive margins multifocal, perineural infiltration , apex Gleason pattern 4, extracapsular extension [Gleason pattern 5], seminal vesicle invasion [Gleason pattern 4], lymphovascular invasion [but all 6 removed lymph nodes were clear] Although prostate cancer (PCa) usually proceeds relatively slowly for most men, I fear that the pathology evidence suggests that my prostate cancer may be more aggressive and fast-growing. As recommended by my surgeon and other experts, I began 6 months of hormone therapy in late September (Casodex plus Lupron) to kill, weaken, and reduce the volume of remaining cancer cells prior to, during, and following 7 weeks of radiation treatment (prostate bed and whole pelvic irradiation, using essentially the same protocol as the RTOG national trial led by Dr. Mack Roach at UCSF). I had my final 7.5mg Lupron shot March 2 (nominal one month dose), which suppressed my testosterone for 9 to 10 weeks, and took my final Casodex pill March 27. MY POST TREATMENT PSA TEST OPTIONS Now that my testosterone level should be back up to normal and it will be about 5 months since my last Lupron shot, I\u0092m ready to get a PSA test and consult with the urologist-surgeon overseeing my case at Kaiser Oakland in California. He says I don\u0092t need an ultra-sensitive PSA test because the test will not make any difference in terms of my possible options for further treatment. He said that if and when my PSA level reaches between 5 and 10, he would then recommend that I resume hormone suppression treatment -- under supervision of a doctor in Kaiser's Medical Oncology Department. However, my wife and I are concerned that this urologist, who is an excellent surgeon, may not be familiar with all the latest developments in terms of post-surgical treatment of recurrent prostate cancer. Last October he advised me against having hormone treatment in conjunction with radiation therapy -- before my radiation oncologist told me that was now the recommended procedure in Kaiser Oakland's Radiation Oncology Department (as well as the recommendation I had gotten from other experts) for men with cases like mine. I\u0092ve read that that one of the reasons for getting an ultra-sensitive PSA test is to estimate doubling time of and remaining prostate cancer cells. Some argue that using ultra-sensitive PSA tests allows patient and doctor to estimate that doubling time sooner rather than later \u0096 and then to decide on an appropriate therapeutic strategy. But recent research (AC Reese at al, \u0093Poor Agreement of Prostate Specific Antigen Doubling Times Calculated Using Ultrasensitive Versus Standard Prostate Specific Antigen Values: Important Impact on Risk Assessment\u0094 J Urol. 2011 Oct 17. [UCSF - Epub ahead of print]) casts doubt on using ultra-sensitive PSA tests to estimate doubling times. On the other hand, I don\u0092t know whether there is any evidence of the correlation between either type of PSA test and actual cancer cell doubling time. For a good discussion, see http://www.yananow.org/UltraPSA.htm MY FUTURE TREATMENT OPTIONS My research suggests that many doctors (like my urologist-surgeon) think that if chemical recurrence happens, then the only option is palliative hormone suppression treatment (i.e., with Lupron, triple blockades, etc.). Other prostate cancer specialists, however, argue that there are now better options than immediately resorting to hormone suppression treatment \u0096 which has a number of well-known nasty side-effects, some of which I experienced even within a relatively short period (6+ months) of hormone therapy \u0096 as part of my adjuvant radiation treatment. For example, Dr. Charles Myers and others have found that prostate cancer cells don't necessarily metastasize all over the body -- but may be localized to one or a few sites that can be identified with high-resolution feraheme imaging and then treated with external beam radiation or site-specific chemotherapy. MY QUESTIONS 1. My wife and my most urgent question is whether to try to get an ultra-sensitive PSA test at this point, even if we have to pay for it ourselves because my doctor and Kaiser think that a standard PSA test is sufficient for my current situation. What would we gain by my getting a PSA test which can detect levels of 0.005 ng/mL as opposed to 0.04 ng/mL? 2. The standard PSA tests run by Kaiser labs use a Chemiluminescent Immunoassay, specifically the SIEMENS Immulite 2000. If you were in my shoes as a prostate cancer patient, would you opt for this standard assay or (putting aside the question of cost) would you prefer to get an ultra-sensitive PSA test? 2. Neither Kaiser\u0092s lab that does the standard test nor outside labs that do ultrasensitive tests (e.g., Quest) provide error bars with their PSA values. Are either standard or ultra-sensitive tests more accurate in terms of their standard deviations (which I realize depend on several different factors including calibration, inherent variation, etc.) and is that a reason to prefer one over the other? 4. If I decide to pay for an ultra-sensitive test myself, what particular assay(s) and or lab(s) would you recommend, and are there any other things I should request besides the PSA value itself? Thanks in advance for whatever information and advice anyone might be able to offer.
