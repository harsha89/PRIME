But why would there even be results pertaining to the colon on a prostate biopsy? Maybe the doctor didn't go deep enough with the cores on the left side and only got colon tissue? Also is the presence of colonic mucosa and squamous mucosa a good thing, or is it the beginning of something that could turn bad?",
