The prostate pathology report: \u201cMalignant with a Gleason Score of 9 (5 secondary + 4 primary).\u201d \u201c Margins uninvolved by invasive carcinoma.\u201d It was believed by all that the cancer had been totally removed since the margins tested good. PSA Level tracking post-surgery: Date Level Change 1/5/2016 0.01 4/5/2016 0.03 0.02 7/12/2016 0.07 0.04 10/12/2016 0.70 0.63 Cancer has returned At this 0.70 level (High absolute number plus large increase in the velocity of the change) combined with my high Gleason Score history, Dr. Willard has suggested starting hormone therapy (Testosterone reduction via injection). Note: As part of the preparation for the Nov 2015 prostate removal surgery, Lexington Medical Center did a full body MRI and a Bone Scan, both of these tests did not show any indication that the cancer had spread beyond the prostrate. Dr. Willard suggested the hormone therapy treatment based upon three factors: 1, Large increase in PSA from 0.07 to 0.70 in 3 months 2, Aggressive nature of the cancerous prostate removed (High Gleason Score) 3, We do not know where in my body the cancer might be located Dr. Willard (Urologist) Treatment Plan (Medical Castration): Nov 2, 2016 Two Shots Firmagon Completed Dec 7, 2016 One shot Firmagon Completed Dec 19. 2016 Care coordination, hand off of all treatment to Medical Oncologist Dr. Lal (Medical Oncologist) Action\\Treatment Plan: Nov 2015, Bone Scan and MRI (Repeat of scans performed 12 months ago). 11/16/2016 Bone Scan Findings: COMPARISON: November 3, 2015 TECHNIQUE: 26.6 mCi of Technetium 99m labeled MDP was administered IV and 3 hour delayed whole body planar imaging was performed. Additional static imaging of the head and neck, chest, pelvis also performed. FINDINGS: There is abnormal activity identified involving the mid cervical spine, as well as the medial right clavicle, L3 and S1, the left sacroiliac joint, left superior acetabulum, as well as proximal left humerus. There is also increased activity involving the left posterior third 6, 10 and 11 ribs, as well as the lateral right fifth rib. These are new from prior study. There is bilateral renal activity present in the bladder which are normal findings. IMPRESSION: Multiple foci of increased activity, consistent with osseous metastatic disease, new from prior study. Electronically signed by: Beth Michelle Siroty-Smith, MD on 11/15/2016 5:00 PM 11/29/2016 Pelvic MRI Results: Technique: Multisequence, multiplanar MR images of the pelvis were obtained without contrast utilizing MRI protocol. Findings: No masses are identified in the surgical bed, No pathologic adenopathy. Mild bladder wall thickening which is nonspecific. Bilateral hip prostheses limits evaluation of the surgical bed on diffusion weighted series. Impression: Interval prostatectomy without evidence of local recurrence. Notes for Dec 6 post Bone Scan and Pelvic MRI visit with Dr. Lal General: A Bone Scan can show bone growth and or breakdown A MRI can identify tumors 1, Does the bone cancer carry the same pathology grade (Gleason Score of 9)? Yes 2, What stage is my cancer? Four 3, Are there other tests to be done \u2013 Full MRI etc. No 4, Surgical Castration Vs. Hormone Therapy? Hormone Side effects for both are the result of testosterone reduction ??????? 5, What is the treatment plan?

      "Content": "Thanks for guiding me along the way, glad I found this forum. Goal, reduce ill side affects = increased quality of life? As I understand it, long term Hormone Therapy increases the possibility of bone fractures and dementia? The removal of my prostate Nov 2015 also damaged nerves to the extent that an erection is just not happening plus I am about to turn 70 so not a big deal to me. The list of side effects associated with Hormone Therapy is a long one and is a big deal to me. I assumed that a medical castration would eliminate the negative side affects. Cancer is already after my bones and the hormone therapy is after them too. My thought was to reduce the total side affect load by eliminating the negative side affects of Hormone Therapy. I discussed the option with my Medical Oncologist, His reply \"Hormone Therapy\" or \"Surgical Castration\", side effects for both are identical due to the testosterone reduction. I cannot find any information to confirm the Med. Oncologist statement. Any help would be appreciated. Thanks in Advance Petzelhead",

      "Content": "\"I also have heard that the majority of the side effects are from the absence of testosterone. The bone issue and weight gain and muscle loss im not sure. Thats a good question for the docs. I am lately experiencing increased loss of energy and forgetfulness and just feeling weird. Im sure its not good to be on any drug for this long.\" This is where I am. It is hard to believe that medical castration would create the immediate side effects of the hormone therapy. Also I am finding studies indicating the long term use of the hormone therapy can result in a higher incidence of bone fracture and dementia. Let me know what your doctor says.",
