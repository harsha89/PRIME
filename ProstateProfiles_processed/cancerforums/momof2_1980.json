      "Content": "He is stage 4, distant metastatic. I don't know what his Gleason scores are/were. I know that his first day of chemo his PSA was around 800, his last chemo it was less then 7, and 1 month later it was in the 8s. It is currently in his bones only, I believe. I don't think he really tells me *everything*, just the basics. The only other experience I have with stage 4 cancers, they were gone in 1 month, and 6 months, but everyone keeps saying prostate is slow, it wont be that quick. My main questions are: 1. Once its spread to the bones, what is the survival rates? 2. is it common to have reduced kidney function? It seems that the main goal is to prevent it from going to the bones, but his already is? then what? I am just looking for personal experience to see what *could* happen",
