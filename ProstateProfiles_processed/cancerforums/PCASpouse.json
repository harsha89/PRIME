It was good to read that the authors acknowledge we have increasingly healthy seniors in western society, and that care should be individualized, as was done here. Whatever goes for a healthy 80-year-old would favor even stronger arguments for a healthy 74-year-old, who per current guidelines would not be checked for PCA in the first place due to assumptions of lowered life expectancy based on age alone. \u0093. . . .Secondly, we think our 80-yr-old patient does have a life expectancy of more than 10 yr. According to the National Comprehensive Cancer Network guidelines, the life expec- tancy of octogenarians is 8.5 yr, but within the best quartile of age\u0097which can be assumed for our patient due to the lack of comorbidities\u0097it rises to 12.15 yr [1,7]. Concerns about undertreatment in healthy elderly men with high-risk pros- tate cancer have already been expressed by the Interna- tional Society of Geriatric Oncology. There have been several reports on otherwise healthy older patients with high-risk prostate cancer being less likely to receive local therapy in comparison to younger men with similar life expectancy [8]. This suggests that the life expectancy of healthy elderly men is commonly underestimated and emphasizes that individual health status rather than chronological age should guide treatment choices [9].\u0094",

      "Content": "1. Another, which medication are you concerned about here as a cause of PSA drop? Do statins, blood thinners, and/or beta blockers which are what P. Collen is reporting as new, lower PSA and if so how much? With finasteride most double the measured PSA to correct for the lowering, but what is the data on the heart agents? 2. P. Collen, you just got a nice new stent and the blood thinner is there to help keep it from failing, most critical in the first few months after placement. How long did your cardiologist say you should be on it ( note they would need to be interrupted for the biopsy, and duration of using them can vary from one month to 18 months and averages a year). You also have raw irritable myocardial tissue as you are recovering from an MI, and most cardiologists, absent an emergency, do not recommend elective surgeries, even little ones like a biopsy, within 3 months of an MI, if not longer. That leads to the question if your PSA change is critical and pressing to work up more during the next couple months, stopping the thinners, risk/benefit assessment. Your PSA has not exactly surged, (unless your three cardiac drugs are known to lower it a lot) so perhaps you could ask your urologist and cardiologist what they might think about considering an in between approach, such as waiting 3 months, reassessing the PSA (no sex, masturbation, DRE, or heavy exercise 2-3 days before) and doing a prostate MRI (if your stent is the usual kind that does not interfere with MRI) in a facility that does a lot of them, and then only biopsy if there is a Pirads 4 or 5 lesion? Just a thought. I wish you a good recovery from your MI and a quiet prostate!",

      "Content": "1. Another, which medication are you concerned about here as a cause of PSA drop? Do statins, blood thinners, and/or beta blockers which are what P. Collen is reporting as new, lower PSA and if so how much? With finasteride most double the measured PSA to correct for the lowering, but what is the data on the heart agents? 2. P. Collen, you just got a nice new stent and the blood thinner is there to help keep it from failing, most critical in the first few months after placement. How long did your cardiologist say you should be on it ( note they would need to be interrupted for the biopsy, and duration of using them can vary from one month to 18 months and averages a year). You also have raw irritable myocardial tissue as you are recovering from an MI, and most cardiologists, absent an emergency, do not recommend elective surgeries, even little ones like a biopsy, within 3 months of an MI, if not longer. That leads to the question if your PSA change is critical and pressing to work up more during the next couple months, stopping the thinners, risk/benefit assessment. Your PSA has not exactly surged, (unless your three cardiac drugs are known to lower it a lot) so perhaps you could ask your urologist and cardiologist what they might think about considering an in between approach, such as waiting 3 months, reassessing the PSA (no sex, masturbation, DRE, or heavy exercise 2-3 days before) and doing a prostate MRI (if your stent is the usual kind that does not interfere with MRI) in a facility that does a lot of them, and then only biopsy if there is a Pirads 4 or 5 lesion? Just a thought. I wish you a good recovery from your MI and a quiet prostate!",

Around here things move slowly (e.g., a one month wait for a new pt appointment just for initial consult) unless you have pull and connections.

My sense is he may have just a few minutes with the doc then if any. Is there special preparation required for genetic markers?

He had a simple tonsillectomy with one course of antibiotics preop a few years ago and landed up with two months of debilitating. C. diff! I did not mention here before on this thread that DH has had sxs BPH for years before his PSA went up, but kept dodging going to a urologist because he is always super busy at work. But when he finally went with me to see this urologist with both the PSA rise , < 10 percent free, and the reported worsening BPH sxs, while we were waiting for the 4k to come back, the doc did flow studies documenting slow flow recently, and high residual volume, and then we also had misc findings of chronic obstruction on MRI. He then tried a couple different alpha blockers and could not tolerate the myriad of side effects even at low doses, so at some point he will almost certainly need some level of a prostate procedure, like surgery, anyway to control those sxs. He is only 57 and pretty healthy now except for odds and ends, and is a good general anesthesia candidate. He may be open to AS even for a life of potentially another 25 years, but as he also needs the BPH treated, it may be a two birds with one stone issue. If the MRI fusion bx is totally negative, unlikely with all we know, and awareness that there are some false negagives, we will of course have a lot more time to pick a good surgeon for benign prostate procedures. But if his PCA is high grade, I want to be ready, as everything moves so slow here and I understand doubling time can be as short as a few months. If it were not for his work, which keeps him so busy, I would just have him travel to the best prostate centers in the country for opinions, like Hopkins or Mayo, but he is unwilling to do that, wants to do things locally. I appreciate your words of caution, and understand of course one needs full analysis of the bx, by a good pathologist, and by reliable people who have enough time to think about things, (and probably also a second pathologist to look at the specimen, like they did with my breast cancer) before doing surgery.

      "Content": "I found this report from 2010 in my recent research file about surgical delays of six months or more creating more problems in Gleason 3+3 men, so if the results have been proven valid since then (not finished researching) I cannot see how results would be better for 3+4. \u201c AUA: Delayed Surgery Boosts Prostate Cancer Risk Charles Bankhead,May 31, 2010 Action Points SAN FRANCISCO -- Men with low-risk prostate cancer had significantly worse outcomes if they delayed surgery for six months or more after their diagnosis, data from a large retrospective cohort showed. The study looked at the medical records of more than 1,100 men with low-risk prostate cancer and found that those who delayed surgery had almost double the likelihood of having high-grade disease at prostatectomy; twice as many men had biochemical progression compared with patients who had surgery less than six months after diagnosis. \"In a contemporary prospective radical prostatectomy cohort of low-risk prostate cancer patients, we found that a delay in surgery of six months or more after diagnosis was associated with worse outcomes, specifically, a significantly greater proportion of high-grade disease and higher rates of biochemical progression,\" Gustavo F. Carvalhal, MD, of Northwestern University in Chicago, said here at the American Urological Association meeting. \"Low-risk patients should be counseled about the possibility of worse pathological outcomes and an increased risk of biochemical progression with surgical delays of six months or more,\" Carvalhal added. \"Further studies are necessary to ascertain whether these findings will translate into a difference in cancer-specific and overall mortality rate.\" As more men opt for active surveillance of low-risk prostate cancer, timing of surgery has emerged as a key consideration during follow-up. Studies of surgical delay's impact on outcomes have yielded conflicting results. One of the earliest studies showed that a delay of three months or more from diagnosis was associated with a lower 10-year biochemical progression-free survival (Can J Urol 2003; 10: 1891-199. Several subsequent studies showed similar outcomes regardless of the interval between biopsy and surgery, said Carvalhal. Still another study showed an increased risk of biochemical relapse in men who delayed surgery for more than six monhs after a positive biopsy (J Urol 2006; 175: 1298-1302). In light of the inconsistent findings, Carvalhal and colleagues assessed the impact of surgical delay on biochemical progression in a contemporary series of patients with low-risk prostate cancer. They analyzed data on 1,111 men who underwent retropubic radical prostatectomy. All met D'Amico criteria for low risk: clinical stage T1c/T2a, PSA ≤10 ng/mL, and biopsy Gleason score ≤6. Defining biochemical recurrence as a postprostatectomy rise in serum PSA to ≥0.2 ng/mL, investigators compared pathologic features and biochemical recurrence rates in men who had surgery within six months of diagnosis or after six months. Of the total cohort, 59 patients had surgery six months or more after diagnosis, and the remaining 1,052 underwent prostatectomy within six months. Longer surgical delay was associated with older age (61 versus 59, P=0.05), African-American race (6.8% versus 2.2%, P=0.05), and a lower proportion of clinical stage T2 versus T1 disease (6.8% versus 18.9%, P=0.02). At prostatectomy the percentage of patients in the two groups did not differ significantly with respect to organ-confined disease, extracapsular extension, positive surgical margins, or seminal vesicle invasion, and no patient in either group had lymph node involvement. However, 47% of patients who delayed surgery for six months or longer had Gleason ≥7 compared with 27% of men who had less delay from diagnosis to surgery (P=0.001). Both groups had a median follow-up of about 40 months. Biochemical recurrence occurred in 5% of patients who had surgery within six months of diagnosis versus 12% in the men who waited six months or longer (P=0.04). A surgical delay of six months or more was associated with a five-year progression-free survival of about 80% compared with about 95% in men who did not delay surgery (P=0.0086). In a multivariable analysis a surgical delay of six months or more remained a significant predictor of biochemical progression, conferring almost a threefold increase in the hazard (HR 2.9, P=0.02).

      "Content": "Mama, you are going through the same thoughts I had when my DH first had a PSA rise with low free PSA, i.e., \u201cit must be BPH\u201d though I worried it was likely not, and then when there was a big PiRads 4 peripheral lesion on MRI that \u201cit could still be a false positive.\u201d During that hunt for still having hope, while waiting for the bx, I found this article about false positives in the peripheral zone (where most PCA arises), and there are indeed quite a few, as others mentioned: https://www.researchgate.net/publication/301288625_Benign_causes_of_diffusion_restriction_f oci_in_the_peripheral_zone_of_the_prostate_diagnos is_and_differential_diagnosis There are many potential false positives, but the bx is the gold standard, and combined with clinical hx, PSA rate of rise, free PSA, and other clinical factors I have tried to get myself used to the idea DH has PCA and just hope it is not bad. Bx with MRI guidance, fusion, was 3/29 on DH, still no results. Our friend had a blind TRUS bx the same day with another center and another doc and he got results yesterday. Tomorrow I start calling to make sure the busy doc complex is not just sitting on a report that was already read out and they have been too preocuppied to call us about.

      "Content": "Lay overview of PiRads scoring system, old and new versions. https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/PI-RADS Pirads 4 is high probablity of significant malignancy (5 would be very high probability). But take heart, because as discussed above, it could be a false positive. DH was not hearing anything from his overloaded doc about his 3/29 MRI guided and US fusion bx of his 2.6x1.4 cm PiRads lesion in the peripheral zone, so yesterday I just went over to get the report from the hospital directly (he signed a form for them indicating I could) .The 12 \u201cstandard template\u201d cores were all read as benign prostate tissue, and the four taken from the area of suspicion were read as benign prostate tissue and seminal vesicle. It was signed \u201c pathology staff\u201d so I cannot check how versed the pathologist is in reading prostate tissue. But before I change my username, though this is good news, I want to look into the possibility of a false negative. The doc finally called DH (who also has very symptomatic BPH and a 50 gram or double size prostate on MRI) and quickly said \u201cYour biopsies were benign. See you in 6 months.\u201d He was getting ready to hang up but DH quickly asked what about a false negative , given the big Pirads 4 lesion, and the doc reluctantly replied \u201cwell that can happen\u201d. He then tried to hang up again and DH asked what he should do about the BPH (e.g., thinking if he has surgery as an option we would get another crack at tissue to help rule out false negative). The doc was surprised, and said \u201coh, you still have that?\u201d, and then told him to schedule a cystoscopy and hung up. Apparently he was not spending much time with DH\u2019s record, and no reason was given for the cystoscopy after-thought (we already know his prostate size, he has no blood in urine, no incontinence, and no neuro disease), and to do it late May because he is on vacation until then. I also saw on the report I picked up that the results were available less than 24 hours after the bx, Friday, so we could have had a more peaceful weekend if the doc had bothered to look and let us know! He also took eight days to notify us of MRI results, most get it in two. We will not be going back there and will follow up with a new urologist we met shortly before the bx who spent a lot of time discussing. Key points: 1. There can be false positives as discussed above in prior posts, but also false negatives, as PCA is diffuse, though I hope DH is not in the latter category (PSA around 4 with under 10 percent free, a big jump from last few years when he was in the 1\u2019s, and positive family history.). If DH has to have most or all of the prostate out for bad BPH anyway, we will know for sure. 2. Patients need to be on the ball about what is happening with them, \u201ctrust but verify\u201d when dealing with docs, they are busy, and to many, you are just another John Doe. Most who are not salaried get payed in bulk, e.g., for how many procedures they do and bill for, rather than how much time they spend explaining things to pts.",

      "Content": "Mama, you are going through the same thoughts I had when my DH first had a PSA rise with low free PSA, i.e., \u201cit must be BPH\u201d though I worried it was likely not, and then when there was a big PiRads 4 peripheral lesion on MRI that \u201cit could still be a false positive.\u201d During that hunt for still having hope, while waiting for the bx, I found this article about false positives in the peripheral zone (where most PCA arises), and there are indeed quite a few, as others mentioned: https://www.researchgate.net/publication/301288625_Benign_causes_of_diffusion_restriction_f oci_in_the_peripheral_zone_of_the_prostate_diagnos is_and_differential_diagnosis There are many potential false positives, but the bx is the gold standard, and combined with clinical hx, PSA rate of rise, free PSA, and other clinical factors I have tried to get myself used to the idea DH has PCA and just hope it is not bad. Bx with MRI guidance, fusion, was 3/29 on DH, still no results. Our friend had a blind TRUS bx the same day with another center and another doc and he got results yesterday. Tomorrow I start calling to make sure the busy doc complex is not just sitting on a report that was already read out and they have been too preocuppied to call us about. Would be nice to have a good weekend",

      "Content": "Lay overview of PiRads scoring system, old and new versions. https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/PI-RADS Pirads 4 is high probablity of significant malignancy (5 would be very high probability). But take heart, because as discussed above, it could be a false positive. DH was not hearing anything from his overloaded doc about his 3/29 MRI guided and US fusion bx of his 2.6x1.4 cm PiRads lesion in the peripheral zone, so yesterday I just went over to get the report from the hospital directly (he signed a form for them indicating I could) .The 12 \u201cstandard template\u201d cores were all read as benign prostate tissue, and the four taken from the area of suspicion were read as benign prostate tissue and seminal vesicle. It was signed \u201c pathology staff\u201d so I cannot check how versed the pathologist is in reading prostate tissue. But before I change my username, though this is good news, I want to look into the possibility of a false negative. The doc finally called DH (who also has very symptomatic BPH and a 50 gram or double size prostate on MRI) and quickly said \u201cYour biopsies were benign. See you in 6 months.\u201d He was getting ready to hang up but DH quickly asked what about a false negative , given the big Pirads 4 lesion, and the doc reluctantly replied \u201cwell that can happen\u201d. He then tried to hang up again and DH asked what he should do about the BPH (e.g., thinking if he has surgery as an option we would get another crack at tissue to help rule out false negative). The doc was surprised, and said \u201coh, you still have that?\u201d, and then told him to schedule a cystoscopy and hung up. Apparently he was not spending much time with DH\u2019s record, and no reason was given for the cystoscopy after-thought (we already know his prostate size, he has no blood in urine, no incontinence, and no neuro disease), and to do it late May because he is on vacation until then. I also saw on the report I picked up that the results were available less than 24 hours after the bx, Friday, so we could have had a more peaceful weekend if the doc had bothered to look and let us know! He also took eight days to notify us of MRI results, most get it in two. We will not be going back there and will follow up with a new urologist we met shortly before the bx who spent a lot of time discussing. Key points: 1. There can be false positives as discussed above in prior posts, but also false negatives, as PCA is diffuse, though I hope DH is not in the latter category (PSA around 4 with under 10 percent free, a big jump from last few years when he was in the 1\u2019s, and positive family history.). If DH has to have most or all of the prostate out for bad BPH anyway, we will know for sure. 2. Patients need to be on the ball about what is happening with them, \u201ctrust but verify\u201d when dealing with docs, they are busy, and to many, you are just another John Doe. Most who are not salaried get payed in bulk, e.g., for how many procedures they do and bill for, rather than how much time they spend explaining things to pts.",

      "Content": "My DH, age 57, pretty healthy, working, and active, has not yet been diagnosed with PCA (and hopefully never will be). As some of you may recall from my other posts, he had first round MRI fusion biopsies recenty read as benign, including four cores reportedly targeted to his PiRads 4 2.6x1.4 cm left peripheral lesion. I am in the process of getting second opinions on the path and MRI reads, because of various reasons for clinical suspicion of PCA including the big Pirads 4 lesion, which will take a while. DH so far is not keen on starting over and getting more biopsies of that lesion at a major PCA center to increase odds of finding hidden PCA , but would like to get going on rx of his annoying but not debilitating BPH sxs in summer. He would be willing to read about reasons to wait a bit longer for BPH rx rather than just doing BPH rx with TURP or GreenLight laser or perhaps Urolift (more temporary) this summer and then just continuing PSA and DRE monitoring for PCA every few months after a recovery period, and worry about occult PCA later, which is what the two urologists suggest. So I am researching what kind of problems you can get with finding PCA and doing prostatectomy a year or more in the future if he were to get limited BPH surgery now. Prostate is only twice normal, 50 grams, so he would not be a candidate for a prostatectomy for the BPH now, which would give a lot of tissue, and TURP would only give tissue near the urethra, not where the lesion is, Greenlight would give none or only a little if a loop is added for some. PSA was 4.2, confirmed, after years of running in the 1\u2019s, < 10% free, FH PCA but no deaths from it. My understanding is scarring from TURP at least can make nerve sparing prostatectomy later on, if needed for PCA, harder to do. Unclear what Greenlight does. Is that correct, and are there other risks, or good papers on this? Anyone here had a TURP or Greenlight in the past and then have prostatectomy for PCA? If yes, did your doc talk about greater risk of problems due to prior BPH surgery? As DH is young and has some IBS, he would not be keen on radiation, if PCA found in the future, both due to young age, and risk of GI SE, as well as SE that would interfere with the very high level of cognitive function he needs for his job, even if it were for just a few months ( says it would be better to wear incontinence pads than to have no energy and not be able to think clearly for months)",

      "Content": "The average PSA bump after T replacement into a therapeutic range, with a normal prostate, has been reported to be 0.3-0.6. However, if testosterone is supratherapeutic, what is expected is not standardized. If clomid is added on, (not routine) even less so. Men with BPH bump their PSAs a bit higher, but so can men with cancer. Indeed, some urologists see a signifcant PSA bump with T to be a stress test for underlying prostate disease, both benign and malignant, but research on this is murky. Even if you got in with a urologist immediately, odds are he would just tell you to knock it off with the T and the clomid and repeat the PSA in 4-6 weeks (and, as others have noted, avoid things that can cause false positives). When you do the repeat, perhaps you should ask for both a total and free PSA ( very low free PSA can mean increased risk of PCA, but there are false positives). A urologist is not going to be swayed one way or the other by your estrogen levels. Are you obese? Do you have a family history of PCA? Are you African-American? All could increase risk of PCA. June is a perfect time for a urology appointment, as that is when PSA should settle down after stopping the T and clomid.",

Are you pretty much the main family member for him, e.g., no wife, no other kids? How was his emotional health before the diagnosis? Does he *want* your help? As others have said, and you suspect, from a pure medical perspective, he should be in the care of a urologist and urologic oncologist who has a lot of experience with metastatic prostate cancer.

Alternatively, if he is a vet and eligible for VA care based on income or service-connection, he can go to the Cincinnati VA ( most VAs have a lot of experience with PCA because of Agent Orange and, contrary to TV news, if they are affiliated with a local university hospital, they can do a very good job taking care of vets with PCA at either low or no cost). If he has a good relationship with his primary care doc, that doc can also steer you to good local options. He, and you, if you have been close, will almost certainly also need emotional care, to help cope with the new diagnosis, and especially if he had preexisting depression or anxiety. I looked online and there are a variety of local prostate cancer support services in the Cincinnati area for patients and family that meet regularly, no cost (I am not sure if I am allowed to mention them here, so no link), to complement medical workup. VA also offers psychology services, if he is a vet. Give him a little space, and then ask him how you can best help him, if it would be ok to have your involvement, and maybe ask if it would be ok if you went to his next appointment with him (if you can do that). He may have already heard from his doc that the likely ADT hormone shots he is set up for will block sexual function, among other major side effects, and along with pain and having cancer, thinking about that can make men angry and cranky or depressed, plus they feel they are losing control, losing their manliness ( certainly they lose their male hormone). Offer to help, and be there if he wants it, on his terms, so he is engaged in his care while you nudge him in the best direction for him, with his unique situation and values. People are also here to help you as best possible. Best wishes on his care.",

He, and you, if you have been close, will almost certainly also need emotional care, to help cope with the new diagnosis, and especially if he had preexisting depression or anxiety. I looked online and there are a variety of local prostate cancer support services in the Cincinnati area for patients and family that meet regularly, no cost (I am not sure if I am allowed to mention them here, so no link), to complement medical workup. VA also offers psychology services, if he is a vet. Give him a little space, and then ask him how you can best help him, if it would be ok to have your involvement, and maybe ask if it would be ok if you went to his next appointment with him (if you can do that). He may have already heard from his doc that the likely ADT hormone shots he is set up for will block sexual function, among other major side effects, and along with pain and having cancer, thinking about that can make men angry and cranky or depressed, plus they feel they are losing control, losing their manliness ( certainly they lose their male hormone). Offer to help, and be there if he wants it, on his terms, so he is engaged in his care while you nudge him in the best direction for him, with his unique situation and values. People are also here to help you as best possible. Best wishes on his care.",

Everyone is different with how their body copes with disease, even metastatic disease, in how long they go on, which is why docs hate to be cornered into saying how long someone will live. Just try and get expedited second and third opinions if you can and see if there is anything else to try. If not, at least secure adequate pain relief and enjoy while you can. Gentle hugs and hope, PCASpouse. I am so sorry, but where there is life there is hope, many of us have seen amazing things.

      "Content": "I posted elsewhere about my DH, who is getting a bx tomorrow for a large Pirads 4 lesion that is likely PCA. DH is an avid motorcyclist, e.g., he not uncommonly rides on and off road the whole day, and routinely also a short distance to work so parking is easy and efficient. I have researched the internet on experiences of motorcyclists as well as medical center instructions after both bx and prostatectomy and there is very little out there. There is a lot more about regular bicycling. Some say there should be no riding for two weeks after bx and one month after surgery, to allow healing, even if it feels ok, others reported they did not feel comfortable riding more than a few miles until many months had passed after surgery and for healing you need two months even if the butt feels ok. His seat is pretty soft on his main bike, but roads, except to work, can be bumpy. DH will of course do what it takes to get proper rx once the path comes back, as there are no awesome rides to experience if you are dead. But we are trying to plan ahead for both work transportation as well as whether or not to pay fees in advance for some bigger organized rides out of the area. If he has surgery, it will likely be mid to late June ( subject to path findings, of course). If anyone who rides who had bx and surgery has anything to add to this, it would be appreciated!",

      "Content": "Thank you for the welcome! Communal answers: My husband is 57. <10% of his PSA (confirmed on repeat) was free, suggestive but not confirmatory of CA. He first saw a urologist mid-January after we got the results from primary care. We were in pursuit of getting a biopsy when we noted the PSA had gone up from years of a steady baseline, with the low free PSA, but he reported also having BPH sxs (negative DRE) on the review of systems. Then the urologist got fixated on giving him an alpha blocker trial to treat that (not tolerated), doing urinary flow and residual studies for BPH work-up (not surprisingly he had slow flow and some retention was confirmed) and giving him brochures about the different surgical ways to rx BPH since he did not tolerate pills.. Meanwhile getting the bx was held up by waiting for the 4K lab the doc recommended. When it came back two weeks later it frankly did not add much to the free PSA, and reported 15% risk of a significant lesion, which we already knew from the free PSA lab report, so the plan was finally to do the biopsy, which we wanted in the first place. We thought he was then finally going for an MRI-guided biopsy last week but due to massive, pan-miscommunication it turned out to be only the MRI. He/I had taken a full day off anticipating biopsy with sedation. He had called his doc's office as well as insurance in advance about his \"MRI-guided biopsy\" and was told the procedure was covered, but it turned out they only did the MRI and no one knew anything about a biopsy. We now have our MRI result reported verbally by the urologist yesterday (it is like pulling teeth in this ACO bureaucracy to get a copy of the actual report, but I am submitting a ROI request for the report and films). Now the battle starts to contact the clerk girls to schedule the actual MRI-guided biopsy and make sure they schedule the right thing. Doc told DH they are going to use general anesthesia to avoid his moving around. We will confirm coverage amount in that hospital, where they like to overcharge paying patients so as to be able to pay for people who have no coverage, so we have to be clear going on what the charges will be that are covered by insurance and if the remainder is an acceptable amount. Doc told DH the lesion (no details) is in an area that would have been biopsied anyway even without MRI guidance (but was not felt on DRE). I assume they will take extra samples of that area, if we could just get it done! We are in northern California, Bay area, and he has United Health Care, but we would be willing to pay a reasonable amount extra if it were not covered. MRI guided bx is, as I understand it, state of the art for guidance on bx, so maybe that is why it is covered now. I am not sure if that also requires combination with ultrasound. I have been reading, trying to learn. Meanwhile as I have little confidence in this confused personnel ACO complex, though we will stick with them for the biopsy to keep things moving (surgeon has a good reputation as a surgeon, but I am unimpressed with his staff and the complex), I am working to line up a new urologist both for a second opinion on what procedure would be best to do after the biopsy (assuming it will be positive), and perhaps to actually also do it even if it means traveling further from our home. My husband rides motorcycles on long trips and likes to take cars on race tracks as a hobby (not for a long time before doing the PSA blood, BTW, so his results are not a false + ). So if surgery is required for a bad cancer, the last thing he needs is landing up with urinary incontinence (not that any man needs that). We want to minimize chances of a poor result due to a rushed and overworked surgeon and confused personnel. This PCA work-up is coming on top of my getting a surprise breast cancer diagnosis 4 months ago (am doing ok), and I'll also toss in putting our favorite cat to sleep last month due to a one-inch abdominal tumor, so I am stressed. Oddly, he is not feeling stressed, maybe it will hit the way it hit me when the biopsy comes back positive (hopefully not, but looking likely).",

If the PCA is truly not gone, there are still options, Lay over view of some of them: https://www.webmd.com/prostate-cancer/prostate-cancer-faq#1 Where you are geographically? I would suggest getting a new opinion by a prostate cancer center of excellence near you, e.g., at the local university is always a start, though best known are Hopkins, MD Anderson, UCLA, Stanford, Duke, Vanderbilt, there are a couple in NY and Chicago, and of course Mayo Clinic. I would gather all his records copies to yourself to be ready to hand carry to his appointment so they do not get lost, and get a fresh look. His doc may be doing all he can do that is appropriate, but new sets of eyes can be helpful. Djintonic also has an extensive research file, and take a look at the stickies. I wish you and your DH the best, as my DH and I wait for results of a biopsy of a suspicious prostate lesion.",

Other men actually report they prefer a woman doing DRE, (if anyone), and talking to women docs rather than men about sexual dysfunction, as there are less potential negative associations, and think there may be less judgment. I once had the pleasure of meeting a woman urologist when there were less than a dozen board-certified in the whole country. She was tall and athletic and had long fingers, perhaps coincidence . And her dad was a urologist, which is how she got interested, and how she got the residency position in a day when it was so rare ( that and bring brilliant).

However, trials of giving T in non PCA pts did not improve glucose control. Have you also gained weight or exercized less since ADT, which is common? That could lead to high glu and insulin resistance too. Let your GU know, but also your internist today about the glus, so you can start on appropriate DM regimen including diet, exercise, meds, Hba1c monitoring. I have seen people on ADT who started it while diabetic so it is not likely to interfere if it gets controlled. BTW hopefully you also have a baseline BMD or a plan to protect your bone with your internist ( and if he knows nothing about it, seek out an endocrinoloogist). After a couple years of ADT, BMD t scores went down -1.8 in a study and can push you into osteoporosis. Diabetics are already at independent risk of osteoporosis too.",

      "Content": "Hello again, Jess! I believe your DH\u2019s bx was two-three weeks ago? My DH had one 3/29. He had a little bit of butt pain with prolonged sitting or with squatting starting three days after bx, not testicular pain, and almost nothing now. He had some pink urine from blood for a couple days and bloody ejaculate for a week, all cleared now, we had been warned about that. His urologist told him it takes about 4-8 weeks for healing, sometimes longer ( that is why they wait at least a month before doing prostatectomy, though data is a bit iffy on whether that is important). If an MRI is done too soon after a bx it may cause false positive spots from pooled traumatized tissue. Our understanding from him is that after the intial post-bx period of taking it easy and not doing heavy exertion, regular exercize is ok but listen to the body, and does not necessarily accelerate healing. There is no diet or supplement our docs recommended to accelerate healing, just eat healthy and go easy on alcohol. If your DH has a lot of testicular pain several weeks after bx he should probably see his urologist. An infection can occur after bx and can radiate into testes though usually there is also burning with urination. Sorry he is having trouble \u2014 call your care team about the symptoms.",

      "Content": "As I posted elsewhere, DH at age 57 (otherwise pretty healthy) had a confirmed PSA bump from the 1\u2019s over several years, to sudden 3.8-4.3, <10% free, confirmed twice under proper circumstances, and due to FH of PCA in dad and a Pirads4 lesion with a 2.6x1.4 cm left peripheral lesion on MRI, he had a fusion bx. He never had any prior biopsies but he has had BPH sxs building up over several years. Prostate is 50gm on MRI and US. 12 standard template cores came back benign prostate tissue. Four cores from the targeted area came back benign prostate tissue and seminal vesicle. These were signed off on by a pathologist who is around 50 (unclear where she did residency) and is on staff in a major SF Bay area community hospital. Urologist is now offering BPH procedures like TURP or Greenlight laser and did not recommend repeat bx. TURP would give us more tissue but not from where the MRI abnormality is, Greenlight would not unless they added a loop which would give a little. DH is not keen on PAE at one of the places that does it which also would not give tissue. I am happy biopsies were negative, but understand there can still be false negatives on MRI bx, so still worry about missing PCA given the whole story as I also understand there can be false positives on MRI. I also understand if you do TURP it can later interfere with PCA surgery if PCA is found later. I am sending the slides to Epstein\u2019s lab at Hopkins for a second opinion for a fee, cash pay (they published that 6 % of second opinion slides they get were originally read as totally benign, so I am not the only worry wart). I would also like to get a second opinion on the MRI, thinking perhaps it was overread, but cannot find anywhere online to send it in. Anyone know of reputable online prostate MRI readers? DH is too busy to travel elsewhere out of the Bay area for a face to face appointment like at Mayo where they would reread the MRI, which would be another way to get another MRI read, so I am limited to online rereviews. If Epstein confirms biopsies are negative and an experienced PCA MRI reader says there is nothing much there, I will relax a bit more.",

Docs should still check PSA to work up patients with symptoms, e.g., urinary or bone symptoms that are not clearly explained, or who have unexplained weight loss. Many have forgotten that, in the prior USPSTF created furor of the last few years, (when not screening anyone, not even high risk patients, was the norm, until 2017 when recommendations were changed), many organizationally salaried docs had fear of checking PSA at all. In my area docs treating vets are still not reminded on the computer to screen for PCA in appropriately aged or risk patients, though they are reminded about 40 or so other things, like looking for falls, colon cancer of course, homelessness, PTSD, smoking and \u201cfood insecurity\u201d.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by DavefromMD The article does state that one of reasons for these results in VA is cost control. There's almost always $$$ involved in some way one way or another. I was very fortunate in that my doctors emphasized they get paid the same no matter what treatment I choose as they were all on salary and not paid by the procedure. One thing all these studies do not take into account is personal preference . . . \u201c . Dave, you may feel \u201cfortunate\u201d that VA doctors (and two-thirds of other doctors now, since the passage of ACA, previously only one-third) are salaried and get paid the same no matter what they do, but this cuts both ways. PCA screening is more work for salaried primary care docs, and then more work for urologists. Then it is more work for salaried urologists to do biopsies. The incentives for salaried docs, whether conscious or not, is to do less, but still get the same salary, just like some fee for service docs have incentive to do more for more income. Docs doing less can always point to gray area studies favoring their doing less. And government often has incentive to get away with cutting corners to avoid what may be considered bloated budgets. [Loeb] \u201csuggested that one reason VA may be adhering to national guidelines at a higher rate is its lack of financial incentives for salaried physicians to recommend expensive fee-for-service procedures. \u201c At least at our local VA, (in the top two in the country) for many years doc have not had any computer \u201creminders\u201d to screen for PCA, though there are reminders on dozens of other marginal issues \u2014 not in men with positive family histories, not in men with Agent Orange, not in men who are African American, not a reminder to any docs to consider a PSA, definitely not a reminder to do a DRE, not even to ask about urinary symptoms which many docs do not bother with unless the pt mentions them, but the doc is supposed to formally document asking about internet access and \u201cfood insecurity.\u201d Patients have not even been offered a discussion about PCA screening and docs who did it were often chastised. Urologists ( many of them salaried moonlighting contractors with no academic affiliation) also fight not to do biopsies if at all possible, (more work) making many excuses for why a PSA velocity is up. To me, that is not \u201ctip of the spear.\u201d Maybe your VA area is different. I would take the fee for service guy any day, someone who does not answer as much to a government boss, and get multiple opinions. Having said that, if a proactive pt can push himself in with complaints of symptoms and dramatic PSA rise to get a biopsy, find PCA, and be referred to the local affiliate university hospital, he is in good shape to get good and appropriate prostate care, usually free or low cost, VA paying. Will see how long it takes for the new and improved 2018 \u201cguidelines\u201d for PCA screening to be incorporated into official health maintenance reminders for primary care.",

I was trying to bring up that docs being salaried, and/or working for government, e.g., creates different incentives that are not always beneficial to patients and can indeed be detrimental. They do not have to be detrimental anymore than fee for service incentives are, but often are, just in different ways (too little rather than too much, and/or with care issues applied to populations and not unique individuals, more one-size-fits-all).

Docs doing less can always point to gray area studies favoring their doing less. And government often has incentive to get away with cutting corners to avoid what may be considered bloated budgets. [Loeb] \u201csuggested that one reason VA may be adhering to national guidelines at a higher rate is its lack of financial incentives for salaried physicians to recommend expensive fee-for-service procedures. \u201c At least at our local VA, (in the top two in the country) for many years doc have not had any computer \u201creminders\u201d to screen for PCA, though there are reminders on dozens of other marginal issues \u2014 not in men with positive family histories, not in men with Agent Orange, not in men who are African American, not a reminder to any docs to consider a PSA, definitely not a reminder to do a DRE, not even to ask about urinary symptoms which many docs do not bother with unless the pt mentions them, but the doc is supposed to formally document asking about internet access and \u201cfood insecurity.\u201d Patients have not even been offered a discussion about PCA screening and docs who did it were often chastised. Urologists ( many of them salaried moonlighting contractors with no academic affiliation) also fight not to do biopsies if at all possible, (more work) making many excuses for why a PSA velocity is up. To me, that is not \u201ctip of the spear.\u201d Maybe your VA area is different. I would take the fee for service guy any day, someone who does not answer as much to a government boss, and get multiple opinions. Having said that, if a proactive pt can push himself in with complaints of symptoms and dramatic PSA rise to get a biopsy, find PCA, and be referred to the local affiliate university hospital, he is in good shape to get good and appropriate prostate care, usually free or low cost, VA paying. Will see how long it takes for the new and improved 2018 \u201cguidelines\u201d for PCA screening to be incorporated into official health maintenance reminders for primary care.",

      "Content": "Dave, it sounds like you had good, objective care, which I know was at Hopkins. My post was just in response to your comment implying that being salaried creates objectivity in docs and is a good thing, which is also what one of the urologists in the article cited as an awesome thing, e.g., at VA. I was trying to bring up that docs being salaried, and/or working for government, e.g., creates different incentives that are not always beneficial to patients and can indeed be detrimental. They do not have to be detrimental anymore than fee for service incentives are, but often are, just in different ways (too little rather than too much, and/or with care issues applied to populations and not unique individuals, more one-size-fits-all). I hope you continue to receive appropriate and as best possible care.",

In men without known PCA, does anyone have a good citation showing how long it takes for a PSA to return to pre-bx baseline after a bx, (an average time plus SD would be most useful) ? I have read anecdotes online about six weeks, twelve weeks, and six months. If no one has a citation, I am open to more anecdotes 2. Long version: I ask because DH, age 57, healthy, remains conflicted what to do. He has BPH and sxs he would like to be rid of, 50 gram prostate, but PSA bump from 1\u0092s over years to 4.2 and < 10% free, +FH PCA. His first and only bx 3/29/18 was an MRI guided fusion bx, standard template plus four cores in an area where he has a 2.6x1.4 cm Pirads4 peripheral lesion, at a large community hospital. Bxs all read as benign prostatic tissue with or without seminal vesicle tissue, confirmed path read at Hopkins, Epstein. There can be false postive Pirads 4 or even 5 images, but most of such lesions in the literature are smaller, or path shows the reasons for false positive ( prostatitis, granuloma, scar, etc.) so I have sent the images to UCSF radiology for a second read to see if they were overread, pending. If overread before, DH would feel a little more comfortable just rxing the BPH. DH has tentatively scheduled a GreenLight with loop procedure for mid July for his BPH but wonders if another PSA, say in June, would help him decide whether to go for another MRI biopsy first at another center, e.g., of PCA excellence. If PSA rising, then he would cancel the BPH procedure and go for another bx first. I am trying to find out if that would be too soon for the PSA to be interpretable if it is up from his 4.2 baseline. So far, I have not found a lot of information showing that first doing BPH surgery and later finding PCA and needing prostatectomy would create future problems. Both community urologists (trained at two different PCA centers of excellence 15-20 years ago) would either do BPH surgery if DH wants sxs controlled, or another PSA in six months, and explain away the Pirads4 with negative bx as \u0093sometimes that just happens.\u0094 I read a paper from UT Dallas Djin cited from 2017 that showed 38% of pts whose first bx was an MRI guided bx of Pirads 5 lesions which were negative were then found to have significant PCA on subsequent either bx or prostatectomy, so these were false negative MRI guided bxs. There were some differences with DH other than the Pirads5: average age ten years older, average PSA 9 ( but wide variance), and though authors did not give ethnicity, likely a lot of African Americans, who have a higher bad PCA risk.",

The government pays the bills (Medicare, Medicaid, VA, Tricare, Obamacare subsidies, even employer subsidized private insurance etc.) so they believe they can control the care patients get, or costs will spiral, so they feel entitled to becomes nannies. This doc apparently serves on a number of government advisory panels. HMOs people sign up for, either pre-Medicare or as part of Medicare Advantage, can also restrict PSA and bx access if there is a controversial area and just not pay for it, and people like Kenny have called for a ban on insurance coverage for the PSA draw and \u201cunnecessary\u201d (they decide) biopsies. Others in Accountable Care Organizations that have docs on salary have called for penalizing docs who order PSAs for screening. The same thing was done for mammograms in women 40-50 a few years ago, even though there are thousands of women < 50 diagnosed with breast cancer annually, many of whom die due to aggressive disease. I find it amazing Kenny did not even try and qualify his comment that \u201cideal PSA screening is no screeening\u201d by excepting African-Americans and those with FH as high risk. His instructions not to screen also include no DRE, as that is a form of \u201cscreening\u201d.",

He writes: \u201c. . . .The recent publication of the third major randomized trial of prostate-specific antigen (PSA)-based screening for prostate cancer reported no difference in prostate cancer mortality after a median follow-up of 10 years in more than 400,000 men in primary care practices across the United Kingdom.

My primary care colleagues and I are still waiting for the US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) to finalize its nearly year-old draft recommendation statement on prostate cancer screening, which I characterized in a Medscape commentary as a \"surprising reversal.\" Rather than discouraging PSA screening for men of any age, the USPSTF instead advised that we routinely discuss the potential benefits and harms of screening in men aged 55-69 years and screen men who desire the test. I disagreed with this stance, which I think is analogous to advising clinicians to routinely discuss the potential benefits and harms of antibiotics for viral infections, or the potential benefits and harms of MRI in patients with uncomplicated acute low back pain. Others are contributing to the PSA debate in the pages of cancer journals, as a recent Medscape article reported. In a position statement published in the Journal of Clinical Oncology, a group of prominent urologists discussed the drop in PSA testing and prostate biopsy rates since 2012 and the rise in the percentage of men diagnosed with prostate cancer presenting with metastatic disease, which began around 2007 but now seems to be rising more sharply. They argued that in contrast to past years, when we were doing too much screening, too little screening is now being done, and they worry that a rise in morbidity and mortality from prostate cancer will follow. In order to get screening \"just right,\" they propose two solutions: \u2022 For urologists, identifying and validating biomarkers to determine which patients with high PSA levels need prostate biopsy \u2022 For primary care physicians, \"to engage in [more] conversations regarding screening that are individualized and centered on shared decision-making\" I agree that the data show that primary care physicians are doing less PSA testing, but the metastatic prostate cancer statistic, derived from a study of the National Cancer Institute's SEER database, is misleading at best. We know that a substantial proportion of prostate cancers detected by PSA screening are overdiagnosed and would never become metastatic. Less PSA testing means that we are finding fewer of these cancers-in-name-only, so the proportion of all prostate cancers that are metastatic at diagnosis rises as a result. This is likely to be a statistical quirk rather than an early indication that less PSA testing will lead to more deaths. As for having family physicians do more shared decision-making with men about PSA testing, a commentary in JAMA Oncology by an internist and two oncologists argued that such discussions are a \"mirage\" in the real world of primary care. The authors asserted that in contrast to guideline recommendations, \"the majority of decisions about PSA testing are not shared but made unilaterally by primary care physicians\" due to multiple barriers, including time, competing demands, and a dearth of data on how race and family history affect one's risk for clinically important prostate cancer and the benefits and harms of screening. Further, they compared an elevated PSA level to \"quicksand,\" where a cascade of invasive diagnostic interventions with scant supporting evidence can follow in rapid succession and create an unstoppable momentum of their own.

I sat with him at the initial urology appointment with his PSA of 4.2 and <10% free report from his primary care doc, and many years of worsening BPH symptoms he ignored. I asked the doc to comment on my reading that 30-50% of patients with free PSA this low have some level of cancer, and he just shrugged and replied that 50% or more do not and many of those have BPH. No citation offered, but it does make some sense. BTW meanwhile DH had his MRI I pushed for, and which insurance covered, and which showed a 2.5x1.4 cm suspicious area. The guided bx is 3/29. I hope it is just a big nest of prostatitis and a false positive, despite the free PSA being low, and also wish your DH a negative MRI on 4/1!",

So I am researching what kind of problems you can get with finding PCA and doing prostatectomy a year or more in the future if he were to get limited BPH surgery now....2.
