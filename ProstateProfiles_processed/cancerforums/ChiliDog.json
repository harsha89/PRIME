Don't take Xanax as there is a kick back after four hours or so, meaning you get more anxious when it wears off. (Husband is a doc.) And remember, it's just a normal work day for anesthesia, nurses, techs, and the doctors! Surgery is scary, but you will probably find that on the day of, you will be calm!",

      "Content": "My husband had this done at MassGeneral last week. Not sure if it was a \"named\" procedure, or software. I wasn't in the room, but I know the doc did just this, superimposed the MRI images onto the real time ultrasound. He took fifteen samples, three were for a research study. (I assume they were doubles.) We had to wait six weeks for this specific test, as his regular urologist doesn't do it. Dr. Feldman did the test and my husband said he had excellent technique. My husband had fifteen negative samples in his biopsy earlier in the year with the endorectal ultrasound. Oh, and for future biopsy testing, my husband found that he was much more comfortable with 5 mg of Valium on board. He didn't want to take narcotics because of having to drink a ton of water afterward and urinate. He's a physician and said that narcotics can impact urination in a negative way. We are waiting for the results of this biopsy, none too patiently.",

      "Content": "I've tried to read all the papers you listed, because I hear your concerns. As you know there is no literature that randomly selects men, with similar disease criteria, and puts them in to a primary radiation treatment or primary surgical treatment. No man, that I know, would agree to that. Not on this site, anyway. I think it's worth looking at whether surgery to remove a high Gleason prostate is better than radiation and drug therapy alone. I've said a million times (I'm sorry to be boring about it) that we are lucky that our internist has studied prostate cancer his whole professional life. He told us that men with high PSAs do better with surgery. He had the data to back that up. And my high PSA husband still can not get his head around surgery and chose radiation. Despite the fact that husband has spent many years doing research as a physician, he did not follow the data, he followed his personal preference. I very much wanted him to do surgery, but I was afraid he would choose no treatment, and his cancer was too advanced for that choice. I've been supportive of his choice, but asked him the other day if he would reconsider and have surgery. \"Ugh!\" he replied. I guess not. He had his first hot flash this morning, it's almost three weeks since his Lupron injection and he takes Casodex.",

My husband's first concern was that he should retire, because the cancer had moved out of the prostate, as indicated in the MRI. He is still working, and although he has to be mentally alert, he does his job sitting in a comfortable chair. He's calmed down a bit, but we'd like to know what the recovery period is like after a prostatectomy and/or radiation? Are there other treatments and recoveries that we should know about. I think just about all the males in his high school and college classes have had prostate problems, with a full variety of treatment modalities, and all good outcomes.",

Newporter, I'd say that ED is important! But I'd rather have the husband alive, and well, the rest is secondary. My impulse is to get that prostate outta here, but it's not my body. Shu246, thanks for sharing your experience. He needs to sit comfortably and talk to people. He does so now, for many hours a day. But you can't always do what you did before. We'll manage whatever comes along.",
