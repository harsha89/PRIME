U may get some bowel issues, but they don't last long. The hardest part will be getting the timing down to have a full bladder before each session. That can take a little practice, but with 37/38 treatments coming, you will need to get the hang of it. Most of the SE if you are going to have any will be long after SRT is over.

I see where you are planning on surgery, and given the stats that u have listed, it looks like u have a excellent chance for a cure. All G6 and G7 (3+4) puts you in the low-intermediate risk group. Good to hear you are going to MDA, several guys here have had a positive experience there. ( also a major cancer center) Read Dr. Patrick Walsh's book ( 3rd edition) \" surviving prostate cancer\". Lots of good information and it will help you get a feel for what's ahead. Lots of peaks and valleys, but you will get thru it. The days pass quickly, and in no time you will be cancer free. Keep asking questions, and remember you are not alone. Best wishes, MM",

As I read your post, I can't help but just shake my head and wonder.....what in the world is going on!!

Waiting eight years? While a healthy diet surely can be of benefit, I can assure you that it will not cure any existing PCa. Honestly, after 10 years of sitting around doing nothing, your husband may qualify as a modern miracle. All that being said, it may not be to late. Take action NOW!! Psa numbers that high are not a good sign. Sorry to sound harsh. This is a forum of support and encouragement. So let me encourage you.

      "Content": "Mike: The key thing is that u have started ADT, and that will control the cancer while you wait for SRT. They may not suspect any mets, but they are trying to guard against any micro-mets which would not show up on any scans. Just worry about healing, and taking one day at a time. Getting used to the HT, etc. It is a change in one's life. Given that u had a positive node, they will keep u on it for awhile. But stay the course Mike, you stand a good chance of beating this, and congrats on getting that PSA response. That is impressive. Keep us posted. MM",

      "Content": "Mike: Since you are currently on Casodex, and I assume the shot you will be receiving will be Lupron, you still have time to wait for the 3 month PSA. The ADT will stop the cancer in it's tracks while you heal. With a 1.1 at six weeks, it probably won't get much better to the point where it will change the course of your treatment. So hang in and heal, and then get the 3 month test. I am going to assume the ADT will start knocking your PSA down. But do not be misled, you still need the SRT to shoot for the cure, and it is still possible! Stay strong brother. MM",

Since u have not had any HT since the 30 days of casodex before your operation, we can assume that your numbers are not being \"masked\" by anything. For now, I would let myself heal as much as possible, and go along for as long as I can without additional treatment. ( u do not mention your continence or any ED issues) I would monitor my PSA every 8-12 weeks, and when it goes to 0.03 or greater, I would pull the trigger. Using the uPSA test, a reading of >0.03 for high risk people like yourself is very indicative of BCR. I would get all my ducks in a row, and be ready to act when your uPSA tells u to do so. Your PSA level will be the most important factor in determining the potential of the success with ADT/SRT. For now sit tight, but be on top of this every 8-12 weeks. Best, MM",

Your doctor has no idea if he got all the cancer out. He can guess, and that's about it. Your tested lymph nodes were negative, but you did have possible lymphatic invasion, which is just another adverse factor which would allow the cancer to get into your bloodstream or lymph system. There are conflicting views as to how serious a pathological feature this is. The good news is the rest of your report is fine. With only a G7 3/4.... even in a SRT situation I think u will be fine.

I see where you are planning on surgery, and given the stats that u have listed, it looks like u have a excellent chance for a cure. All G6 and G7 (3+4) puts you in the low-intermediate risk group. Good to hear you are going to MDA, several guys here have had a positive experience there. ( also a major cancer center) Read Dr. Patrick Walsh's book ( 3rd edition) \" surviving prostate cancer\". Lots of good information and it will help you get a feel for what's ahead. Lots of peaks and valleys, but you will get thru it. The days pass quickly, and in no time you will be cancer free.

Your doctor has no idea if he got all the cancer out. He can guess, and that's about it. Your tested lymph nodes were negative, but you did have possible lymphatic invasion, which is just another adverse factor which would allow the cancer to get into your bloodstream or lymph system. There are conflicting views as to how serious a pathological feature this is. The good news is the rest of your report is fine. With only a G7 3/4.... even in a SRT situation I think u will be fine.

      "Content": "Hey Caddy: Welcome to the forum, sorry u have to be here, but at least it is with a G6. Your case seems to be local, the only thing that would concern me in what u have written is that u have 5 positive cores. That probably means a call for action. While the Cat scan may show that the disease is contained, that is not a certainty. One never knows until the pathology, should you be choosing surgery. I would agree that you have no reason to rush, so I would get a few more opinions and check out all options. Speak with a Robotic surgeon, and speak with a RO. The side effects are something to not take lightly, as they can be life altering. Pick up a copy of Dr. Patrick Walsh's book \"The guide to Surviving Prostate Cancer\". Lots of good information that will get you started. Keep us posted. Best, MM",

While the Cat scan may show that the disease is contained, that is not a certainty. One never knows until the pathology, should you be choosing surgery. I would agree that you have no reason to rush, so I would get a few more opinions and check out all options. Speak with a Robotic surgeon, and speak with a RO.

As I read your post, I can't help but just shake my head and wonder.....what in the world is going on!! The PSA numbers that you refer to should have been enough to alert any medical professional that action was/is required. Eight years ago his PSA was 32? And what did the doctor recommend? Waiting eight years? While a healthy diet surely can be of benefit, I can assure you that it will not cure any existing PCa. Honestly, after 10 years of sitting around doing nothing, your husband may qualify as a modern miracle. All that being said, it may not be to late. Take action NOW!! Psa numbers that high are not a good sign. Sorry to sound harsh. This is a forum of support and encouragement. So let me encourage you. If your husband does not take action, he may not have another 10 years to think about it. Keep us posted on his condition. If you act now, modern treatments could keep him alive for many years.

      "Content": "Mike: Since you are currently on Casodex, and I assume the shot you will be receiving will be Lupron, you still have time to wait for the 3 month PSA. The ADT will stop the cancer in it's tracks while you heal. With a 1.1 at six weeks, it probably won't get much better to the point where it will change the course of your treatment. So hang in and heal, and then get the 3 month test. I am going to assume the ADT will start knocking your PSA down. But do not be misled, you still need the SRT to shoot for the cure, and it is still possible! Stay strong brother. MM",

Getting used to the HT, etc. It is a change in one's life. Given that u had a positive node, they will keep u on it for awhile. But stay the course Mike, you stand a good chance of beating this, and congrats on getting that PSA response. That is impressive. Keep us posted. MM",

Your case seems to be local, the only thing that would concern me in what u have written is that u have 5 positive cores. That probably means a call for action. While the Cat scan may show that the disease is contained, that is not a certainty. One never knows until the pathology, should you be choosing surgery. I would agree that you have no reason to rush, so I would get a few more opinions and check out all options. Speak with a Robotic surgeon, and speak with a RO.

My surgeon would not touch me for 6-8 weeks after the biopsy. Told me I had to heal. Oh well. Glad it worked out well for u and your husband. Many more Zero's your way. MM",

      "Content": "Hello Mike: Interesting post. I think the \"Who Are Us\" probably could be changed to \"Who am I? Most of what you have said about who stays on the forum is correct. But, I think it is more about the person, and who they are and their life situation. Time plays a major part in forum participation. What is it that a person does everyday? Does he/she have the time for this? Make no mistake, it is a commitment. I for one have a great deal of admiration for the 2 guys who have already responded to your thread. One guy has a minor case, one guy no case at all. Yet they are all over this board reaching out to help others and provide support and information, paying it forward. Why am I still around? To pay back all the good things that have happened to me by joining this forum. I feel a debt of gratitude to those who have helped me during this ordeal. Think about it, total strangers reaching out to help others, it has been quite amazing. With nothing in it for themselves! This is not to be critical of those who have come and gone. Life gets in the way of many things. I guess it depends upon how a person feels inside themselves. For myself, I will continue to pay it forward, and stay the course. Wishing you the best, MM",

And finally, can either one of u comment on the Partin table. If I have a 59% chance of PC being contained and a 32% chance of it being on the \"edge of the capsule\" that would total 91%. Face value seems like good odds. Edge of the capsule being defined as.....good, bad, or kind of unknown?

      "Content": "Hey Ourtime: I am a Gleason 8 (4+4) When my current uro delivered the news, she ran by me what is called the Partin tables, a method used at John Hopkins ( or developed by a uro there) to predict what you are asking. Google John Hopkins Partin tables and you may plug in your husbands numbers. Mine are as follows: 59% organ confined, 32% EPE ( just outside the capsule ) 6% chance to the seminal vesiciles, and 3% chance to the lymph nodes. Now, I just went to chiguys link to sloan ket and the numbers for me were much worse. So, I can't help you there. For now i am going to go with the uro who sat me down and gave me this information as one of the tools for her recommendations for treatment. Once again to be clear, I am not sure about the sloan ket link. The partin tables are also discussed in Dr. Walsh's book. My best, MM",

The 3 most important things are baggy shorts/ sweats, a nice recliner, and depends. (Extra absorbent) Don't waste your money running around buying all the crap they tell u. Buy it as needed. U may not need any type of ointment, rubber gloves, wipes, blah, blah, blah. Since it is summer, get some baggy shorts, hang the bag in your pocket, and pee away!! Use the big bag so u don't have to change it often. Get a long cord with the bag ( hospital provided) and u can sleep in your bed. Keep the bag below u. Best Wishes, MM",

U r just putting it around where the catheter is inserted in your penis. BTW...half the stuff they told me I needed I never used. The 3 most important things are baggy shorts/ sweats, a nice recliner, and depends. (Extra absorbent) Don't waste your money running around buying all the crap they tell u. Buy it as needed. U may not need any type of ointment, rubber gloves, wipes, blah, blah, blah. Since it is summer, get some baggy shorts, hang the bag in your pocket, and pee away!! Use the big bag so u don't have to change it often. Get a long cord with the bag ( hospital provided) and u can sleep in your bed. Keep the bag below u. Best Wishes, MM",

As usual, a very informative and well written account of what goes on during the process, I'm glad to hear he has the bladder issue down pat. In most discussions about SRT, no one has really tackled the diet issues, etc. I am glad you have brought it to the forefront. Your husband is very lucky to have you as his advocate, you are a great role model for all SO/spouses/partners. Please keep us posted...MM",

Your pathology report was a victory, and you should be feeling a sigh of relief. pT2c post-op is not all bad. G7 (4+3) not the end of the world. Rest easy, there is a very good chance he is cured. Jim215 and Chuck have covered the finer points of your post. Keep us posted on your Aug. 5th appointment. And remember, it takes 8-12 weeks after surgery to feel good again. It is a major operation.

      "Content": "Hello Flourish: Welcome to the forum. Sorry for what you are going thru as a couple. Another side effect of PCa....the gift that keeps on giving. ( Please note my sarcasm). You don't mention anything about ADT, or anything about the effects on your sex life. My apologies if that statement was a bit to personal. This disease has many different faces, and none of them are good. Many men go thru what you are describing, myself being one of them. Lots of body changes and various feelings of what the hell just happened to me. It takes some time to come to grips with the \"new normal\". Things will never be the same...but they can be even better on certain levels. If you could create a signature and tell us more about your husband, perhaps that would give a clearer picture. I guess what I am saying is what you have described is NOT unique to u. Many of us are going thru it. Don't give up, your husband did not ask for PCa! He needs to get past the dark side, and then u two can work on things. Please keep us posted. Warmest Regards, MM FWIW, we have a Forum sister with the Handle \"Ready2Fight\". She is a lovely woman, and one of the kindest people I have come to know. She is well educated, and very giving of her time. Send her a PM if u like, perhaps another woman's perspective would be of some help. Good luck, MM",

      "Content": "Hello Gary. There are many studies and various opinions as to how long one should be on HT. As with most things PCa, there is no clear cut answer. The standard of care for someone with your pathology would probably be all u have done plus 2 full years of ADT. I know it\u0092s tough, but you will make it thru. Your PSA, while low, was never undetectable after RP. You have LN involvement. I would go with what the University of Chicago and Loyola Cancer Center told me...2 years. It\u0092s a long road, but I\u0092m almost done. I have a signature, but it does not show up when using my iPhone. Click on my name and take a look. Good luck, MM",

I find it a bit interesting that they are even taking your PSA at this stage. Why? Did they order it, or did u? What was your pathological staging? So your PSA went from 0.26 to .02. So far, so good. Hang in there, but to ease your mind u are heading in the correct direction. Best, MM",

MD Anderson in Houston is the mecca for cancer centers...but the last thing u want to do is be treated if u don't need to be.

      "Content": "Rooster:Since your RP failed, the next bag of tricks is to shoot for a cure or durable ( many years) remission via SRT/ HT. First of all, u may be ok. This is the hard part, the waiting game. Eligard/ Lupron may work for many years. Who's to say 2 years? Everyone is different, and many men have great responses for much longer than that. HT not only does what Roblee suggested, but along with radiation can kill cells. Hopefully any stray cells that may be floating about. Should your PSA continue to rise and u become hormone refractory, there are additional bullets to fire before becoming stage 4. U just don't automatically go to stage 4. Many treatments available and others in the pipeline to tame this beast. Hope this helps. MM",

      "Content": "Hey Brite: Sorry to year about your urologist/surgeon. Much more common than we would like to think. Let\u0092s move on. I would get a 6 week uPSA and see where u are at that point. Even with your high PSA, that time frame would be a good starting point to see where he is at. I would not wait 3 months. Surely by 8 weeks the half life of PSA will have expired and get u a accurate look. Yes, I do have the name of a RO who was recommended to me that is out of Hyde Park. Let me look it up and pass it on. I will reply tomorrow. I\u0092m not sure of Dr. McCall\u0092s locations. I know for sure she is at the Frankfort/ Lenox location. Check it out. She\u0092s worth it. At this stage All u would be needing is a consultation to start getting your ducks in a row. Start with Dr. S at Hyde Park. He is a straight shooter who tells it like he sees it, but really cares about the patient. I liked him. You are very early in the process, get the ball rolling with Dr.S as soon as u can. See what he thinks. I\u0092m currently being treated at Loyola Medical. My cousin is my PCP who got me in with my current urologist. If we need to find additional options, I will make some calls to him. The big 4 in Chicago.....Northwestern, UC, Loyola, Rush. Keep me posted, don\u0092t wait take action now and get in to see him soon. Best, MM",

      "Content": "Hello Gary. There are many studies and various opinions as to how long one should be on HT. As with most things PCa, there is no clear cut answer. The standard of care for someone with your pathology would probably be all u have done plus 2 full years of ADT. I know it\u0092s tough, but you will make it thru. Your PSA, while low, was never undetectable after RP. You have LN involvement. I would go with what the University of Chicago and Loyola Cancer Center told me...2 years. It\u0092s a long road, but I\u0092m almost done. I have a signature, but it does not show up when using my iPhone. Click on my name and take a look. Good luck, MM",

      "Content": "Hello Brite: Just saw your post. I am afraid my forum sister R2F gives me to much credit. I'm no expert, but I do have a few suggestions for u here in the Chicago area. Ok, so u just had a RP. It says in your signature that it was in October 2017. Why are u starting Lupron right now? Can u tell me anything about his PSA post-op? Has he even been tested yet? At this stage I would not even be talking to a urologist/surgeon. As a pT3B NO, I would be speaking to a MO or a RO. Maybe they are being aggressive because of your pre-op PSA, I don't know. That would be my guess. Here in Chicago the RO that I would recommend would be from the University of Chicago ( Frankfort affiliate) Dr. Ann McCall. Probably the best doctor that I have come across during my treatments. A lovely woman, always has time for u, and answers EM in about an hour. She's the best. For an MO, I would choose Dr. Russell Szmulewitz at the UC. ( Located in Hyde Park in the city) He is Assistant Professor of Hematology/Oncology. Very matter of fact, but a real good guy. I would not go to a Urologist at this stage, their work is done. If u could provide more information as to his current state, I may be able to help more. Best of Luck, MM..............If u need more help, just ask",

      "Content": "Hello Brite: Just saw your post. I am afraid my forum sister R2F gives me to much credit. I'm no expert, but I do have a few suggestions for u here in the Chicago area. Ok, so u just had a RP. It says in your signature that it was in October 2017. Why are u starting Lupron right now? Can u tell me anything about his PSA post-op? Has he even been tested yet? At this stage I would not even be talking to a urologist/surgeon. As a pT3B NO, I would be speaking to a MO or a RO. Maybe they are being aggressive because of your pre-op PSA, I don't know. That would be my guess. Here in Chicago the RO that I would recommend would be from the University of Chicago ( Frankfort affiliate) Dr. Ann McCall. Probably the best doctor that I have come across during my treatments. A lovely woman, always has time for u, and answers EM in about an hour. She's the best. For an MO, I would choose Dr. Russell Szmulewitz at the UC. ( Located in Hyde Park in the city) He is Assistant Professor of Hematology/Oncology. Very matter of fact, but a real good guy. I would not go to a Urologist at this stage, their work is done. If u could provide more information as to his current state, I may be able to help more. Best of Luck, MM..............If u need more help, just ask",

      "Content": "Hey Brite: Sorry to year about your urologist/surgeon. Much more common than we would like to think. Let\u0092s move on. I would get a 6 week uPSA and see where u are at that point. Even with your high PSA, that time frame would be a good starting point to see where he is at. I would not wait 3 months. Surely by 8 weeks the half life of PSA will have expired and get u a accurate look. Yes, I do have the name of a RO who was recommended to me that is out of Hyde Park. Let me look it up and pass it on. I will reply tomorrow. I\u0092m not sure of Dr. McCall\u0092s locations. I know for sure she is at the Frankfort/ Lenox location. Check it out. She\u0092s worth it. At this stage All u would be needing is a consultation to start getting your ducks in a row. Start with Dr. S at Hyde Park. He is a straight shooter who tells it like he sees it, but really cares about the patient. I liked him. You are very early in the process, get the ball rolling with Dr.S as soon as u can. See what he thinks. I\u0092m currently being treated at Loyola Medical. My cousin is my PCP who got me in with my current urologist. If we need to find additional options, I will make some calls to him. The big 4 in Chicago.....Northwestern, UC, Loyola, Rush. Keep me posted, don\u0092t wait take action now and get in to see him soon. Best, MM",

( all in a good way) You are the official poet laureate of cancer forums! I knew right away that you were in education, as my greatest fear would be following your words with having to construct a post of my own. What has impressed me most about your journey is....YOU! Your endless words of encouragement to others, offering hope and guidance to those in need. Your picking up on when someone needs help, or knowing when to be a good listener. I admire the amount of time you give to others, and the willingness to share your story. You have a wealth of experience in both life and PCa, please stick around, you will be a valuable addition. Now on to the important stuff.....Take ISU and the 6.5 at home tomorrow. They won't let us down. TCU is ripe to be had! I would tell you to hang in, but you already know how to do that.

      "Content": "Rooster:Since your RP failed, the next bag of tricks is to shoot for a cure or durable ( many years) remission via SRT/ HT. First of all, u may be ok. This is the hard part, the waiting game. Eligard/ Lupron may work for many years. Who's to say 2 years? Everyone is different, and many men have great responses for much longer than that. HT not only does what Roblee suggested, but along with radiation can kill cells. Hopefully any stray cells that may be floating about. Should your PSA continue to rise and u become hormone refractory, there are additional bullets to fire before becoming stage 4. U just don't automatically go to stage 4. Many treatments available and others in the pipeline to tame this beast. Hope this helps. MM",

      "Content": "Hello Jet. Thanks for the reply. Not sure I get it, perhaps someone more knowledgeable will chime in. The neurovascular bundles are located in the soft tissue that surrounds the prostate gland. Your tumor was in the bundle. You had EPE, with negative margins. We have already discussed that at length in several posts on this forum. I would have to think the invading of the nerve bundles caused the pathological staging u received. The question I have still stands. Why is the surgeon telling u it was all contained? I have a guess, but just found ur case curious. In any event, wishing u all the best. MM",

      "Content": "Hey Brite: Sorry to year about your urologist/surgeon. Much more common than we would like to think. Let\u0092s move on. I would get a 6 week uPSA and see where u are at that point. Even with your high PSA, that time frame would be a good starting point to see where he is at. I would not wait 3 months. Surely by 8 weeks the half life of PSA will have expired and get u a accurate look. Yes, I do have the name of a RO who was recommended to me that is out of Hyde Park. Let me look it up and pass it on. I will reply tomorrow. I\u0092m not sure of Dr. McCall\u0092s locations. I know for sure she is at the Frankfort/ Lenox location. Check it out. She\u0092s worth it. At this stage All u would be needing is a consultation to start getting your ducks in a row. Start with Dr. S at Hyde Park. He is a straight shooter who tells it like he sees it, but really cares about the patient. I liked him. You are very early in the process, get the ball rolling with Dr.S as soon as u can. See what he thinks. I\u0092m currently being treated at Loyola Medical. My cousin is my PCP who got me in with my current urologist. If we need to find additional options, I will make some calls to him. The big 4 in Chicago.....Northwestern, UC, Loyola, Rush. Keep me posted, don\u0092t wait take action now and get in to see him soon. Best, MM",

Any increase above 0.03 could be a indication of BCR. Your correct about 1 thing, your GP knows nothing. If that is his idea of giving you advice, I would tell him to stick to what he knows. You should be seeing a urologist, or RO. Beware, many Uros have a annoying habit of waiting to long to initiate SRT. I would almost just make a appointment with the RO. You are correct to be concerned about any increase in PSA. It begs your attention. Best, MM",

      "Content": "Hello Brite: Just saw your post. I am afraid my forum sister R2F gives me to much credit. I'm no expert, but I do have a few suggestions for u here in the Chicago area. Ok, so u just had a RP. It says in your signature that it was in October 2017. Why are u starting Lupron right now? Can u tell me anything about his PSA post-op? Has he even been tested yet? At this stage I would not even be talking to a urologist/surgeon. As a pT3B NO, I would be speaking to a MO or a RO. Maybe they are being aggressive because of your pre-op PSA, I don't know. That would be my guess. Here in Chicago the RO that I would recommend would be from the University of Chicago ( Frankfort affiliate) Dr. Ann McCall. Probably the best doctor that I have come across during my treatments. A lovely woman, always has time for u, and answers EM in about an hour. She's the best. For an MO, I would choose Dr. Russell Szmulewitz at the UC. ( Located in Hyde Park in the city) He is Assistant Professor of Hematology/Oncology. Very matter of fact, but a real good guy. I would not go to a Urologist at this stage, their work is done. If u could provide more information as to his current state, I may be able to help more. Best of Luck, MM..............If u need more help, just ask",

I do not remember your risk status, but u might want to consider the uPSA test, in addition to being tested more than once in a year. Once done with SRT, and because u are receiving 3-month shots of Lupron, I would think that they should be testing u before each shot? Like once every 3 months. Since your PSA is doing well, I would assume that your \"T\" level is in the correct place, but a check on that could not hurt either. As for me, doing as well as I could have asked. So far, so good.

      "Content": "Hello Paul. Welcome to the forum. Sorry you have to be here, but at least you are here with a Gleason 6. If you would care to list your stats in a signature page, many folks here will be able to ease some of the stress that you are experiencing. As I said, if all you have to worry about is the Gleason 6, my guess is that you have a excellent chance for a complete cure, and will be done with treatment after your RALP. A G6 prostate cancer is very low-risk. I'm not positive, but I don't think the cancer cells of a G6 are capable of spreading. Given your extremely low PSA, I would think that is has not spread and is confined to the capsule. To sum up, you are probably 10 car lengths in the clear!!( based on what you have written) What you should be thinking is I am going to be fine, and within a year my life will be back to normal. Your case, as you have presented it, is just not that serious. It is completely normal for the mind to wonder and dark thoughts to enter. That will ease as time moves along. Don't worry now about what \"might\" occur after the surgery. Just focus on the here and now. If all they found on the biopsy is a G6 ( 3+3), even a small upgrade is not a big worry. For now, concentrate on making smart decisions based on what you know now. I assume you have picked a surgeon who has at least 300-400 RALPS under his belt. Your main concern now is the best surgeon you can find, and your SE and cancer cure will be just fine. Be nice to your wife, we all need people to stand behind us!! Remember, you are not alone, we all are here for you. Best Regards, MM",

I was just saying that IF something were to change, the earlier we know about it the better! Outcomes in the world of PCa can be affected by one's timing. In any event, u seem to be happy and doing well. Please keep me posted on your progress, and if I may be of any help, ask away. Best, MM",

      "Content": "Hey Jimmy: As you will see from my signature profile, I have been all over the board as far as my diagnoses and staging went. I think the answer to your question may hinge on actually knowing your staging. I choose surgery because my clinical staging was T2c. Meaning it was contained to the capsule. Regrettably, it did not turn out that way. My pathological staging or final stage was pT3bNOMO. Herein lies the problem. In many cases, surgery is not curative with T3 staging. Some yes, some no. Many of the T3 patients find themselves facing this situation. Meaning having surgery, and then facing secondary treatment. I guess what I am saying is you may end up having to have radiation and end up in the same place if you just would have started radiation in the first place. Had I have known this in my situation, I may have choose some sort of brachytherapy/ ADT and not had the additional issues associated with surgery. I don't know, tough call. With one G9 and many G8, you find yourself in a high risk category. All this is coming from a guy who just had surgery. My readings and research are leading me to think that for T3 patients, some sort of radiation/HT combo may be just as useful, without having to go thru 2 procedures. BTW, the CT scan was probably just of the pelvic Lymph nodes. That would not tell u much about possible PM, EPE, SV... etc. Perhaps others here will chime in on how to get a better read on that.

      "Content": "Hey Jimmy: As you will see from my signature profile, I have been all over the board as far as my diagnoses and staging went. I think the answer to your question may hinge on actually knowing your staging. I choose surgery because my clinical staging was T2c. Meaning it was contained to the capsule. Regrettably, it did not turn out that way. My pathological staging or final stage was pT3bNOMO. Herein lies the problem. In many cases, surgery is not curative with T3 staging. Some yes, some no. Many of the T3 patients find themselves facing this situation. Meaning having surgery, and then facing secondary treatment. I guess what I am saying is you may end up having to have radiation and end up in the same place if you just would have started radiation in the first place. Had I have known this in my situation, I may have choose some sort of brachytherapy/ ADT and not had the additional issues associated with surgery. I don't know, tough call. With one G9 and many G8, you find yourself in a high risk category. All this is coming from a guy who just had surgery. My readings and research are leading me to think that for T3 patients, some sort of radiation/HT combo may be just as useful, without having to go thru 2 procedures. BTW, the CT scan was probably just of the pelvic Lymph nodes. That would not tell u much about possible PM, EPE, SV... etc. Perhaps others here will chime in on how to get a better read on that. Hang in there, we are all here for u. Regards, MM",

      "Content": "Hello Swarren. I guess I will disagree ever so slightly with what has already been said. PCa does not have to be contained to be cured. It certainly makes it more likely, but you received Lupron to not only aid in the radiation process, but to kill any cells that potentially are not in the radiation field. There has been research that shows it can happen. ( killing of stray cells) As Pratoman says, a lot depends upon your specific case. In the world of high-risk PCa, the word \"cured\" should be used with the utmost caution. Please tell us more about yourself, if comfortable. Best, MM",

      "Content": "Hello BAB. Welcome to the forum. Brother MF, as usual, has covered most of the bases. I would just add that with 12+ cores, and 2 of them G7 (4+3) I would go ahead and get a second reading of the slides. Any core with a dominant pattern 4 should be taken seriously, and I would get a second reading just to be sure. So far u would be classified as Grade group 3, if I am not mistaken. ( higher intermediate risk-group). This all being said, check out all your options, and the first step is getting a second reading. Cost is around 250$. Don't take anything for granted, and during this journey one is best to expect the unexpected. Keep us posted on the slide results, we are here to help u. You are not alone. Best, MM",

      "Content": "Hello Kbolieu. Welcome to the forum. I am at work and I saw this post. Honestly, this post is making my skin crawl. Not because of your husbands Dx, but because of the surgeons behavior in this case. I would probably be looking to throw him off the top of the nearest building. With this high risk case, to tell you that the best move is surgery, without talking about any other potential options, is downright brutal. I'm sorry, I just have to vent on this. But, that is all behind you now. Yes, get to MDA ASAP. Take a deep breath. They will point u in the correct direction. If you could create a signature and list all your husbands stats, that would be helpful. Stay strong, there are many treatments and options out there. Get away from this goofball surgeon. Go to MDA. They will help you with a game plan. Yes, you need to see a MO and a RO. Be pro-active, there is still plenty of time to have a positive outcome. And yes, some potential treatments down the road may keep him near the place where he is being treated. More to follow. Best, MM",

What you are experiencing seems severe and a bit out of the ordinary. I had SRT and for the most part it was no trouble. I am assuming that you started with HT and then went to RT as your primary treatment. I would talk to the RO right away. Something not quite right here. I just wanted to answer and bump this up to the top, hopefully one of the forum brothers with RT as a primary will be chiming in soon. Sorry that u are going thru this. Best, MM",

Kind of curious as to your treatment plan for a intermediate risk case. As far as the RT, I had some loose bowels, but the biggest issue was the full bladder and the timing of the radiation. The drive home in that regard was no picnic. As time went by, I needed a restroom. Had some severe I have to go now issues. What u are experiencing is way beyond. Check it out and let us know. Did you have any diagnostic tests that made HT necessary right away? Or was it the 4+3? Good luck sportbug. MM",

Not because of your husbands Dx, but because of the surgeons behavior in this case. I would probably be looking to throw him off the top of the nearest building. With this high risk case, to tell you that the best move is surgery, without talking about any other potential options, is downright brutal. I'm sorry, I just have to vent on this. But, that is all behind you now. Yes, get to MDA ASAP. Take a deep breath. They will point u in the correct direction. If you could create a signature and list all your husbands stats, that would be helpful. Stay strong, there are many treatments and options out there. Get away from this goofball surgeon. Go to MDA. They will help you with a game plan. Yes, you need to see a MO and a RO. Be pro-active, there is still plenty of time to have a positive outcome. And yes, some potential treatments down the road may keep him near the place where he is being treated. More to follow. Best, MM",

Looks like the HT is working and you are responding quite well. Since you are now on HT, you have some time to check out all your options. I could make a case for either one, but it's your call. Nice to see you driving down the PSA. Looks to me like you have a great chance here for success. Best, MM",

Not good, but to this point in time, manageable. Dosage of Lupron Injection depends on the condition being treated, ( extent of) and the patient's age and sex. There may be other drugs that can interact with the Lupron Injection to help you with some of the issues you are having. Perhaps you should have a conversation with your MO and explain your concerns. For some men, the side effects become to much to handle. Many will have severe reactions. See if your MO can help you in this regard. You should not be sitting in this much discomfort.

      "Content": "Hello Glenn. Well for not having your PSA checked for 5 years with basically a G8, I would say as of now you are quite lucky. While .9 is getting up there, and would put you into a late salvage category, it does not necessarily mean it has metastasized. You are certainly playing with fire, and I would be contacting a RO immediately. For someone with no additional treatment other than primary, and to ignore it for 5 years, I would have expected a much higher number. Act now! Best, MM",

Based on the information given, I would go under the assumption that u have a serious case, although that does not mean it can't be controlled and managed for many years to come. For now, I would be taking this case to a major cancer center, and look for meetings with a RO and MO. If u are in a remote location, perhaps u could indicate where u live and others will have some suggestions as to treatment centers. It is a lot to take in, but the beginning is always the hard part. Please keep us informed as to the results, and again RobLee has offered excellent advice. Good Luck, MM",

I assume he is a pT3b. Was he offered ADT when he had the SRT? If so, did he decline? SRT/ADT combined will give you a 50% better outcome ( or chance of) than either one alone. There are many studies supporting this. I am currently under going HT, happy to share my experiences. The more information u can give us, the better.

I am surprised that they are not testing u with the uPSA, given your higher risk status. Have they been testing your \"t\" levels all along? In answer to your question regarding staying on Casodex after the first few months, it really is up to the RO. Mine told me it was not necessary after the SRT ended. Kind of there is no right or wrong on that one. Some combine the 2, others do not. Best of luck, and congrats on the \"ZERO\"!!!! MM",

Once that action is taken, I would develop a plan from there. As Southsider points out, if it is 60, there is probably cancer present. However, additional testing may still allow your treatment to produce a cure. No way to tell until things play out. One thing for sure, do not ignore it. Keep us posted, MM",

I assume he is a pT3b. Was he offered ADT when he had the SRT? If so, did he decline? SRT/ADT combined will give you a 50% better outcome ( or chance of) than either one alone. There are many studies supporting this. I am currently under going HT, happy to share my experiences. The more information u can give us, the better. Please list his history since the SRT he received 6 months after RALP. Best Regards, MM",

      "Content": "Hello Sept. We are here to help. Could you please post his most recent stats in the signature page. It will make it easier to comment. Also 2 questions come to mind. I assume he is a pT3b. Was he offered ADT when he had the SRT? If so, did he decline? SRT/ADT combined will give you a 50% better outcome ( or chance of) than either one alone. There are many studies supporting this. I am currently under going HT, happy to share my experiences. The more information u can give us, the better. Please list his history since the SRT he received 6 months after RALP. Best Regards, MM",

Kind of curious as to your treatment plan for a intermediate risk case. As far as the RT, I had some loose bowels, but the biggest issue was the full bladder and the timing of the radiation. The drive home in that regard was no picnic. As time went by, I needed a restroom. Had some severe I have to go now issues. What u are experiencing is way beyond. Check it out and let us know. Did you have any diagnostic tests that made HT necessary right away? Or was it the 4+3? Good luck sportbug. MM",

In answer to your question regarding staying on Casodex after the first few months, it really is up to the RO. Mine told me it was not necessary after the SRT ended. Kind of there is no right or wrong on that one. Some combine the 2, others do not. Best of luck, and congrats on the \"ZERO\"!!!! MM",

If you talk to 10 different uros, u will get 30 diifferent answers. Another one of the many frustrating aspects of the treatment process. Some say this, others say that. I have done 1000's of kegels, and it has not helped me to where I am totally dry. And I did them before and after surgery. Honestly, I do not think there is any set answer. Good luck, MM",

Going on what u wrote, I can make the following comments. I believe the synergies of combining the RT and the ADT can be much more effective than either one alone. There is a wide range of opinion as to what is the proper length of time. In my high risk case, standard of care is what u see in my signature. I asked my doctor if the ADT kills stray cells that may be floating around ( when I first began SRT). He said they think it might, but he could not give me a conclusive yes. I would at least continue the ADT after radiation for 6 months....I would liken it to being on antibiotics, and deciding to not finish the prescribed amount. You have the \"unhappy G7\" with a dominant pattern 4. You may have something worse...just hard to tell. Not trying to scare u, but we each must make a decision as to how hard we want to go at it.

Since your surgery date is not until 9/11, u might want to take the time before then to do some research and homework. BTW...a surgery on 9/11? That date and surgery don't seem to go together!! Since your husband has already been DX as a cT3a, you owe it to yourself and him to explore all your treatment options. T3 means the horse has already left the barn, and while a cure is still very possible, you need to go about this with the least amount of SE as possible. Surgery may not be curative by itself, and then u will find yourself in the SRT and perhaps other treatment modalities type of situation. Check out all your options, see a RO and learn about the various forms of radiation therapy. I am the poster boy for SE, and I would just like to pass along my experience on the subject.

      "Content": "Hey Kozmic: On this one I would defer to your doctor. The better shape your in, the easier the recovery and the surgery will go. Not sure of your situation, but if the surgeon says it can't wait one year, call me crazy, I would tend to believe him. I was 200lbs. on sept 15th when my PSA was discovered to be out of whack. I kind of new something was up, so I just started a diet and exercise program. It's only a hour of exercise a day, plus eating right. I got down to 182 for my surgery. And I feel great!! If my sorry self can do it, so can you. What's more important than your overall health? Excess weight can cause all sorts of issues with surgery, and aftercare. Start something and take baby steps. 10 or 15% of something is better than 100% of nothing. Good luck, MM",

Using local hospitals can give you several different answers. Unless you are at a major Cancer center, I would go that route. Then u will know for sure and can formulate a plan.

      "Content": "Hello firemana: Others here have given u sound opinions and directions. I had this exact conversation with my RO at the UC. The bottom line... a very low PSA, I believe the threshold was 2.5 or so accompied by a high grade Gleason would indicate a very aggressive tumor. Meaning 2.5 or less and a G8-10 are very rare. A high grade Gleason not showing a higher Psa value is to be taken very seriously. Not trying to scare u, just relating a topic of discussion with my RO. In other words, if given the choice, I'd rather have a G9 with a Psa of 5.9 than one with a 2.5 PSA. Check it out with your medical team. Best Wishes, MM",

I would continue to test every 2 months, and would only become concerned when a trend developed above 0.03, which recent studies have shown to be a accurate indicator of BCR. For what it's worth, SRT is not that big of a deal for most men. The SE are not to bad, and they go away in short order. If u do need it at some point in the future, sooner rather than later will produce the best outcomes. Best, MM",

Many men with that high of a number can be treated and go on about life for many, many years. My guess is that Hormone Therapy and Chemo Therapy are what you will be hearing from your Doctor. And while not fun, they do work. As Michael F has pointed out, it is highly possible that his PCa can be successfully managed for many years. Also, let's not assume the worst. It could be something else. Hang in there, I'm sure your dad will be around for a long time. My best, MM",

      "Content": "Hey Kozmic: On this one I would defer to your doctor. The better shape your in, the easier the recovery and the surgery will go. Not sure of your situation, but if the surgeon says it can't wait one year, call me crazy, I would tend to believe him. I was 200lbs. on sept 15th when my PSA was discovered to be out of whack. I kind of new something was up, so I just started a diet and exercise program. It's only a hour of exercise a day, plus eating right. I got down to 182 for my surgery. And I feel great!! If my sorry self can do it, so can you. What's more important than your overall health? Excess weight can cause all sorts of issues with surgery, and aftercare. Start something and take baby steps. 10 or 15% of something is better than 100% of nothing. Good luck, MM",

      "Content": "Hey Cubs Fan: Welcome to the other side, and congrats on what seems to be a speedy recovery. I am also being treated at Loyola right now, so know that you are in good hands. I am sorry about the pathology report, but don't give up the ship. While you had several of the same adverse findings as I had, my doctors are still not ruling out a possible cure. You need to be aggressive and have the attitude that you are going to kick this in the a****. Your best bet is to attack when this is in the early stages, so I would be asking the RO about both HT and ART/SRT combined. You stand a better chance of success when combining the 2. You also have the additional issue of ductal PCa, which may require seeing a PCa specialist who has handled those sort of cases. Good News: You have NO and have no SVI. Those are 2 huge positives. Go on the offensive, and tell the doctor u want to be aggressive. Much like your Cubs, you will be staging a late inning rally. Keep me posted on how you are doing. Best, MM",

G9 is a whole new ballgame, and requires a full court press and aggressive action. I would talk to both a surgeon and RO who specializes in high risk PCa about your options. Fairwind makes a good point, but I don't want to sway you in any one direction. One thing for sure, don't waste any time. Get on this! That being said, stay positive and know that u can beat this.

That being said, your trend is a bit of a concern. I would be keeping my eye on it, and would be testing more often. U are now at what is considered the \"new\" number to watch as it pertains to predicting BCR. >.03. I would be talking to a RO, and just get another opinion. Standing in your shoes, I would be pro-active, and have a contingency plan. I find your trend a concern, ultra PSA or not. On a positive note, even if this was BCR, the chances of it being local are very good. A cure would still be in your future. Studies have shown that the old number of .1 is being used less and less, especially in high risk cases. In addition, the sooner you act, the better the outcome. Since you have had surgery, I would not concern myself with any of the old rules regarding what to refrain from. U don't have a prostate. Best, MM",

They have many ways to start penile rehab while you are healing. It is very important to keep the blood flow going. I would see the ED doctor as opposed to the Urologist/ surgeon. They really don't deal well with ED. ( kind of one size fits all) As to your comment with the insurance, some will cover the implant, others no. As with all things health related, we are at the mercy of what our insurance will pay for. Don't give up, you still have plenty of hope. Best to u, MM",

It\u0092s not rising or really bouncing, it\u0092s doing nothing. The uPSA is measuring into the trillionths of grams. Not sure what u mean by positive? Positive what? U have a pristine path report.

      "Content": "Gary: Yes I did, and I am still on ADT until April/May of 2018. Happy to answer any questions. I\u0092m on my phone, which when I post doesn\u0092t produce a signature. Click on my name and U can view my history. I started Casodex on 4/1/16 and was on it until the end of radiation. My first lupron shot was 4/15/16. Being a PT3bNO, G9 ( 4+5), I wanted to throw everything at this including the kitchen sink! The studies I have read told me to increase my odds of any potential cure, I needed to take this path. Please pardon my straight talk. ADT sucks. The side effects were and have been difficult, but I have just told myself this is what I need to do. I will be on it for 2 years. The SE really hit me at the 3 month mark. Among them... bad sweats, weight gain in the stomach area, bone pain, joint pain. My hands got so bad I couldn\u0092t move my thumb joint. I fall asleep ok, but wake up every 2 hours. Honestly, it\u0092s beem brutal. Sorry, not going to bullshit anyone. I walk an average of 4/5 miles per day, and in the winter lift weights. I won\u0092t even go into the sexual SE or incontinence issues. Most guys aren\u0092t as bad as me. I was never given the chance to heal. I am currently on the nutrisystem diet and achieving some success. I was always thin and trim, and in excellent shape. Ok, enough. The good news? My PSA has been <0.05 for 14 months. I have given myself every chance to beat this. Not saying you or anyone else should follow this path. I have chosen living as my # 1 goal. We shall see how I do. I have read many of your posts. You are a very smart man, so I\u0092m sure u will do what is best for u. I\u0092m here to help if needed. Best, MM",

Hey Samie. Looks like your hubby and I have the same pathology reports. Or very close. First, let me say that when it happened to me I was a bit shaken up. It kind of scares you! But, I have spoken with many people and some of the guys on this site helped me understand that there is still a good chance for a cure. pT3b means that it has just escaped the prostate, but as our esteemed moderator pointed out to me \" it's still in the neighborhood\". The lymph nodes were negative. Good sign. Pt3 cases are more difficult, but not insurmountable. If needed, AR, SRT, etc could kill off any remaining cells. And who knows, your surgeon may have gotten it all. Chuck, Michael F, and Prato all helped me get thru the initial worry. For now, the PC is out of you and we both need to concentrate on getting better with the SE. Many of the surgeons have different protocol regarding the next steps. Mine is a 6w and a 12W PSA. then we shall see what happens. Mine friend Trinity3 is the same as us via John Hopkins. I will keep u posted on any information I receive. Hang in there, as prato told me \" grieve for a bit, then get off the mat and get back in the game!! Keep us posted. Regards, MM",

If he is going to be required to have a full bladder, that is something that can cause some uncomfortable times, until u get the timing down. I would try and go somewhere that is convenient, as the drive to and from will occur 5x a week for 7-8 weeks. There is possible radiation burn, but you can get cream for that. The main problem for me was the timing of the bladder. I had a couple meltdowns, but once I figured it out, it worked out. The radiation simulation was kind of a bummer, but that\u0092s only one day. List his stats, I may have more to offer. The actual time under the arc is short and no problem. Keep us posted. Best, MM",

If he is going to be required to have a full bladder, that is something that can cause some uncomfortable times, until u get the timing down. I would try and go somewhere that is convenient, as the drive to and from will occur 5x a week for 7-8 weeks. There is possible radiation burn, but you can get cream for that. The main problem for me was the timing of the bladder. I had a couple meltdowns, but once I figured it out, it worked out. The radiation simulation was kind of a bummer, but that\u0092s only one day. List his stats, I may have more to offer. The actual time under the arc is short and no problem. Keep us posted. Best, MM",

      "Content": "Gary: Yes I did, and I am still on ADT until April/May of 2018. Happy to answer any questions. I\u0092m on my phone, which when I post doesn\u0092t produce a signature. Click on my name and U can view my history. I started Casodex on 4/1/16 and was on it until the end of radiation. My first lupron shot was 4/15/16. Being a PT3bNO, G9 ( 4+5), I wanted to throw everything at this including the kitchen sink! The studies I have read told me to increase my odds of any potential cure, I needed to take this path. Please pardon my straight talk. ADT sucks. The side effects were and have been difficult, but I have just told myself this is what I need to do. I will be on it for 2 years. The SE really hit me at the 3 month mark. Among them... bad sweats, weight gain in the stomach area, bone pain, joint pain. My hands got so bad I couldn\u0092t move my thumb joint. I fall asleep ok, but wake up every 2 hours. Honestly, it\u0092s beem brutal. Sorry, not going to bullshit anyone. I walk an average of 4/5 miles per day, and in the winter lift weights. I won\u0092t even go into the sexual SE or incontinence issues. Most guys aren\u0092t as bad as me. I was never given the chance to heal. I am currently on the nutrisystem diet and achieving some success. I was always thin and trim, and in excellent shape. Ok, enough. The good news? My PSA has been <0.05 for 14 months. I have given myself every chance to beat this. Not saying you or anyone else should follow this path. I have chosen living as my # 1 goal. We shall see how I do. I have read many of your posts. You are a very smart man, so I\u0092m sure u will do what is best for u. I\u0092m here to help if needed. Best, MM",

      "Content": "Rooster. I had this on my computer that I had read in a PCblog regarding the question of how long. The statement had something to do with the curative intent of using ADT. once again I found this on a PCa Blog. It radio-sensitizes the cancer and then cleans up any hormone sensitive cells that the radiation did not kill. In clinical trials among high risk men, it significantly improves outcomes. Some of the more hormone-resistant cells apparently take longer to kill off. Undoubtedly, there is an abscopal effect too.",

Maybe, but I would be checking this out, and not taking that for a answer. To me, it is very clear that your psa level is a concern. It should be zero, period. You had a appointment with the RO in Oct. of 2018...what did they say? garyi and DJ are very smart forum brothers, I am wondering what they see here that I do not. Best, MM",

      "Content": "Hey there Rob: First on the PSA....Congrats! That is the type of response that u want to see, and let's hope that NO TREND will develop...just lots of Zeros. I am very happy to see that u are doing well, gives many of us hope that there is lite at the end of this tunnel, and it's not a train! In answer to your ADT comments and T levels, I thought u would like this. I asked the same questions and received this response.... As to when ADT will wear off, that is highly individual. In this study, testosterone recoved for 36.9% 66.3%, 86.3% and 92.6% at 3, 6, 9 and 12 months, respectively. But they were only on ADT for 9 months, I think you should expect it to take longer in your case. https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3739223/ As you are well aware, I will be on ADT for 2 years, ending this May 15th. I think u had 18 months. To your comment regarding doctors, if they told us what they should they would have no patients...we would all run like hell!! Good luck tomorrow my friend, and congrats again on the PSA. U deserve it. Best, MM",

I would not even bother going to the appointment with the urologist. U need to see a RO right away. SRT is most effective when PSA values are low.

If your current doctor is not giving you enough guidance, keep moving along until you find a doctor who will. With your husbands PSA heading northbound, I would not be wasting anytime. ADT and/or radiation therapy is the next standard step. Given his higher risk case, sooner rather than later. Hang in there, your husband is lucky to have you in his corner. Best of Luck, MM",

The statement had something to do with the curative intent of using ADT. once again I found this on a PCa Blog. It radio-sensitizes the cancer and then cleans up any hormone sensitive cells that the radiation did not kill. In clinical trials among high risk men, it significantly improves outcomes. Some of the more hormone-resistant cells apparently take longer to kill off. Undoubtedly, there is an abscopal effect too.",

Not much to add to what has already been said, except that with your stats, I would advise you that you have plenty of time to make a decision. If surgery is your choice, the skill and experience of the surgeon is the most important thing you should be investigating. You live in AZ? If it were me, I would be going to the Mayo Clinic. Can't go wrong there. This is a very intricate operation. Not a place for rookies. Good luck and please keep us informed. You are not alone. Regards, MM",

I am very happy to see that u are doing well, gives many of us hope that there is lite at the end of this tunnel, and it's not a train! In answer to your ADT comments and T levels, I thought u would like this. I asked the same questions and received this response.... As to when ADT will wear off, that is highly individual. In this study, testosterone recoved for 36.9% 66.3%, 86.3% and 92.6% at 3, 6, 9 and 12 months, respectively. But they were only on ADT for 9 months, I think you should expect it to take longer in your case. https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3739223/ As you are well aware, I will be on ADT for 2 years, ending this May 15th. I think u had 18 months. To your comment regarding doctors, if they told us what they should they would have no patients...we would all run like hell!! Good luck tomorrow my friend, and congrats again on the PSA. U deserve it. Best, MM",

U both are great examples of a couple who are there for each other, for better or worse. Bad enough what you have endured, but then to have you wife ill just seems all wrong! Praying for both of you each day. Now to your post. You had RP. What was your level of continence at the six month mark? I had surgery in Dec. of 2015. I am a fellow pT3B. By the 4-5 month mark, I was about a 9 on the scale of 10. Then I had SRT/HT, and I went back a bit to where I am now, about 7/8. One pad a day, unless i am working out, then it gets bad. My Uro told me that I will not know my situation until later this year. Almost 2 years after. Did u ever regain any continence? Just curious, and I guess what i am saying is don't give up. Keep working on it! Best of luck to u and your wife. MM",

      "Content": "Hey Nick: You ask a great question...Why would they tell u that u had zero chance of a cure, if they were treating u with curative intent? My take on your situation is that it is similar to Rob's and mine. ( Me having the G9, u both less) Your undetectable psa only means that u are responding to treatment. It means that u are hormone sensitive, instead of Hormone refractory. All good things. The ability to tolerate ADT has nothing to do with your long term prognosis...meaning the SE. Much more time needs to pass for all of us before any proclamations can be made. Given how long you have been on HT, you should probably expect it to take many months before returning to a \"reasonable\" T level. Good to hear from u, and keep us posted. MM",

Not much to add to what has already been said, except that with your stats, I would advise you that you have plenty of time to make a decision. If surgery is your choice, the skill and experience of the surgeon is the most important thing you should be investigating. You live in AZ? If it were me, I would be going to the Mayo Clinic. Can't go wrong there. This is a very intricate operation. Not a place for rookies. Good luck and please keep us informed. You are not alone. Regards, MM",

His job is over, at this stage u should be consulting with a RO and possibly a MO if u want a second opinion. The surgeon does just that, the rest of your treatment path at this time has little to do with him. As far as Casodex and Lupron for now, that sounds about right. You are now entering a full hormonal blockade. Some RO will keep u on the Casodex for the duration of the time u are receiving SRT. No real right or wrong way after that time frame is up. As it pertains to the SE, u can expect them to rear their ugly head in about 4 weeks. Hang tough, u will get thru this and if I can be of any help, feel free to PM at anytime. Best, MM",

PSA history, any and all treatments you have received, G score, etc. If you are currently on ADT, the scans and appointments for now probably won't have as much meaning as they will when you get off of it. For now, your PSA is being suppressed. Need more information to help u. What is GcMAF? I am not familiar with that. The ADT that u are on is known as front line HT. There are more in the event that you become CR to them. The hell with any doctor who will not help you or not answer any reasonable question. They are not always right, and many of them do not know a damn thing other than exactly what their specialty is. I would show them the door, and leave no stone unturned in finding a doctor who will show you the proper consideration. Let us know . Best, MM",

Not much to add to what has already been said, except that with your stats, I would advise you that you have plenty of time to make a decision. If surgery is your choice, the skill and experience of the surgeon is the most important thing you should be investigating. You live in AZ? If it were me, I would be going to the Mayo Clinic. Can't go wrong there. This is a very intricate operation. Not a place for rookies. Good luck and please keep us informed. You are not alone. Regards, MM",

      "Content": "Hello Jennifer. Sorry to hear of your father's troubles. You don't say what you dads PSA history has been, but his current PSA of .02 is very good news. It means that he is responding to treatment. That's a good thing. Is it a smoke screen? No, not really. It is showing that the 1st and 2nd line treatments that have been available to him are working. His PSA is telling u that. Was the mass from his bladder related to the PCa? Or are you saying that he also had bladder cancer? Not to many G10 guys, but plenty of G8/9, myself included. Hopefully others will be along to chime in, and perhaps you can give us a few more answers regarding his bladder. Best, MM",

My take on your situation is that it is similar to Rob's and mine. ( Me having the G9, u both less) Your undetectable psa only means that u are responding to treatment. It means that u are hormone sensitive, instead of Hormone refractory. All good things. The ability to tolerate ADT has nothing to do with your long term prognosis...meaning the SE. Much more time needs to pass for all of us before any proclamations can be made. Given how long you have been on HT, you should probably expect it to take many months before returning to a \"reasonable\" T level. Good to hear from u, and keep us posted. MM",

( not sure about the ductal component and how that would change things) given your PM and G9, I\u0092m surprised that it will only be a 6 month course. Most of us in this risk category find ourselves in the 18-24 month camp. There are several schools of thought on length of ADT, you could possibly discuss this with your RO. I would ask to start the ADT right away, as it will hold the cancer at bay while you get the RT in order. You don\u0092t want your PSA going any higher while you wait for RT to begin. Some RO will start u on Casodex for a few weeks to prevent testosterone flare, and keep u on it the entire time u are on the LHRH ( lupron). Others will just omit the Casodex after a few months. No right or wrong way there, just different RO ways of doing things. It\u0092s not easy, but u will make it thru. As for the clinical trial, no opinion on that. May depend on the amount of radiation u are receiving, along with any boost that might occur to the PLN. Wishing u the best possible outcome, MM",

Nothing has worked, and as you have said the injections became much to painful. If u are using trimix, one of the 3 drugs is the one that causes the pain. Try having you doctor change the dose on that one, it may provide some relief from the ache. As for the pills, I would be taking 100mg every other day and not just taking the drug, but u must have the stimulation by whatever means necessary. Working the tissues! U do not have a signature, so I do not know the extent of your treatment for the PCa. In my case, it may just be a penile implant will be the only thing that works. Which ever brand of pills you decide, I would up the dose to what I told u. BTW...there is a pharmacy in MI that you can get the the active ingredient in Viagra ( sildenafil) 100 20mg pills for around $75. You will need a RX. Best of luck, MM",

      "Content": "EMS: If your question is can inflammation of the prostate affect the free PSA as well as the PSA level the answer is yes. Free PSA is just that, floating around and not attached to any proteins. It will clear out of the bloodstream quicker because it is a smaller cell or I guess molecule, thus returning to it's true level faster than PSA. Hang in there and pump the brakes!! You are going to be just fine and those kids of yours will enjoy having Dad around for many, many, years. My guess is this is a infection, given all you have told us. you are not alone.

For now, you are in the waiting zone. It may take a few years to give u an accurate picture of your success. Your numbers for now are ok, and with a nadir of 0.44, you are still in the bounce phase. Your numbers could go back down. Perhaps someone with first hand knowledge will be chiming in. I would not be worried as of now.

      "Content": "Hello jls85: Thanks for checking back in with the pathology report on your SO. Well, it is not what we want to hear, and it is a difficult dx. That being said there is reason for hope. U can still be cured, and this report is not insurmountable. U do not say what the final staging is, so I am going to assume u are a G8 with a T3 tumor. With any 5 component G score, it increases the odds for micro-metastasis. That all being said, I would take the pro-active approach with this. I would not wait until October for my first PSA. That is 12 weeks. Given your PSA, the half-life will be taken into account by 6-7 weeks, and you should have a good indication of where you stand. I would also be getting my ducks in a row with a RO. Do it now. You may not need it, but I would not be wasting any time. With your pathology, your Uro wants your 1st test at 12 weeks? Your Uro's job is now over, and I would go and speak with a RO. Do not ask a Uro surgeon about radiation, they don't know a damn thing. Take a aggressive approach and throw everything at this including the kitchen sink. IF...you find yourself needing additional treatment, you will have a small window to act. Cancer takes no days off. For now just heal. SRT has few SE. It will depend upon where u are at with ED and continence at that point in time. More on all that later. If u need to talk more or are in need of greater detail, PM me or just ask. Best, MM",

      "Content": "Hello Moonshadow: Welcome to the forum. Sorry to hear about your fathers tough Dx. Now that the cancer has escaped and gone to his hips and spine, a cure will not be possible. I'm happy to report that is all the bad news. The good news? Many stage 4 men can get this under control and live for many, many years. The ADT will act to stop the cancer while your Dad remains hormone sensitive. This will be his front line hormone therapy. It also should knock the hell out of his PSA and send it plummeting. The EBRT will help control the cancer and the pain. It should be noted that the PCa survival rate for the next 5 years is very high. There are a host of second line hormonal treatments, and other treatments beyond those. Many new things coming down the pike for advanced cases. There is hope. I have seen men with PSA numbers in the thousands that are around for a long time. Life will be different on ADT, but it's manageable. Your father is lucky to have you in his corner. Make sure your team consists of a top notch RO and MO. If the mets get tough, they can also spot radiate. Hang around, others will be chiming in soon. Summing up, although a cure may not be possible, there are many options to keep your dad around for years. Keep us posted. BTW....... u a Cat Stevens fan? I'm being followed by a moonshadow......MM",

      "Content": "Rob: I am glad to hear that u have sought out the proper medical attention. My ex-wife had a history of depression in her family, and it entered into our lives after about 10 years of marriage. The next 10 years were an absolute shit show. I have first hand knowledge of what u are going thru, and please follow the doctors orders to the letter, it will help on the road to your recovery. My ex thought she knew more than the doctors, and that made things even worse. You discussed in paragraph 3 the relationship between cancer and depression, giving out some stats. To be honest, none of that surprises me. I think most of us have those feelings, it's just a matter of degree. The symptoms that u have described were a clear cry for help. Not sure what the hell your doctor was thinking. In another thread and post, I made the comment that this disease was depressing, and that I have my darker moments. I feel that this is quite normal. I mean think about it, your life gets turned upside down. This has happened to me at a young age. Not only did I get PCa, but I fell into a sub-group of 15% of the men DX who have a high-risk case. Christ, if that doesn't get a person down, you must have ice flowing thru your veins. My life has been forever changed. What to do about it? I guess I am from the school that things are what they are. I did not ask for this stinking disease. I did not engage in any behavior that would have made me anymore likely to get it. It has happened, and my future will depend on how I react to it. I have done all I can do to give myself the best chance at a possible cure/ long term remission. I have been pro-active. I have left no stone unturned. Knowing all this, I just move along. When I think about it, I am not depressed. I'm just PISSED off! LOL! The flip side for me is that I have been a over achiever in life, and have received far more than I have deserved. I guess the wheel is round, and what lies in front of me I will deal with. I have refused to let this rotten disease run my life. I'm back in the game of life, and doing whatever the hell I want. Don't be hard on yourself. As I read your paragraph on the well, I had a few days like that. It's ok to feel whatever way u want, and you don't need to worry about what anybody thinks, feels, or says. Your particular case is even harder than most, and adding your wife into the mix, I think you are doing just fine. Your contributions to this forum have been many, add that up with your compassion to the other men on here, and I see a great guy who has had a rough time. Stay focused, take the medication, stay the course. There will be better days ahead, and you will conquer these demons. Wishing you the best, MM",

      "Content": "Hello jls85: Thanks for checking back in with the pathology report on your SO. Well, it is not what we want to hear, and it is a difficult dx. That being said there is reason for hope. U can still be cured, and this report is not insurmountable. U do not say what the final staging is, so I am going to assume u are a G8 with a T3 tumor. With any 5 component G score, it increases the odds for micro-metastasis. That all being said, I would take the pro-active approach with this. I would not wait until October for my first PSA. That is 12 weeks. Given your PSA, the half-life will be taken into account by 6-7 weeks, and you should have a good indication of where you stand. I would also be getting my ducks in a row with a RO. Do it now. You may not need it, but I would not be wasting any time. With your pathology, your Uro wants your 1st test at 12 weeks? Your Uro's job is now over, and I would go and speak with a RO. Do not ask a Uro surgeon about radiation, they don't know a damn thing. Take a aggressive approach and throw everything at this including the kitchen sink. IF...you find yourself needing additional treatment, you will have a small window to act. Cancer takes no days off. For now just heal. SRT has few SE. It will depend upon where u are at with ED and continence at that point in time. More on all that later. If u need to talk more or are in need of greater detail, PM me or just ask. Best, MM",

To be honest, u probably will not know anything for 3/6/12 months to get a clear picture of where u are at. You have described many situations, I would just try and keep track of how u are doing pad wise, and see how u improve in that respect. keep doing the kegels, and see how it goes. 5 weeks is way to soon to form any judgments.

Free PSA is just that, floating around and not attached to any proteins. It will clear out of the bloodstream quicker because it is a smaller cell or I guess molecule, thus returning to it's true level faster than PSA. Hang in there and pump the brakes!! You are going to be just fine and those kids of yours will enjoy having Dad around for many, many, years. My guess is this is a infection, given all you have told us. you are not alone.

My current surgeon at Loyola, where you are at, keeps telling me my course of treatment is the best chance for long term success. It seems with this disease that, unlike other illness, has so many different views from so many medical professionals. Example for radiation. University of Chicago and Dana Farber for SRT use a dosage of 68.4 GY, and a boost of 1.8 GY. At other big name cancer centers, it's 70-72 GY. Maybe that's why I am on ADT longer, to make up for the smaller dosage. I do know one thing....There are no bad doctors at Loyola or UC. Best, MM",

      "Content": "Hello Mintlatte: Welcome to the forum. I am sorry to hear about your husband's difficult DX. Given a PSA of 6800, that would probably indicate a Stage 4 case. You say they did the biospy on a lymph node? Is this reading of 6800 a typo? Sad to report, these cases can happen. Sometimes the symptoms don't appear until it is to late for a cure. But that does not mean it can't be controlled for many years! Lets start with where do u live? If all the information u are telling us is correct, I would get straight to a MO at a major cancer center. Any exact stats you can tell us about your husband will help us answer questions. Stay strong, there are many treatments out there that can get control of this and keep your husband around for a long time. There is hope. His initial treatment plan will probably be HT/Chemo. But get us some solid info and we can go from there. Good luck, MM",

There are many issues to consider when picking a place for radiation. Number 1 is the most current machines. I have the name of the best ones. I'll look it up for u. And I will say that a top notch RO is just as important as a top surgeon. Please don't talk to Uro surgeons about radiation or MO. It's way above their pay grade. Best of luck. MM",

      "Content": "Hello Moonshadow: Welcome to the forum. Sorry to hear about your fathers tough Dx. Now that the cancer has escaped and gone to his hips and spine, a cure will not be possible. I'm happy to report that is all the bad news. The good news? Many stage 4 men can get this under control and live for many, many years. The ADT will act to stop the cancer while your Dad remains hormone sensitive. This will be his front line hormone therapy. It also should knock the hell out of his PSA and send it plummeting. The EBRT will help control the cancer and the pain. It should be noted that the PCa survival rate for the next 5 years is very high. There are a host of second line hormonal treatments, and other treatments beyond those. Many new things coming down the pike for advanced cases. There is hope. I have seen men with PSA numbers in the thousands that are around for a long time. Life will be different on ADT, but it's manageable. Your father is lucky to have you in his corner. Make sure your team consists of a top notch RO and MO. If the mets get tough, they can also spot radiate. Hang around, others will be chiming in soon. Summing up, although a cure may not be possible, there are many options to keep your dad around for years. Keep us posted. BTW....... u a Cat Stevens fan? I'm being followed by a moonshadow......MM",

      "Content": "Rob: I am glad to hear that u have sought out the proper medical attention. My ex-wife had a history of depression in her family, and it entered into our lives after about 10 years of marriage. The next 10 years were an absolute shit show. I have first hand knowledge of what u are going thru, and please follow the doctors orders to the letter, it will help on the road to your recovery. My ex thought she knew more than the doctors, and that made things even worse. You discussed in paragraph 3 the relationship between cancer and depression, giving out some stats. To be honest, none of that surprises me. I think most of us have those feelings, it's just a matter of degree. The symptoms that u have described were a clear cry for help. Not sure what the hell your doctor was thinking. In another thread and post, I made the comment that this disease was depressing, and that I have my darker moments. I feel that this is quite normal. I mean think about it, your life gets turned upside down. This has happened to me at a young age. Not only did I get PCa, but I fell into a sub-group of 15% of the men DX who have a high-risk case. Christ, if that doesn't get a person down, you must have ice flowing thru your veins. My life has been forever changed. What to do about it? I guess I am from the school that things are what they are. I did not ask for this stinking disease. I did not engage in any behavior that would have made me anymore likely to get it. It has happened, and my future will depend on how I react to it. I have done all I can do to give myself the best chance at a possible cure/ long term remission. I have been pro-active. I have left no stone unturned. Knowing all this, I just move along. When I think about it, I am not depressed. I'm just PISSED off! LOL! The flip side for me is that I have been a over achiever in life, and have received far more than I have deserved. I guess the wheel is round, and what lies in front of me I will deal with. I have refused to let this rotten disease run my life. I'm back in the game of life, and doing whatever the hell I want. Don't be hard on yourself. As I read your paragraph on the well, I had a few days like that. It's ok to feel whatever way u want, and you don't need to worry about what anybody thinks, feels, or says. Your particular case is even harder than most, and adding your wife into the mix, I think you are doing just fine. Your contributions to this forum have been many, add that up with your compassion to the other men on here, and I see a great guy who has had a rough time. Stay focused, take the medication, stay the course. There will be better days ahead, and you will conquer these demons. Wishing you the best, MM",

      "Content": "Now What: Interesting comment on who it means more to. On Saturday nite I was with my girlfriend and after a few Tito's martinis, dinner, a bottle of wine, and a after dinner drink, we decided to give it a try. ( we were not driving) We have both found humor to get us thru this. Using the pills, but not much happening yet. After all the gymnastics of getting ready, it was a flop!! But, we laughed. She affectionately calls me JPP.....Johnny pee pee pants!! Even though the sex didn't work, we still are having fun being together until it does. I think it means way more to me than her. She doesn't care, she just loves me. ( As long as she can still go shopping for all her stuff) LOL! My point: have fun together and tell hubby not to be hard on himself. It's way to early in the game to get down. Stay positive and be there for each other. Best wishes, MM",

      "Content": "Hello Mintlatte: Welcome to the forum. I am sorry to hear about your husband's difficult DX. Given a PSA of 6800, that would probably indicate a Stage 4 case. You say they did the biospy on a lymph node? Is this reading of 6800 a typo? Sad to report, these cases can happen. Sometimes the symptoms don't appear until it is to late for a cure. But that does not mean it can't be controlled for many years! Lets start with where do u live? If all the information u are telling us is correct, I would get straight to a MO at a major cancer center. Any exact stats you can tell us about your husband will help us answer questions. Stay strong, there are many treatments out there that can get control of this and keep your husband around for a long time. There is hope. His initial treatment plan will probably be HT/Chemo. But get us some solid info and we can go from there. Good luck, MM",

My RO wanted me to do the boost right then and there. She also was adamant that I stay on HT for a total of 2 years, as is my current Uro at Loyola. I know you have a lot of important things going on in the coming days, I will be reaching out to check on your progress. Stay strong brother, and my best to your wife. MM",

At the 5-6 month mark I was totally dry at nite , and about a 7/8 out of 10 during normal daily activity. 5. In regard to the last four questions, had no real penile problems ( not counting ED) 6. My situation changed upon the start of SRT. My continence went south. Wonderful. Especially during physical activities. I now find myself dry during my job ( desk) and walking around the house stuff. Golf, changing a pad every six holes. Walking the course and swinging, the pad is soaked. It SUCKS! I walk four miles on non-golf days, 1 pad is soaked. IT SUCKS! Weight Lifting....1 pad soaked. Did I mention it SUCKS? Sorry guys, just venting. Been thru a billion kegals, PT, etc, etc. The beat goes on. MM",

      "Content": "Keto: I would be asking about whether or not you should be starting ADT. Since the PCa has gone at least into the SV, that treatment phase may be in your future. If so, better to start ASAP. This way the cancer will remain on hold and not advance any, while you decide on a treatment path. I would be asking about which treatment ( or co-treatments) would present the least amount of SE. You are probably facing Surgery+Radiation+ADT...or IMRT+Brachy+HT. Ask about odds for a cure and long term cancer control. You did have 43 cores, and only 4 positive. And u are G7. A cure could still be possible, but u need to take action now. I would ask about length of time on ADT, and what the standard of treatment is for u. I think your are located in Europe? Is that correct? Sometimes treatments are different overseas. You want an aggressive approach, so with SVI u also want to treat the local PLN. Good luck, keep us posted. Best, MM",

For what it's worth my MO from the UC has a advised me on the following: Weight Lifting and cardio activity have been proven to be very helpful. The following are what he would recommend: Soy products taken as food. Broccoli. Green tea, and pomegranate taken as food or in pill form. Told me to concentrate on those four and throw all else away. In addition, my RO will not let me take anything until SRT is completed, as some antioxidants do not mix well with RT.

It is quite normal to be scared, and the entire beginning of this PCa mess can be very unnerving. Since at this point u don't know anything, step one is to get to the URO and start the process. U are correct, a PSA of 29 might mean some cancer, but please keep in mind that most of the PCa Dx are very curable. Since u have other issues going on, your psa spike could be related to something else, no way of telling until you see the Uro. I would start with working on a few of your other health issues, and get moving on this ASAP. Your first appt.?.......probably a DRE, and then I would guess either some antibiotics and/or scheduling a biopsy. Hang in there, as the days move on, things will become clearer...Please keep us posted. MM",

      "Content": "Rob. Sorry for what you are going through. It seems like there are so many issues on so many different levels. I like the idea of the support group offered by Another. Venting and talking and letting the anger out are very natural things. Especially given all that's going on in your life. Like another im divorced, so I understand the lonely part of the relationship that u referred to. As time passes, things got better for me. Don't give up on yourself, your wife/ relationship, or your treatments. Stay the course, it's tough now but the AUS from what I've read can be a life changer. We all get down, it's the nature of this beast. Try to engage your wife into taking walks, spending some time together. You guys have come far together, find ways to reconnect. Keep me posted, stay strong. MM",

      "Content": "Cubs: To be fair to the surgery aspect, if you talk to uro-surgeons, they shake their head no to my above post. My current surgeon at Loyola, where you are at, keeps telling me my course of treatment is the best chance for long term success. It seems with this disease that, unlike other illness, has so many different views from so many medical professionals. Example for radiation. University of Chicago and Dana Farber for SRT use a dosage of 68.4 GY, and a boost of 1.8 GY. At other big name cancer centers, it's 70-72 GY. Maybe that's why I am on ADT longer, to make up for the smaller dosage. I do know one thing....There are no bad doctors at Loyola or UC. Best, MM",

      "Content": "Hello: You don't say what his post-op Gleason score was? If it was a G6, I would be less worried than the presence of any pattern 4 cells. In any event, the trend is going in the wrong direction. If necessary, SRT has the greatest odds of success when your PSA is the lowest. Studies have shown that it is the single most deciding factor. I would be talking to a RO and getting that opinion....many uros have the annoying habit of waiting....and waiting....and waiting. Can't hurt to get your ducks in a row, just in case. Best to you and your husband. MM",

      "Content": "Hey 1000: Welcome to the forum, sorry that your situation brings u here. For now, just take it one thing at a time. It is quite normal to be scared, and the entire beginning of this PCa mess can be very unnerving. Since at this point u don't know anything, step one is to get to the URO and start the process. U are correct, a PSA of 29 might mean some cancer, but please keep in mind that most of the PCa Dx are very curable. Since u have other issues going on, your psa spike could be related to something else, no way of telling until you see the Uro. I would start with working on a few of your other health issues, and get moving on this ASAP. Your first appt.?.......probably a DRE, and then I would guess either some antibiotics and/or scheduling a biopsy. Hang in there, as the days move on, things will become clearer...Please keep us posted. MM",

There are many men in your father's situation who live for many, many years. Today's treatments can control the cancer for long periods of time. Lots of new stuff coming down the pike. Make sure your dad is seeing a top MO at a major cancer center. ( if possible) Don't give up hope or assume the worst, there are lots of options out there. Best wishes, MM",

I try my best to lead a normal life, while knowing I have been dealing with a high risk case of PCa. Your second statement is more of a problem for me. I had zero problems sexually before my \"triple play\" of treatments. My sexual arousal and attraction disappeared when I began ADT, I doubt that it was a just a coincidence. My question....what do u think I should be blaming? Lots of respect for u and your contributions to the forum, you are mostly right about so many things. Please enlighten me. MM",

      "Content": "Hello Mike. Welcome back. All things considered, your .3 PSA is not all bad. Nice to see it drop. So far, the treatments seem to be working. SRT side effects can vary from person to person. For some it went smoothly, for others, not so much. Of my 38 treatments, happened about 10 times, my big issue had to do with the full bladder ( moving it out of the field of radiation) and the ability to not burst while waiting for the machine. Had some intense moments, but made it through. U will need to be able to time things, and develop a feel for it as you begin. The ride home was a situation where I had to pee, so I always made sure of my route and where to stop. The urinary issues were the big thing. Lots of having to rush to the bathroom. I had my treatments the last time they had each day, 415. I made sure of no traffic by doing this, as I lived in opposite direction of the flow. These are all the things I thought about to make it easier. Also have them give u lotion for skin burn. It's a pain, but manageable. Let me know if I can help. Best, MM",

      "Content": "Hey 1000: Welcome to the forum, sorry that your situation brings u here. For now, just take it one thing at a time. It is quite normal to be scared, and the entire beginning of this PCa mess can be very unnerving. Since at this point u don't know anything, step one is to get to the URO and start the process. U are correct, a PSA of 29 might mean some cancer, but please keep in mind that most of the PCa Dx are very curable. Since u have other issues going on, your psa spike could be related to something else, no way of telling until you see the Uro. I would start with working on a few of your other health issues, and get moving on this ASAP. Your first appt.?.......probably a DRE, and then I would guess either some antibiotics and/or scheduling a biopsy. Hang in there, as the days move on, things will become clearer...Please keep us posted. MM",

In any event, the trend is going in the wrong direction. If necessary, SRT has the greatest odds of success when your PSA is the lowest. Studies have shown that it is the single most deciding factor. I would be talking to a RO and getting that opinion....many uros have the annoying habit of waiting....and waiting....and waiting. Can't hurt to get your ducks in a row, just in case.

      "Content": "Hello Sspanda: Welcome to the forum, sorry to hear of your father's situation. I am not sure where you live or who is in charge of your dad's treatment, but one thing that stands out is the inaction that has taken place since his surgery. I have noticed that urologist's tend to wait...and wait...and wait. My first suggestion would be to see a MO. Is you dad still on HT? If not, and assuming that his PCa is still hormone sensitive, that would probably be the first thing. ( Just going back on Lupron or Firmagon) There are other treatments when Firmagon and Lupron no longer work. A qualified MO will be able to guide u. Many of these second and third line hormones can give you years of a durable remission. IMO, your current medical team has done you no favors. Your 2/3 month post-op PSA was .11. Why would they wait until November to begin treatment? Another option...I had a phone conversation with a man who was kind of in this same boat. He lives in the south. He had one bone met, and had it radiated I think at the Dattoli Cancer center in south Florida. Now this is not a cure, and most often was or is done to control the pain. But this man told me he wanted to just do this to in his mind, control things. He did say that they give you a Free phone consultation, so what do u have to lose? Once PCa has metastasized, there is no cure. But with prompt treatment and action, your father could have many quality years left. Best of luck, MM",

      "Content": "Hello livin. Welcome to the forum. No need to panic, but definitely time to act. I'm not quite clear on your posted information. Are you saying he has been on AS with a G7 4+3 in four cores? Or was all this just discovered and there was a biopsy some time ago? I'm counting 9 positive cores on this biopsy, is that correct? What were his original findings, if any? I would agree with Brother Rob Lee that radiation is probably his best bet given his age. You need to have both a CT scan and a bone scan before any treatment decisions can be made. Given the amount of cancer he has, and his age, I would be seeing a RO pronto. If this is caught early enough, a cure is still possible. Please keep us posted on his progress, and please know that your husband will be around for many years. Good luck. MM",

      "Content": "Hello livin. Welcome to the forum. No need to panic, but definitely time to act. I'm not quite clear on your posted information. Are you saying he has been on AS with a G7 4+3 in four cores? Or was all this just discovered and there was a biopsy some time ago? I'm counting 9 positive cores on this biopsy, is that correct? What were his original findings, if any? I would agree with Brother Rob Lee that radiation is probably his best bet given his age. You need to have both a CT scan and a bone scan before any treatment decisions can be made. Given the amount of cancer he has, and his age, I would be seeing a RO pronto. If this is caught early enough, a cure is still possible. Please keep us posted on his progress, and please know that your husband will be around for many years. Good luck. MM",

While you may find that the mechanism still works, as time passes by you will probably not even care. Many men ( myself included) try the pills, pump, shots... u can see a doctor to get a view of all that, and see if something can work for u. To be honest, I found sex on ADT to be more of a bother. Sorry, just being honest. Talk to your partner and let her know that\u0092s it\u0092s difficult. Those who have never experienced ADT have no idea. Good luck, MM",

I try my best to lead a normal life, while knowing I have been dealing with a high risk case of PCa. Your second statement is more of a problem for me. I had zero problems sexually before my \"triple play\" of treatments. My sexual arousal and attraction disappeared when I began ADT, I doubt that it was a just a coincidence.

All that is left to debate is the length of time one is on it. And yes, this has become the standard of care. If u are going to go thru the RT, my view is to throw everything at the cancer before more time passes by. If u have any \"stray cells\" out there that are not local, the ADT will at least give u a chance at killing them off. They think this is possible, but not totally sure. Without ADT, this is not possible. Just my view.....best of luck, MM",

      "Content": "Hey wbigs: Welcome to the forum. Hope we can be of help to you, lots of good people on this site. A few questions/comments come to mind. I am not sure why your doctor would tell you that basically the PCa was all contained to the prostate gland. No way he could know that at this point in time. There has been no microscopic examination. Enhanced imaging can give you a real good clue, but many times upon examination things turn out differently. The good news is that with your low PSA, it's more than likely that it is contained and is 100% curable. Please remember that each case is different, and your father's and uncle's PCa is really of no relevance to yours. There is a family/bloodline link, but as far as what method of treatment and case outcomes, they are not the same. Not trying to discourage you in any way, just kind of keeping you in the loop. Try and get us more information, and we will all be here for u. With your low PSA and young age, I am sure this was caught in time for a complete recovery. We are glad you jumped in and joined the group. Best Regards, MM",

      "Content": "Gail: Now here is a subject I can comment on. I had a few similar feelings about some of the doctors that I have encountered during this mess. ( Some folks call this a journey, I will use the term mess!! lol) Patient care seems to be handled more by the \"staff\" than by the actual doctor. I can't tell u some of the frustration I have encountered. These \"staff members\" just seem to think every case is the same. \" See you in 3 months, see you in six months, let's make a appointment for your yearly PSA\" Really? What about if I have a problem? Oh, contact us on mychart. Gee, thanks for nothing. I went to several different doctors until I found one who could actually return a damn EM or phone call. They seem to forget that they work for us. Without the patient, they are worthless. I'm on a roll!!! I have FIRED a few doctors and met with several until I became comfortable with who was treating me. If your current doctor has only 5 minutes for u, or can't return a call or EM in a reasonable amount of time, find a new doctor. I have been my own advocate in this medical mess. If I did not like what I was hearing, I kept digging. Thanks to this FORUM, I have been able to stay ahead of the game in my treatment. This approach has led me to my current RO, who is great. Totally on the top of her game. Carries her I-phone around with her, you get an answer in 15 minutes. Keep searching for someone who wants to take a interest in u, they are out there. Say hello to Cliff. Best wishes, MM",

      "Content": "Hey wbigs: Welcome to the forum. Hope we can be of help to you, lots of good people on this site. A few questions/comments come to mind. I am not sure why your doctor would tell you that basically the PCa was all contained to the prostate gland. No way he could know that at this point in time. There has been no microscopic examination. Enhanced imaging can give you a real good clue, but many times upon examination things turn out differently. The good news is that with your low PSA, it's more than likely that it is contained and is 100% curable. Please remember that each case is different, and your father's and uncle's PCa is really of no relevance to yours. There is a family/bloodline link, but as far as what method of treatment and case outcomes, they are not the same. Not trying to discourage you in any way, just kind of keeping you in the loop. Try and get us more information, and we will all be here for u. With your low PSA and young age, I am sure this was caught in time for a complete recovery. We are glad you jumped in and joined the group. Best Regards, MM",

      "Content": "Dave: I would agree with RobLee. There have been enough studies to now know that the combination of HT/SRT is far more effective than SRT alone. All that is left to debate is the length of time one is on it. And yes, this has become the standard of care. If u are going to go thru the RT, my view is to throw everything at the cancer before more time passes by. If u have any \"stray cells\" out there that are not local, the ADT will at least give u a chance at killing them off. They think this is possible, but not totally sure. Without ADT, this is not possible. Just my view.....best of luck, MM",

      "Content": "Hey Aldeny. For what it's worth, I would not put it off for much longer if you want some success down the road. According to my doctor, penile rehab should begin at the earliest possible time. I have been taking 100mg of sildenafil ( active ingredient in Viagra) 3x per week since my surgery. It is very important to keep the blood flowing. I am also on the shots, but waited on that until the 3-4 month post-op time frame. I get the pills from a pharmacy in Michigan, very cheap. Your doctor would have to call it in for you, but its 60 20mg pills for about 58 dollars. They work the same as the expensive stuff. My University of Chicago uro uses them. Don't give up, it takes time. I'm not there yet, but seeing some signs of life. PM me if needed. Regards, MM",

      "Content": "Hey Red. I am assuming that u are talking about Casadex. That is given by some RO prior to taking Lupron to avoid what is called testosterone Flare. That is why they are giving that to you for now. It may only last for about 4 months until the end of ART. Most RO at that point just let you continue on with lupron. To that end, I really can't see why you are stuck in this Zytiga thing. It is VERY expensive, and without proper medical coverage, can be financially devastating. Plus, u don't need it now. I think your doctors have you on the correct path. I know your head is spinning, I've been there. You seem to be doing all the right things, and you will not know anything regarding your cure potential for a long while. Remain optimistic, all your numbers right now look pretty good. Stay in the present. U have a decent chance at a very favorable outcome. Congrats on the kids, much to be proud of. Nice to see stories of our children's success. Remember, you are not alone.

      "Content": "Max: Hope you are feeling better. What's going on with ur PSA is probably quite simple. They, or the surgery, didn't get it all. Basically you are a pt3a with NO. Good news? Your Gleason score was downgraded to 3+4. That's excellent news. Your PSA at this point should be undetectable. Pardon my straight talk. A PSA at your stage of .5-.6 needs to be dealt with while the cancer is at its weakest. I would be seeking out a RO to discuss the next steps. My guess is some sort of HT plus SRT is in your future. On a positive note, it is still probably local, which means decisive action right now can still produce a cure. I would be seeking to make a game plan now, while u are still healing. The RO can start a short course of ADT to hold the remaining cancer at bay. Then u can proceed. Stay strong, ur LN were negative, and your G score is minor. Studies have shown the earlier one starts ART/SRT, the better the outcome. PSA is the most significant factor to consider. Best, MM",

      "Content": "Thank u Ron. David: Congrats on beating back the beast! In your prior post, you said you were G8 with Lymph node involvement. Your scans are now clean. Have you talked to a RO? You may now be able to \"spot\" radiate or have some options in that regard. In your case, I would think you will be on ADT for 2-3 years before you get a vacation. Your medical team should be the MO and the RO. I would not be just seeing a urologist. I would not even bother asking others about their results after ADT was discontinued. Every case is different. Only one thing is for sure...when you go off of it, you are on the clock. That's when u will know. General standard of care in your case is probably at least 2 years. Good news is that your body is showing a great response. Once we can see some more information, we can go from there. What's your PSA history? Keep us posted",

I'm not sure why a MRI is needed at this stage, unless it has something to do with his prior cancer issue. Keep us posted, we are here to help. Best, MM",

I want to apologize for my absence, lots of turmoil to deal with. Let's see.....PCa, divorce, fathers death, to name three. Wanted to say hello to all, and get back into the swing of things. To that end, today's UPSA rolled another winner. <0.05. That's as low as it gets at the UC. Wanted to let everyone know, because in the battle against this beast, we all must rejoice in the good news while we can. So for now, circle the wagons, I'm still in the game. My heartfelt thanks for all the support I have received here. Looking forward to helping others. Warmest Regards, MM",

      "Content": "Hey Red. I am assuming that u are talking about Casadex. That is given by some RO prior to taking Lupron to avoid what is called testosterone Flare. That is why they are giving that to you for now. It may only last for about 4 months until the end of ART. Most RO at that point just let you continue on with lupron. To that end, I really can't see why you are stuck in this Zytiga thing. It is VERY expensive, and without proper medical coverage, can be financially devastating. Plus, u don't need it now. I think your doctors have you on the correct path. I know your head is spinning, I've been there. You seem to be doing all the right things, and you will not know anything regarding your cure potential for a long while. Remain optimistic, all your numbers right now look pretty good. Stay in the present. U have a decent chance at a very favorable outcome. Congrats on the kids, much to be proud of. Nice to see stories of our children's success. Remember, you are not alone.

      "Content": "Max: Hope you are feeling better. What's going on with ur PSA is probably quite simple. They, or the surgery, didn't get it all. Basically you are a pt3a with NO. Good news? Your Gleason score was downgraded to 3+4. That's excellent news. Your PSA at this point should be undetectable. Pardon my straight talk. A PSA at your stage of .5-.6 needs to be dealt with while the cancer is at its weakest. I would be seeking out a RO to discuss the next steps. My guess is some sort of HT plus SRT is in your future. On a positive note, it is still probably local, which means decisive action right now can still produce a cure. I would be seeking to make a game plan now, while u are still healing. The RO can start a short course of ADT to hold the remaining cancer at bay. Then u can proceed. Stay strong, ur LN were negative, and your G score is minor. Studies have shown the earlier one starts ART/SRT, the better the outcome. PSA is the most significant factor to consider. Best, MM",

      "Content": "Hello All: Thank u all for the kind words and responses. A special thanks to brother RobLee for taking the time to convey his own personal situation, and what I may be facing. Much appreciated. On to my appointment...My regular Uro has referred me to a Uro who just does the AUS 800 and the implant. They are both associated with Loyola Medicine in Chicago, Loyola being one of the big four in Chicago. Upon meeting me, he gave me an exam and based on my leakage, told me I was a potential candidate for the AUS 800. He said potential because not everyone is. In my case, he is worried about the SRT and the effect on the scar tissue around the now gone prostate area. He said I will need to under go a procedure in a few weeks, meaning I will be scoped and he will exam what he has to work with. He told me he will numb or freeze the area, and that I will feel nothing. During this time, I will be able to see what he is pointing out on the screen. Due to the SRT, he also said that this IS NOT a 100% solution. Right now at my desk job and daily life, I am using about 1 large pad per day. Not bad. My problem is when I exercise, golf, yard stuff, go out and have a few drinks, any sort of real activity. Then things just get bad. Rob, I'm not sure I have any other choice but to give this a shot. He told me he could improve my situation by about 75/80%, and life would improve. I liked the fact that he was honest, and told me the truth straight up. He also pointed out that these devices usually have a life of 5-10 years, all depending upon the person, etc. when the thing wears out, time to do it again. Thanks PCa...LOL! As for the penile implant, he will not do them both at the same time. He said there is to much going on with these devices, and that he wants to take one step at a time. The implant could be done 3 months after the AUS 800, assuming things go well. He did say there would be a week or so of discomfort, but after all the other treatments, so what? He did not mention the implant being bulky or awkward...good question to ask him. He did say that the AUS will, along with the implant, prevent leakage during a sexual encounter. ( fingers crossed) To Roblee's point about the sexual thing...as of now I have no interest in sex either. I was on ADT for 25 months, and will continue to feel the effects well into late 2019. If I were not in a relationship for 6 years with my GF, I would just say the hell with it. I kind of feel like I am doing it for her/us, and perhaps that is the right thing to do. IDK. Rob has given me some questions to ask when I return to the Uro on Oct 11th. Much like Rob, right now I am wondering if I will ever feel a damn thing sexually again. The beat goes on...Stay strong...MM",

      "Content": "Hey Samie: I realize what a tough position you must be in. The lady in the middle of your husband and his proper care. Kind of a fine line to dance upon. SV involvement used to be a pathological finding that precluded radiation. But that was 15-20 years ago. Mostly because those cases were so much more advanced back then. PCa testing and awareness have changed dramatically since then. Many people with SV involvement are having RT today. It is not the adverse finding that it was 10-15-20 years ago. Not trying to make a mountain out of this, but I guess I'm just not clear what your surgeon is referring to. But, he is the doctor, not me. Good luck with everything Samie, and keep us posted on your progress. Best Wishes, MM",

      "Content": "Hey Samie: Thank u for asking how I am doing. I am fine and moving along in hopes of a cure. I am throwing everything including the kitchen sink at my PCa. As you can see, I am also a pT3bNO. With that said, why would your surgeon say what he did about AR/SRT not being effective? How could he know that yet? Your husband was negative lymph nodes and, as of now, no metastases. Truth is, nobody knows as of now. If he were to receive AR/SRT, he would not know the answer until afterward. And depending upon HT, not until that left his system. If there was any cancer left in the prostate bed, they could kill it and he would be cured. If it already was or is in a micro-metastases state, then radiation would be futile. Again, nobody knows. \"Assay\" is the methodology used to calculate the PSA. Different labs have different ways of doing it. One labs undetectable might be another's whatever. With a pre-op PSA of 39 and a G8, I would be all over this like a hawk. I would want to know the exact PSA, and the method being used. And I would not wait another 3 months to be tested. Just me, I'm a pro-active guy. Talk to a RO/MO. Be your own boss. BTW, even if people like us run into stone walls, there are TX out there to keep us going for many years. And a lot coming down the pipeline. Your husband is very lucky to have such a loving and caring wife. Best regards, MM",

Brings tears to my eyes. I think we all are lucky to at least have legitimate hope. Lots of good things coming down the pipe for prostate cancer. Hell, there may even be a vaccine by the time my son is 40. (He's 22). Enjoy the good moments, and congrats on a great result. Wishing you the best possible outcome. MM",

      "Content": "Hello Dking: Welcome to the forum. Lots of good people here to help you and your husband through the process. Not trying to scare you, but your husband is considered a high-risk case. PI means that the cancer is or has spread to the space surrounding the nerve. When found on a biopsy, it MAY suggest that the cancer has spread outside of the prostate, or has a higher chance of having done so. For now, that is the least of your concerns. Intraductal Carcinoma is not the garden variety of prostate cancer. I would suggest that you go to a major cancer center and see a specialist who has experience with IDC-P. Most PCa cases are adenocarcinoma. I would suspect that unless you go to a major cancer center, they may not be familiar with the treatment of this particular type of PCa. Keep in mind that any PCa can be cured if still contained, and many none-contained cases can be cured or successfully managed for many, many, years. Where do you live? Many of my forum brothers are standing ready to help with suggestions of the best medical facilities. Let us know how we can help. Best, MM",

In addition, there are so many smart guys helping out that sometimes I feel that I am not needed as much. Today I am heading for my Appt. that is in the post title, and when I return I will post the results for all who may be interested. Given my high risk status, I was never allowed the time to heal, and having to proceed so quickly to ADT/SRT hurt my continence and ED issues. The good news is that I seem to be doing well so far, now I am just trying to get back to a bit more normal of a life. Best to all in this fight....MM",

What is his exact PSA? What type of \"assay\"? He may need aggressive treatment. AR/ SRT and/ or possible HT could possibly cure him. It is a small window that you may have, each day that goes by is another day the time frame closes. Have you spoke with a MO or a RO? Remember, your surgeons job is over. If you could provide more data, we may be able to help you. I am not saying you need to rush into radiation, he may be fine. However, most high risk cases find themselves headed in that direction. The more information you can provide, the better we can help. Best regards, MM",

      "Content": "Hello All: Thank u all for the kind words and responses. A special thanks to brother RobLee for taking the time to convey his own personal situation, and what I may be facing. Much appreciated. On to my appointment...My regular Uro has referred me to a Uro who just does the AUS 800 and the implant. They are both associated with Loyola Medicine in Chicago, Loyola being one of the big four in Chicago. Upon meeting me, he gave me an exam and based on my leakage, told me I was a potential candidate for the AUS 800. He said potential because not everyone is. In my case, he is worried about the SRT and the effect on the scar tissue around the now gone prostate area. He said I will need to under go a procedure in a few weeks, meaning I will be scoped and he will exam what he has to work with. He told me he will numb or freeze the area, and that I will feel nothing. During this time, I will be able to see what he is pointing out on the screen. Due to the SRT, he also said that this IS NOT a 100% solution. Right now at my desk job and daily life, I am using about 1 large pad per day. Not bad. My problem is when I exercise, golf, yard stuff, go out and have a few drinks, any sort of real activity. Then things just get bad. Rob, I'm not sure I have any other choice but to give this a shot. He told me he could improve my situation by about 75/80%, and life would improve. I liked the fact that he was honest, and told me the truth straight up. He also pointed out that these devices usually have a life of 5-10 years, all depending upon the person, etc. when the thing wears out, time to do it again. Thanks PCa...LOL! As for the penile implant, he will not do them both at the same time. He said there is to much going on with these devices, and that he wants to take one step at a time. The implant could be done 3 months after the AUS 800, assuming things go well. He did say there would be a week or so of discomfort, but after all the other treatments, so what? He did not mention the implant being bulky or awkward...good question to ask him. He did say that the AUS will, along with the implant, prevent leakage during a sexual encounter. ( fingers crossed) To Roblee's point about the sexual thing...as of now I have no interest in sex either. I was on ADT for 25 months, and will continue to feel the effects well into late 2019. If I were not in a relationship for 6 years with my GF, I would just say the hell with it. I kind of feel like I am doing it for her/us, and perhaps that is the right thing to do. IDK. Rob has given me some questions to ask when I return to the Uro on Oct 11th. Much like Rob, right now I am wondering if I will ever feel a damn thing sexually again. The beat goes on...Stay strong...MM",

      "Content": "Hello Samie: Not sure I would agree with what is going on. Could u provide more information? Was your husband pT3bNo Mx? Was there already lymph node involvement? What is his exact PSA? What type of \"assay\"? He may need aggressive treatment. AR/ SRT and/ or possible HT could possibly cure him. It is a small window that you may have, each day that goes by is another day the time frame closes. Have you spoke with a MO or a RO? Remember, your surgeons job is over. If you could provide more data, we may be able to help you. I am not saying you need to rush into radiation, he may be fine. However, most high risk cases find themselves headed in that direction. The more information you can provide, the better we can help. Best regards, MM",

      "Content": "Hey Samie: Thank u for asking how I am doing. I am fine and moving along in hopes of a cure. I am throwing everything including the kitchen sink at my PCa. As you can see, I am also a pT3bNO. With that said, why would your surgeon say what he did about AR/SRT not being effective? How could he know that yet? Your husband was negative lymph nodes and, as of now, no metastases. Truth is, nobody knows as of now. If he were to receive AR/SRT, he would not know the answer until afterward. And depending upon HT, not until that left his system. If there was any cancer left in the prostate bed, they could kill it and he would be cured. If it already was or is in a micro-metastases state, then radiation would be futile. Again, nobody knows. \"Assay\" is the methodology used to calculate the PSA. Different labs have different ways of doing it. One labs undetectable might be another's whatever. With a pre-op PSA of 39 and a G8, I would be all over this like a hawk. I would want to know the exact PSA, and the method being used. And I would not wait another 3 months to be tested. Just me, I'm a pro-active guy. Talk to a RO/MO. Be your own boss. BTW, even if people like us run into stone walls, there are TX out there to keep us going for many years. And a lot coming down the pipeline. Your husband is very lucky to have such a loving and caring wife. Best regards, MM",

Radiation techniques and equipment have improved greatly over the years. U are in the enviable position of having time to consider all options. Nothing wrong with surgery, and we are all here to support any choice you make. But just be aware of all the SE of each treatment, and know that what happened to your family members has nothing to do with u. BCR can happen with all primary treatments. Good Luck, MM",

      "Content": "From one Midwest to another: Welcome to the forum, and I am happy that u are here with G6 PCa. ( would rather that u were not here at all!!) Sounds like u have a excellent doctor who has explained all the various options. A few areas of concern would be the number of positive cores, and the involvement you have. Not trying to scare u, but u have a great deal of cancer there. I hate to break the news, but there is no AS protocol on the planet that u would qualify for. I don't think any additional testing is really going to matter. Also, remember that things can get upgraded or the higher grade tumors can be missed on the biopsy. That happens over 20/25% of the time. All that being said, prompt action with your current stats could result in a cure, and getting this behind you. Wishing u the best, the forum brothers and sisters stand with u. MM",

In addition, there are so many smart guys helping out that sometimes I feel that I am not needed as much. Today I am heading for my Appt. that is in the post title, and when I return I will post the results for all who may be interested. Given my high risk status, I was never allowed the time to heal, and having to proceed so quickly to ADT/SRT hurt my continence and ED issues. The good news is that I seem to be doing well so far, now I am just trying to get back to a bit more normal of a life. Best to all in this fight....MM",

      "Content": "Hey Samie: I realize what a tough position you must be in. The lady in the middle of your husband and his proper care. Kind of a fine line to dance upon. SV involvement used to be a pathological finding that precluded radiation. But that was 15-20 years ago. Mostly because those cases were so much more advanced back then. PCa testing and awareness have changed dramatically since then. Many people with SV involvement are having RT today. It is not the adverse finding that it was 10-15-20 years ago. Not trying to make a mountain out of this, but I guess I'm just not clear what your surgeon is referring to. But, he is the doctor, not me. Good luck with everything Samie, and keep us posted on your progress. Best Wishes, MM",

Radiation techniques and equipment have improved greatly over the years. U are in the enviable position of having time to consider all options. Nothing wrong with surgery, and we are all here to support any choice you make. But just be aware of all the SE of each treatment, and know that what happened to your family members has nothing to do with u. BCR can happen with all primary treatments. Good Luck, MM",

You may still respond very well. Hang in there, and get to a new MO. Good luck. MM",

      "Content": "Sudds: Hello and welcome to the forum. Just one thing to add, and comment on your last post. It is fine to talk with other family members, but each case is different. Radiation techniques and equipment have improved greatly over the years. U are in the enviable position of having time to consider all options. Nothing wrong with surgery, and we are all here to support any choice you make. But just be aware of all the SE of each treatment, and know that what happened to your family members has nothing to do with u. BCR can happen with all primary treatments. Good Luck, MM",

Then higher the PSA goes, the less effective the SRT will be. You have a trend which has been in place for some time. Studies have shown the PSA level is the single most important factor in the success or failure of SRT. You have beaten this beast now for 7 years, do not give up. Standing in your shoes, I would be pro-active and getting this lined up....yesterday! You are only 71, act now and you will be around for many, many , more years. What are you waiting for?

      "Content": "Hello Dexter. Welcome to the forum, hopefully we can look at your case and provide some suggestions. Well first, it looks like the doctors at the VA are leaving me a bit puzzled. Why u were refused surgery, I don't know. Your bone and CT scan were clean, so I'm going to say there were no distant metastasis. Your PSA nadir was 0.49, so u went nadir plus 2 in April. Did u stop with the lupron, or is ur PSA rising while still on it? You may not be a candidate now for surgery, given the Brachytherapy and IMRT. That may not work. Anyway can u see another doctor at a cancer center and just get your drugs thru the VA? Not knowing your exact ADT status, I am wonderingly what your doctor means by stating you PSA will go down without HT. Huh? You may need to try another form of HT, second line drugs etc. My gut is telling me that u need to see a different MO for a second opinion. Start there and then worry about the prescription deal. Keep us posted, and good luck. MM",

Make an appointment with a RO and get the ball rolling. Given your G8, I would request that I be given HT right now, thereby stopping the cancer while you investigate the process. PSA level is the single most important factor in determining outcomes from SRT. Right now u are in the \" very early salvage group \". Keep it that way. I have the answers to ur last question in my notes at home. I will check in with that info later today. Stay strong. MM",

      "Content": "Zencat: To answer your 1st question, a PLND is or has become SOP. Actually, during the operation your surgeon will be taking out the lymph nodes and stopping the operation for several minutes. The dissected LN will be then viewed by the pathologist, and the report given to the surgeon. This is done during the operation. The report on your entire prostate, known as your path report, will be given to you about a week after the surgery. The implications from a negative report are good. Please keep in mind that all it really means is that the LN that were taken during the operation are negative. It says nothing about the others in the pelvic area. Your surgeon will be taking the lymph nodes that he believes would be most likely to be infected. I think it's the iliac LN. The ones that are traveling north in your body. PCa tends to move in that direction, moving towards the bone. A positive result would be another adverse factor that nobody wants. It can mean many things, none of them good. Given your profile to this point in time, I would not be overly concerned. Best Regards, MM",

Many aggressive tumors don't put out a lot of PSA, so there is no way of knowing until u have the biopsy. Certainly with a positive DRE and a PSA over 20, something is going on. But, it may be one of several issues not related to PCa. I guess what I am saying is each case is different, so get the biopsy and go from there.

      "Content": "Hello Dexter. Welcome to the forum, hopefully we can look at your case and provide some suggestions. Well first, it looks like the doctors at the VA are leaving me a bit puzzled. Why u were refused surgery, I don't know. Your bone and CT scan were clean, so I'm going to say there were no distant metastasis. Your PSA nadir was 0.49, so u went nadir plus 2 in April. Did u stop with the lupron, or is ur PSA rising while still on it? You may not be a candidate now for surgery, given the Brachytherapy and IMRT. That may not work. Anyway can u see another doctor at a cancer center and just get your drugs thru the VA? Not knowing your exact ADT status, I am wonderingly what your doctor means by stating you PSA will go down without HT. Huh? You may need to try another form of HT, second line drugs etc. My gut is telling me that u need to see a different MO for a second opinion. Start there and then worry about the prescription deal. Keep us posted, and good luck. MM",

Make an appointment with a RO and get the ball rolling. Given your G8, I would request that I be given HT right now, thereby stopping the cancer while you investigate the process. PSA level is the single most important factor in determining outcomes from SRT. Right now u are in the \" very early salvage group \". Keep it that way. I have the answers to ur last question in my notes at home. I will check in with that info later today. Stay strong. MM",

      "Content": "Hello Mike. Congrats on moving forward, you have now taken the next step on this journey to ensuring that you will have many more years! You have more than a few years left in you, you are just in the early stages of the game, with many more options and bullets to fire. Your PSA rise could be attributed to a few different factors, no better place to find out than MSK. IMHO, sitting around doing nothing is not a option. Ask questions, find answers, be aggressive with your own case. In the immortal words of T. Boone Pickens...\u0094a fool with a plan is better than a genius without one\u0094. Please keep us posted on what they have to say. Stay Strong Brother. Best, MM",

      "Content": "Hello Mosserj: Just wanted to say Hi and a warm welcome to the forum. At first glance, your PC seems to be of the lower/ intermediate risk variety. That's a good thing. A PSA under 10 would probably indicate that this is a local or contained case. Also a good thing. As you said, stay calm and become your own advocate. Don't be afraid to ask questions both here and of your doctors. Get Dr. Patrick Walsh's book, the 3rd edition. ( The guide to surviving Prostate Cancer). Good read and it will help you understand the various options. Keep in mind this process is a long road with many peaks and valleys. We will be here to help you get through. My one concern with your situation is the number of cores that had PC. Meaning, you will need some sort of treatment. Don't mess around. You stand an excellent chance for a full cure. Best wishes, MM",

      "Content": "Mike: I would agree with Fairwind. Uros have a annoying habit of waiting to long to do much of anything. I would take your case to a MO at a major cancer center. I see that u have not been on Lupron...i also would be seeing a doctor that does the uPSA. With your high risk status, I believe it is imperative. Without using the uPSA, it is hard to tell if your PSA ever really became undetectable. Assuming that you may still be hormone sensitive, lupron may still be a option. You may be finding yourself in a situation of being on intermittent HT, with the ability of taking some \"vacations\". There are several other hormonal drugs which may also be appropriate for your situation. Do this now while your PSA is still low. ( see the MO) I should point out that Trelstar is a LHRH, but perhaps Lupron would be more effective for u. IDK. Please keep us posted, and best of luck. MM",

Doctors today are trained to look at the trend and the velocity that it is moving. 4-10 is kind of viewed as no man's land. My PSA pre-op was 5.9. It turns out that I have a high grade/risk disease. Many aggressive tumors don't put out a lot of PSA, so there is no way of knowing until u have the biopsy. Certainly with a positive DRE and a PSA over 20, something is going on. But, it may be one of several issues not related to PCa. I guess what I am saying is each case is different, so get the biopsy and go from there. I know it's hard, but try and remain calm and positive. Keep us posted on the results. Best wishes, MM",

Given that u live in NJ, I would go to MSK, and not waste anymore time doing so. I\u2019m not sure what your current Urologist can do for u, even with the title you mentioned. You need a top notch MO to review the case. Once in Texas, MDA would be my choice. They are at the forefront of damn near all things cancer. Stay on top of this and get moving... your current urologist may be correct in not taking any action right now, but I would rather hear that view from a MO at MSK. A rising PSA after your tri-modality of treatments requires immediate attention. Best, MM",

      "Content": "Gary: Sorry to hear the news, but I am sure this is a local issue, and can be cleaned up by SRT. Given that u are a G7 (3+4) ADT may not be needed at this time. While your PSA of 0.32 is not ideal, it is not like it came back 4-5-6. It is still very low. Kind of a strange case, given your pathology report. Yes, I have read about surgery cases where the PSA never became undetectable out of the gate. Just a bit strange in your case, given your low-risk features. Hang in there, I'm sure u will be just fine. Good luck, MM",

      "Content": "Hello dimavvs: Welcome to the forum, sorry u have to be here, but hopefully what you are experiencing is not related to PCa. Ok, first, it was a bit hard to follow what you are trying to say. I'm a bit confused about a urologist who preformed a colonoscopy? I can say that you are very young to have PCa, and also very young to have a PSA of 4.4. Seems a bit odd. PCa is a slow moving disease, so rapid spikes in PSA may indicate something else being wrong. Rather than sit here and go point by point about what you wrote, my advice would be to find a Urologist who will get to the bottom of this. Where do u live? perhaps once we find that out, folks on here can guide you to the proper place. U have listed a host of issues, my question is why is your current doc is not addressing them with the symptoms u are describing? Let's try to get u to a major medical center and solve these issues. My gut says this is not PCa, but u need to press on and find out about the bleeding, rash, etc. U have already been on Cipro once, that apparently did u very little good. Why again? Standing in your shoes, I would be aggressive in finding a urologist in a major medical center who is interested in helping you solve this problem. Hang in there, it may be nothing. As I said, you are very young to have PCa. Regards, MM",

If u go in prepared, and have all your questions written out and perhaps send this specialist an EM beforehand with anything that they may need time to reflect on, u should be all set. Why take 2 more weeks? I decided on the spot. U can always book the treatment, and then cancel if needed. I just found it really easy if I was my own advocate. Good luck. MM",

      "Content": "Mike: I would agree with Fairwind. Uros have a annoying habit of waiting to long to do much of anything. I would take your case to a MO at a major cancer center. I see that u have not been on Lupron...i also would be seeing a doctor that does the uPSA. With your high risk status, I believe it is imperative. Without using the uPSA, it is hard to tell if your PSA ever really became undetectable. Assuming that you may still be hormone sensitive, lupron may still be a option. You may be finding yourself in a situation of being on intermittent HT, with the ability of taking some \"vacations\". There are several other hormonal drugs which may also be appropriate for your situation. Do this now while your PSA is still low. ( see the MO) I should point out that Trelstar is a LHRH, but perhaps Lupron would be more effective for u. IDK. Please keep us posted, and best of luck. MM",

Given that u live in NJ, I would go to MSK, and not waste anymore time doing so. I\u2019m not sure what your current Urologist can do for u, even with the title you mentioned. You need a top notch MO to review the case. Once in Texas, MDA would be my choice. They are at the forefront of damn near all things cancer. Stay on top of this and get moving... your current urologist may be correct in not taking any action right now, but I would rather hear that view from a MO at MSK. A rising PSA after your tri-modality of treatments requires immediate attention. Best, MM",

      "Content": "Scott: Welcome to the forum. Hopefully your stay will be a short one. PSA varies a great deal from person to person. In today's world, many PCP will taken no action between 0-4. Doctors today are trained to look at the trend and the velocity that it is moving. 4-10 is kind of viewed as no man's land. My PSA pre-op was 5.9. It turns out that I have a high grade/risk disease. Many aggressive tumors don't put out a lot of PSA, so there is no way of knowing until u have the biopsy. Certainly with a positive DRE and a PSA over 20, something is going on. But, it may be one of several issues not related to PCa. I guess what I am saying is each case is different, so get the biopsy and go from there. I know it's hard, but try and remain calm and positive. Keep us posted on the results. Best wishes, MM",

      "Content": "Hello Mosserj: Just wanted to say Hi and a warm welcome to the forum. At first glance, your PC seems to be of the lower/ intermediate risk variety. That's a good thing. A PSA under 10 would probably indicate that this is a local or contained case. Also a good thing. As you said, stay calm and become your own advocate. Don't be afraid to ask questions both here and of your doctors. Get Dr. Patrick Walsh's book, the 3rd edition. ( The guide to surviving Prostate Cancer). Good read and it will help you understand the various options. Keep in mind this process is a long road with many peaks and valleys. We will be here to help you get through. My one concern with your situation is the number of cores that had PC. Meaning, you will need some sort of treatment. Don't mess around. You stand an excellent chance for a full cure. Best wishes, MM",

Highlander ( Chuck) gave me some good advice. In addition to having the general area frozen so there is no pain going in, have the doctor give the actual gland some medication. It worked very well for me. I also took a Valium 2/3 hours prior to the procedure. I took the easy way, and it worked. Best of Luck, MM",

Sadly, part of the game for some of us. I can only say what he is going thru is not that uncommon, and it WILL get better soon. Keep walking to get the bowels going, that worked for me. All recoveries are different, better days are ahead. Keep the MoM going, and they should be giving him some medicine to soften the stool. Don't be bashful about asking for the pain meds, nothing wrong with that. Good luck and keep us posted. MM",

Don't be afraid to ask questions both here and of your doctors. Get Dr. Patrick Walsh's book, the 3rd edition. ( The guide to surviving Prostate Cancer). Good read and it will help you understand the various options. Keep in mind this process is a long road with many peaks and valleys. We will be here to help you get through.

      "Content": "Hey Fred: Sorry to hear of the ED situation. You have plenty of company, including yours truly. I had the same thing happen to me, and it just ruined the moment and was a complete disaster. However, better days are ahead. Just give things time and your continence will return. I think most men take up to a year to become fully dry. And by that I mean including physical activity. I am dry now, but not when I workout or play golf. Still got the small leaks. It's ok to want to scream and cry, normal human emotions. Look at it this way, you have a garden variety case of PCa. Chances are that you are now CURED!!! The most important thing is now behind you. There are many treatments for ED and your incontinence will be a thing of the past. You will have sex again, just a matter of time. Hang in there and be patient. Keep us posted on your progress. All the best, MM",

      "Content": "Hello illek: Welcome to the forum, sorry about the pathology report. What happened to u is exactly what happened to me. Are u being over treated? NO! Much like myself, u have a high risk serious case. From what I can gather, your risk is finding out about micro-mets as time goes by. Should that be the case, there is really nothing u can do about it but go into containment mode, which can last years. BUT, u may still have a chance at a cure if u throw everything at it right now! PCa takes no days off, and neither should u. Your window for a possible cure is now, using the 3 treatment whammy of RP, SRT/ART, and ADT. Why not give yourself every chance? Just my opinion. Your doctor seems to be on top of his game, they only other thing I would add is that a zero psa at this point just buys u time, u probably will not be able to avoid additional treatment. Best, MM",

You will be at JH for at least one nite, and assuming all goes well will be released. U don't need 3 nites at a local hotel. I would just go home. U will have the catheter in, so u really don't need to worry about the bathroom. It will probably be a few days before u go #2, so no worries there. U won't need a wheelchair, ( I am assuming you are in otherwise good health) and any of the other items you are suggesting. Baggy shorts, bag to cover the bag, get on the plane ( couple hours?) and get back home. Example: upon checkout from the UC, I walked and carried my overnite bag. U are going to a lot of expense and trouble for nothing. Once again, all else being equal. Best, MM",

Highlander ( Chuck) gave me some good advice. In addition to having the general area frozen so there is no pain going in, have the doctor give the actual gland some medication. It worked very well for me. I also took a Valium 2/3 hours prior to the procedure. I took the easy way, and it worked. Best of Luck, MM",

You will be at JH for at least one nite, and assuming all goes well will be released. U don't need 3 nites at a local hotel. I would just go home. U will have the catheter in, so u really don't need to worry about the bathroom. It will probably be a few days before u go #2, so no worries there. U won't need a wheelchair, ( I am assuming you are in otherwise good health) and any of the other items you are suggesting. Baggy shorts, bag to cover the bag, get on the plane ( couple hours?) and get back home. Example: upon checkout from the UC, I walked and carried my overnite bag. U are going to a lot of expense and trouble for nothing. Once again, all else being equal. Best, MM",

      "Content": "Hello Mike: Congrats on the good numbers, nice to see and bodes well at this point in time. My first question is given your status as pT3b, why is your doctor not checking u every 3 months at this point in time? Are u having the uPSA test? I would have the uPSA test and plan any possible SRT around what my PSA scores are showing. Anything above 0.03 on the uPSA scale is highly indicative of BCR, ( at least for high risk) and of course you could wait to see the trend. The best time to start SRT is early!! I would not wait much longer than .1...that is when I pulled the trigger. In your case, the target will be the prostate bed, along with what is known as the boost. ( local LN). That is really all they can do at this point. Good luck and keep us posted, MM",

What is your clinical staging? So your bone scan was negative, and the CT showed lymph node involvement? When you say it has spread down my legs, what exactly do you mean? They remove sample cores during a biopsy, what do u mean a tumor was removed? Just trying to get a clear picture of the situation. Even cases with +LN can be cured if caught early. Do not lose hope!! Why aren't they going to radiate? Your taking ADT will stop it in its tracks for now, there are EBRT and Brachy treatments that may offer u a cure, or a combo of both. Please give us as much information as possible, others will be chiming in soon. This game has just started, we will help u devolpe a plan. Hang in. MM",

As far as your other question, if u are using a UPSA, the score being that low might vary a bit from lab to lab. Example, I was 0.05 six weeks out. At 12 weeks I was .1 My doctor said if we tested the 12 week score 10 times, we may get 10 different numbers. But they would all be around 0.05 to .1. Point is, the score was going north. Look for your trend, not a specific number. Good luck, MM",

      "Content": "Hello Bruce: As Chuck has stated, if u could provide a stat line, it would be most helpful in getting a better understanding of your case. In any event, the care of PCa might be different where u are at, but you should have been on ADT/Chemo some time ago. It is increasing at a rapid rate, and u need the ADT to stem the tide. Every case is different, many men live on ADT/chemo for years, others are not so lucky. Once your primary and secondary treatments failed, and your PSA reached 18.1.....that was the signal that you will probably be on HT for the duration of your life...which could be many years! There is no cure now, but you are in the \"manage the disease phase\". And many men do \"manage\" it with ADT and second/third line HT for many years. The SE are what they are, but the alternative is not so great. For now, you need to get that PSA number under control. ADT is no fun, but u can get thru it. Also, if it works, you can go off it and then back on it...again, every case is different. Good luck my friend, please keep us posted. MM",

      "Content": "Hello Mrs. Z. As our esteemed Moderator Chuck has noted, if the cancer has remained in the prostate gland or regional area, there is hope for a cure. I am assuming his bone and CT scan were negative, otherwise they would not be offering you surgery. So on that front, good news. I also have G9, and while it has been a long road, I remain optimistic. My I phone doesn't show my signature, but click on my name and see my treatment schedule. U will see there is hope. And more than a glimmer! Ok? To answer your questions.... 1. I am single and did not have a caregiver. I am in good physical condition, so if your husband is also, you don't need to take any days off. There really is not anything for u to do. 2. Yes, he will be able to climb the stairs. It is encouraged. 3. Will he need assistance? I would say it would depend on his general health. I was a solo act 4. Don't go crazy buying things. I bought all kinds of things that the stickey told me, and found most of it to be useless. In my view, u need a recliner for the day, I slept in bed at nite. You need a big catheter bag, and a long rope attached to it. This will allow u the flexibility to move about and sleep on either side. Baggy athletic shorts, where u can hook the catheter in your pocket and walk. That's it. I had a hernia operation in 2009, much worse than PC surgery. Hang in there, and keep us posted. MM",

To answer your topic question, the side effects of hormone therapy are due to the lack of testosterone in your body. So, i am not sure that there would be much difference in the medical vs. chemical castration as it pertains to side effects. You say your in Carolina? Are you at a major medical center? Interested in knowing what was your clinical diagnoses? Why did they only take 2 lymph nodes during your surgery? I would have thought there would be a lot more taken in your case. What was your pathological staging? Your PSA, while not a large number, has seen a alarming velocity in it's movement. But, this case you present is a bit puzzling. I am surprised that your recent scans were not discovered at the beginning. Your PSA is .7. It usually takes a much higher number for these findings to show up. It's not like your PSA is now 5 or 10. What happened in the beginning of your case? Any additional information you can provide would be helpful. You should be taking some calcium supplements. Vit. D3 around 5000mg per day. Vit K2, around 100mg per day. Adva Cal Ultra. 1000 mg per day. The adva cal has many of these in the serving, so check out the label. Your physical fitness regime is something u want to keep up. You are to be applauded for the great condition u are in. This will help a great deal with ADT. Don't give up hope. Many stage 4 patients live for many, many, years. There are a boatload of front line, second line and down the line hormonal treatments. Many new things coming down the pike. Lets hope the PSA takes a nose dive when the chemo is being done.

I am going thru a lot of the same, wondering what the hell might be next! I get past each day by telling myself that I am dealing with the hand I have been dealt, and that I have done and will continue to do all I can to keep my feet north of the grass. I no longer worry about things out of my control. Take solace in the positive/good things in life and stay active, keeping your mind and body sharp. This may sound crazy, but PCa has made me a better person. I have a heightened level of sensitivity to other people, and to life as it pertains to what is really important. Rejoice in your kids, family and friends. In my life I have been the beneficiary of far more than I have deserved, and now because of what WE have all been thru, I can see things with a great deal of clarity. YOUR PCa is not going to get u! U GOT THIS! Stay Strong, MM",

There are second and third line HT, which can also then be added say, after Lupron/Casodex. AS has given u a example in his above post. To answer you last question...no, it is not.

      "Content": "Hello Bruce: As Chuck has stated, if u could provide a stat line, it would be most helpful in getting a better understanding of your case. In any event, the care of PCa might be different where u are at, but you should have been on ADT/Chemo some time ago. It is increasing at a rapid rate, and u need the ADT to stem the tide. Every case is different, many men live on ADT/chemo for years, others are not so lucky. Once your primary and secondary treatments failed, and your PSA reached 18.1.....that was the signal that you will probably be on HT for the duration of your life...which could be many years! There is no cure now, but you are in the \"manage the disease phase\". And many men do \"manage\" it with ADT and second/third line HT for many years. The SE are what they are, but the alternative is not so great. For now, you need to get that PSA number under control. ADT is no fun, but u can get thru it. Also, if it works, you can go off it and then back on it...again, every case is different. Good luck my friend, please keep us posted. MM",

      "Content": "Hello Karen. I am also a pT3bNO. You can look below at my signature and gain some insight into my case. Not sure where to start, so here goes. Your first urologist has done you no favors. In letting your husbands PSA to climb as it has to .4, he has decreased the optimal outcome you both are hoping for. Lord knows what he is thinking, but I would dump him pronto. With you husbands adverse pathology, he should have been taking action at 0.03 or greater. Studies have shown that for us high risk guys, above that threshold is a good indicator of BCR. I would immediately follow the advice of the RO that u have seen. Please forgive my straight talk. You are wasting precious time, and I am not sure what you are waiting for? The PSA of .4 is still low, and the scans probably will not pick anything up. This 70% stuff? This person has no idea if this is localized or not, there is simply no way of knowing. Your greatest risk is micro-mets, which had you been given better medical advice would perhaps have been treated successfully already. As things stand, your only hope at a possible cure is to start HT yesterday, and SRT tomorrow. The HT will stop any cancer in it's tracks, while your RO arranges the SRT. It's worh a shot, why not? Once again, your Urologist or RO or whoever else you want to talk to has no idea about where this cancer is or confined to. Radiation and HT together produce 50% better outcomes than either one alone.

      "Content": "RobLee: Hello. Recent studies have shown that PSA is the major deciding factor in the success or failure of SRT. If your PSA is now<0.02, I would not be concerned. However with your risk profile, I would be using any trend >0.03 to begin the SRT process. Notice I said the Trend. There is no way to determine whether or not it has or will spread beyond that. Only time will tell. Your major risk is the same as mine....micromets. Remember that early HT in addition to SRT can kill off stray cells that may not be sitting in local lymph nodes or the prostate bed. Early action could offer you a cure. I can assure you that if your PSA starts rising and u develop a trend that keeps going north, that it will spread. Remember, cancer control is goal #1. With a G8 and a pT3b NO, I would be throwing everything at this including the kitchen sink. HT/ RT has 50% better chance of success than either one alone. PAY Attention to your PSA. It is the number one factor overriding Gleason score, PM, EPE etc.... On the bright side, so far your looking good and seem to be having a great response. Best of luck, MM......Some interesting reading http://prostatecancerinfolink.net/20...on-save-lives/ http://jco.ascopubs.org/content/earl...O.2016.68.3425 https://pcnrv.blogspot.com/2016/08/l...tatectomy.html https://pcnrv.blogspot.com/2016/08/h...d-salvage.html Given my risk profile, I try and stay informed.

I went thru it this summer, and if u want to get some exact information, I have all the particulars that I would be willing to share. PM me if needed. Don't worry.

I can assure you that if your PSA starts rising and u develop a trend that keeps going north, that it will spread. Remember, cancer control is goal #1. With a G8 and a pT3b NO, I would be throwing everything at this including the kitchen sink. HT/ RT has 50% better chance of success than either one alone. PAY Attention to your PSA. It is the number one factor overriding Gleason score, PM, EPE etc.... On the bright side, so far your looking good and seem to be having a great response. Best of luck, MM......Some interesting reading http://prostatecancerinfolink.net/20...on-save-lives/ http://jco.ascopubs.org/content/earl...O.2016.68.3425 https://pcnrv.blogspot.com/2016/08/l...tatectomy.html https://pcnrv.blogspot.com/2016/08/h...d-salvage.html Given my risk profile, I try and stay informed.

      "Content": "Hello Petzelhead: Sorry to hear about this tough time u are having. To answer your topic question, the side effects of hormone therapy are due to the lack of testosterone in your body. So, i am not sure that there would be much difference in the medical vs. chemical castration as it pertains to side effects. You say your in Carolina? Are you at a major medical center? Interested in knowing what was your clinical diagnoses? Why did they only take 2 lymph nodes during your surgery? I would have thought there would be a lot more taken in your case. What was your pathological staging? Your PSA, while not a large number, has seen a alarming velocity in it's movement. But, this case you present is a bit puzzling. I am surprised that your recent scans were not discovered at the beginning. Your PSA is .7. It usually takes a much higher number for these findings to show up. It's not like your PSA is now 5 or 10. What happened in the beginning of your case? Any additional information you can provide would be helpful. You should be taking some calcium supplements. Vit. D3 around 5000mg per day. Vit K2, around 100mg per day. Adva Cal Ultra. 1000 mg per day. The adva cal has many of these in the serving, so check out the label. Your physical fitness regime is something u want to keep up. You are to be applauded for the great condition u are in. This will help a great deal with ADT. Don't give up hope. Many stage 4 patients live for many, many, years. There are a boatload of front line, second line and down the line hormonal treatments. Many new things coming down the pike. Lets hope the PSA takes a nose dive when the chemo is being done. Hang in there, I will will following your posts. Wishing you the best, MM",

You already know how I feel about your courage and bravery as it pertains to your illness, and also dealing with your wife's issues. I meant no disrespect. Since I am reading in Mike's post a PSA of 40, and I am not hearing anything to the contrary, I can assure him that this high a level is to be taken seriously. With a G8 on biopsy, and a PSA of 40, Mike needs to take decisive action and formulate a game plan immediately. Mike when you get the results, please post and we can guide you on the correct path. When I read thru the thread and saw that nobody commented on your PSA, I was thinking perhaps you meant 4.0...and not 40. Not trying to scare you in anyway, just want you to have the best chance possible. And RobLee, while his PSA is not 3 digits, if it is indeed 40, that to me is a cause for concern. I was not being critical of u, I have great respect for your opinions, and the amount of time you give to others. No disrespect intended. Best to all, MM",

You already know how I feel about your courage and bravery as it pertains to your illness, and also dealing with your wife's issues. I meant no disrespect. Since I am reading in Mike's post a PSA of 40, and I am not hearing anything to the contrary, I can assure him that this high a level is to be taken seriously. With a G8 on biopsy, and a PSA of 40, Mike needs to take decisive action and formulate a game plan immediately. Mike when you get the results, please post and we can guide you on the correct path. When I read thru the thread and saw that nobody commented on your PSA, I was thinking perhaps you meant 4.0...and not 40. Not trying to scare you in anyway, just want you to have the best chance possible. And RobLee, while his PSA is not 3 digits, if it is indeed 40, that to me is a cause for concern. I was not being critical of u, I have great respect for your opinions, and the amount of time you give to others. No disrespect intended. Best to all, MM",

      "Content": "Hello PCH: Welcome to the forum. Your case is a bit puzzling, being that u had surgery and it was a true G6. True G6 has never been found to metastasize. Metastasize is different than people using the word spread. G6 can spread locally, ( get into the surrounding tissue, prostate bed) without metastasizing. Since my Dx, I have read study after study, and I can't find a case of a treated ( true) G6 ending someone's life. You did have positive margins, and as my RO said from the University of Chicago \"once the cancer has left the prostate gland, your gleason score becomes irrelevant\". ( in terms of having to be treated) In all honesty, as I sit here and look at your PSA, your trend started to become apparent back in Jan. of 2012. In another thread on here, I just posted a link to SRT, and how one's PSA has an effect on outcomes. I will go back and get it for u, and post it in a bit. My guess is that u have something sitting locally , which can be cured by SRT. You may not have to engage in ADT. Lucky u! To answer your last question, I would be acting....yesterday. Found this for you to read from noted pathologist Jonathan Epstein, should make u feel better. Epstein comments: Good News for Men with Gleason Score 6 \"In other news, Epstein and colleagues recently took a closer look at the behavior of Gleason score 6 prostate cancer; their findings were published in the American Journal of Surgical Pathology. Although Gleason score 6 cancer is considered slow-growing and not aggressive, it has been found \u0096 rarely \u0096 in studies of prostate specimens after radical prostatectomy, to have spread outside the prostate. Could Gleason 6 cancer ever spread to the pelvic lymph nodes? Good news: The answer is no. \"We performed a search of the radical prostatectomy databases at four large academic centers,\" says Epstein. \"In more than 14,000 radical prostatectomies, there was not a single case of a Gleason score 6 tumor ever spreading to lymph nodes.\" It takes a Gleason score of 7 or higher for prostate cancer to become aggressive enough to spread far beyond the prostate. Under the microscope, Gleason score 6 cells appear uniform, \"and they have a more predictable, excellent prognosis,\" Epstein notes. Gleason score 6 disease has such a good reputation as being \"indolent\" \u0096 slow-growing and well behaved, as cancers go \u0096 among pathologists that some of them have questioned whether it should still be considered cancer. Yes it should, Epstein says. One important reason why is that the biopsy Gleason score is often adjusted after radical prostatectomy, when the prostate is studied by a pathologist, \"because the biopsy often underestimates disease grade and extent.\" Also, \"if men think that Gleason 6 tumors are not cancer, this could result in a missed opportunity for cure.\"",

      "Content": "Hello PCH: Welcome to the forum. Your case is a bit puzzling, being that u had surgery and it was a true G6. True G6 has never been found to metastasize. Metastasize is different than people using the word spread. G6 can spread locally, ( get into the surrounding tissue, prostate bed) without metastasizing. Since my Dx, I have read study after study, and I can't find a case of a treated ( true) G6 ending someone's life. You did have positive margins, and as my RO said from the University of Chicago \"once the cancer has left the prostate gland, your gleason score becomes irrelevant\". ( in terms of having to be treated) In all honesty, as I sit here and look at your PSA, your trend started to become apparent back in Jan. of 2012. In another thread on here, I just posted a link to SRT, and how one's PSA has an effect on outcomes. I will go back and get it for u, and post it in a bit. My guess is that u have something sitting locally , which can be cured by SRT. You may not have to engage in ADT. Lucky u! To answer your last question, I would be acting....yesterday. Found this for you to read from noted pathologist Jonathan Epstein, should make u feel better. Epstein comments: Good News for Men with Gleason Score 6 \"In other news, Epstein and colleagues recently took a closer look at the behavior of Gleason score 6 prostate cancer; their findings were published in the American Journal of Surgical Pathology. Although Gleason score 6 cancer is considered slow-growing and not aggressive, it has been found \u0096 rarely \u0096 in studies of prostate specimens after radical prostatectomy, to have spread outside the prostate. Could Gleason 6 cancer ever spread to the pelvic lymph nodes? Good news: The answer is no. \"We performed a search of the radical prostatectomy databases at four large academic centers,\" says Epstein. \"In more than 14,000 radical prostatectomies, there was not a single case of a Gleason score 6 tumor ever spreading to lymph nodes.\" It takes a Gleason score of 7 or higher for prostate cancer to become aggressive enough to spread far beyond the prostate. Under the microscope, Gleason score 6 cells appear uniform, \"and they have a more predictable, excellent prognosis,\" Epstein notes. Gleason score 6 disease has such a good reputation as being \"indolent\" \u0096 slow-growing and well behaved, as cancers go \u0096 among pathologists that some of them have questioned whether it should still be considered cancer. Yes it should, Epstein says. One important reason why is that the biopsy Gleason score is often adjusted after radical prostatectomy, when the prostate is studied by a pathologist, \"because the biopsy often underestimates disease grade and extent.\" Also, \"if men think that Gleason 6 tumors are not cancer, this could result in a missed opportunity for cure.\"",

When I read thru the thread and saw that nobody commented on your PSA, I was thinking perhaps you meant 4.0...and not 40. Not trying to scare you in anyway, just want you to have the best chance possible. And RobLee, while his PSA is not 3 digits, if it is indeed 40, that to me is a cause for concern. I was not being critical of u, I have great respect for your opinions, and the amount of time you give to others. No disrespect intended. Best to all, MM",

Just void yourself out and do what you need to do. You should begin taking 100mg 3x a week of some sort of ED medication. You don't need to be having intercourse, but at least get the blood moving by manual stimulation. I was doing that with good results, until I had to start ADT. Kind of killed my interest, but I am still working on it. Good luck, MM",

      "Content": "Hello guys: As I have stated on a prior thread, my biopsy appt. is this Thursday, OCT 1st. During the past week I have been reading this forum and doing my homework for what may or may not lie ahead. In a few of these threads, it has been mentioned that there are 4 things you should NOT do before taking a PSA test. ( 48-72 hours prior) Do not have sex. Do not ride a bike Do not preform any strenuous exercise Do not allow a doctor to preform a DRE Ok, so for the last 17 years I have been testing for PSA, my highly respected internist ( Loyola Chicago) has never mentioned any of these. The one exception being he asked me about bike riding before the round of antibiotics when my PSA went from 2.9 up to 4.1. Moreover, during the last 4-5 PSA tests, I did not refrain from sex or strenuous exercise. ( 18 holes walk and carry my own bag) Lastly, during each of my physicals, I would get the DRE exam last in the session, then be taken to get the blood work. Is it possible my numbers are flawed? Hard for me to believe my internist would not be aware of this. Thoughts or comments? I'm confused. As always, thanks to all the great people on this site. Chuck, for you, GO IRISH!",

You already know how I feel about your courage and bravery as it pertains to your illness, and also dealing with your wife's issues. I meant no disrespect. Since I am reading in Mike's post a PSA of 40, and I am not hearing anything to the contrary, I can assure him that this high a level is to be taken seriously. With a G8 on biopsy, and a PSA of 40, Mike needs to take decisive action and formulate a game plan immediately. Mike when you get the results, please post and we can guide you on the correct path. When I read thru the thread and saw that nobody commented on your PSA, I was thinking perhaps you meant 4.0...and not 40. Not trying to scare you in anyway, just want you to have the best chance possible. And RobLee, while his PSA is not 3 digits, if it is indeed 40, that to me is a cause for concern. I was not being critical of u, I have great respect for your opinions, and the amount of time you give to others. No disrespect intended. Best to all, MM",

I am sure u are aware of studies that tell us your PSA level is the single most important factor in the potential outcome of SRT, more so than any other pathological feature. Get yourself into the \"very early group\" and act no greater than .1. With your pathology, this will all be behind you soon. As u know, i have had the triple whammy...I got thru SRT, so will you. I don't want to go into all my issues, they probably would not apply to your case. My side effects are a result of all 3 treatment modalities, and your situation is quite different. Don't overthink, don't over analyze, just do it. Cancer takes no days off. BTW...I have not forgotten how good u were to me during my bad days post surgery. Please know I am here for u, in whatever way I may be needed. Best Regards, MM",

I would agree with southsider, your four cores and one being a G7 would warrant some further investigation. For now, time is on your side. I would meet with another Urologist and a RO. See what opinions are out there. Was your G7 3+4 or 4+3? I am assuming it was 3+4. Perhaps you could create a signature and give us some more information on your history. If I were standing in your shoes, I would be pro-active and check out all my options. U may be sitting on a golden opportunity for a cure, make sure you do not pass it up. We are all here for u. MM",

I would agree with southsider, your four cores and one being a G7 would warrant some further investigation. For now, time is on your side. I would meet with another Urologist and a RO. See what opinions are out there. Was your G7 3+4 or 4+3? I am assuming it was 3+4. Perhaps you could create a signature and give us some more information on your history. If I were standing in your shoes, I would be pro-active and check out all my options. U may be sitting on a golden opportunity for a cure, make sure you do not pass it up. We are all here for u. MM",

With a G7 (4+3) you might find yourself not being a T1C. Not trying to scare you at all, but I started out this mess as a G8, T1C. On second opinion I was a G7, (4+3) T2c. U can see by my signature where I ended up. Many times these doctors just don't know the clinical staging. Perhaps some sort of enhanced imaging would help you out. I wish I would have done that. Knowing that information will clearly help in the decision process. U have time, just try and get as much info as possible. Please keep us posted, and remember we are here for u. Regards, MM",

I discontinued after the 4 month period ( per my RO) and now I am on a 9 month -2 year Lupron sentence. Got my testosterone test back, sitting at 15! Take charge of your treatment, go to a major medical cancer center if possible. Even though you were dx stage 4, there are many treatments available now, and many more coming down the pike that will keep you around for many, many, years. Hang in there, from what I understand Casodex ( bicalutamide) has been producing great results. Keep us posted. MM",

      "Content": "Hello PCH: Welcome to the forum. Your case is a bit puzzling, being that u had surgery and it was a true G6. True G6 has never been found to metastasize. Metastasize is different than people using the word spread. G6 can spread locally, ( get into the surrounding tissue, prostate bed) without metastasizing. Since my Dx, I have read study after study, and I can't find a case of a treated ( true) G6 ending someone's life. You did have positive margins, and as my RO said from the University of Chicago \"once the cancer has left the prostate gland, your gleason score becomes irrelevant\". ( in terms of having to be treated) In all honesty, as I sit here and look at your PSA, your trend started to become apparent back in Jan. of 2012. In another thread on here, I just posted a link to SRT, and how one's PSA has an effect on outcomes. I will go back and get it for u, and post it in a bit. My guess is that u have something sitting locally , which can be cured by SRT. You may not have to engage in ADT. Lucky u! To answer your last question, I would be acting....yesterday. Found this for you to read from noted pathologist Jonathan Epstein, should make u feel better. Epstein comments: Good News for Men with Gleason Score 6 \"In other news, Epstein and colleagues recently took a closer look at the behavior of Gleason score 6 prostate cancer; their findings were published in the American Journal of Surgical Pathology. Although Gleason score 6 cancer is considered slow-growing and not aggressive, it has been found \u0096 rarely \u0096 in studies of prostate specimens after radical prostatectomy, to have spread outside the prostate. Could Gleason 6 cancer ever spread to the pelvic lymph nodes? Good news: The answer is no. \"We performed a search of the radical prostatectomy databases at four large academic centers,\" says Epstein. \"In more than 14,000 radical prostatectomies, there was not a single case of a Gleason score 6 tumor ever spreading to lymph nodes.\" It takes a Gleason score of 7 or higher for prostate cancer to become aggressive enough to spread far beyond the prostate. Under the microscope, Gleason score 6 cells appear uniform, \"and they have a more predictable, excellent prognosis,\" Epstein notes. Gleason score 6 disease has such a good reputation as being \"indolent\" \u0096 slow-growing and well behaved, as cancers go \u0096 among pathologists that some of them have questioned whether it should still be considered cancer. Yes it should, Epstein says. One important reason why is that the biopsy Gleason score is often adjusted after radical prostatectomy, when the prostate is studied by a pathologist, \"because the biopsy often underestimates disease grade and extent.\" Also, \"if men think that Gleason 6 tumors are not cancer, this could result in a missed opportunity for cure.\"",

      "Content": "Hello PCH: Welcome to the forum. Your case is a bit puzzling, being that u had surgery and it was a true G6. True G6 has never been found to metastasize. Metastasize is different than people using the word spread. G6 can spread locally, ( get into the surrounding tissue, prostate bed) without metastasizing. Since my Dx, I have read study after study, and I can't find a case of a treated ( true) G6 ending someone's life. You did have positive margins, and as my RO said from the University of Chicago \"once the cancer has left the prostate gland, your gleason score becomes irrelevant\". ( in terms of having to be treated) In all honesty, as I sit here and look at your PSA, your trend started to become apparent back in Jan. of 2012. In another thread on here, I just posted a link to SRT, and how one's PSA has an effect on outcomes. I will go back and get it for u, and post it in a bit. My guess is that u have something sitting locally , which can be cured by SRT. You may not have to engage in ADT. Lucky u! To answer your last question, I would be acting....yesterday. Found this for you to read from noted pathologist Jonathan Epstein, should make u feel better. Epstein comments: Good News for Men with Gleason Score 6 \"In other news, Epstein and colleagues recently took a closer look at the behavior of Gleason score 6 prostate cancer; their findings were published in the American Journal of Surgical Pathology. Although Gleason score 6 cancer is considered slow-growing and not aggressive, it has been found \u0096 rarely \u0096 in studies of prostate specimens after radical prostatectomy, to have spread outside the prostate. Could Gleason 6 cancer ever spread to the pelvic lymph nodes? Good news: The answer is no. \"We performed a search of the radical prostatectomy databases at four large academic centers,\" says Epstein. \"In more than 14,000 radical prostatectomies, there was not a single case of a Gleason score 6 tumor ever spreading to lymph nodes.\" It takes a Gleason score of 7 or higher for prostate cancer to become aggressive enough to spread far beyond the prostate. Under the microscope, Gleason score 6 cells appear uniform, \"and they have a more predictable, excellent prognosis,\" Epstein notes. Gleason score 6 disease has such a good reputation as being \"indolent\" \u0096 slow-growing and well behaved, as cancers go \u0096 among pathologists that some of them have questioned whether it should still be considered cancer. Yes it should, Epstein says. One important reason why is that the biopsy Gleason score is often adjusted after radical prostatectomy, when the prostate is studied by a pathologist, \"because the biopsy often underestimates disease grade and extent.\" Also, \"if men think that Gleason 6 tumors are not cancer, this could result in a missed opportunity for cure.\"",

The good news is that his PSA is showing a nice response, and the lupron has done its job. With this much PCa and it\u0092s aggressive nature, I would have to agree with Chuck. Perhaps his other medical issues are not allowing him to be treated. I can tell u that his PCa needs to be addressed and a plan needs to be put in place. Follow Chucks advice and get all his stuff and head to the Mayo Clinic. Without prompt attention, this type of PCa can get out of control. Given your dads situation, he may just be on HT for the rest of his life. I would find out if any additional RT is even possible. Try not to worry.

Any type of HT? What are his statistics as it pertains to the PC? PSA, G score, any type of diagnostic testing. Given his age, I assume that he did not have surgery option. Tell us more about his PCA, all you can remember. \"This means to me that his pancreas is no longer working correctly or at all. Is this something that happens during prostate treatment? I cannot seem to find any other instances of this\". I would agree with u. And I do not ever recall hearing anything like this. You need to pressure your RO who started this and get some answers. Call us in 2018 if anything changes? Jesus. What the hell is going on with his PCa treatment? Be firm and get some answers. Perhaps when we see his stats, others will be chiming. Best, MM",

With a G7 (4+3) you might find yourself not being a T1C. Not trying to scare you at all, but I started out this mess as a G8, T1C. On second opinion I was a G7, (4+3) T2c. U can see by my signature where I ended up. Many times these doctors just don't know the clinical staging. Perhaps some sort of enhanced imaging would help you out. I wish I would have done that. Knowing that information will clearly help in the decision process. U have time, just try and get as much info as possible. Please keep us posted, and remember we are here for u. Regards, MM",

      "Content": "To all my forum brothers: Just wanted to say hello to all and let everyone know my SRT was completed on 8/5/16. I want to thank all of u for the kindness and support that has been directed at me. Of course, also the technical knowledge of helping me develop a game plan. I got to ring the \"bell\" 3 times, as is the tradition at UC. All the techs and doctors came out and gave me a round of applause, which I felt kind of strange about. It was I that should have been applauding them, and I did. I hugged and thanked each one of them, brought all of them a few parting gifts, and when I spoke I started to get choked up. Could not finish my words, so just kind of thankfully bowed my head and left. Such a great team, I felt fortunate to be in their care. SE have not been all bad, some bowel and urinary issues that will go away in about 6-8 weeks. I was >90% dry going in, and for the most part have stayed that way. I am about 1/2 pad per day. So, I guess that might be one bullet I dodged. I did not celebrate on that Friday, right after I drove to a religious place near my home and went to the grotto. I said a few prayers and walked around this beautiful place. Trees, smell of fresh cut grass, open fields, and suddenly I was at peace with all this PCa mess. Don't mind admitting I had a meltdown, but re-grouped and got home. Where the rest of this journey takes me who knows, but I am glad to take it with all of my Forum brothers ( and sisters) by my side. Warmest Regards, MM",

      "Content": "Flag: I would echo what Chuck just said: Thank u for your service to our country. My 2 cents: I would try and get a second opinion on your clinical staging. With a G7 (4+3) you might find yourself not being a T1C. Not trying to scare you at all, but I started out this mess as a G8, T1C. On second opinion I was a G7, (4+3) T2c. U can see by my signature where I ended up. Many times these doctors just don't know the clinical staging. Perhaps some sort of enhanced imaging would help you out. I wish I would have done that.

With a G7 (4+3) you might find yourself not being a T1C. Not trying to scare you at all, but I started out this mess as a G8, T1C. On second opinion I was a G7, (4+3) T2c. U can see by my signature where I ended up. Many times these doctors just don't know the clinical staging. Perhaps some sort of enhanced imaging would help you out. I wish I would have done that.

      "Content": "To all my forum brothers: Just wanted to say hello to all and let everyone know my SRT was completed on 8/5/16. I want to thank all of u for the kindness and support that has been directed at me. Of course, also the technical knowledge of helping me develop a game plan. I got to ring the \"bell\" 3 times, as is the tradition at UC. All the techs and doctors came out and gave me a round of applause, which I felt kind of strange about. It was I that should have been applauding them, and I did. I hugged and thanked each one of them, brought all of them a few parting gifts, and when I spoke I started to get choked up. Could not finish my words, so just kind of thankfully bowed my head and left. Such a great team, I felt fortunate to be in their care. SE have not been all bad, some bowel and urinary issues that will go away in about 6-8 weeks. I was >90% dry going in, and for the most part have stayed that way. I am about 1/2 pad per day. So, I guess that might be one bullet I dodged. I did not celebrate on that Friday, right after I drove to a religious place near my home and went to the grotto. I said a few prayers and walked around this beautiful place. Trees, smell of fresh cut grass, open fields, and suddenly I was at peace with all this PCa mess. Don't mind admitting I had a meltdown, but re-grouped and got home. Where the rest of this journey takes me who knows, but I am glad to take it with all of my Forum brothers ( and sisters) by my side. Warmest Regards, MM",

      "Content": "Mike: It is ok to feel blue. It is ok to feel anyway that u want, this PCa business is a life changing event for many of us. I would be concerned if u didn't feel a bit down at the beginning of this ....mess! Sorry to hear about the additional news. With possible SVI and larger volume of cores/cancer involved, this moves you into a higher risk category. This forum, for whatever reason, has more men with surgery than any other treatment choice. Nothing wrong with that. However, as a higher risk patient who is now looking at multiple treatment modalities, I would be looking to lessen the SE of gaining a cure. I have been thru all three. Read about what has occurred with me. If you are going to need radiation, u might want to check out just starting with it at the beginning. Surgery+radiation+ ADT has given me the worst of all worlds. ( in terms of SE) I was doing just fine after surgery, until SRT/ADT came into the picture. With the amount of cancer u are now looking at, there may be more in there than just a G7 (4+3). Surgery will tell u that, but it probably won't change your treatment path. Not with your other risk factors. I have no horse in this race. Just a forum brother who has been thru the ringer, and if I would have known what I was going to have to go thru, I might have looked into the following study. All that said, I seem to be on the correct track, and I am grateful that I may have an opportunity for a cure. It's a long road, hang tough. MM https://pcnrv.blogspot.com/2017/02/f...brt-bt-is.html",

      "Content": "Hello PCH: Welcome to the forum. Your case is a bit puzzling, being that u had surgery and it was a true G6. True G6 has never been found to metastasize. Metastasize is different than people using the word spread. G6 can spread locally, ( get into the surrounding tissue, prostate bed) without metastasizing. Since my Dx, I have read study after study, and I can't find a case of a treated ( true) G6 ending someone's life. You did have positive margins, and as my RO said from the University of Chicago \"once the cancer has left the prostate gland, your gleason score becomes irrelevant\". ( in terms of having to be treated) In all honesty, as I sit here and look at your PSA, your trend started to become apparent back in Jan. of 2012. In another thread on here, I just posted a link to SRT, and how one's PSA has an effect on outcomes. I will go back and get it for u, and post it in a bit. My guess is that u have something sitting locally , which can be cured by SRT. You may not have to engage in ADT. Lucky u! To answer your last question, I would be acting....yesterday. Found this for you to read from noted pathologist Jonathan Epstein, should make u feel better. Epstein comments: Good News for Men with Gleason Score 6 \"In other news, Epstein and colleagues recently took a closer look at the behavior of Gleason score 6 prostate cancer; their findings were published in the American Journal of Surgical Pathology. Although Gleason score 6 cancer is considered slow-growing and not aggressive, it has been found \u0096 rarely \u0096 in studies of prostate specimens after radical prostatectomy, to have spread outside the prostate. Could Gleason 6 cancer ever spread to the pelvic lymph nodes? Good news: The answer is no. \"We performed a search of the radical prostatectomy databases at four large academic centers,\" says Epstein. \"In more than 14,000 radical prostatectomies, there was not a single case of a Gleason score 6 tumor ever spreading to lymph nodes.\" It takes a Gleason score of 7 or higher for prostate cancer to become aggressive enough to spread far beyond the prostate. Under the microscope, Gleason score 6 cells appear uniform, \"and they have a more predictable, excellent prognosis,\" Epstein notes. Gleason score 6 disease has such a good reputation as being \"indolent\" \u0096 slow-growing and well behaved, as cancers go \u0096 among pathologists that some of them have questioned whether it should still be considered cancer. Yes it should, Epstein says. One important reason why is that the biopsy Gleason score is often adjusted after radical prostatectomy, when the prostate is studied by a pathologist, \"because the biopsy often underestimates disease grade and extent.\" Also, \"if men think that Gleason 6 tumors are not cancer, this could result in a missed opportunity for cure.\"",

      "Content": "Hello MRJ. Just wanted to welcome you to the forum. Many great people on here who are more than willing to help you through this. You are not alone. I would start doing my homework, so pick up a copy of Dr. Patrick Walsh's book the \"Guide to surviving Prostate Cancer\". 3rd edition. Given your PSA and G score, u are classified as high intermediate risk. My only concern would be your dominant pattern 4. But, u won't know anything until the final report is in. ( after surgery). For now, let's just go with learning, asking questions, and having us support you in any way possible. To be fair, your G7 ( 4+3) could always be downgraded. And all PCa can be curable if it has not escaped the gland. Of course, many are cured whose PCa has escaped, but remained local. If you need to talk, send me a PM. This forum has your back. Best Regards, MM",

      "Content": "Hey All: First, thank u for the support in my prior posts before the biopsy. I will make a stats page as soon as I get the printed report. The damn printer was broken when I went in for the results. My biopsy was positive for PC in 9 of the 12 cores taken. 5 of the cores were 3+3=6 gleason. Please hang with me, I'm going from my notes. 4 cores were 4+4=8 Gleason. 3 were neg. My PSA on 9/12/15 was 5.9. Needless to say, when I heard Gleason 8, I kind of went into a trance. For now, I have started this at a well-respected hospital just outside Chicago. Love the uro. She gave me my info on the Partin Tables. Says the following: 59% chance contained to the prostate, 32% chance just outside the capsule, 6% chance it has gone to the seminal vesicles, and 3% chance it has gone to the Lymph nodes. Like I said, I was by myself when I got this news but the uro called me the next day and we talked on the phone. So I am sure this is correct. Cat scan and bone scan set for Monday the 12th. Uro says if all is good on those, I have a very good chance of a cure, ( surgery and possible radiation) depending on what happens. Also, suggests I get a second opinion. So, I am off to the University of Chicago Uro cancer team in another 2 weeks. ( When I get all my results and they can fit me in). Right now, my head is spinning and i'm doing a lot of pacing. I forgot to write down that % involvment aspect. I will include all on a stats page when I get the report. Maybe UC will review all this and have better news on the cores. Scared and freakin in the windy city. Congrats to chuck and pratoman on the good news. Pulling for u guys. I will keep u posted. Regards, John. Forgot to mention my current staging T1C",

      "Content": "Prato: I am thankful for people like you. Your technical contributions to this forum are invaluable, only exceeded by your kindness, compassion, and willingness to give back. To all the regulars on this site who always give 100% of themselves, thank you. I can assure you it does not go unnoticed. Chuck, thank u for everything. You do so much i would be typing for hours if I had to list it all. Today I was watching CNBC financial news and one of the regular contributors named Joe Terrernova ( sp. ? ) started to speak. But it was not about financial news. One year ago this day, he was discovered to have a lump or mass in his liver. He started telling this story on live TV at noon. I was not sure where he was going with this. They thought it was cancer, but after several tests, etc, it appears to be just a benign mass. He spoke about being thankful. His wife, his children, etc. Then he said words that will stay with me forever. \"What am I thankful for this holiday? the next 5 minutes.\" Kinda put things in perspective for me. Happy Thanksgiving to all. MM",

      "Content": "Hey All: First, thank u for the support in my prior posts before the biopsy. I will make a stats page as soon as I get the printed report. The damn printer was broken when I went in for the results. My biopsy was positive for PC in 9 of the 12 cores taken. 5 of the cores were 3+3=6 gleason. Please hang with me, I'm going from my notes. 4 cores were 4+4=8 Gleason. 3 were neg. My PSA on 9/12/15 was 5.9. Needless to say, when I heard Gleason 8, I kind of went into a trance. For now, I have started this at a well-respected hospital just outside Chicago. Love the uro. She gave me my info on the Partin Tables. Says the following: 59% chance contained to the prostate, 32% chance just outside the capsule, 6% chance it has gone to the seminal vesicles, and 3% chance it has gone to the Lymph nodes. Like I said, I was by myself when I got this news but the uro called me the next day and we talked on the phone. So I am sure this is correct. Cat scan and bone scan set for Monday the 12th. Uro says if all is good on those, I have a very good chance of a cure, ( surgery and possible radiation) depending on what happens. Also, suggests I get a second opinion. So, I am off to the University of Chicago Uro cancer team in another 2 weeks. ( When I get all my results and they can fit me in). Right now, my head is spinning and i'm doing a lot of pacing. I forgot to write down that % involvment aspect. I will include all on a stats page when I get the report. Maybe UC will review all this and have better news on the cores. Scared and freakin in the windy city. Congrats to chuck and pratoman on the good news. Pulling for u guys. I will keep u posted. Regards, John. Forgot to mention my current staging T1C",

      "Content": "John4803: Are they adding the Chemo because of the positive nodes? Standard of care for pT3bNO has been ( assuming they had surgery) ART/SRT, along with up to 2 years of ADT. I received this answer from 3 different doctors. I have also noticed that some RO/ MO are also throwing Zytiga in the mix with ADT. The studies to which you refer have been around since I started treatment...wondering what has changed. You are correct, G8-10 can be highly predictive of micro-mets. When I asked my uro if SRT/ADT could kill off stray cells, his answer was...\"We think it can\". But no conclusive evidence. Ask your RO the question as to why the standard of care may or may not have changed. Most of the pT3BNO on this forum have had the triple whammy of Surgery, SRT, ADT. Not many chemo additions. Good luck, MM",

      "Content": "Hello Prato: Nice to hear from you, not so nice that u are now facing SRT and/or a decision on what to do. One thing is clear, u have a trend, and it's not going away. I am sure u are aware of studies that tell us your PSA level is the single most important factor in the potential outcome of SRT, more so than any other pathological feature. Get yourself into the \"very early group\" and act no greater than .1. With your pathology, this will all be behind you soon. As u know, i have had the triple whammy...I got thru SRT, so will you. I don't want to go into all my issues, they probably would not apply to your case. My side effects are a result of all 3 treatment modalities, and your situation is quite different. Don't overthink, don't over analyze, just do it. Cancer takes no days off. BTW...I have not forgotten how good u were to me during my bad days post surgery. Please know I am here for u, in whatever way I may be needed. Best Regards, MM",

U don't want to c it go any higher, but see what the next test brings. It's still pretty low. CC33: why are you saying the RT will work for only 2-3 years? Lack of early HT? No chance at a cure? His Post-op PSA suggested it could be local. Ur thoughts on this comment? Thanks, MM",

I am a stage 3 and have had many dark moments, most during the initial parts of my treatment. Seemed surreal at times. Kept wanting to wake up from a bad dream, but it was/ is reality. Things will get better with time, and with each day the urge to stand up and fight and not give in or up will return. As brother MF has said, tell us a bit about you history, etc. I am sure others will be along to extend a warm welcome. Hang in, stay the course, and don't give up the ship. You are not alone.

That's not enough of a rise to make any judgements at this time. Why in the world would your oncologist want to take a PSA during radiation treatment? Would be of zero value, no sense at all. Why no HT here? Ur stats are very similar to mine. HT combined with SRT produce results 50% better than either one alone. Early ADT kills local and stray cells, before they get out of hand. Did u have ADT? Not sure where u r receiving treatment, very surprised and concerned that u have not thrown everything at this. Since our stats are alike, I will leave u with what my MO at the university of Chicago told me. It may be a tough ride, but your chances of survival are excellent. I'll go with that. Best, MM",

Men who have been afflicted with this terrible disease, and who have the benefit of walking in the path u now find yourself in. I don't blame you for following your doctors advise, their credentials seem impeccable. There is no use worrying about the past. What can you do from here? I would demand some answers. Become pro-active in your case. Something is wrong here. Could you provide the exact details of your case? Your PSA seems very high for a G7. What was your pathology? When your 4W PSA came out why did that not raise any concerns? By your 16W PSA....and still nothing. If u can create a signature, we can help. Remember, you are not alone. Don't worry about what was, let's move forward and find some answers. Good Luck, MM",

They say to only do it once to gain a feel for the correct muscles.( i.e, the pelvic floor muscles) \" Doing this exercise while you are urinating can cause problems emptying your bladder and increases your risk for urinary tract infection\". My surgeon has me doing 10x10 for 100 per day in preparation for my surgery. Told me to get the correct muscles, and it takes some practice. Sitting, standing, etc. did not matter. Hope this helps.

There was a Atlantic Ocean of difference between the PCP, the regular urologist, and the surgeon. Bottom line... have the surgeon do it.

You just had a major operation, and it takes awhile before all systems are go. Remember, don't lift anything for 8-10 weeks and just stay patient. You will get there. Here's hoping for a clean path report and best wishes for a full cure and recovery. Regards, MM",

My last Lupron shot wore off on May 15th, 2018. My results: 12/12/18....Free T 42.8...Std Range...47-244. Total T.....262....Std Range...300-720. Not sure how to feel about all this, I am still having a few hot flashes at nite, and very little sexual interest. A touch, but not much. I guess my next uPSA will be a bit more important than I first suspected, kind of nervous. Hoping for good news for u, best of luck. MM",

Common sense has taken a back seat to political panels who don't have a damn clue what they are doing. What the hell can a simple blood test hurt? And THEN decide if additional steps need be taken. Simply Bleeping amazing!!",

      "Content": "Hey All: First, thank u for the support in my prior posts before the biopsy. I will make a stats page as soon as I get the printed report. The damn printer was broken when I went in for the results. My biopsy was positive for PC in 9 of the 12 cores taken. 5 of the cores were 3+3=6 gleason. Please hang with me, I'm going from my notes. 4 cores were 4+4=8 Gleason. 3 were neg. My PSA on 9/12/15 was 5.9. Needless to say, when I heard Gleason 8, I kind of went into a trance. For now, I have started this at a well-respected hospital just outside Chicago. Love the uro. She gave me my info on the Partin Tables. Says the following: 59% chance contained to the prostate, 32% chance just outside the capsule, 6% chance it has gone to the seminal vesicles, and 3% chance it has gone to the Lymph nodes. Like I said, I was by myself when I got this news but the uro called me the next day and we talked on the phone. So I am sure this is correct. Cat scan and bone scan set for Monday the 12th. Uro says if all is good on those, I have a very good chance of a cure, ( surgery and possible radiation) depending on what happens. Also, suggests I get a second opinion. So, I am off to the University of Chicago Uro cancer team in another 2 weeks. ( When I get all my results and they can fit me in). Right now, my head is spinning and i'm doing a lot of pacing. I forgot to write down that % involvment aspect. I will include all on a stats page when I get the report. Maybe UC will review all this and have better news on the cores. Scared and freakin in the windy city. Congrats to chuck and pratoman on the good news. Pulling for u guys. I will keep u posted. Regards, John. Forgot to mention my current staging T1C",

I was never given the chance to really heal, and post SRT my continence just kept getting worse. Not so much at my job ( desk), but In everyday life. Especially having to do with exercise, golf, any sort of exertion. I went thru PT, Kegels, etc.... nothing has worked. I\u0092ve probably done thousands of Kegels, just didn\u0092t work for me. What the doctors do not tell us is that this CAN happen. It\u0092s been 3 years for me, going to have the AUS 800 surgery at Loyola. You are not alone.... let me know if I can help. MM",

      "Content": "Mike: While I applaud your pro-active stance, right now u don't need to do anything. Your numbers could not be any better. Given your pT3b status, I would be testing every 8-12 weeks, and keeping track of my PSA in that manner. ( Even if I had to pay the cost myself) I have read the studies that you have referenced in your letter to Dr. Shah. For the 0.03 threshold that you mention, I do not think it matters on which PSA test it happens on. It will just be telling u that it is time to get your ducks in a row....or do so before hand. In my view the words adjuvant and salvage really are not that much different. Bottom line.....proceed when your PSA tells u so. Use the uPSA assay, and IF your psa should begin to rise, pull the trigger sooner rather than later. Standard of care for your case would be EBRT (IMRT), (IGRT). Today's radiation ( Varian Rapid Arc, or VMAT if I am remembering correctly) will get the job done, and is the radiation that most insurance company's will approve. I do not see why proton therapy would be any better for a salvage situation. BTW...with surgery and radiation, some of the side effects are hard to avoid. The price us high risk guys pay to keep our feet north of the grass. Be grateful if u can avoid ADT and slavage....for now u are doing well. Best, MM",

Neither supplements or God had anything to do with it being contained. You may just have been lucky, or caught it in the nick of time. G8 is serious. Ductal is serious. You need to be seeing a PCa specialist who handles these type of cases. Not really clear if you knew about this at biopsy, or what your timeline is. Your scans and tests, which you say are negative now, may not stay that way over time. Your initial high PSA, G8, and ductal PCa are telling you that this game may be far from over. For now, congrats on the 3 month test. I would be consulting a MO and RO to secure opinions about your status moving forward. Best of luck, MM",

In all my readings and speaking with surgery patients, I have never heard of any advanced imaging taking place like you are suggesting. Are you sure you understood that correctly? Unless you have a prior medical issue, I am not sure what they would be looking at. The recovery period for surgery is about 8 weeks. ( at least before you may start normal activities) To be honest, my hernia operation 5 years ago was MUCH more painful than the RALP. Many on here have had surgery, if u have specific questions, fire away. I am wondering if they would be looking at Prostate Anastomosis, the reconnection of the bladder and the urethra? Best Wishes for your complete recovery. MM",

      "Content": "Red: There has been quite a bit of discussion and debate on the diet and supplement issue, and it's potential to halt the progression of PCa, and as you have asked, to keep PSA low. In all my research and studying, I have found very little if any proof that either one of the two have any significant effects on PCa progression. FWIW, my MO at the UC told me to do the following: 1. Pomegranate in pill form. 2. Soy products in food form 3. Green Tea 4. Broccoli All this being said, is it really helping me? Hell if I know. I also take Curcumin (750mg) Calcium/Vit. D3. For your upcoming ART/SRT, I would not be taking anything until the sessions are completed. Some supplements can actually have an adverse effect. Advice: do nothing until it's over. As for diet, it's always good to have a balanced one. It can't hurt, but I have not seen the science behind it for what you are asking.

      "Content": "Red: There has been quite a bit of discussion and debate on the diet and supplement issue, and it's potential to halt the progression of PCa, and as you have asked, to keep PSA low. In all my research and studying, I have found very little if any proof that either one of the two have any significant effects on PCa progression. FWIW, my MO at the UC told me to do the following: 1. Pomegranate in pill form. 2. Soy products in food form 3. Green Tea 4. Broccoli All this being said, is it really helping me? Hell if I know. I also take Curcumin (750mg) Calcium/Vit. D3. For your upcoming ART/SRT, I would not be taking anything until the sessions are completed. Some supplements can actually have an adverse effect. Advice: do nothing until it's over. As for diet, it's always good to have a balanced one. It can't hurt, but I have not seen the science behind it for what you are asking.

      "Content": "Hello Rotty: Welcome to the Forum. Sorry u are here, let's hope your stay is a short one. Answering your questions: 1. Most people who post here are men who have been there, done that. Very few if any doctors. 2. There are several signs of PCa that doctors look for. But please keep in mind that many of them could also be medical issues that are NOT PCa. ( BPH, Urinary Tract infections, Painful Bladder, Postatitis, among them) 3. I would go to a Uro for all opinions regarding PCa. Most family doctors or PCP don't know much about PCa. You will learn far more from this forum than any PCP or family doctor. Your PSA is a bit high for someone your age. Your Uro was correct to give you some antibiotics, you were incorrect not to take them as prescribed. Bad idea. I would agree with your current doctor that u should be considering a biopsy. It is the only way to rule out or confirm PCa. \"So I started looking into this and found that a lot of reputable medical people don't want a biopsy this soon into the deal, Also I had a doctor tell me they dont even do the PSA any more due to the un-reliable ness of it. The original doctor also told me that he has patients with a PSA of 15 that have no cancer.\" If this is the advice you are receiving, I would get several more opinions. PSA testing has saved my life, and these statements in my view are complete nonsense! Example....Yes, some men with a PSA of 15 may not have cancer. So what? What the hell does that have to do with your situation? PSA is a simple blood test, this BS about it not being reliable? Tell that to the men who followed this advice and found themselves in a position where a potential cure was no longer possible. Perhaps others will chime in, that's my take. Best to u, MM",

My last Lupron shot wore off on May 15th, 2018. My results: 12/12/18....Free T 42.8...Std Range...47-244. Total T.....262....Std Range...300-720. Not sure how to feel about all this, I am still having a few hot flashes at nite, and very little sexual interest. A touch, but not much. I guess my next uPSA will be a bit more important than I first suspected, kind of nervous. Hoping for good news for u, best of luck. MM",

I went thru it this summer, and if u want to get some exact information, I have all the particulars that I would be willing to share. PM me if needed. Don't worry.

      "Content": "Hello MRJ. Just wanted to welcome you to the forum. Many great people on here who are more than willing to help you through this. You are not alone. I would start doing my homework, so pick up a copy of Dr. Patrick Walsh's book the \"Guide to surviving Prostate Cancer\". 3rd edition. Given your PSA and G score, u are classified as high intermediate risk. My only concern would be your dominant pattern 4. But, u won't know anything until the final report is in. ( after surgery). For now, let's just go with learning, asking questions, and having us support you in any way possible. To be fair, your G7 ( 4+3) could always be downgraded. And all PCa can be curable if it has not escaped the gland. Of course, many are cured whose PCa has escaped, but remained local. If you need to talk, send me a PM. This forum has your back. Best Regards, MM",

      "Content": "Josey: I would agree with MF, as to what he believes your doctors are thinking. They must be factoring in a high PSA, and the 4+3...No reason to be pessimistic, the ADT and combined hormonal's could knock out any stray cells floating around. They think it kills stray cells, but are not 100% sure. It should also help with the existing tumor burden in the prostate. My guess is with that many positive cores, they must feel there is more to deal with than your biopsy would suggest. All that being said, for now all you know for sure is you are a G7, with a psa of 22. Nothing is confined, until it's confined. You still have a decent shot at a cure, so go with what they are telling you. Hang in there, your case is not that bad. Remember as Josey said....\"dying ain't much of a livin boy\"..good luck. MM",

First I would find the nearest church and thank the good lord, and next I would fly to my favorite party spot with all my friends and spend 90% of my net worth on recreational drugs, hookers, and alcohol. The other 10% I would probably waste. I don't think I would use the cure word, this is cancer and only time will tell. But your doctor did use the word likely, and I would agree. To answer your margin question, u have what is referred to as a focal margin. Generally < 2/3 mm. This means there were only small bits of cancer seen at the ink, and that they probably got it all on the cut out. Congrats!! MM",

      "Content": "Hello Rooster: Welcome to the forum, and best of luck in your upcoming surgery. In all my readings and speaking with surgery patients, I have never heard of any advanced imaging taking place like you are suggesting. Are you sure you understood that correctly? Unless you have a prior medical issue, I am not sure what they would be looking at. The recovery period for surgery is about 8 weeks. ( at least before you may start normal activities) To be honest, my hernia operation 5 years ago was MUCH more painful than the RALP. Many on here have had surgery, if u have specific questions, fire away. I am wondering if they would be looking at Prostate Anastomosis, the reconnection of the bladder and the urethra? Best Wishes for your complete recovery. MM",

Sorry to hear about having additional surgery. Nice to hear that things are looking up, and that your SRT will not be affected. I saw the term \" hanging tough\" today, it had a picture of u!

      "Content": "Hello jgs: Sorry to hear what you Father has had to go thru. Does this story make sense? No, it does not. Who started the PCa treatment? Was he treated with anything other than RT? Any type of HT? What are his statistics as it pertains to the PC? PSA, G score, any type of diagnostic testing. Given his age, I assume that he did not have surgery option. Tell us more about his PCA, all you can remember. \"This means to me that his pancreas is no longer working correctly or at all. Is this something that happens during prostate treatment? I cannot seem to find any other instances of this\". I would agree with u. And I do not ever recall hearing anything like this. You need to pressure your RO who started this and get some answers. Call us in 2018 if anything changes? Jesus. What the hell is going on with his PCa treatment? Be firm and get some answers. Perhaps when we see his stats, others will be chiming. Best, MM",

      "Content": "Hello Akhlak: Welcome to the Forum. Based on what you have told us, I would say that you are being over treated. With that being said, you are in a different country, so I can only comment on what the standard of care would be if u lived in the United States. You have G6, which is the LEAST aggressive form of PCa. IMO, there is no need for you to be starting HT. With 6 positive cores out of 10, you will probably need some treatment, but you have plenty of time to research your options. Both surgery and radiation could offer you a cure, both with equal rates of success. I would pump the brakes on HT, and get a second opinion. HT has a lot of nasty SE, and if possible, you will want to avoid it. I am sure others will be chiming in soon... Best of luck, MM",

To all the regulars on this site who always give 100% of themselves, thank you. I can assure you it does not go unnoticed. Chuck, thank u for everything. You do so much i would be typing for hours if I had to list it all. Today I was watching CNBC financial news and one of the regular contributors named Joe Terrernova ( sp. ? ) started to speak. But it was not about financial news. One year ago this day, he was discovered to have a lump or mass in his liver. He started telling this story on live TV at noon. I was not sure where he was going with this. They thought it was cancer, but after several tests, etc, it appears to be just a benign mass. He spoke about being thankful. His wife, his children, etc. Then he said words that will stay with me forever. \"What am I thankful for this holiday? the next 5 minutes.\" Kinda put things in perspective for me. Happy Thanksgiving to all. MM",

Chuck has done his usual fine job of explaining the basics. With high risk cancer, I would be going to the top cancer center that I could find. Where do u live? I would be speaking to both a surgeon and a RO immediately. I do not think a MO is needed at this point. Let me know how I can help. Don't waste anytime. Best, MM",

      "Content": "Jim215: As you know, u are my favorite on this forum. We are on the same page. My comments were not based on someone having PSA \"anxiety\". Pardon my straight talk. I think the entire PSA \"anxiety\" thing is way overrated. So we all have anxiety? Is that going to change the issue? Our numbers are what they are. No amount of \"anxiety\" or worry will change that. My comments to Gene were based on what he has already done in terms of his treatment. Like myself, it has been damn the torpedoes. If his PSA starts to rise from here, it will make little difference if he finds out at .1 or.2 or.3 etc. Both Gene and I, to just tell it like it is, are basically out of curative options. Talking about Gene, I am talking about myself. Unless there is something else out there I am not aware of. If my PSA starts to rise, I will probably be on HT for the rest of my life. Or as my RO says, it's her job to keep me alive for the next 10-15 years, then benefit from the new drugs and treatments that are in the pipeline. Neither Gene nor I know if we are cured, but a UPSA vs. a standard one is not going to make a difference in terms of HT/ADT starting etc. Hope I am making some sense. Hope u are doing well, always a pleasure to hear from u. Nobody gives the analogies better than u! You got to know when to hold, when to fold, when to walk away, when to run...... Geez, I think u know all that!! Best, MM",

      "Content": "To all my forum brothers: Just wanted to say hello to all and let everyone know my SRT was completed on 8/5/16. I want to thank all of u for the kindness and support that has been directed at me. Of course, also the technical knowledge of helping me develop a game plan. I got to ring the \"bell\" 3 times, as is the tradition at UC. All the techs and doctors came out and gave me a round of applause, which I felt kind of strange about. It was I that should have been applauding them, and I did. I hugged and thanked each one of them, brought all of them a few parting gifts, and when I spoke I started to get choked up. Could not finish my words, so just kind of thankfully bowed my head and left. Such a great team, I felt fortunate to be in their care. SE have not been all bad, some bowel and urinary issues that will go away in about 6-8 weeks. I was >90% dry going in, and for the most part have stayed that way. I am about 1/2 pad per day. So, I guess that might be one bullet I dodged. I did not celebrate on that Friday, right after I drove to a religious place near my home and went to the grotto. I said a few prayers and walked around this beautiful place. Trees, smell of fresh cut grass, open fields, and suddenly I was at peace with all this PCa mess. Don't mind admitting I had a meltdown, but re-grouped and got home. Where the rest of this journey takes me who knows, but I am glad to take it with all of my Forum brothers ( and sisters) by my side. Warmest Regards, MM",

      "Content": "Jim215: As you know, u are my favorite on this forum. We are on the same page. My comments were not based on someone having PSA \"anxiety\". Pardon my straight talk. I think the entire PSA \"anxiety\" thing is way overrated. So we all have anxiety? Is that going to change the issue? Our numbers are what they are. No amount of \"anxiety\" or worry will change that. My comments to Gene were based on what he has already done in terms of his treatment. Like myself, it has been damn the torpedoes. If his PSA starts to rise from here, it will make little difference if he finds out at .1 or.2 or.3 etc. Both Gene and I, to just tell it like it is, are basically out of curative options. Talking about Gene, I am talking about myself. Unless there is something else out there I am not aware of. If my PSA starts to rise, I will probably be on HT for the rest of my life. Or as my RO says, it's her job to keep me alive for the next 10-15 years, then benefit from the new drugs and treatments that are in the pipeline. Neither Gene nor I know if we are cured, but a UPSA vs. a standard one is not going to make a difference in terms of HT/ADT starting etc. Hope I am making some sense. Hope u are doing well, always a pleasure to hear from u. Nobody gives the analogies better than u! You got to know when to hold, when to fold, when to walk away, when to run...... Geez, I think u know all that!! Best, MM",

      "Content": "Hello m. First, your PSA of .08 at this stage of the game is not the end of the world. I would wait to see what develops over the next few tests. That's not enough of a rise to make any judgements at this time. Why in the world would your oncologist want to take a PSA during radiation treatment? Would be of zero value, no sense at all. Why no HT here? Ur stats are very similar to mine. HT combined with SRT produce results 50% better than either one alone. Early ADT kills local and stray cells, before they get out of hand. Did u have ADT? Not sure where u r receiving treatment, very surprised and concerned that u have not thrown everything at this. Since our stats are alike, I will leave u with what my MO at the university of Chicago told me. It may be a tough ride, but your chances of survival are excellent. I'll go with that. Best, MM",

The more it goes up, the worse the odds. This is a case of some uros who have acquired the annoying habit of waiting, and waiting, and waiting. U have shown a clear trend, I would be concerned enough to get a plan in action. Good Luck, MM",

      "Content": "Rascally: Hello, and welcome to the forum. We are here to help. Yes, there are many of us with similar stats who would be more than willing to share our thoughts and experiences. First thing u should know. G9 is serious business. In your case perhaps even more so, given that your dad's PSA was only 2.7. When u have a PSA that low, and a high grade tumor, it can be even more aggressive. It is not giving off much PSA. Not trying to scare u, just wanting u to get your dad moving towards a treatment decision. Let's see what the bone and cat scan say, and go from there. Anger and a hopeless feeling are normal. On a positive note, any PCa that is contained can be cured. ( and even some that r not) Today's medical advances in PCa are mind-boggling. Your dad has every chance to be around for many, many years. Just get to a top notch cancer facility, and get a plan in place. Let us know how we can help. Once you get the results of the tests, get back to us. Hang in there, u are not alone. Best wishes, MM",

My question now is, why are you waiting to begin secondary treatment? You have a ticking time bomb inside you, and you are not seeing the doctor until August? You should be in line for both HT and SRT. You should have already started the process, and your MO and RO should have explained this to u. The chances of side effects from secondary treatment are 100%. No way to avoid them. In order to have any chance at a cure, you need to act now. Wishing you the best, MM",

      "Content": "Hey All: First, thank u for the support in my prior posts before the biopsy. I will make a stats page as soon as I get the printed report. The damn printer was broken when I went in for the results. My biopsy was positive for PC in 9 of the 12 cores taken. 5 of the cores were 3+3=6 gleason. Please hang with me, I'm going from my notes. 4 cores were 4+4=8 Gleason. 3 were neg. My PSA on 9/12/15 was 5.9. Needless to say, when I heard Gleason 8, I kind of went into a trance. For now, I have started this at a well-respected hospital just outside Chicago. Love the uro. She gave me my info on the Partin Tables. Says the following: 59% chance contained to the prostate, 32% chance just outside the capsule, 6% chance it has gone to the seminal vesicles, and 3% chance it has gone to the Lymph nodes. Like I said, I was by myself when I got this news but the uro called me the next day and we talked on the phone. So I am sure this is correct. Cat scan and bone scan set for Monday the 12th. Uro says if all is good on those, I have a very good chance of a cure, ( surgery and possible radiation) depending on what happens. Also, suggests I get a second opinion. So, I am off to the University of Chicago Uro cancer team in another 2 weeks. ( When I get all my results and they can fit me in). Right now, my head is spinning and i'm doing a lot of pacing. I forgot to write down that % involvment aspect. I will include all on a stats page when I get the report. Maybe UC will review all this and have better news on the cores. Scared and freakin in the windy city. Congrats to chuck and pratoman on the good news. Pulling for u guys. I will keep u posted. Regards, John. Forgot to mention my current staging T1C",

      "Content": "Hey All: First, thank u for the support in my prior posts before the biopsy. I will make a stats page as soon as I get the printed report. The damn printer was broken when I went in for the results. My biopsy was positive for PC in 9 of the 12 cores taken. 5 of the cores were 3+3=6 gleason. Please hang with me, I'm going from my notes. 4 cores were 4+4=8 Gleason. 3 were neg. My PSA on 9/12/15 was 5.9. Needless to say, when I heard Gleason 8, I kind of went into a trance. For now, I have started this at a well-respected hospital just outside Chicago. Love the uro. She gave me my info on the Partin Tables. Says the following: 59% chance contained to the prostate, 32% chance just outside the capsule, 6% chance it has gone to the seminal vesicles, and 3% chance it has gone to the Lymph nodes. Like I said, I was by myself when I got this news but the uro called me the next day and we talked on the phone. So I am sure this is correct. Cat scan and bone scan set for Monday the 12th. Uro says if all is good on those, I have a very good chance of a cure, ( surgery and possible radiation) depending on what happens. Also, suggests I get a second opinion. So, I am off to the University of Chicago Uro cancer team in another 2 weeks. ( When I get all my results and they can fit me in). Right now, my head is spinning and i'm doing a lot of pacing. I forgot to write down that % involvment aspect. I will include all on a stats page when I get the report. Maybe UC will review all this and have better news on the cores. Scared and freakin in the windy city. Congrats to chuck and pratoman on the good news. Pulling for u guys. I will keep u posted. Regards, John. Forgot to mention my current staging T1C",

      "Content": "Hey Rin: The fact that your first ever biopsy was negative may or may not mean anything. Several of the forum brothers have had negative biopsy's on the first round, only to have additional issues as time passes on. Meaning their PSA kept going up and wanting to find out the reason discovered PCa. If u did not know, a standard 12 core biopsy only covers about 10% of the entire gland. It is kind of like sticking a needle in a haystack. This is the reason that many Gleason scores can change, etc. Not all nodules are PCa, but if its hard, it more than likely is. You are 73. A PSA of 4.7 is not exactly screaming high. Perhaps some additional testing with advanced imaging of suspected areas is in order. You can also have one of several conditions that would elevate your PSA that have nothing to do with PCa. Press your doctor, and keep us informed. Best, MM",

The negative bone scan is great news. He will probably start some sort of ADT right away. That will stop any cancer in its tracks while the decision making process is getting in order. If his pain persists and he can't function, call the urologist and get some answers. Your dad needs a advocate, and it looks like he is lucky to have you as his daughter. Where do u live? Others will be chiming in soon with words of advice and encouragement. If comfortable, create a signature of your dads history with PSA, biopsy, any treatments, results, family history, etc. Best, MM",

Several of the forum brothers have had negative biopsy's on the first round, only to have additional issues as time passes on.

      "Content": "Mike: While I applaud your pro-active stance, right now u don't need to do anything. Your numbers could not be any better. Given your pT3b status, I would be testing every 8-12 weeks, and keeping track of my PSA in that manner. ( Even if I had to pay the cost myself) I have read the studies that you have referenced in your letter to Dr. Shah. For the 0.03 threshold that you mention, I do not think it matters on which PSA test it happens on. It will just be telling u that it is time to get your ducks in a row....or do so before hand. In my view the words adjuvant and salvage really are not that much different. Bottom line.....proceed when your PSA tells u so. Use the uPSA assay, and IF your psa should begin to rise, pull the trigger sooner rather than later. Standard of care for your case would be EBRT (IMRT), (IGRT). Today's radiation ( Varian Rapid Arc, or VMAT if I am remembering correctly) will get the job done, and is the radiation that most insurance company's will approve. I do not see why proton therapy would be any better for a salvage situation. BTW...with surgery and radiation, some of the side effects are hard to avoid. The price us high risk guys pay to keep our feet north of the grass. Be grateful if u can avoid ADT and slavage....for now u are doing well. Best, MM",

If u could post a signature regarding your treatment history and pathology report, it would give us a better idea of where you stand. Neither supplements or God had anything to do with it being contained. You may just have been lucky, or caught it in the nick of time. G8 is serious. Ductal is serious. You need to be seeing a PCa specialist who handles these type of cases. Not really clear if you knew about this at biopsy, or what your timeline is. Your scans and tests, which you say are negative now, may not stay that way over time. Your initial high PSA, G8, and ductal PCa are telling you that this game may be far from over. For now, congrats on the 3 month test. I would be consulting a MO and RO to secure opinions about your status moving forward. Best of luck, MM",

Ok, the good news...I would like to stand and give your doctors a standing ovation. This is exactly the type of treatment ( aggressive style) that your case needs. Standard protocol is just what you are doing for a higher risk case. And your doctors are throwing everything at it including the kitchen sink. Well Done!!! You are to be applauded for taking this approach that may cure u. With a G9, positive margins, and +LN, I would be going all out. I assume your ADT will be lasting between 6 months and 2 years. IMHO, I would go the longer route. I would rather find out that 2 years was to long than 6 months being not enough. Congrats on your PSA. That is great news!! It shows that your body and cancer are responding to the treatments. Those are great numbers. For now I would not worry about being cured. I would just take one day at a time. When will you or I be cured? Ask each one of us in 10 years!!. My Medonc and RO have told me its there job to keep me around for 10-15 years. They say by then with the advances and treatments that are coming down the pike, there will be more drugs, etc. to keep guys like us around for many more years. Could we be cured, sure. But even if not we will have a long life ahead of us. This is a long road, hang tough. congrats on facing this head on. Best Wishes, MM",

Ok, the good news...I would like to stand and give your doctors a standing ovation. This is exactly the type of treatment ( aggressive style) that your case needs. Standard protocol is just what you are doing for a higher risk case. And your doctors are throwing everything at it including the kitchen sink. Well Done!!! You are to be applauded for taking this approach that may cure u. With a G9, positive margins, and +LN, I would be going all out. I assume your ADT will be lasting between 6 months and 2 years. IMHO, I would go the longer route. I would rather find out that 2 years was to long than 6 months being not enough. Congrats on your PSA. That is great news!! It shows that your body and cancer are responding to the treatments. Those are great numbers. For now I would not worry about being cured. I would just take one day at a time. When will you or I be cured? Ask each one of us in 10 years!!. My Medonc and RO have told me its there job to keep me around for 10-15 years. They say by then with the advances and treatments that are coming down the pike, there will be more drugs, etc. to keep guys like us around for many more years. Could we be cured, sure. But even if not we will have a long life ahead of us. This is a long road, hang tough. congrats on facing this head on. Best Wishes, MM",

Several of the forum brothers have had negative biopsy's on the first round, only to have additional issues as time passes on.

      "Content": "Daddy's girl: Sorry to hear of your fathers difficult diagnosis. Given the your dads PCa is small cell, I would be looking to get treated at a major cancer cancer. You need a specialist who is well versed in this type of carcianoma, as this is not garden variety PCa. ( adenocarcinoma) If it has not spread to the LN or bones, you may still have a chance at a cure or at least a long durable remission. Many people with the more aggressive types of PCa use several treatment modalities to achieve cancer control. Seeing a RO is a great start, but make sure you start to develop a game plan. Time is not on your side. I'm sure a CT scan will be in order, and for now there is no telling what the pain is. It could be many things. Focus on getting to the right place and seeing the correct doctors. Don't lose hope, many people with advanced disease can live long lives with today's medical advances. Best, MM",

      "Content": "Hello C33: Welcome to the forum, sorry about you having to be here. Our cases are quite alike, the difference being the +LN. So here in the states, you would be pT3bN1. Ok, the good news...I would like to stand and give your doctors a standing ovation. This is exactly the type of treatment ( aggressive style) that your case needs. Standard protocol is just what you are doing for a higher risk case. And your doctors are throwing everything at it including the kitchen sink. Well Done!!! You are to be applauded for taking this approach that may cure u. With a G9, positive margins, and +LN, I would be going all out. I assume your ADT will be lasting between 6 months and 2 years. IMHO, I would go the longer route. I would rather find out that 2 years was to long than 6 months being not enough. Congrats on your PSA. That is great news!! It shows that your body and cancer are responding to the treatments. Those are great numbers. For now I would not worry about being cured. I would just take one day at a time. When will you or I be cured? Ask each one of us in 10 years!!. My Medonc and RO have told me its there job to keep me around for 10-15 years. They say by then with the advances and treatments that are coming down the pike, there will be more drugs, etc. to keep guys like us around for many more years. Could we be cured, sure. But even if not we will have a long life ahead of us. This is a long road, hang tough. congrats on facing this head on. Best Wishes, MM",

      "Content": "Hello C33: Welcome to the forum, sorry about you having to be here. Our cases are quite alike, the difference being the +LN. So here in the states, you would be pT3bN1. Ok, the good news...I would like to stand and give your doctors a standing ovation. This is exactly the type of treatment ( aggressive style) that your case needs. Standard protocol is just what you are doing for a higher risk case. And your doctors are throwing everything at it including the kitchen sink. Well Done!!! You are to be applauded for taking this approach that may cure u. With a G9, positive margins, and +LN, I would be going all out. I assume your ADT will be lasting between 6 months and 2 years. IMHO, I would go the longer route. I would rather find out that 2 years was to long than 6 months being not enough. Congrats on your PSA. That is great news!! It shows that your body and cancer are responding to the treatments. Those are great numbers. For now I would not worry about being cured. I would just take one day at a time. When will you or I be cured? Ask each one of us in 10 years!!. My Medonc and RO have told me its there job to keep me around for 10-15 years. They say by then with the advances and treatments that are coming down the pike, there will be more drugs, etc. to keep guys like us around for many more years. Could we be cured, sure. But even if not we will have a long life ahead of us. This is a long road, hang tough. congrats on facing this head on. Best Wishes, MM",

      "Content": "\" Most radiation oncologists use the \"Phoenix\" definition of biochemical (PSA) recurrence which is a PSA of nadir +2. So any increase less than 2 ng/ml over your lowest PSA since treatment is officially a bounce. The problem is knowing if your lowest PSA so far is really your nadir, which may not occur for two years or more after radiation. With your history of PSA fluctuations, it may be that you have some recalcitrant prostatitis going on too that may continue to complicate your ability to distinguish a bounce from a biochemical recurrence. I'm two years out and my PSA is still on a long-term declining trend with a few bounces along the way. My RO has a standard line of \"let's wait another 3 months and see what happens.\" It all depends on when those cancer cells come out of hibernation and decide to replicate, at which time the \"time bomb\" implanted by the radiation will kill them.\" To be clear, these are not my words. I found this for your benefit. If this in not appropriate, I am sure Chuck will address it. For those with RO as a primary treatment I found this for u to read....hope this helps. This does not apply to those of us who had surgery and then SRT. In my case my RO has stated \" we just want to see stability or lower\". Then is no Bounce to be considered. Good Luck, MM",

      "Content": "Tilly: Welcome back to the Forum. I am not a doctor, but my opinion is that u r correct, that is not good news. At about the 2 month mark after radiation, the RO will test the PSA to begin a new baseline number. What the RO should be looking for is for the PSA to remain stable or go down. Now I will say that you have not told us what he PSA was prior to the RT. However, my guess is that with a PSA of 0.01 and then going up to .3, this would be indicative of some loose cells in there. There is a radiation \"bounce theory\" where that could be normal, but at least with surgery and then SRT this would not be a good sign. Do u know what his Nadir was/is? In any event stay positive, they are many treatments available that may still cure u and give many, many years of a quality life. Best Wishes, MM",

      "Content": "Hey Rf51: Welcome to the forum. With your high -risk dx, as Chuck has pointed out, please speak with all the various specialists before deciding on a treatment course. And please ask them about SE!! My experience is that sometimes we do not get the entire story. The RO and the surgeon, (especially surgeons painting a picture that is a bit rose colored) may tell you one thing, but your specific case may not turn out like that. All I am saying is that the SE are no joke, and for us high-risk guys, may last much longer than most. One never knows. As Jim215 points out, surgery does de-bulk the tumor. However, it is my understanding that radiation may as well. Please ask these questions to the appropriate doctor. Wishing you good luck, MM",

      "Content": "Hey David. Welcome to the forum. Sorry you have to be here, but lots of good people and information to help you make a decision that is best for you. First, you mentioned you are a veteran. Thank u for your service. If you look at my signature, you will see we have a few things in common. I have 5 cores G6, and 4 cores G7 (4+3). Don't get to set on those Gleason scores, these things tend to be fluid and can change once you receive your post-op report ( should you choose surgery) of if you get a second opinion. I was downgraded from G8 on a second opinion. I'm sure there is a lot going on in your mind now, but it also appears you caught it early. With a G7 (4+3) we are both on the higher end of intermediate risk. But, with a T1 or T2 staging, that means the doc thinks it's contained to the prostate, and that is good news. You have a good chance for a cure. Get a copy of Dr. Patrick Walsh's book, the guide to surviving prostate cancer, 3rd edition. It will help you understand what lies ahead. Lean on this forum for answers, lots of really smart guys to help u. keep us posted on your progress. Regards, MM",

      "Content": "Hello Wendy: Welcome to the forum, sorry u have to be here, but u have landed at a great place. I see a few good signs and one that concerns me a bit. Gleason 6 and G7 (3+4) are the kind of PCa you want if it happens to u. G6 is low-risk, and G7 ( 3+4) is low intermediate risk. Both of these are quite curable and either surgery or radiation will offer you a cure. Do yourself a favor and pick up a copy of Dr. Patrick Walsh's book, Surviving Prostate cancer. ( 3rd edition). Lots of great information to get u up to speed. While 3/14 cores isn't to bad, I am not sure you would qualify for certain AS protocols. AS may or may not be a option, and it is not just for the elderly. It just depends upon your situation. Please keep in mind that all cases are different, no 2 are alike. What concerns me in your case is the PSA of 21. That's getting up there. I would consult with your Uro and see if they feel additional testing or enhanced imaging is in order. If all you have is low-risk G6/7 with that high of a PSA, god bless. Not trying to scare you, just wanting to alert you to the fact that something else may be hiding in there. A biopsy only examines a very small portion of the gland, so one never knows. Is Davinci the best option for him? That depends. If his clinical staging is T1 or T2, I would say yes. If not, that could bring other options into play. As you get more information, let us know. Lets see what the scans say, and go from there. We are here to help, keep us posted. Regards, MM",

      "Content": "Hey David. Welcome to the forum. Sorry you have to be here, but lots of good people and information to help you make a decision that is best for you. First, you mentioned you are a veteran. Thank u for your service. If you look at my signature, you will see we have a few things in common. I have 5 cores G6, and 4 cores G7 (4+3). Don't get to set on those Gleason scores, these things tend to be fluid and can change once you receive your post-op report ( should you choose surgery) of if you get a second opinion. I was downgraded from G8 on a second opinion. I'm sure there is a lot going on in your mind now, but it also appears you caught it early. With a G7 (4+3) we are both on the higher end of intermediate risk. But, with a T1 or T2 staging, that means the doc thinks it's contained to the prostate, and that is good news. You have a good chance for a cure. Get a copy of Dr. Patrick Walsh's book, the guide to surviving prostate cancer, 3rd edition. It will help you understand what lies ahead.

      "Content": "Hello CC33: Assuming that u have at least 1 nerve bundle left, you do have a chance. I am currently working with a doctor who is a specialist in penile rehab. Both of my nerve bundles were spared in the operation, but I am also on ADT and had SRT. The RO said that she avoided the penile blub, so I am good to go there. The doctor has me taking 100mg of sildenafil every other day. In addition, taking the shots 2x a week. The point being to get the blood moving anyway you can. You don't need to reach a climax, but u do need to get things going, by whatever means possible. With the shots, I am seeing some signs of life, but not erect enough to have intercourse. But, getting there. Hope this helps. Regards, MM",

Gleason 6 and G7 (3+4) are the kind of PCa you want if it happens to u. G6 is low-risk, and G7 ( 3+4) is low intermediate risk. Both of these are quite curable and either surgery or radiation will offer you a cure. Do yourself a favor and pick up a copy of Dr. Patrick Walsh's book, Surviving Prostate cancer. ( 3rd edition). Lots of great information to get u up to speed. While 3/14 cores isn't to bad, I am not sure you would qualify for certain AS protocols. AS may or may not be a option, and it is not just for the elderly. It just depends upon your situation. Please keep in mind that all cases are different, no 2 are alike. What concerns me in your case is the PSA of 21. That's getting up there. I would consult with your Uro and see if they feel additional testing or enhanced imaging is in order. If all you have is low-risk G6/7 with that high of a PSA, god bless. Not trying to scare you, just wanting to alert you to the fact that something else may be hiding in there. A biopsy only examines a very small portion of the gland, so one never knows. Is Davinci the best option for him? That depends. If his clinical staging is T1 or T2, I would say yes. If not, that could bring other options into play. As you get more information, let us know. Lets see what the scans say, and go from there. We are here to help, keep us posted. Regards, MM",

      "Content": "Hello Marve: To answer your question on T levels, it varies from person to person. Generally about a year after HT, they want to see your levels start returning to normal. (Using your case as an example, your dad was on HT for 2 years) A lot depends upon age, health, many different factors. Ask your doctor, he would know more about your case. All things being equal in your case, I would say 1 year. FWIW, I can't make any head way with your signature. The dates have me confused. When did he have HT? When was his surgery? I know you folks do the date differently than us. I really can't read it. Thanks, MM",

      "Content": "Tilly: Welcome back to the Forum. I am not a doctor, but my opinion is that u r correct, that is not good news. At about the 2 month mark after radiation, the RO will test the PSA to begin a new baseline number. What the RO should be looking for is for the PSA to remain stable or go down. Now I will say that you have not told us what he PSA was prior to the RT. However, my guess is that with a PSA of 0.01 and then going up to .3, this would be indicative of some loose cells in there. There is a radiation \"bounce theory\" where that could be normal, but at least with surgery and then SRT this would not be a good sign. Do u know what his Nadir was/is? In any event stay positive, they are many treatments available that may still cure u and give many, many years of a quality life. Best Wishes, MM",

      "Content": "\" Most radiation oncologists use the \"Phoenix\" definition of biochemical (PSA) recurrence which is a PSA of nadir +2. So any increase less than 2 ng/ml over your lowest PSA since treatment is officially a bounce. The problem is knowing if your lowest PSA so far is really your nadir, which may not occur for two years or more after radiation. With your history of PSA fluctuations, it may be that you have some recalcitrant prostatitis going on too that may continue to complicate your ability to distinguish a bounce from a biochemical recurrence. I'm two years out and my PSA is still on a long-term declining trend with a few bounces along the way. My RO has a standard line of \"let's wait another 3 months and see what happens.\" It all depends on when those cancer cells come out of hibernation and decide to replicate, at which time the \"time bomb\" implanted by the radiation will kill them.\" To be clear, these are not my words. I found this for your benefit. If this in not appropriate, I am sure Chuck will address it. For those with RO as a primary treatment I found this for u to read....hope this helps. This does not apply to those of us who had surgery and then SRT. In my case my RO has stated \" we just want to see stability or lower\". Then is no Bounce to be considered. Good Luck, MM",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by ASAdvocate MM, I am one of the foremost advocates of not rushing into treatment....But, with your pathology report, I don't think that there can be any doubt that treatment is needed soon, and that any waiting and monitoring would be highly risky for you. You have surgery scheduled, and that gives you a good chance to beat the cancer. Just do it. AS: Just to be clear, I already had the surgery. It was on 12/29/15. It has been about 4 weeks. My thread/question here was how to proceed as my PSA tests are coming up. I have a 6W and 12W, followed by a sit down with the surgeon at the 12W mark. I have been very pro-active throughout this entire process, doing all the things one should. Just happen to be one of the guys with a higher risk profile. Thanks for your support. MM",

      "Content": "Gene: Hello there. Glad you found this forum, and we are all here to help. My case is very similar to yours, and I have been down the exact road which you are now traveling. I would like to say \"kudos\" for all you have accomplished and your decision making process to date. Very well done. I would encourage you to forge ahead, not just with AR, but also with a course of HT. First, a PSA of <0.1 is not necessarily undetectable. I would get a UPSA and see what that tells u. Many doctors now in high risk cases are using 0.03 as the cut off mark. More times than not with your profile and mine, .05 can turn into .1 and higher in short order. You are a pT3a NO, with a G9 and PM. Most likely u have some PCa cells that are local in your prostate bed. Your doctors are giving you sound advice. I would also ask about 4 months of casodex, followed by 6-18 months of lupron injections. HT can be tough, but it is manageable and I am getting thru it. Studies have shown that RT/ADT are 50% more effective together than either one alone. The ADT should begin about 8 weeks before RT starts, to \"soften up\" the cancer cells for the attack. Also it may kill off other PCa cells that may not be in the bed, but are still ripe to be attacked. ( we both hope) Ask your RO about doing not just the bed, but also the pelvic lymph nodes. With a G9, I would be throwing everything at this including the kitchen sink. The good news is your case is not as bad as you think. You could be cured. Only time will tell. I am a pT3bNO and my RO has told me many cases of folks like me who are around for many, many years. She has guys worse than us ( positive LN) who are around 15-20 years after treatment. and still going. Don't get down, stay focused. What you do NOW is what matters. Don't delay, and my guess is that a cure for you is very possible. I will comment on the ED matter tomorrow, I just saw a specialist with Northshore health. We will be in that game in no time!!!! don't expect to much right now, you just had surgery. I will check in with you tomorrow. Warmest Regards, MM16.....Hey it's that time of year....GO BLUE!!!!",

      "Content": "Hello Wendy: Welcome to the forum, sorry u have to be here, but u have landed at a great place. I see a few good signs and one that concerns me a bit. Gleason 6 and G7 (3+4) are the kind of PCa you want if it happens to u. G6 is low-risk, and G7 ( 3+4) is low intermediate risk. Both of these are quite curable and either surgery or radiation will offer you a cure. Do yourself a favor and pick up a copy of Dr. Patrick Walsh's book, Surviving Prostate cancer. ( 3rd edition). Lots of great information to get u up to speed. While 3/14 cores isn't to bad, I am not sure you would qualify for certain AS protocols. AS may or may not be a option, and it is not just for the elderly. It just depends upon your situation. Please keep in mind that all cases are different, no 2 are alike. What concerns me in your case is the PSA of 21. That's getting up there. I would consult with your Uro and see if they feel additional testing or enhanced imaging is in order. If all you have is low-risk G6/7 with that high of a PSA, god bless. Not trying to scare you, just wanting to alert you to the fact that something else may be hiding in there. A biopsy only examines a very small portion of the gland, so one never knows. Is Davinci the best option for him? That depends. If his clinical staging is T1 or T2, I would say yes. If not, that could bring other options into play. As you get more information, let us know. Lets see what the scans say, and go from there. We are here to help, keep us posted. Regards, MM",

      "Content": "Prato, Thank u. Jim215: I guess I should have phrased it different. Clearly if PSA starts heading north, it's a call to action. I am with one of the best medical teams around, I could not imagine any other response. But, what if my PSA is in the zero club? Just looking for some different views and experiences. And yes, being cancer free and survival is my primary goal. The SE will be what they are. I want to stick around!! As always, thanks for your wise counsel. Regards, MM",

      "Content": "Hello Keith: Throwing my 2 cents into the ring. I was dx in early October of 2015. I went for a second opinion at the UC at the end of October, and my cancer at that time was downgraded to G7 from G8. I was a cT2c, after being examined by the uro surgeon. His 1st appt. for surgery was 12/29/2015, and i asked him if waiting would be a potential negative for my case. Based on the evidence at hand, he said I had up to 3-6 months before any changes would occur to alter my case. Now, that was based on G6-7 PCa. As things turned out, well take a look at my signature. I would agree with the others, sooner always beats later, if at all possible. Best to u, MM",

All u can do for now is the kegel's, and start a walking routine to build up the muscles. It is way to early to worry about anything. Just take one day at a time, and measure your progress in weeks or weekly. BTW...was your G 4+3 downgraded to 3+4? If so, that is a big bonus for u. Stay strong and stay the course, MM",

      "Content": "Hello Keith: Throwing my 2 cents into the ring. I was dx in early October of 2015. I went for a second opinion at the UC at the end of October, and my cancer at that time was downgraded to G7 from G8. I was a cT2c, after being examined by the uro surgeon. His 1st appt. for surgery was 12/29/2015, and i asked him if waiting would be a potential negative for my case. Based on the evidence at hand, he said I had up to 3-6 months before any changes would occur to alter my case. Now, that was based on G6-7 PCa. As things turned out, well take a look at my signature. I would agree with the others, sooner always beats later, if at all possible. Best to u, MM",

      "Content": "Steve: I did do the research on EBRT ( IMRT/ IGRT) when I was making my decision. I don't remember anyone on here using SBRT as a primary treatment. Hypofractionated and sterotactic radiation are being evaluated for long-term data and from what I understand, MAY be considered for certain patients. As I am sure you are aware, the dose for SBRT is substantially higher. Since travel is not a issue, I would go to a major cancer center and get all the information you can before deciding on any radiation plan. Since SBRT is given in five or fewer treatments, my guess is u will have to qualify. Best of luck, MM",

I went for a second opinion at the UC at the end of October, and my cancer at that time was downgraded to G7 from G8. I was a cT2c, after being examined by the uro surgeon. His 1st appt. for surgery was 12/29/2015, and i asked him if waiting would be a potential negative for my case. Based on the evidence at hand, he said I had up to 3-6 months before any changes would occur to alter my case. Now, that was based on G6-7 PCa. As things turned out, well take a look at my signature. I would agree with the others, sooner always beats later, if at all possible. Best to u, MM",

      "Content": "Gene: Hello there. Glad you found this forum, and we are all here to help. My case is very similar to yours, and I have been down the exact road which you are now traveling. I would like to say \"kudos\" for all you have accomplished and your decision making process to date. Very well done. I would encourage you to forge ahead, not just with AR, but also with a course of HT. First, a PSA of <0.1 is not necessarily undetectable. I would get a UPSA and see what that tells u. Many doctors now in high risk cases are using 0.03 as the cut off mark. More times than not with your profile and mine, .05 can turn into .1 and higher in short order. You are a pT3a NO, with a G9 and PM. Most likely u have some PCa cells that are local in your prostate bed. Your doctors are giving you sound advice. I would also ask about 4 months of casodex, followed by 6-18 months of lupron injections. HT can be tough, but it is manageable and I am getting thru it. Studies have shown that RT/ADT are 50% more effective together than either one alone. The ADT should begin about 8 weeks before RT starts, to \"soften up\" the cancer cells for the attack. Also it may kill off other PCa cells that may not be in the bed, but are still ripe to be attacked. ( we both hope) Ask your RO about doing not just the bed, but also the pelvic lymph nodes. With a G9, I would be throwing everything at this including the kitchen sink. The good news is your case is not as bad as you think. You could be cured. Only time will tell. I am a pT3bNO and my RO has told me many cases of folks like me who are around for many, many years. She has guys worse than us ( positive LN) who are around 15-20 years after treatment. and still going. Don't get down, stay focused. What you do NOW is what matters. Don't delay, and my guess is that a cure for you is very possible. I will comment on the ED matter tomorrow, I just saw a specialist with Northshore health. We will be in that game in no time!!!! don't expect to much right now, you just had surgery. I will check in with you tomorrow. Warmest Regards, MM16.....Hey it's that time of year....GO BLUE!!!!",

      "Content": "Hello Mike: Welcome home to the other side. Glad to see you are up and around. The PAFP is just that, fatty tissue. In your case, why did they excise it? Having positive lymphatic disease there is actually rare. I had heard of this, but really do not know to much more about it. I would be asking why they were checking in the first place. Metastatic disease in there would be a adverse pathological feature, but i don't think it would be much different than positive LN elsewhere. I would be interested in hearing the explanation. Hang in there Mike, i am sure it is nothing. Best, MM",

      "Content": "Gene: Hello there. Glad you found this forum, and we are all here to help. My case is very similar to yours, and I have been down the exact road which you are now traveling. I would like to say \"kudos\" for all you have accomplished and your decision making process to date. Very well done. I would encourage you to forge ahead, not just with AR, but also with a course of HT. First, a PSA of <0.1 is not necessarily undetectable. I would get a UPSA and see what that tells u. Many doctors now in high risk cases are using 0.03 as the cut off mark. More times than not with your profile and mine, .05 can turn into .1 and higher in short order. You are a pT3a NO, with a G9 and PM. Most likely u have some PCa cells that are local in your prostate bed. Your doctors are giving you sound advice. I would also ask about 4 months of casodex, followed by 6-18 months of lupron injections. HT can be tough, but it is manageable and I am getting thru it. Studies have shown that RT/ADT are 50% more effective together than either one alone. The ADT should begin about 8 weeks before RT starts, to \"soften up\" the cancer cells for the attack. Also it may kill off other PCa cells that may not be in the bed, but are still ripe to be attacked. ( we both hope) Ask your RO about doing not just the bed, but also the pelvic lymph nodes. With a G9, I would be throwing everything at this including the kitchen sink. The good news is your case is not as bad as you think. You could be cured. Only time will tell. I am a pT3bNO and my RO has told me many cases of folks like me who are around for many, many years. She has guys worse than us ( positive LN) who are around 15-20 years after treatment. and still going. Don't get down, stay focused. What you do NOW is what matters. Don't delay, and my guess is that a cure for you is very possible. I will comment on the ED matter tomorrow, I just saw a specialist with Northshore health. We will be in that game in no time!!!! don't expect to much right now, you just had surgery. I will check in with you tomorrow. Warmest Regards, MM16.....Hey it's that time of year....GO BLUE!!!!",

      "Content": "Hello Keith: Throwing my 2 cents into the ring. I was dx in early October of 2015. I went for a second opinion at the UC at the end of October, and my cancer at that time was downgraded to G7 from G8. I was a cT2c, after being examined by the uro surgeon. His 1st appt. for surgery was 12/29/2015, and i asked him if waiting would be a potential negative for my case. Based on the evidence at hand, he said I had up to 3-6 months before any changes would occur to alter my case. Now, that was based on G6-7 PCa. As things turned out, well take a look at my signature. I would agree with the others, sooner always beats later, if at all possible. Best to u, MM",

All u can do for now is the kegel's, and start a walking routine to build up the muscles. It is way to early to worry about anything.

      "Content": "Big: I think u are over thinking all this. Your pathology report is not all bad. For now, your PSA is ZERO! The SK nonogram is just that, a nonogram. It gives you the range of statistics of men who have been treated with your pathology. Not saying it isn't somewhat reliable, but you are a person. All of us are different, you can't be making hard and fast conclusions based upon a nomogram. They are prediction tools designed to help a patient understand what may or may not be in front of them. \"Maybe I am not understanding the technical aspects but how can there be any pertinent data on SRT that is done without any indications of a bio-chemical recurrence as the the wild card is that there is none, there-fore it worked\" THe SRT nonogram is based on people who have had a recurrence, and what the odds are of it being treated with success. ( based on your risk factors). For now, just take it easy. You are doing fine, don't borrow any trouble. Based on your pathology, IF additional treatment were necessary, your chances of it being a local disease are high. Especially with the PM, that argues well for a cure. Best of luck, MM",

Get ready to feel better...NO means that your Lymph Nodes that were taken during surgery were negative. You had what is called a ePLND. ( extended pelvic lymph node dissection). You were negative. Trust me, that's a great start. The lingo is as follows...p stands for pathological, T is tumor, 3 is stage 3, b is for seminal vesicle invasion ( either one or both). If there is a c in front of all that, it stands for clinical. NO does not say a damn thing about your lifespan, other than thank god u did not also have that. More to follow.....Regards, MM",

I would be going to a major cancer center, if possible. With a G10 plus a positive node, I would be watching my PSA like a hawk and acting early to achieve the best results.

This was mainly because many of the cases that came in back then were of a very advanced nature. PSA testing and DRE screening were not like they have been in recent times. Many men with SVI back then were already to far gone. With the advent of regular screening, this has changed. So, many of those stats were not applicable to today's men. There is also good and bad SVI, or should I say one being less of a worry than the other. I will get my notes from my office tomorrow, and give you the medical lingo. In a nutshell, the SV look like rabbit ears. If the tumor invaded the SV at the bottom, it's a far less serious situation. That would mean that the tumor just got thru the tissue and penetrated like a PM issue. However, if the tumor is found in the \"ear\" of the SV, that would mean it got there thru the bloodstream, etc. Not good. I am giving you the layman's explanation, I will give the medical tomorrow.

Trust me, that's a great start. The lingo is as follows...p stands for pathological, T is tumor, 3 is stage 3, b is for seminal vesicle invasion ( either one or both).

There is a mathematical formula that you can plug in your PSA to calculate the exact time it will take to get a accurate reading. Bottom line: For most men, 6-8 weeks gives a very accurate indication of where you stand. At 12 weeks, you can take it to the bank. Not knowing anything else about your case, that's about all I can tell u. Wishing you the best, MM",

      "Content": "Hello Lee. Welcome to the forum, u will find many good people to offer lots of support. Your history was a bit hard to read in the order that you presented it, but here is what I can tell u. Your PSA right after the RP was just fine. 3 months later it was then .63. You don't state if u then began ADT prior to the SRT. Doesn't matter now, but for all newbies out there who read this, It may have given u a better chance at success. Your PCa right after SRT was 3.53. That was not a good sign. Should have been around the .5 area. U didn't really have a big turnaround, your PCa was not a local case to start with. I don't want to rehash what I think you should or should not have done, that's already gone. Your PSA never went undetected while on lupron. You need to see a MO to get this straightened out. Did you have a RO, I assume? There is still plenty u can do, I believe there are several hormonal therapies available to u, lupron is just step 1. Plenty of bullets to be fired. U can spot radiate for just one met, maybe some form of SBRT. It won't cure u, but it can be of added benefit. Hang in there, lots of positives to keep you going for years, but u need to see a MO right now. Keep us posted. Best, MM",

Sorry, I do see that u gave some information in your opening post. the more the better. Take your time and don't feel rushed, another month or so will probably not matter.

You don't state if u then began ADT prior to the SRT. Doesn't matter now, but for all newbies out there who read this, It may have given u a better chance at success. Your PCa right after SRT was 3.53. That was not a good sign. Should have been around the .5 area. U didn't really have a big turnaround, your PCa was not a local case to start with. I don't want to rehash what I think you should or should not have done, that's already gone. Your PSA never went undetected while on lupron. You need to see a MO to get this straightened out. Did you have a RO, I assume? There is still plenty u can do, I believe there are several hormonal therapies available to u, lupron is just step 1. Plenty of bullets to be fired. U can spot radiate for just one met, maybe some form of SBRT. It won't cure u, but it can be of added benefit. Hang in there, lots of positives to keep you going for years, but u need to see a MO right now. Keep us posted. Best, MM",

Kind of tough not knowing any of your history. There may not be any reason for you to feel pessimistic about your situation. Each case is different, and the important thing is to catch it early. Sorry, I do see that u gave some information in your opening post. the more the better. Take your time and don't feel rushed, another month or so will probably not matter. Do u have a current staging? Did the surgeon do a DRE? What medical basis are you using to assume it is not contained? Keep us posted on your progress. We are all in your corner. BTW...my Gleason went from 8-7-9.......let's hope yours goes to all 3+3. Regards, MM",

      "Content": "Hello Mr. Ed. Welcome to the forum. It's sounds like you are in good hands and have done your homework. You are where I started out, which was G7 ( 4+3). I choose surgery, at the time my staging was cT2c. I am using my I phone, which doesn't show my signature. But I post a lot, u can find it. Things turned out to be upgraded, and I have been thru the ringer. Reason I'm telling u this..... not sure I would have made the surgery decision if I would have known my high/ risk profile. Right now, you are intermediate high risk. Any Gleason primary pattern 4 can be a wild card. Check out all options, the side effects of surgery, radiation, and HT have been tough. They are no damn joke. What I'm saying is that it's a big decision. Make it and don't look back, just know all the facts before hand. Ask questions here, the various doctors will preach or push their specialty. One problem, they don't have to live with it. Good luck, pick up Dr. Patrick Walsh's book. Good Read. Best, MM",

      "Content": "Probability of remaining recurrence-free after salvage radiation In 2007, Stephenson et al. published a nomogram that predicted the probability of success of salvage radiation after post-prostatectomy biochemical failure. Biochemical failure was defined as a PSA≥0.2 ng/ml. Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center has made the nomogram publicly available at this link. But that data was put together before ultrasensitive PSA tests became widely available, and before three randomized clinical trials demonstrated an advantage to adjuvant radiation over waiting. Several studies now suggest (see this link) that early salvage may provide the same benefit as adjuvant radiation therapy, but with less risk of overtreatment. Tendulkar et al. have now updated the Stephenson nomogram.. The original nomogram was based on 1,540 patients treated between 1987 and 2005 at 17 tertiary care facilities. All patients had a confirmed PSA ≥0.2 ng/ml before SRT. Outcomes were based on 6-year progression-free probability after SRT. The updated nomogram is based on 2,460 patients treated between 1987 and 2013 at 10 academic medical centers. It included post-op ultrasensitive PSA test results for some (18 percent) of the patients, but only 18 patients were treated at a PSA≤0.05 ng/ml. The nomogram predicts 5- and 10-year probability of freedom from biochemical failure (PSA≥0.2 ng/ml) after SRT. The authors also constructed a nomogram that predicts 5- and 10-year probability of incidence of metastasis. Their model has a predictive accuracy of about 68 percent for freedom from biochemical failure, and 74 percent for incidence of metastasis. The tables below approximate the nomogram for predicting the 10-year probability of remaining free of biochemical failure after SRT treatment. Risk Factor Score (points) Points ADT Yes: 0 No: 49 Gleason score 6: 0 7: 54 8: 70 9/10: 90 Extraprostatic Extension No:0 Yes:22 Surgical Margins Positive: 0 Negative: 27 Seminal Vesicle Invasion No: 0 Yes: 24 Pre-RT PSA (ng/ml) 0.05: 2.5 0.1: 5 0.2:10 0.3: 15 0.5: 25 1.0: 50 1.5: 75 Radiation dose (Gy) ≥66 Gy: 0 <66 Gy: 17 Total points Total points Probability 100 70% 150 50% 195 30% 220 20% 245 10% 265 5% As an example, take the case of a man who, after his prostatectomy, had a Gleason score of 9 (=90 points), seminal vesicle invasion (=24 points), margins were negative (=27 points), PSA before SRT was 0.5 ng/ml (=25 points), and his radiation oncologist plans on treating him with a dose of 65 Gy (=17 points) without ADT(=49 points). His total score is 90+24+27+25+17+49= 232. This corresponds to about a 15% probability of success. The doctor and his patient probably would not consider this SRT treatment, given the risk of adverse side effects. Now, let\u2019s suppose the same man is treated earlier when his PSA is only 0.05 ng/ml (2.5 points) and his radiation oncologist proposes a dose of 70 Gy (=0 points) with ADT beginning two months before SRT (=0 points). His total score is 90+24+27+2.5+0+0= 143.5. This corresponds to about a 55% probability of success. This SRT treatment is a lot more tempting. Because of database limitations, they could not incorporate PSA doubling time or increases in their model. They also could not include the duration of ADT use or more precise radiation dosage. With more data, a genomic classifier (Decipher®) also might improve the predictive accuracy of their model. Together with other factors like co-morbidities, risk of adverse effects and life expectancy, this nomogram should prove useful in helping the patient and doctor decide whether SRT is worthwhile.

      "Content": "Big: I think u are over thinking all this. Your pathology report is not all bad. For now, your PSA is ZERO! The SK nonogram is just that, a nonogram. It gives you the range of statistics of men who have been treated with your pathology. Not saying it isn't somewhat reliable, but you are a person. All of us are different, you can't be making hard and fast conclusions based upon a nomogram. They are prediction tools designed to help a patient understand what may or may not be in front of them. \"Maybe I am not understanding the technical aspects but how can there be any pertinent data on SRT that is done without any indications of a bio-chemical recurrence as the the wild card is that there is none, there-fore it worked\" THe SRT nonogram is based on people who have had a recurrence, and what the odds are of it being treated with success. ( based on your risk factors). For now, just take it easy. You are doing fine, don't borrow any trouble. Based on your pathology, IF additional treatment were necessary, your chances of it being a local disease are high. Especially with the PM, that argues well for a cure. Best of luck, MM",

Now, let\u2019s suppose the same man is treated earlier when his PSA is only 0.05 ng/ml (2.5 points) and his radiation oncologist proposes a dose of 70 Gy (=0 points) with ADT beginning two months before SRT (=0 points). His total score is 90+24+27+2.5+0+0= 143.5. This corresponds to about a 55% probability of success. This SRT treatment is a lot more tempting. Because of database limitations, they could not incorporate PSA doubling time or increases in their model. They also could not include the duration of ADT use or more precise radiation dosage. With more data, a genomic classifier (Decipher®) also might improve the predictive accuracy of their model. Together with other factors like co-morbidities, risk of adverse effects and life expectancy, this nomogram should prove useful in helping the patient and doctor decide whether SRT is worthwhile.

      "Content": "Hello Dave and Barb: To answer your questions. Yes, your continence will probably be \"frozen\" about where it is at the time that u go in for ART. If u can put it off for say 3-6 months, perhaps u can go into the RT with a good sense of where u are. One option would be to track his PSA using the uPSA, and try and get/buy as much time as u can. If u have HT with the radiation, which in your case is standard of care, this will stop the cancer from progressing and buy u time. Typically, u will be on ADT for 2 months prior to RT. Casodex/ lupron, etc. Honestly, they use the terms ADT/SRT like there is a big difference...I think it is more about when u begin in relation to your PSA. As far as ED, during RT the RO will be able to avoid the penile bulb, and perhaps his ED will improve over time. Tough to say for now...but with RT and ADT, sadly he will not even care. The good news: While your report is not the greatest, it isn't the end of the world either! You still have a chance at a cure, and if that is what u are most concerned about, leave no stone Unturned. As the saying goes...erections do u no good with your feet south of the grass. Wishing u and your husband the best, MM",

      "Content": "I just had to post this. I received my Lupron shot on April 15. (7.5mg) 1 month's worth for starters. I look at my insurance online to make sure all is good. I have Coventry One, a division of Atena. UC hospitals billed the insurance company $7,469 for the Lupron. The nurse who gave me the shot billed $423. That's a total of $7892 for a 5 minute visit. Really? I used to think that the insurance company\"s were a bunch of criminals. ( For the most part they are) Who the hell do these hospitals think they are to bill that sum? Guess what they got paid per their contract with Coventry? $266. So they bill $7892, but are willing to accept $266. So, for some poor soul who has no insurance, they walk in and are charged $7892. But, the insurance company pays $266 and the hospital is thrilled to accept. This system sucks!!",

      "Content": "Shu: I mean having the the same prices ( 266 vs. 7892) for everyone. This poses a problem when it comes to cash pay patients, because patients are billed at the same high rates unless a cash price is previously negotiated. The \"adjusted rate\" or \"negotiated rate\" only applies to the insurance company.This information alone is proof that the prices of healthcare are not set. They are inflated and filled with erroneous charges. These \"adjusted rates\" are guarded like top level espionage. A doctors office will bill a insurance company and a unrelated person for the same service. The insurance company pays several times less. The patient faces financial ruin. This is even more of a problem for the self-insured, those of us who don't work for the post office, fire department, police or have company plans. If these people saw my health premiums and out-of-pocket costs over the years, they would faint. Nothing against any of those occupations. If I knew I could pay the lower price, I might be able to do the math and just self-insure. My RALP all in was close to 90,000. The UC hospitals received less than 20K. The \"free market\" does not seem to be working.",

      "Content": "Shu: I mean having the the same prices ( 266 vs. 7892) for everyone. This poses a problem when it comes to cash pay patients, because patients are billed at the same high rates unless a cash price is previously negotiated. The \"adjusted rate\" or \"negotiated rate\" only applies to the insurance company.This information alone is proof that the prices of healthcare are not set. They are inflated and filled with erroneous charges. These \"adjusted rates\" are guarded like top level espionage. A doctors office will bill a insurance company and a unrelated person for the same service. The insurance company pays several times less. The patient faces financial ruin. This is even more of a problem for the self-insured, those of us who don't work for the post office, fire department, police or have company plans. If these people saw my health premiums and out-of-pocket costs over the years, they would faint. Nothing against any of those occupations. If I knew I could pay the lower price, I might be able to do the math and just self-insure. My RALP all in was close to 90,000. The UC hospitals received less than 20K. The \"free market\" does not seem to be working.",

I have Coventry One, a division of Atena. UC hospitals billed the insurance company $7,469 for the Lupron. The nurse who gave me the shot billed $423. That's a total of $7892 for a 5 minute visit. Really? I used to think that the insurance company\"s were a bunch of criminals. ( For the most part they are) Who the hell do these hospitals think they are to bill that sum? Guess what they got paid per their contract with Coventry? $266. So they bill $7892, but are willing to accept $266. So, for some poor soul who has no insurance, they walk in and are charged $7892. But, the insurance company pays $266 and the hospital is thrilled to accept. This system sucks!!",

Since u are doing this well at 6 months, I would not take any other action. Pump and injections are not much fun, especially injections. They can be painful, and can lead to other SE that u don't even want to hear about. Give yourself some time. If u want, consult a ED specialist. Not your Uro/surgeon, they really don't do much in this space. For now, work on the leakage, and time may be your best bet. Best, MM",

      "Sample": "I guess what I am saying is you may end up having to have radiation and end up in the same place if you just would have started radiation in the first place. Had I have known this in my situation, I may have choose some sort of brachytherapy/ ADT and not had the additional issues associated with surgery....It all depends on when those cancer cells come out of hibernation and decide to replicate, at which time the \"time bomb\" implanted by the radiation will kill them.\" To be clear, these are not my words....Now that he has PM, if he does end up having radiation, make sure the plan covers the prostate bed and local lymph nodes, known as a \"boost\". Get them all done at once....Because of database limitations, they could not incorporate PSA doubling time or increases in their model. They also could not include the duration of ADT use or more precise radiation dosage....Having a chance to do it over, I may have chosen a different route. Best, MM https://prostatecancerinfolink.net/2...-or-ebrt-only/...The case to which you refer was G7 (3+4) so maybe that's why. Now that he has PM, if he does end up having radiation, make sure the plan covers the prostate bed and local lymph nodes, known as a \"boost\"....Had I have known this in my situation, I may have choose some sort of brachytherapy/ ADT and not had the additional issues associated with surgery. I don't know, tough call....At about the 2 month mark after radiation, the RO will test the PSA to begin a new baseline number. What the RO should be looking for is for the PSA to remain stable or go down....My RO has a standard line of \"let's wait another 3 months and see what happens.\" It all depends on when those cancer cells come out of hibernation and decide to replicate, at which time the \"time bomb\" implanted by the radiation will kill them.\"...If you need to go through what men like you and I have/will, I would choose the radiation path. Both surgery and radiation will \"de-bulk\"the tumor....Steve: I did do the research on EBRT ( IMRT/ IGRT) when I was making my decision. I don't remember anyone on here using SBRT as a primary treatment....Steve: I did do the research on EBRT ( IMRT/ IGRT) when I was making my decision....If your intention is to give yourself the best chance at a cure, you may want to reconsider your decision. Above data is with RT, but I think I have some files as it pertains to surgery....",
