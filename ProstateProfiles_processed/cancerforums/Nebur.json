      "Content": "Hello everyone. I am totally new to this. Let me go ahead and tell you my story. For the year I been having pain in my penis area and some discomfort when sitting. I had a PSA done last year, on 09/2016 and it was 0.38. Had a urinalysis done and checked for STDs, all were negative. I had another PSA done on 08/2017 and it was 0.34. The pain continued and so I went to a new doctor who referred for a ultrasound of my bladder and prostate despite having a normal Digital rectal exam. On the Ultrasound, the radiologist said he saw a 2 cm hypoechoic area, either abscess or tumor. So I went to the urologist, who performed another digital rectal Exam and said it felt normal and said he recommends the MRI. I have been freaking out and self diagnosed myself with Prostate cancer. The urologist doesn\u0092t think it is cancer, but what else can it be if it\u0092s not cancer. My prostate total volume is 6 cc by the way. Any words of advise and encouragement is greatly appreciated.",

      "Content": "A few months ago I had a Ultrasound done on me because I have been having a ongoing pain in my penis area for almost a year now and some mild discomfort I\u0092m assuming my prostate area, usually when I sit for prolonged periods. I had a PSA done on me back in 10/16 and it came out to be 0.38 ng. Had multiple STD tests, all negative. Continued to have pain / discomfort, so i had another PSA done in 08/17 and the results came back as 0.34 ng. I am 37 years old by the way. I then had Ultrasound done in September. My prostate is pretty small at only 6 cc volume. The Ultrasound came back stating a 2 cm hypoechoic neoplasm That may be an abscess and requested for a MRI or biopsy. The urologist suggested the MRI and scheduled it in December but wasn\u0092t able to do it until just recently. I had the MRI done on 01/23/18 and just today (02/02/1 the radiology department called me because they wanted more Images in the Sagittal view. I am now really freaking out and thinking the worse of the worse and thinking maybe they wanted Images because they found cancer !! I\u0092m so scared and don\u0092t know what to think.. have any of you had a call for additional MRI Images? Any information would greatly be appreciated or similar experiences be shared with me. Is it possible that it is worse than though, this the reason they want more Images. Could this be a Prostatitis, cyst? Or the big \u0091C\u0092 word that has metastasized, thus more Images required.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by KPINOTT I'm very surprised that you are even considering prostate cancer here. Look up chronic pelvic pain syndrome online. You likely have that and don't have Pca with your age, no symptoms, and extraordinarily low psa. You are totally overreacting. I\u0092m just very concerned because of the nodule they found on Ultrasound and then I had a MRI last week and then the radiology department called me yesterday to have additional images done. I am now in total panic mode. I did consider CPPS.. but I\u0092m not sure if nodules are present with this. On the positives, I am relatively young for PCA and have low PSA with a small prostate according to my labs and ultrasound images. But I am now thinking the worse of the worse.
