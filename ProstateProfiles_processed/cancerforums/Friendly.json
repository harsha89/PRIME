I want to thank everyone and those who continue to be treated will always be in my heart and prayers. I had posted that my walking had gotten more difficult and painful and asked if anyone had any experiences with this issue. In time my Hormone Oncologist guested the cause and sent me to a Specialist. I have a serious case of Spinal Stenosis and will be having surgery in April. I again want to thank everyone who contributes to this wonderful site and please know folks are praying for you and I. God bless and keep you, Gregg",

Pain is not new to me I am asking just in-case this little pinch of pain is something I need to be prepared for? Many thanks and I apologize if this was asked before I missed it.",

The spot on the liver did not show up on both tests and is so small he does not want to wait any longer then getting the second opinion and starting my treatment.

When I see my Radiation Doctor, we see him once a week to check on us and review how we are doing. I will ask him myself at that time. How 5 Treatments at this NJ Radiation Center can replace and can accomplish the same results as the 45 Treatments I am receiving is a mystery to me.

I believe I mentioned that about a week ago I went for my yearly Thyroid Checkup. I have nodules and for the first time in 5 years they have enlarged. Five years ago the Needle Biopsy indicated they were not cancerous. However because of the increase in size I am leaving in a few minutes for a new Needle Biopsy of my Thyroid. More then anything I am wondering how they will treat both cancers if the nodules are now cancerous. I appreciate being able to share this with my friends on the Prostate Cancer Forum since that is how I first came here. Nancy is strong and supportive however having worked in Pathology sometimes she understands too well. I can come here and share without causing her more worries before it is necessary. My throat has been scratchy and my voice a little ruff at times I suspect and read these are indicators of something with the Thyroid. The same department and staff that did my Prostate Needle Biopsy and installed my Gold Flakes will be doing my Thyroid in an hour. I told the person who made the appointment I will have to introduce myself because up to now my association with the Specialist has been anything but FACE TO FACE. When I know more I will let you all know, God bless you one and all.",

In May I had to go to the him and Nancy said to insist on a PSA it had been too long already. I insisted and he agreed to do the PSA Test. The PSA was 20.7, the Radiation Oncologist went over my records closely and found the last time the Primary Doctor did a PSA was four years ago and my PSA was only 2. He wasn't going to say anything but you could sense that he did not think it was good that my Primary had not done a PSA in four years. This time the Primary Doctor did the PSA only because I insisted because of Nancy's advice and it went from 2.0 to 20.7 and my Gleason is 7 in those four years. If I had a yearly PSA they may have discovered this before it got this high. The Radiation Oncologist also said because it did increase that much in four years it was the more aggressive form of Prostate Cancer and had to be treated immediately. This is what the Urologist had to us and he had us go to the Oncologist for a second opinion immediately. They both told us to tell my sons to start having PSAs starting at age 40 and to have them regularly and not let their Doctor allow four years to pass between them. I had the Needle Biopsy and it showed that 70-75 percent of the test issue had cancer in it. We do not know my fathers family history because they died of other issues from years of smoking and drinking, my mothers side were all dead early on and we had no way of finding a history of it in Moms' family anymore. The PSA testing is a painless easy way to test, I regret not insisting sooner or more often. I would recommend it at the very least. It put us on to my Prostate Cancer and the need for more testing and direct testing and treatment",

      "Content": "mkane09, I believe you are correct, years ago NBC did a report on Americans dying of treatable diseases because they could not afford the treatments. It is happening again and will more in the coming months and years. The IRS has been assigned to regulate the Obama Health Care Coverage by the Obama Administration. I had to go to the emergency room for a badly broken wrist 2 years ago, it looked like a Z shape. After giving my name we sat and sat and sat as families brought their children into the emergency room as though it their family doctor's office. Finally I could not stand the pain anymore, it required an operation and steel plate to repair, I went up to the window and asked how does one get a broken wrist looked at since we were waiting for people with simple colds to get treated? The nurse said WHAT MAKES YOU THINK YOU HAVE A BROKEN WRIST AND I SHOWED HER THE Z shaped wrist. She said I will get a doctor. Anymore our area of USA has become a relocation center for the Caribbean Commonwealth of the USA. They get what they need free or from a program. I am asking myself do I want to spend our life savings to try to live and still die leaving Nancy broke or die and leave Nancy with some kind of resources. Nancy will not hear of it, she wants me. I love her and I worry who will take care of her because she is not included in any of these special treatment groups. We got a Blue Cross Blue Shield Blue for SENIORS supplemental health care policy a PPO. THE FIRST SPECIALIST WE WENT TO see SAID HE DOES NOT ACCEPT it because it restricts the treatments too much for people who need the prescribed treatments. His staff was tried of fighting with BC/BS for the patients. Swell the first time we tried to use our SPECIAL SENIOR plan the SPECIALIST does not accept it and it was supposedly designed for SENIORS. YEA RIGHT.",

      "Content": "What I learned about LEG PAIN after months of Hormone Therapy this past week at my 6 Month Checkup. My PSA was 20.9, Gleason 7 and the split was 4/3 last spring when my Prostate was diagnosed. I never had any really outward symptoms before the first PSA test my doctor would do in 4 years. I had 45 Radiation Treatments and a string of Hormones starting before the Radiation Treatments that continue for a full 22 or 24 months. A month after the Radiation Treatments were completed I began to have pains in both my legs, the pains were in both legs and identical. They continued to get stronger and my family doctor wrote me a prescription of an Anti Inflammatory medication. This week I questioned my Radiation Doctor if the pain could be related to my treatments and not my cancer spreading. He said Oh yes some people get these leg pains from the Hormone Treatments. He said if I could stand to go on with them the chance of the Cancer returning are greatly reduced. If I had less or discontinued the Hormones there is a greater chance of the cancer returning. I told him I am most relieved it is not Cancer spreading and I will continue to deal with the leg pains knowing now what it is. I should add my PSA is currently 0.1 so the leg pain is a painful distraction believe me, however it is worth it to get PSAs like this. The Compulsion from the Hormone Treatments to run out and have my nails done and get a perm is decreasing too, JOKE",

      "Content": "My Primary Doctor was not one for testing and I figured he was knew best, that was my mistake. In May I had to go to the him and Nancy said to insist on a PSA it had been too long already. I insisted and he agreed to do the PSA Test. The PSA was 20.7, the Radiation Oncologist went over my records closely and found the last time the Primary Doctor did a PSA was four years ago and my PSA was only 2. He wasn't going to say anything but you could sense that he did not think it was good that my Primary had not done a PSA in four years. This time the Primary Doctor did the PSA only because I insisted because of Nancy's advice and it went from 2.0 to 20.7 and my Gleason is 7 in those four years. If I had a yearly PSA they may have discovered this before it got this high. The Radiation Oncologist also said because it did increase that much in four years it was the more aggressive form of Prostate Cancer and had to be treated immediately. This is what the Urologist had to us and he had us go to the Oncologist for a second opinion immediately. They both told us to tell my sons to start having PSAs starting at age 40 and to have them regularly and not let their Doctor allow four years to pass between them. I had the Needle Biopsy and it showed that 70-75 percent of the test issue had cancer in it. We do not know my fathers family history because they died of other issues from years of smoking and drinking, my mothers side were all dead early on and we had no way of finding a history of it in Moms' family anymore. The PSA testing is a painless easy way to test, I regret not insisting sooner or more often. I would recommend it at the very least. It put us on to my Prostate Cancer and the need for more testing and direct testing and treatment",

      "Content": "Thanking God for a miracle today, we went over my Bone Scan and Kat Scan at the Urologist Tuesday. It has not spread however my PSA is 20. and the Gleason Score 7 however apparently my Prostate Cancer is the more aggressive form. It as found at the beginning and not afterwards. I am going with the hormone and radiation. The Urologist suggested a highly respected and highly rated Radiation Oncologist in our area. However the Urologist was not sure this man was accessible because of the number of patients he already has. The Urologists' staff was going to call today because I need to start my treatments immediately. While searching on the WWW Tuesday night I found a link to this Oncologist and it had his email address. I took a chance and wrote him, I told him who I was seeing and my test results and how much it would mean to my family if I could be treated by him. This morning I started up the old PC and there was a wonderful email answer from this very doctor himself. He told me his staff would call me this morning to get in to see him TODAY. At 2:00 P.M. Nancy and I got in to see him. He is everything we heard he was and more. He is going to take my case and he works well with my Urologist and has in the past. I called my Urologist and they were amazed because they had not called him yet and had doubts he could take me on. Until we got to the appointment the Urologist had everything faxed directly to the Oncologist. He went over everything with us carefully and patiently. My Prostate Cancer is an aggressive type HOWEVER IT WAS CAUGHT early in it progress not after it had gotten into my bones and organs. He is starting treatment immediately with Hormone Therapy to better prepare me for the Radiation treatment that will come. No one can believe I got this Oncologist because he gets patients from all over. Then to find him to be patient, very complete in his explaining everything, and very compassionate was great. EVERYTHING I LEARNED ON THIS SITE FITS INTO WHAT HE EXPLAINED TO US AND HOW THE TREATMENT WILL PROCESS! To me it gave me great confidence in the help I received on this site and the advice given to people like myself who knows nothing about this when it struck. I thank everyone who worked so hard to establish this wonderful Forum. You have given us hope and the hope lead us to a Great Urologist and now a GREAT Oncologist. I am going to continue to come here to learn all that I can and if I can offer hope to others, as this site has given us hope.",

I will not know more before Tuesday, however this does state that Cancer of the Prostate can lead to unsteadiness and shortness of breath. These along with leg cramps and pain while walking are all things I have been treated for however no one had tested me for Prostate Cancer at this point. Cancer of prostate develops in the prostate gland and typically develops slowly. Advanced prostate cancer could extend to the brain or other body parts. The brain is one of the most common sites of metastasis from solid tumors. When symptoms of metastatic cancer take place, the type and frequency of the symptoms will rely on the size and location of the metastasis. For instance, cancer that extends to the bones is probable to lead to pain and can cause bone fractures. Cancer that extends to the brain can lead to various symptoms including headaches, seizures and unsteadiness. Shortness of breath might be a sign of lung involvement.

      "Content": "Thank you I was just diagnosed with the Prostate Cancer earlier this month. My doctor sent in a blood test and it returned with what he called Double Digit PSA numbers I believe. The Specialist found 70-75 percent of the needle biopsy samples contained cancer. He immediately ordered a Bone Scan and Kat Scan that I had yesterday and will find out the extent of the cancer on Tuesday. This is all new to me. I mentioned the unsteadiness because someone told me how they experienced some of what I have been having because it spread to his internal organs possibly his liver. I had Vertigo a couple years back, a bad case of it. It never seemed to go away and my legs started to cramp and my unsteadiness seemed to get worse. The person I spoke to have a similar experience and it was the cancer spreading to his internal organs. A lot of time was wasted on treating what we thought was Vertigo and the doctor thought the cramping and my problems with walking were from medications. I found this site and asked the question because this happened to this individual I was hoping to find out if this was something others experienced. Believe me I am not well versed in this yet. I know the Specialist felt someone should have been testing me more regularly and by the time I got there my count was high. I insisted on a Blood Test because of my wife who understands these things much better then I do made it clear I had to get a blood test it had been too long since my last. Now the Specialist told my wife and I to let our sons know they need to be getting tested starting at the age of 40, he suspects it runs in the family. I told him my father, Uncle and Grandfather died of life style issues and we would not have known if they had Prostate Cancer because smoking and drinking took them out in the long run. All this is new to me, I have much to learn, if my answers are not complete I go Tuesday and will try to get more complete answers.",

      "Content": "A couple years ago I had several bad days with Vertigo. I mentioned to the doctor that the Vertigo never seemed to go away and recently he did a MRI of my inner ears and found nothing. Did or does anyone ever experience an unsteadiness with Prostate Cancer as a symptom? A month ago they found my blood count is double digits. I had a Bone Scan and Kat Scan after a needle biopsy. They found 70 percent of the needle biopsy had cancer. My unsteadiness seems to be getting worse, could the cancer be attacking something that has made me this way? THANK YOU.[/SIZE][/B][/SIZE]",

      "Content": "Top User, My wife worked in Pathology for years and understands medicine much better than I do. She has been a blessing many times over the years. The Specialist did tell us I believe the count was 20+ PSA and 70-75 percent of the Needle Biopsies showed cancer and he immediately ordered the Bone Scan and Kat Scan. Tuesday we meet with him again to go over those tests. He realized that Nancy has a great ability of understanding medical issues, testing etc. He gave her a book to read on Prostate Cancer to read since we did not have time to go over all the facts in that visit. Again on Tuesday she is going with me again, I told the Specialist and his staff they could share everything with me four or five times or ONCE with Nancy. I also told them they are completely free to discuss my case with her as if they were talking to me. Once we have that visit I will share with you what we have learned since the tests yesterday. THANK YOU ALL AGAIN, and thank God for this forum!",

      "Content": "I don't know what happened to my last posting. I will not know more before Tuesday, however this does state that Cancer of the Prostate can lead to unsteadiness and shortness of breath. These along with leg cramps and pain while walking are all things I have been treated for however no one had tested me for Prostate Cancer at this point. Cancer of prostate develops in the prostate gland and typically develops slowly. Advanced prostate cancer could extend to the brain or other body parts. The brain is one of the most common sites of metastasis from solid tumors. When symptoms of metastatic cancer take place, the type and frequency of the symptoms will rely on the size and location of the metastasis. For instance, cancer that extends to the bones is probable to lead to pain and can cause bone fractures. Cancer that extends to the brain can lead to various symptoms including headaches, seizures and unsteadiness. Shortness of breath might be a sign of lung involvement. Article Source: http://EzineArticles.com/3877141 When I learn more on Tuesday I will come back with more information. THANK YOU FOR ALL YOUR PATIENCE AND HELP, this is all new to me and I realize some of my answers are not what you need to share more.",

      "Content": "Thank you I was just diagnosed with the Prostate Cancer earlier this month. My doctor sent in a blood test and it returned with what he called Double Digit PSA numbers I believe. The Specialist found 70-75 percent of the needle biopsy samples contained cancer. He immediately ordered a Bone Scan and Kat Scan that I had yesterday and will find out the extent of the cancer on Tuesday. This is all new to me. I mentioned the unsteadiness because someone told me how they experienced some of what I have been having because it spread to his internal organs possibly his liver. I had Vertigo a couple years back, a bad case of it. It never seemed to go away and my legs started to cramp and my unsteadiness seemed to get worse. The person I spoke to have a similar experience and it was the cancer spreading to his internal organs. A lot of time was wasted on treating what we thought was Vertigo and the doctor thought the cramping and my problems with walking were from medications. I found this site and asked the question because this happened to this individual I was hoping to find out if this was something others experienced. Believe me I am not well versed in this yet. I know the Specialist felt someone should have been testing me more regularly and by the time I got there my count was high. I insisted on a Blood Test because of my wife who understands these things much better then I do made it clear I had to get a blood test it had been too long since my last. Now the Specialist told my wife and I to let our sons know they need to be getting tested starting at the age of 40, he suspects it runs in the family. I told him my father, Uncle and Grandfather died of life style issues and we would not have known if they had Prostate Cancer because smoking and drinking took them out in the long run. All this is new to me, I have much to learn, if my answers are not complete I go Tuesday and will try to get more complete answers.",

      "Content": "My Primary Doctor was not one for testing and I figured he was knew best, that was my mistake. In May I had to go to the him and Nancy said to insist on a PSA it had been too long already. I insisted and he agreed to do the PSA Test. The PSA was 20.7, the Radiation Oncologist went over my records closely and found the last time the Primary Doctor did a PSA was four years ago and my PSA was only 2. He wasn't going to say anything but you could sense that he did not think it was good that my Primary had not done a PSA in four years. This time the Primary Doctor did the PSA only because I insisted because of Nancy's advice and it went from 2.0 to 20.7 and my Gleason is 7 in those four years. If I had a yearly PSA they may have discovered this before it got this high. The Radiation Oncologist also said because it did increase that much in four years it was the more aggressive form of Prostate Cancer and had to be treated immediately. This is what the Urologist had to us and he had us go to the Oncologist for a second opinion immediately. They both told us to tell my sons to start having PSAs starting at age 40 and to have them regularly and not let their Doctor allow four years to pass between them. I had the Needle Biopsy and it showed that 70-75 percent of the test issue had cancer in it. We do not know my fathers family history because they died of other issues from years of smoking and drinking, my mothers side were all dead early on and we had no way of finding a history of it in Moms' family anymore. The PSA testing is a painless easy way to test, I regret not insisting sooner or more often. I would recommend it at the very least. It put us on to my Prostate Cancer and the need for more testing and direct testing and treatment",

      "Content": "mkane09, I believe you are correct, years ago NBC did a report on Americans dying of treatable diseases because they could not afford the treatments. It is happening again and will more in the coming months and years. The IRS has been assigned to regulate the Obama Health Care Coverage by the Obama Administration. I had to go to the emergency room for a badly broken wrist 2 years ago, it looked like a Z shape. After giving my name we sat and sat and sat as families brought their children into the emergency room as though it their family doctor's office. Finally I could not stand the pain anymore, it required an operation and steel plate to repair, I went up to the window and asked how does one get a broken wrist looked at since we were waiting for people with simple colds to get treated? The nurse said WHAT MAKES YOU THINK YOU HAVE A BROKEN WRIST AND I SHOWED HER THE Z shaped wrist. She said I will get a doctor. Anymore our area of USA has become a relocation center for the Caribbean Commonwealth of the USA. They get what they need free or from a program. I am asking myself do I want to spend our life savings to try to live and still die leaving Nancy broke or die and leave Nancy with some kind of resources. Nancy will not hear of it, she wants me. I love her and I worry who will take care of her because she is not included in any of these special treatment groups. We got a Blue Cross Blue Shield Blue for SENIORS supplemental health care policy a PPO. THE FIRST SPECIALIST WE WENT TO see SAID HE DOES NOT ACCEPT it because it restricts the treatments too much for people who need the prescribed treatments. His staff was tried of fighting with BC/BS for the patients. Swell the first time we tried to use our SPECIAL SENIOR plan the SPECIALIST does not accept it and it was supposedly designed for SENIORS.

      "Content": "What I learned about LEG PAIN after months of Hormone Therapy this past week at my 6 Month Checkup. My PSA was 20.9, Gleason 7 and the split was 4/3 last spring when my Prostate was diagnosed. I never had any really outward symptoms before the first PSA test my doctor would do in 4 years. I had 45 Radiation Treatments and a string of Hormones starting before the Radiation Treatments that continue for a full 22 or 24 months. A month after the Radiation Treatments were completed I began to have pains in both my legs, the pains were in both legs and identical. They continued to get stronger and my family doctor wrote me a prescription of an Anti Inflammatory medication. This week I questioned my Radiation Doctor if the pain could be related to my treatments and not my cancer spreading. He said Oh yes some people get these leg pains from the Hormone Treatments. He said if I could stand to go on with them the chance of the Cancer returning are greatly reduced. If I had less or discontinued the Hormones there is a greater chance of the cancer returning. I told him I am most relieved it is not Cancer spreading and I will continue to deal with the leg pains knowing now what it is. I should add my PSA is currently 0.1 so the leg pain is a painful distraction believe me, however it is worth it to get PSAs like this. The Compulsion from the Hormone Treatments to run out and have my nails done and get a perm is decreasing too, JOKE",

They try to help me walk faster by taking my hands, they mean well however I can not move faster the pain has slowed me up. If I cough it can be enough to send the pains down both legs for a sharp minute.

The Specialist did tell us I believe the count was 20+ PSA and 70-75 percent of the Needle Biopsies showed cancer and he immediately ordered the Bone Scan and Kat Scan. Tuesday we meet with him again to go over those tests. He realized that Nancy has a great ability of understanding medical issues, testing etc. He gave her a book to read on Prostate Cancer to read since we did not have time to go over all the facts in that visit. Again on Tuesday she is going with me again, I told the Specialist and his staff they could share everything with me four or five times or ONCE with Nancy. I also told them they are completely free to discuss my case with her as if they were talking to me. Once we have that visit I will share with you what we have learned since the tests yesterday. THANK YOU ALL AGAIN, and thank God for this forum!",

The Specialist did tell us I believe the count was 20+ PSA and 70-75 percent of the Needle Biopsies showed cancer and he immediately ordered the Bone Scan and Kat Scan. Tuesday we meet with him again to go over those tests. He realized that Nancy has a great ability of understanding medical issues, testing etc. He gave her a book to read on Prostate Cancer to read since we did not have time to go over all the facts in that visit. Again on Tuesday she is going with me again, I told the Specialist and his staff they could share everything with me four or five times or ONCE with Nancy. I also told them they are completely free to discuss my case with her as if they were talking to me. Once we have that visit I will share with you what we have learned since the tests yesterday. THANK YOU ALL AGAIN, and thank God for this forum!",

A bigger worry will be the blood in your urine and semen..Be SURE to stop taking aspirin or fish oil 2 weeks before the procedure or heavy bleeding can result...You may want to purge your semen yourself after a few days to avoid shocking your sex partner.. Fairwind, you are right, my doctor told me this might happen and to be prepared. I had Kidney Stones over the years and had blood in my urine however with this it was much deeper in color and took me back for a minute. In a few days it got better and soon it was gone. I only mentioned it because it was not like my Kidney stone experience it was a much deeper red after my biopsy. I had to take a strong antibiotic the night before the biopsy, the morning of it that night again and the next morning. I had no problems with an infection now I am having the Gold flakes placed in my Prostate this week and it is the same thing again for this procedure.",

      "Content": "I don't know what happened to my last posting. I will not know more before Tuesday, however this does state that Cancer of the Prostate can lead to unsteadiness and shortness of breath. These along with leg cramps and pain while walking are all things I have been treated for however no one had tested me for Prostate Cancer at this point. Cancer of prostate develops in the prostate gland and typically develops slowly. Advanced prostate cancer could extend to the brain or other body parts. The brain is one of the most common sites of metastasis from solid tumors. When symptoms of metastatic cancer take place, the type and frequency of the symptoms will rely on the size and location of the metastasis. For instance, cancer that extends to the bones is probable to lead to pain and can cause bone fractures. Cancer that extends to the brain can lead to various symptoms including headaches, seizures and unsteadiness. Shortness of breath might be a sign of lung involvement. Article Source: http://EzineArticles.com/3877141 When I learn more on Tuesday I will come back with more information.

      "Content": "Thank you I was just diagnosed with the Prostate Cancer earlier this month. My doctor sent in a blood test and it returned with what he called Double Digit PSA numbers I believe. The Specialist found 70-75 percent of the needle biopsy samples contained cancer. He immediately ordered a Bone Scan and Kat Scan that I had yesterday and will find out the extent of the cancer on Tuesday. This is all new to me. I mentioned the unsteadiness because someone told me how they experienced some of what I have been having because it spread to his internal organs possibly his liver. I had Vertigo a couple years back, a bad case of it. It never seemed to go away and my legs started to cramp and my unsteadiness seemed to get worse. The person I spoke to have a similar experience and it was the cancer spreading to his internal organs. A lot of time was wasted on treating what we thought was Vertigo and the doctor thought the cramping and my problems with walking were from medications. I found this site and asked the question because this happened to this individual I was hoping to find out if this was something others experienced. Believe me I am not well versed in this yet. I know the Specialist felt someone should have been testing me more regularly and by the time I got there my count was high. I insisted on a Blood Test because of my wife who understands these things much better then I do made it clear I had to get a blood test it had been too long since my last. Now the Specialist told my wife and I to let our sons know they need to be getting tested starting at the age of 40, he suspects it runs in the family. I told him my father, Uncle and Grandfather died of life style issues and we would not have known if they had Prostate Cancer because smoking and drinking took them out in the long run. All this is new to me, I have much to learn, if my answers are not complete I go Tuesday and will try to get more complete answers.",

If this was to becomes too costly and with the Obama changes apparently creating new and higher premiums with less options I have thought I would rather not even begin treatment. We live in an area where there was a large steel corporation. People I know worked long and hard to provide for their families to have some security after their passing. The steel corporation went belly up and the families have squat now. The wives are struggling to keep things going with the husbands having died and the company closing. We have several other large industries that have done this leaving the family struggling. I love my wife and she loves me, she wants the best for me and I for her. For me I don't want to leave her broke and struggling in this economy so I get a couple more years.

In men with early-stage prostate cancer, hormone therapy may be used to shrink tumors before radiation therapy. This can make it more likely that radiation therapy will be successful.

      "Content": "You bring up an issue I have been concerned with the cost of all this care. We have Medicare and a Secondary Plan from my wife's job. She hopes to work at least another year for now. I do not want to leave her with debt or eat up our savings trying to get me refurbished. If this was to becomes too costly and with the Obama changes apparently creating new and higher premiums with less options I have thought I would rather not even begin treatment. We live in an area where there was a large steel corporation. People I know worked long and hard to provide for their families to have some security after their passing. The steel corporation went belly up and the families have squat now. The wives are struggling to keep things going with the husbands having died and the company closing. We have several other large industries that have done this leaving the family struggling. I love my wife and she loves me, she wants the best for me and I for her. For me I don't want to leave her broke and struggling in this economy so I get a couple more years. She will not even discuss this with me, as I see the amounts of money it could cost us to get a couple more years I really struggle with even getting treatment.",

Nancy knows everything I do about my Prostate Cancer the 20.7 PSA, Gleason Score of 7 and 70-75% of the biopsy tissue was cancerous. My Bone Scan and Kat Scan were good, however the Radiation Oncologist told us because of the speed of increase in the PSA in 4 years and the Gleason Score this is a more Aggressive Form of Prostate Cancer and we need to get busy. I have started the Hormone Therapy to prepare for the Radiation Treatments. At this point I am scheduled for a Radiation Treatment 5 times a week for 9 weeks for a total of 45 Radiation Treatments. There is a strong possibility of continued of more and continued Hormone Therapy during and after the Radiation. Nancy is asking me if anyone has mentioned the number of Radiation Treatments they had and if 45 is a lot. I know the Oncologist was VERY concerned and is considered one of the very best and respected in our part of Eastern PA. So the bottom line is 45 Radiation Treatments in 9 weeks a lot, average or whatever and MANY THANKS,",
