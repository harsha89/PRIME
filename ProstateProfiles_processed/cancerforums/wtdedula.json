The three tips that came in most handy for me included bringing a 10 feet extention cord for yoyr tablet; Chap Stick for dry lips, and.... Buying an abdominal binder on Amazon, under prostate equipment, that put light pressure where it needs to be after surgery. Much better than a pillow and a great $15 investment.

      "Content": "Originally Posted by Pratoman Today I had my MRI with contrast done at MSKCC. They are very thorough. They gave me a shot of something-or-other that is used to quiet the bowel, to minimize movement. And just before I went into the room, they took a wand and moved it over my body, to make sure I didn't have any metal inside me besides the 2 stents that I told them about. After the test was done, the technician who was a friendly dude made a comment that really surprised me. He said \"in all the years I've been working here, I don't recall ever seeing a recurrence of prostate cancer.\" I'm like, \"WHAT?\" But I didn't respond or persue it, I just chose to believe it because we all believe what we want to believe. Now I wait for the results. With a PSA of .03 as of end of May, I'd be shocked if it picked up any prostate cancer. But I figure, exactly for the fact that I'm not worried about it, they will probably find some collateral unexpected thing that is worse, like bladder cancer, or some other disaster. But if I didn't think that, I wouldn't be me. One thing I know, if they do find that, I'm not having a cystoscope. No matter what. Ever. The MRI was done only because the RO wanted a baseline, just in case I continue to see PSA rising. Guess I'll call next week for the results. I'm too scared to sign up for the MSKCC patient portal Hey, Pratoman - Maybe I shouldn't ask, but what's wrong with a cystoscope ? I have Robotic RP in a few days (Next Tuesday) and I believe my surgeon ordered a cystoscope on the day of my followup appointment, I'm assuming to check to see how the bladder is healing to determine if it is safe to have my catheter removed. Is it painful, dangerous, etc ... ? Tim",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by Busby I was going over my pathology report before my meeting with doc tomorrow. My report states: The tumor infiltrates as discrete, infiltrative, compressed, irregular glands as well as cribriforming sheets and glomeruloid structures and involves the prostate bilaterally from apex to mid-base.

It seems that fairly recently, the staging and reporting of prostate cancer has changed and it has been recommended that cribriforming patterns be reported on biopsy and pathology reports (as gleason 4). I'm certainly going to go over this with my doc and maybe get some more info from the pathologist.

I also researched glomeruloid structures but there is no conclusive data on prognosis other than it's associated with more aggressive forms of cancer. I find this fascinating.

      "Content": "Originally Posted by joseywales Brothers, At my cancer conference I asked my doctor about activities or foods I should avoid. He said, \"Don't worry about anything.\" I started doing a bit of reading and made an appointment with a nutritionist. I know diet is not going to cure my cancer, but if there are things that contributed to it it seems logical to slash them. Dairy and red meet seem like good candidates. I weighed in at 123lbs clothed. That's a little light for me. Body fat was estimated at 16.8 and BMI at 19.8 Here's what the nutritionist said: I'd like to get you up to 130 or 135 pre-treatment because you will lose some weight with any treatment. Let's try to add lean muscle Reduce cardio and increase weight training. Eat lean protein. Eat more fruits and vegetables. Drink plenty of water. Eat two eggs for breakfast. Eat legumes, but no more than 8oz per meal. Chicken and fish are good. Eat wild caught fish over farm raised. Have half a protein shake in the morning and half in the evening. Continue with B12 and multi-vitamins. Add D3 and probiotics. The goal is to consume 70-80g of protein per day. Whole grains are good. I asked about eggs, because I had heard some mixed things about them. She said they were good. I asked about sugar. \"Sugar feeds cancer,\" she said. My uncle, who had throat cancer had already told me this and I thought it odd she did not bring it up. I asked about sugar in protein shakes. She said, \"Get one with Stevia.\" So, here are my questions: I had heard that grains in general cause inflammation and inflammation is not good. What can you tell me about whole grains? It seems like if cancer loves sugar it would love stevia just as much. Am I incorrect in this hypothesis? I haven't had good luck finding much on eggs. MDA's website says they have gotten a bad rap but are good for you. I know they contain a lot of choline and had read something about choline being used in PET scans because it goes to the cancer. I did some reading. Even broccoli contains choline. What can you tell me about eggs? If anyone has any thoughts or recommendations, please let me know. Thanks! Josey \"When things look bad, and it looks like you're not gonna make it, you've gotta get mean. I mean mad dog mean, because if you lose your head in a fight you neither win nor live. That's just the way it is.\" I have studied nutrition informally for many years due to my type 2 diabetes (and later PCa) and can give you my thoughts on the items above ... You asked about grains. Well, some grains may be OK if you don't have diabetes but grains in general turn into sugar and raise blood sugar so they could feed cancer and also cause inflamation. My personal opinion is that everyone would do better with less grains and diabetics should eliminate them alltogether (as I did). By the way, as a type 2 diabetic, removing grains was the best thing I ever did to lower my blood sugar. In the standard american diet, every american dish contains some grains usually and this is not necessary doing anyone any good. Stevia is OK because it does not raise blood sugar - it is a herb, not a sugar. Also check out Erythritol and to a lesser extent, xylitol - both of these are sugar alcohols which doesn't affect blood sugar much if at all but xylitol in particular and erythritol to a lesser extent could cause a laxitive effect if too much is eaten at a time. If you have a dog, I believe it is xylitol that you have to watch out for because it could be fatal to dogs since they can't digest it but the issue doesn't exist in humans. I used to bake cakes with only xylitol and they tasted just like sugar. Though cakes are problematic unless you can find a grain free cake which perhaps uses almond or some other grain-free flour rather than white grain-based flour. I can't weigh in on eggs because I don't like them so I may be biased if I do. But eggs are probably OK. There is some research that animal protein may affect Prostate Cancer but I think most if the problem centers around red meat. Much of the scientific literature on PCa and nutrition suggest a link to Red Meat and PCa. I would also recommend staying away from dairy as it could be problematic due to casein and cheese in particular is very addicting. Interestingly, for me I was eating Vegan from the time of diagnosis with PCa and my robotic surgery and between that 3 month period, my PSA didn't increase that fast, only a few tenths of a point as I recall. However, I started eating meat and probably more red meat than I should about a year after my surgery and my PSA is starting to climb (Not much but .02 in 3 months) and perhaps that would have been slowed if I had eaten Vegan instead. I don't however think anyone has to go vegan to do good with Prostate Cancer, I suspect it's a good idea to stay away from Red Meat or only eat it once or twice a month and the rest of the time, eat chicken or a vegan dish. Of all of the scientific literature I've looked at, I can't find anything bad said about poultry (Chicken, turkey, etc ...). In fact, I looked at a few studies recently that said there was no link between poultry consumption and PCa. Of there's definitely a benefit to adding more vegetables to your diet or eating some meals a week vegan and no meat at all. Nowadays, there are many vegan meat substitutes such as soybean pasta (Which I like) and bean pasta (also good if you can get over the black color). I would stay away anything with soy protein isolate or anything like that because it's highly processed and may have health consequences. There are also many recipes on the internet for vegan meat substitutes that you make from scratch - these are the best and most healthiest because you know what goes into them. Couple of other things you may want to look into - Consider adding tumeric root to some of your dishes, also fresh garlic and fresh ginger root, all Organic if possible. Also green tea (Like Matcha) is good too. All of these help decrease inflammation which could improve a cancer outcome. I want to mention I'm not a nutritionist but only a concerned citizen trying to improve my own health as much as possible and live as long as I can. Hope this helps - these are my personal opinions which could change over time if new research comes to light. Tim",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by Trex Dino wtdedula ... I really do like my URO, and the RO I saw yesterday I liked too. What stood out with my RO yesterday is that he agreed that I should get all the information I could from the other RO and two surgeons I am scheduled to see in order for me to figure out the best treatment plan for myself. Yesterday's RO was factual and to the point sharing his opinion with confidence and never gave me the impression it was his way or the highway. In addition to my diet from my URO ... I really need to give credit to my wife (of 35+ years) who is well read, informed and supportive of what is good for me with my diet and supplements. My wife allows me to veer a little off course for my mental health then nudges me back in line (nudge = kick in the ass). Blessings of being married to an Irish Newfie woman. Awesone, DT looks you're well taken care of on all fronts . I'm in search of a good RO too though not for initial treatment like you, but for possible BCR. If I end up needing radiation, I have high hopes that an RO can knock this cancer out for good due to my fairly favorable pathology. I have my initial RO #1 appt. in about a week. Will likely call a few more next week to get differing opinions. Hopefully I can settle on one I really like and trust like you. Wishing you the best of success no matter what treatment you chose. Your nutrition strategy should help with your success. I'll probably switch to nearly 100% vegetarian until I determine what my PSA is doing and if I'll need radiation in the event it could help slow the growth. Tim",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by Trex Dino When I was recently DX my URO said to cut out red meat, dairy and follow a veggie based diet ... allowing for occasional wild salmon. I cut out as much sugar products such as any sweets, pastas, breads and alcohol (though fudge with two or three small glasses of red wine a week). Breakfast is the only time a have a little dairy having cottage cheese with flax oil, medley of fresh fruit, dash of cinnamon and walnuts. Lunch is a variety of fresh vegetables with avocado oil, vinegar and tumeric. Dinner is mainly veggies with occasional small amount of meat. The other night I had a homemade tomato sauce over spaghetti squash with two very small meatballs (wife and daughter had pasta with a side of squash) along with a garden salad. Once a week have a boiled egg as a snack. Dessert is usually a big spoonful of almond butter with chopped almonds and a glass of almond or coconut milk. Beverages is copious amount of coffee in the morning with water throughout the day. Once a week is cheat night. This Sunday it will be take out Chinese food. Really needed to get on this diet as want to drop another 10 lbs to run (slow run) a 12k on May 5th. Td - That sounds like an excellent and logical plan to me. I like your doctor and I wish I could find a doctor with good advice like that. It's OK to indulge once in a while (Few times a month) but I wouldn't do it every day. Tim",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by Trex Dino wtdedula ... I really do like my URO, and the RO I saw yesterday I liked too. What stood out with my RO yesterday is that he agreed that I should get all the information I could from the other RO and two surgeons I am scheduled to see in order for me to figure out the best treatment plan for myself. Yesterday's RO was factual and to the point sharing his opinion with confidence and never gave me the impression it was his way or the highway. In addition to my diet from my URO ... I really need to give credit to my wife (of 35+ years) who is well read, informed and supportive of what is good for me with my diet and supplements. My wife allows me to veer a little off course for my mental health then nudges me back in line (nudge = kick in the ass). Blessings of being married to an Irish Newfie woman. Awesone, DT looks you're well taken care of on all fronts . I'm in search of a good RO too though not for initial treatment like you, but for possible BCR. If I end up needing radiation, I have high hopes that an RO can knock this cancer out for good due to my fairly favorable pathology. I have my initial RO #1 appt. in about a week. Will likely call a few more next week to get differing opinions. Hopefully I can settle on one I really like and trust like you. Wishing you the best of success no matter what treatment you chose. Your nutrition strategy should help with your success. I'll probably switch to nearly 100% vegetarian until I determine what my PSA is doing and if I'll need radiation in the event it could help slow the growth. Tim",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by Ready2Fight Hi Tim. You should be seeing an RO now. Personally I wouldn't waste my time with a NP. Go right to the RO. Thanks for your suggestion, Ready2Fight. I did make an appointment with a RO in 1-1/2 weeks (Early March) so I'm good there. The appointment secretary said that the doctor is out next week and wondered if i wanted to see someone else in the office and I said no I'll wait because I didn't think waiting 1-week longer would make much of a difference considering my relatively favorable pathology and relatively low PSA. But I'm still wondering if there is any benefit to having followup appointments for my surgery or if most folks just followup with their regular urologist? Tim",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by joseywales Brothers, At my cancer conference I asked my doctor about activities or foods I should avoid. He said, \"Don't worry about anything.\" I started doing a bit of reading and made an appointment with a nutritionist. I know diet is not going to cure my cancer, but if there are things that contributed to it it seems logical to slash them. Dairy and red meet seem like good candidates. I weighed in at 123lbs clothed. That's a little light for me. Body fat was estimated at 16.8 and BMI at 19.8 Here's what the nutritionist said: I'd like to get you up to 130 or 135 pre-treatment because you will lose some weight with any treatment. Let's try to add lean muscle Reduce cardio and increase weight training. Eat lean protein. Eat more fruits and vegetables. Drink plenty of water. Eat two eggs for breakfast. Eat legumes, but no more than 8oz per meal. Chicken and fish are good. Eat wild caught fish over farm raised. Have half a protein shake in the morning and half in the evening. Continue with B12 and multi-vitamins. Add D3 and probiotics. The goal is to consume 70-80g of protein per day. Whole grains are good. I asked about eggs, because I had heard some mixed things about them. She said they were good. I asked about sugar. \"Sugar feeds cancer,\" she said. My uncle, who had throat cancer had already told me this and I thought it odd she did not bring it up. I asked about sugar in protein shakes. She said, \"Get one with Stevia.\" So, here are my questions: I had heard that grains in general cause inflammation and inflammation is not good. What can you tell me about whole grains? It seems like if cancer loves sugar it would love stevia just as much. Am I incorrect in this hypothesis? I haven't had good luck finding much on eggs. MDA's website says they have gotten a bad rap but are good for you. I know they contain a lot of choline and had read something about choline being used in PET scans because it goes to the cancer. I did some reading. Even broccoli contains choline. What can you tell me about eggs? If anyone has any thoughts or recommendations, please let me know. Thanks! Josey \"When things look bad, and it looks like you're not gonna make it, you've gotta get mean. I mean mad dog mean, because if you lose your head in a fight you neither win nor live. That's just the way it is.\" I have studied nutrition informally for many years due to my type 2 diabetes (and later PCa) and can give you my thoughts on the items above ... You asked about grains. Well, some grains may be OK if you don't have diabetes but grains in general turn into sugar and raise blood sugar so they could feed cancer and also cause inflamation. My personal opinion is that everyone would do better with less grains and diabetics should eliminate them alltogether (as I did). By the way, as a type 2 diabetic, removing grains was the best thing I ever did to lower my blood sugar. In the standard american diet, every american dish contains some grains usually and this is not necessary doing anyone any good. Stevia is OK because it does not raise blood sugar - it is a herb, not a sugar. Also check out Erythritol and to a lesser extent, xylitol - both of these are sugar alcohols which doesn't affect blood sugar much if at all but xylitol in particular and erythritol to a lesser extent could cause a laxitive effect if too much is eaten at a time. If you have a dog, I believe it is xylitol that you have to watch out for because it could be fatal to dogs since they can't digest it but the issue doesn't exist in humans. I used to bake cakes with only xylitol and they tasted just like sugar. Though cakes are problematic unless you can find a grain free cake which perhaps uses almond or some other grain-free flour rather than white grain-based flour. I can't weigh in on eggs because I don't like them so I may be biased if I do. But eggs are probably OK. There is some research that animal protein may affect Prostate Cancer but I think most if the problem centers around red meat. Much of the scientific literature on PCa and nutrition suggest a link to Red Meat and PCa. I would also recommend staying away from dairy as it could be problematic due to casein and cheese in particular is very addicting. Interestingly, for me I was eating Vegan from the time of diagnosis with PCa and my robotic surgery and between that 3 month period, my PSA didn't increase that fast, only a few tenths of a point as I recall. However, I started eating meat and probably more red meat than I should about a year after my surgery and my PSA is starting to climb (Not much but .02 in 3 months) and perhaps that would have been slowed if I had eaten Vegan instead. I don't however think anyone has to go vegan to do good with Prostate Cancer, I suspect it's a good idea to stay away from Red Meat or only eat it once or twice a month and the rest of the time, eat chicken or a vegan dish. Of all of the scientific literature I've looked at, I can't find anything bad said about poultry (Chicken, turkey, etc ...). In fact, I looked at a few studies recently that said there was no link between poultry consumption and PCa. Of there's definitely a benefit to adding more vegetables to your diet or eating some meals a week vegan and no meat at all. Nowadays, there are many vegan meat substitutes such as soybean pasta (Which I like) and bean pasta (also good if you can get over the black color). I would stay away anything with soy protein isolate or anything like that because it's highly processed and may have health consequences. There are also many recipes on the internet for vegan meat substitutes that you make from scratch - these are the best and most healthiest because you know what goes into them. Couple of other things you may want to look into - Consider adding tumeric root to some of your dishes, also fresh garlic and fresh ginger root, all Organic if possible. Also green tea (Like Matcha) is good too. All of these help decrease inflammation which could improve a cancer outcome. I want to mention I'm not a nutritionist but only a concerned citizen trying to improve my own health as much as possible and live as long as I can. Hope this helps - these are my personal opinions which could change over time if new research comes to light. Tim",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by Ready2Fight For us our URO surgeon told us he didn't need to see us anymore. He said we could even just get our PSA tests through our family doctor. Once we had a slight rise on the uPSA that's when we connected with the RO. I was ordering the uPSA and paying out of pocket while we were with the URO surgeon. Once we started seeing the RO, she did give me the RX for the uPSA which was something the URO surgeon said he wasn't going to give me and he didn't want me seeking it out. During the year that his PSA was more or less \"steady\" while we were under the care of our RO and we thought things were going along somewhat uneventfully the plan was to either get an annual DRE from a local URO or our RO. We ended up getting the DRE from the RO. I suppose in hindsight, I should have sought out a RO right after surgery. But hoping my RO does what is necessary when I see him in about 12 days and if warranted, will expedite getting treatment started. Tim",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by Ready2Fight For us our URO surgeon told us he didn't need to see us anymore. He said we could even just get our PSA tests through our family doctor. Once we had a slight rise on the uPSA that's when we connected with the RO. I was ordering the uPSA and paying out of pocket while we were with the URO surgeon. Once we started seeing the RO, she did give me the RX for the uPSA which was something the URO surgeon said he wasn't going to give me and he didn't want me seeking it out. During the year that his PSA was more or less \"steady\" while we were under the care of our RO and we thought things were going along somewhat uneventfully the plan was to either get an annual DRE from a local URO or our RO. We ended up getting the DRE from the RO. I suppose in hindsight, I should have sought out a RO right after surgery. But hoping my RO does what is necessary when I see him in about 12 days and if warranted, will expedite getting treatment started. Tim",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by Ready2Fight Hi Tim. You should be seeing an RO now. Personally I wouldn't waste my time with a NP. Go right to the RO. Thanks for your suggestion, Ready2Fight. I did make an appointment with a RO in 1-1/2 weeks (Early March) so I'm good there. The appointment secretary said that the doctor is out next week and wondered if i wanted to see someone else in the office and I said no I'll wait because I didn't think waiting 1-week longer would make much of a difference considering my relatively favorable pathology and relatively low PSA. But I'm still wondering if there is any benefit to having followup appointments for my surgery or if most folks just followup with their regular urologist? Tim",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by Trex Dino When I was recently DX my URO said to cut out red meat, dairy and follow a veggie based diet ... allowing for occasional wild salmon. I cut out as much sugar products such as any sweets, pastas, breads and alcohol (though fudge with two or three small glasses of red wine a week). Breakfast is the only time a have a little dairy having cottage cheese with flax oil, medley of fresh fruit, dash of cinnamon and walnuts. Lunch is a variety of fresh vegetables with avocado oil, vinegar and tumeric. Dinner is mainly veggies with occasional small amount of meat. The other night I had a homemade tomato sauce over spaghetti squash with two very small meatballs (wife and daughter had pasta with a side of squash) along with a garden salad. Once a week have a boiled egg as a snack. Dessert is usually a big spoonful of almond butter with chopped almonds and a glass of almond or coconut milk. Beverages is copious amount of coffee in the morning with water throughout the day. Once a week is cheat night. This Sunday it will be take out Chinese food. Really needed to get on this diet as want to drop another 10 lbs to run (slow run) a 12k on May 5th. Td - That sounds like an excellent and logical plan to me. I like your doctor and I wish I could find a doctor with good advice like that. It's OK to indulge once in a while (Few times a month) but I wouldn't do it every day. Tim",

      "Content": "ktboston; Interestingly but unfortunately, I also ended up in the emergency room the very night I had my catheter removed. About midnight, I began experiencing back pain that was very strange in that I could never get comfortable and then that moved to being stomach pain. I don't like going to the emergency room because I don't think they're particularly helpful and I don't like all of those tests run on me but I got scared thinking maybe urine was leaking so I reluctantly drove myself to the nearest hospital emergency room since I live alone. Urine didn't show an infection. CT Scan was normal (so no I wasn't leaking urine) but one blood test that the doctor on call called a pancreas number was abnormal but she said that that can happen sometimes so she didn't feel any additional tests were necessary. I was actually feeling better by the time the doctor came back with the results so I went home. I have never experienced that issue again in nearly a year since my catheter removal and hopefully I never will. I'm assuming I got some sort of infection when the catheter was removed which quickly resolved itself (fortunately). I don't think I had a fever, though. Tim",

      "Content": "Hi All; So now it's been nine weeks since my surgery August 1st. I am still struggling with incontinence but it's getting better. Now I can lay down (awake) or sit in a chair without involuntary urination. I do experience involuntary urination sometimes when getting up from a seated position or standing but it's not nearly as much as it used to. I, however do experience urination at night while sleeping. It seems my \"feeling\" that I have to urinate isn't as great post surgery as it was pre surgery and near as I can tell, I am letting my bladder fill up during the night but not always getting enough sensation that it wakes me up. Sometimes I wake up after starting to urinate and other times I don't. I do want to mention that I have a few factors that are causing me to urinate more often during the night than most of you, namely type 2 diabetes and medication. Anyone have any thought or ideas about this and has anyone else experienced it ? It is annoying of course and I would like it to stop. I'm having to wash my clothes and bedsheets each day. I will discuss this with my surgeon at my 3 month followup next month to see if he has ideas about if this is normal or what to do about it. Tim",

Hi rmotacek1; Nowadays most labs at major hospitals allow you to sign up to get your lab results on-line so you can see them usually within 24 hours of the lab performing the test. In the worst case scenario, you can go and visit the lab and fill out a form to request your lab work and they should give it to you on the spot.

How concerned should I be about the margin? Thanks for any input You had almost the same pathology report as me if you'll read my signature. I had a G3+4 but only a very small amount of 4. I also had a very small positive margin measuring 1mm whereas yours measured 2mm. If you look on a ruler, 1mm and 2mm are very small. Just like you, my gleason pattern at the positive margin is pattern 3 which is very slow growing. As some others suggested, discuss the implications of the positive margin with your uro surgeon but if I were you, I would feel pretty good about your overall pathology report. If you're curious, my URO surgeon said not to worry about my 1mm and yours will probably say the same thing about your 2mm. My URO surgeon told me he still thinks he cured me. Wishing you an undetectable PSA for as long as you live which I predict will be a very long time. Tim",

Gleason Score 7 (98% pattern 3, 2% pattern 4) Tertiary Pattern not applicable Tumor 10% Extraprostatic Extension: Not involved Seminal Vesicle Invasion : Not Identified Margins: Involved by carcinoma Length of positive margin: 2 mm Location of margin: left mid Gleason pattern at margin: 3 Lympovascular Invasion: Not identified Primary tumor: pT2c so it seems I have good news except for the positive margin. How concerned should I be about the margin? Thanks for any input You had almost the same pathology report as me if you'll read my signature. I had a G3+4 but only a very small amount of 4. I also had a very small positive margin measuring 1mm whereas yours measured 2mm. If you look on a ruler, 1mm and 2mm are very small. Just like you, my gleason pattern at the positive margin is pattern 3 which is very slow growing. As some others suggested, discuss the implications of the positive margin with your uro surgeon but if I were you, I would feel pretty good about your overall pathology report. If you're curious, my URO surgeon said not to worry about my 1mm and yours will probably say the same thing about your 2mm. My URO surgeon told me he still thinks he cured me. Wishing you an undetectable PSA for as long as you live which I predict will be a very long time. Tim",

      "Content": "Hello All; I need your advice and suggestions ... I had RP on August 1st and my 1 month and 3 month PSA tests were essentially undetectable. However, my surgeon at the Cleveland Clinic is not requesting a PSA test at 6 months but instead is requesting one at 9 months just prior to my followup appointment. Is this unusual given my pathology (below)? Don't surgeons usually test PSA every 3 months for a year or two after RP? Or is that just in aggressive cases ? Would you suggest I ask for a test at 6 months or just wait for my 9 month followup ? Tim",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by Busby da Vinci scheduled for January 9. I've settled on Dr. Michael Mangelson because he did his residency at Mayo Clinic and he helped pioneer a new way of doing the operation that produces a better outcome for continence. I even asked him about doing kegel exercises in prep for surgery and he said don't bother. I've been doing them anyway. I've been through multiple hernia surgeries, both laparoscopic and open, and I know all about having a sore abdomen for several weeks. Back then the nurses instructed me on how to get up and down without using my abs which really helped. I just hope the da Vinci prostatectomy is not as bad as my hernia surgeries. I can't go through that again. I checked with my hernia surgeon and he told me not to worry about the previous surgeries and the mesh. He said the prostatectomy is on a completely different plane than the hernia surgeries. I have read a LOT of threads on the da Vinci prostatectomy on this forum and about what to expect. I have two concerns: 1) I don't own a recliner and 2) I'm going to have to take care of myself most of the time. I have some friends coming to stay with me but I am on my own when it comes to managing the catheter and bag. This concerns me. From what I have read here, I need to keep the catheter clean and keep an antibacterial and/or numbing (lidocaine) ointment on the catheter at the tip of the penis. That's my biggest fear, keeping things clean and lubricated without passing out at the sight of blood. One thing confuses me. In all that I have read on this forum I see a lot of comments saying the surgery did not cause a lot of pain and many people just used over the counter pain relievers. But some of those same people talked about how sore their abs were and it made it difficult to get up and down. So I'm wondering if I use the heavy duty pain pills, can I alleviate the abdominal soreness? I'm a wimp when it comes to pain. Hi Busby; I'm going to add my 2 cents here since I have gone through RP about a year and a half ago and I was in a similar situation as you. I also did not own a recliner and was concerned that that would be an issue for me PRIOR to RP but I found out for me, it wasn't necessary after returning home from the hospital. I did, however find it necessary to camp out on my comfportable sofa in the livingroom and sleeping there too. I didn't experience that much pain (Except from the catheter - more on that later) and I was able to get up off the sofa OK without assistance. I don't recall having a lot of sureness. I also didn't have anyone to help me since I live alone but I did ask a good friend to stop by once in a while and to run a few errands for me like get pills, etc \u0085 I really didn't end up needing her that much, though. One thing I did was to stsock up on food that I can reheat easily. If you are a good cook like I am, you could make a large quantity of meals and freeze them prior to surgery so you can just pop them in the microwave for the first few weeks following surgery. I wasn't permitted to drive before I got the cathether out which I believe was about 10 days so you should buy or prepare/freeze about 2 weeks worth of food. What everyone says about pain is correct - there really isn't much pain following surgery and for me, I didn't require that much pain medication. I did experience some gas pain about a day following surgery I think due to the a surgical procedure they do and for me it was annoying but it passed in a day or so and was gone before I left the hospital. The doctor wanted to discharge me from the hosp. the very next morning following surgery but I had to stay an extra day because that was the earliest my friend could pick me up. There was only one big issue I had upon arriving home. My catheter began burning extremely severely a few days after returning home - so much so that it was difficult to even walk without pain. Though I pretty much fault the hospital for this as the (male) nurse who gave me my homegoing instructions did not explain a thing about care and cleaning of the catheter. I'm assuming I was supposed to lubricate the end but they didn't say anything about that or give me any instructions. Once I got help and suggestions on this very forum \u0085 I was already in a lot of pain and it was too late and the day to get it removed couldn't come sooner. So be sure to ask your nursing staff if they need to give you any catheter instructions prior to being discharged. I know a lot of men on here report no pain and I'll bet that's because they probably lubricated the tip. A couple more things about the catheter. You will experience a red liquid in the catheter a day or two or perhaps a bit more following surgery but that is normal. Things eventually cleared up for me. Though starting a few days before I was to have my catheter removed, I started seeing some residue come through the catheter tubing and I called the nurse and she said that was normal. Also, fyi - I did not require any assistance taking care of changing the catheter bag by myself. It's very easy - you probably just turn a valve on the bag to empty the liquid (in the toilet, of course). Hope this helps. Tim",

      "Content": "Thanks for all of your encouragement. Three years ago, my PSA was 2.9 and 2 months ago, it jumped to 5.9. I really don't know why (And I'm hitting myself for it now), why 2.9 didn't raise a red flag for me. Both doctor's who reviewed it didn't raise any concern. My internist doesn't order yearly psa tests for some reason and it just wasn't on my radar. I only had the psa test done three years ago because I got a physical from work and they automatically order them after age 50. I did not get a work physical in the two years thereafter but if I had, may have discovered a rising psa sooner. Regarding the nerve sparring stuff, I really don't understand any of that. However, he asked me my level of importance of three things and here's how I answered ... Most important was to get all of the cancer, second most important was to not have incontinence, and lowest priority was to not have ED. I know a lot would disagree with this order of priority but I have never been married and have never been sexually active so that is why I came to that decision. My largest concern is that he doesn what is necessary to live a normal lifespan. While I know a lot go through it, I am really fearful of high dose radiation as I believe it can lead to other cancer's. That's why I personally opted for surgery. Perhaps the doctor will eventually suggest radiation too after getting the final pathology report after surgery but hopefully not. I would feel better just to have the whole prostate removed. I have been eating an ultra healthy vegan diet for about the past 8 months (Long before I was diagnosed) along with fresh ginger, tumeric, and garlic every day and I expect that will help prevent a occurrence. I am thinking of getting a second opinion from MD Anderson. Since Prostate surgery is very serious, I would have no problem traveling a great distance to get better care I feel more comfortable with.

      "Content": "Originally Posted by oshguy Hi, Your situation sounds very similar to mine, and I also elected surgery. Active surveillance was not recommended for me, not that I would have gone that route anyway. I wanted that cancerous thing out of my body permanently! While I could have had the surgery closer to home, my urologist recommended either Johns Hopkins or Cleveland Clinic. I'm located about equidistant from both, and elected to go to Cleveland. My surgeon was Dr. Andrew Stephenson, and he did a great job with both nerve bundles spared. I also live alone, and a friend agreed to accompany me to the hospital for the surgery and stay with me for a short while during recovery, which was completely uneventful. I usually think a second opinion is beneficial, though once I met with Dr. Stephenson I had complete confidence in him and didn't seek out any other opinions. I suspect I would have felt the same with a Johns Hopkins surgeon as well, knowing that they're among the best in the world. I think if I were in your position and so close to the Cleveland Clinic that I would at least get an opinion from a surgeon there. Good luck, and keep us posted with your progress through this process. Thanks, ohsguy. I just submitted a request for a second opinion at the Cleveland Clinic. I also checked out Dr. Stephenson's bio and video and he looks great plus your referral (The only one I have so far) clinched the deal so I requested him. Not sure if I'll get him though but hope I do and don't have to wait too long. Tim",

      "Content": "Hello All; I'm 57 years old and I was diagnosed with prostate cancer about 3 weeks ago after getting a biopsy. My PSA was 5.9 a few months ago and my biopsy showed 6 cores positive with three a gleason 6 and three a gleason 7 (3+4). My urologist had me do a bone scan and mri and both were negative. What makes this harder is that I live alone and my mother passed away about 3 months ago. I do have two other brother's who I haven't told yet. Even though my urologist gave me the option of active surveillance, I didn't like the idea of waiting for the tumor to grow larger (which would cause me added stress) so I told my urologist that I wanted my prostate removed. He explained that this diagnosis was not a death sentence and a cure was possible. So he referred me to a robotic surgeon within his practice. I went to see the surgeon (Carson Wong) last week and while he seems like a competent surgeon (He said he did about 800 robotic surgeries when I asked him), I got the feeling like he rushed me through the appt. and didn't fully explain things. I was able to get a copy of the surgeon's notes and he stated \"Given the patient's age, PSA value, volume of disease, and Gleason Score, curative therapy was recommended. Patient has elected to proceed with LEFT nerve sparing robotic-assisted laproscopic prostatectomy/BPLND)\". Surgery is scheduled for the second week in July, I believe. Both urologist and surgeon seemed to say a cure was possible but when I asked the surgeon last week something regarding the potential for a cure, he said \"there are no guarantees\". So here are my questions ... 1. I see a lot of folks on this forum going to major hospitals to do surgery such as MD Anderson or Mayo Clinic. But is this really necessary and are good surgeons at other smaller community hospitals such as where I'm going (Southwest Urology/Parma Hospital)? My nearest major hospital in the area is Cleveland Clinic. 2. Since I have already selected surgery, is it worth getting a second opinion or seeking out a different surgeon who is friendlier who spends more time with you ? Thanks. Tim",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by rooster22 I read somewhere that teaching hospitals have students do some portion of surgery. That is how the students gain experience. Ask the surgeon if this is true, and if so, would you experience this. This is a very reasonable question to ask your surgeon. I, too am having my surgery done at a teaching hospital (Cleveland Clinic) in about 3 weeks (August 1st) so I actually asked my surgeon this in an email because I read that it is one of the questions you should ask. And he provided a very detailed answer. In fact, more detailed than I was expecting. He said he will be doing all of the surgery at the robot console. However, he did say that he has assistants that do non-critical things but I didn't get the impression that these are students. This only makes sense. He did say that he frequently has international visitors and medical students observing him in the operating room but they aren't doing any part of the surgery - they are only there to observe him (the surgeon) and learn from it. Since my surgery is scheduled for the summer (August 1st), I asked him about if summer students would also be present (I know the Cleveland Clinic hires a lot of summer students, btw) and he said that no summer interns will be present. Interestingly, my supervisor said that he was previously a Cleveland Clinic summer student and he actually was able to observe a Robotic Prostate Cancer Surgery but that was probably 15 years ago - not sure if that was an isolated case or if this is sometimes done. But I'm sure he was only there to observe. If it were me, I don't think I'd want to observe. This is another reason I asked the question. He did say that if I didn't want any international visitors/medical students observing, he will exclude them from my surgery. And I emailed him back and told him he need not exclude anyone - I was more interested in whether \"HE\" was doing the full surgery. Also when you think about it, if the surgeon has other doctor's observing his work, he and his associates must be confident in his abilities to let him do that. Tim",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by garyi Plus there is a bit more incentive for doing an excellent job, one would hope. I believe that, sometimes, residents or PA's will perform the open, insert the arms, grab the bagged prostate, and do the close. Good luck Tim! Thanks, garyi. Hmmm ... perhaps some surgeons allow this but not mine. From my surgeon's response, he said he's doing the full surgery. Here's an excerpt from the end of his response ... which made me feel really good ... \"I do have senior level residents (5-6 years into their surgery training, 6-12 months from performing these operations independently) perform non-critical aspects of the surgery under my direct supervision. However, everything related to the prostate removal, nerve-sparing, reconstruction are done 100% by me.\". I suppose it is possible that his senior-level residents perform the open, insert the arms, and do the close but these things are non-critical and if this worked for my surgeon's 700+ RP operations up to now, then I am OK with it. What happens when he's inside is really what counts and I would want him doing 100% of that which he said he does from the above response. It is still good to ask the surgeon this question especially if it bothers someone. I'll bet 99.9% of surgeons would be happy to answer and for the .1% that doesn't, I'd get another surgeon . Tim",

Active surveillance was not recommended for me, not that I would have gone that route anyway. I wanted that cancerous thing out of my body permanently! While I could have had the surgery closer to home, my urologist recommended either Johns Hopkins or Cleveland Clinic. I'm located about equidistant from both, and elected to go to Cleveland. My surgeon was Dr. Andrew Stephenson, and he did a great job with both nerve bundles spared.

I usually think a second opinion is beneficial, though once I met with Dr. Stephenson I had complete confidence in him and didn't seek out any other opinions. I suspect I would have felt the same with a Johns Hopkins surgeon as well, knowing that they're among the best in the world. I think if I were in your position and so close to the Cleveland Clinic that I would at least get an opinion from a surgeon there. Good luck, and keep us posted with your progress through this process. Thanks, ohsguy. I just submitted a request for a second opinion at the Cleveland Clinic. I also checked out Dr. Stephenson's bio and video and he looks great plus your referral (The only one I have so far) clinched the deal so I requested him.

      "Content": "Hello All; I'm 57 years old and I was diagnosed with prostate cancer about 3 weeks ago after getting a biopsy. My PSA was 5.9 a few months ago and my biopsy showed 6 cores positive with three a gleason 6 and three a gleason 7 (3+4). My urologist had me do a bone scan and mri and both were negative. What makes this harder is that I live alone and my mother passed away about 3 months ago. I do have two other brother's who I haven't told yet. Even though my urologist gave me the option of active surveillance, I didn't like the idea of waiting for the tumor to grow larger (which would cause me added stress) so I told my urologist that I wanted my prostate removed. He explained that this diagnosis was not a death sentence and a cure was possible. So he referred me to a robotic surgeon within his practice. I went to see the surgeon (Carson Wong) last week and while he seems like a competent surgeon (He said he did about 800 robotic surgeries when I asked him), I got the feeling like he rushed me through the appt. and didn't fully explain things. I was able to get a copy of the surgeon's notes and he stated \"Given the patient's age, PSA value, volume of disease, and Gleason Score, curative therapy was recommended. Patient has elected to proceed with LEFT nerve sparing robotic-assisted laproscopic prostatectomy/BPLND)\". Surgery is scheduled for the second week in July, I believe. Both urologist and surgeon seemed to say a cure was possible but when I asked the surgeon last week something regarding the potential for a cure, he said \"there are no guarantees\". So here are my questions ... 1. I see a lot of folks on this forum going to major hospitals to do surgery such as MD Anderson or Mayo Clinic. But is this really necessary and are good surgeons at other smaller community hospitals such as where I'm going (Southwest Urology/Parma Hospital)? My nearest major hospital in the area is Cleveland Clinic. 2. Since I have already selected surgery, is it worth getting a second opinion or seeking out a different surgeon who is friendlier who spends more time with you ? Thanks. Tim",

I am thinking of getting a second opinion from MD Anderson. Since Prostate surgery is very serious, I would have no problem traveling a great distance to get better care I feel more comfortable with.

      "Content": "Hello All; I'm 57 years old and I was diagnosed with prostate cancer about 3 weeks ago after getting a biopsy. My PSA was 5.9 a few months ago and my biopsy showed 6 cores positive with three a gleason 6 and three a gleason 7 (3+4). My urologist had me do a bone scan and mri and both were negative. What makes this harder is that I live alone and my mother passed away about 3 months ago. I do have two other brother's who I haven't told yet. Even though my urologist gave me the option of active surveillance, I didn't like the idea of waiting for the tumor to grow larger (which would cause me added stress) so I told my urologist that I wanted my prostate removed. He explained that this diagnosis was not a death sentence and a cure was possible. So he referred me to a robotic surgeon within his practice. I went to see the surgeon (Carson Wong) last week and while he seems like a competent surgeon (He said he did about 800 robotic surgeries when I asked him), I got the feeling like he rushed me through the appt. and didn't fully explain things. I was able to get a copy of the surgeon's notes and he stated \"Given the patient's age, PSA value, volume of disease, and Gleason Score, curative therapy was recommended. Patient has elected to proceed with LEFT nerve sparing robotic-assisted laproscopic prostatectomy/BPLND)\". Surgery is scheduled for the second week in July, I believe. Both urologist and surgeon seemed to say a cure was possible but when I asked the surgeon last week something regarding the potential for a cure, he said \"there are no guarantees\". So here are my questions ... 1. I see a lot of folks on this forum going to major hospitals to do surgery such as MD Anderson or Mayo Clinic. But is this really necessary and are good surgeons at other smaller community hospitals such as where I'm going (Southwest Urology/Parma Hospital)? My nearest major hospital in the area is Cleveland Clinic. 2. Since I have already selected surgery, is it worth getting a second opinion or seeking out a different surgeon who is friendlier who spends more time with you ? Thanks. Tim",

      "Content": "Thanks for all of your encouragement. Three years ago, my PSA was 2.9 and 2 months ago, it jumped to 5.9. I really don't know why (And I'm hitting myself for it now), why 2.9 didn't raise a red flag for me. Both doctor's who reviewed it didn't raise any concern. My internist doesn't order yearly psa tests for some reason and it just wasn't on my radar. I only had the psa test done three years ago because I got a physical from work and they automatically order them after age 50. I did not get a work physical in the two years thereafter but if I had, may have discovered a rising psa sooner. Regarding the nerve sparring stuff, I really don't understand any of that. However, he asked me my level of importance of three things and here's how I answered ... Most important was to get all of the cancer, second most important was to not have incontinence, and lowest priority was to not have ED. I know a lot would disagree with this order of priority but I have never been married and have never been sexually active so that is why I came to that decision. My largest concern is that he doesn what is necessary to live a normal lifespan. While I know a lot go through it, I am really fearful of high dose radiation as I believe it can lead to other cancer's. That's why I personally opted for surgery. Perhaps the doctor will eventually suggest radiation too after getting the final pathology report after surgery but hopefully not. I would feel better just to have the whole prostate removed. I have been eating an ultra healthy vegan diet for about the past 8 months (Long before I was diagnosed) along with fresh ginger, tumeric, and garlic every day and I expect that will help prevent a occurrence. I am thinking of getting a second opinion from MD Anderson. Since Prostate surgery is very serious, I would have no problem traveling a great distance to get better care I feel more comfortable with.

      "Content": "Originally Posted by oshguy Hi, Your situation sounds very similar to mine, and I also elected surgery. Active surveillance was not recommended for me, not that I would have gone that route anyway. I wanted that cancerous thing out of my body permanently! While I could have had the surgery closer to home, my urologist recommended either Johns Hopkins or Cleveland Clinic. I'm located about equidistant from both, and elected to go to Cleveland. My surgeon was Dr. Andrew Stephenson, and he did a great job with both nerve bundles spared. I also live alone, and a friend agreed to accompany me to the hospital for the surgery and stay with me for a short while during recovery, which was completely uneventful. I usually think a second opinion is beneficial, though once I met with Dr. Stephenson I had complete confidence in him and didn't seek out any other opinions. I suspect I would have felt the same with a Johns Hopkins surgeon as well, knowing that they're among the best in the world. I think if I were in your position and so close to the Cleveland Clinic that I would at least get an opinion from a surgeon there. Good luck, and keep us posted with your progress through this process. Thanks, ohsguy. I just submitted a request for a second opinion at the Cleveland Clinic. I also checked out Dr. Stephenson's bio and video and he looks great plus your referral (The only one I have so far) clinched the deal so I requested him. Not sure if I'll get him though but hope I do and don't have to wait too long. Tim",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by RobLee You may wish to read THIS THREAD from late last year. Lots of guys contributed to it. Personally I never had much luck with the clamp, or with pads for that matter. They didn't hold enough and my shaft had the tendency to flop off to one side or the other and miss the pad altogether. I came to rely primarily on external catheters and have written extensively on several different forums on the subject. My favorite, most comfortable and most reliable was the Freedom silicone with aloe, about $1.25 ea on Az, leg bag by Rusch about $2 ea also from Az. I would try to go a day or two each week w/o the CC and would use Prevail belted shields, which are also sold at CVS as their own brand. I think we discussed this in an earlier thread, so maybe you tried these and they did not work for you. Different strokes, as they say. Several ppl had suggested to me to place a pad inside a Depends brief, with only a small portion of the adhesive exposed. That way you can change the pad without changing the brief. I found it all to be way too bulky... but then I am slender and wear snug fitting trousers, so it definitely looked like I was wearing a diaper. Today I wear only a Tena moderate absorbent pad, the \"3 drops\" package. Hi Roblee; Correct ... you did mention earlier and I tried all of your suggestions ... see results below ... I did try the Freedom Silicon Catheter last week and it did work and I was able to collect urine in a leg bag but for some reason, it seemed to leak. I thought I measured the correct size but may measure again. They also seem to be available in limited sizes. There was another catheter that was recommended by someone else - may try that if I can find what it was. From what I'm reading, men seem to have variable success with the penile clamp - it seems as if most are able to use it but some have problems with it falling off. Maybe I will be one who has success. I did buy some belted shields - actually two packages of them - one locally and one off the internet and did try them and they seem to work though they didn't collect as much urine as a diaper did which makes sense. I did find them a bit difficult to button on but may revisit that. Would be nice if they had either velcro or snaps but I know that would increase the cost tremendously. Tim",

      "Content": "Hello TB; My first surgeon (Who I ended up not using) did a CT Scan of Pelvic area and Bone Scan (Because I had a Gleason Score of 3+4 - He said this would be a waste of money if I have had a 3+3). Then my second surgeon (Who I did end up using) ordered a 3T MRI of my Pelvic area during pre-surgical testing one week prior to surgery. I have not seen the results of that MRI but I assume this was to determine where the tumor was located to help with his surgery. I think both surgeons determined early on that my cancer had not spread due to my biopsy results, Gleason score, and Pre-surgical PSA. Tim",

      "Content": "Sandra; First of all, can you tell us your dad's Gleason Score from his biopsy last year ? That will tell us on the forum how aggressive his cancer really is. And can you tell us as much as you can about what the doctor found from the biopsy such as the number of cores with cancer and how much in each core? If his doctor is able to make the diagnosis of \"aggressive\", he must be going by what he saw on the biopsy. Lots of biopsy results are being placed on-line these days but if not, insist that your dad's doctor provide is because he paid for it and is entitled to it. Secondly, I know a lot about natural treatments because I have been very interested in learning about the power of natural fruits and vegetables for many years. Before I get into this, you will find a lots of folks on YouTube and the internet that claim they cured cancer with homeopathic remedies. While I can't confirm or deny those claims, you really have to watch what you believe on youtube as I'm sure some (perhaps even most) of those folks fabricate those stories to make more money through advertising. OK so here are my recommendations ... 1. With a diagnosis as serious as prostate cancer, it will be of great benefit to your dad to supplement his conventional treatments with scientifically proven natural remedies. This is what I did and I believe it helped and is continuing to help. I was eating very healthy - an entirely vegetarian diet and a green smoothie (Broccoil, cabage, chia, hemp, and flax seeds, fresh turmeric root, fresh ginger root, etc ...) every morning. Then as you can see from my signature line at the bottom of this message, my PSA only climbed .2 in 6 months between diagnosis and surgery. 2. There are actually a lots of authorative medical studies and writings on the internet by prominent doctors which link certain elements of diet and lifestyle to better prostate cancer (and all cancer overall) outcomes. Here are a few to get you started ... https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/brady-urology-institute/specialties/conditions-and-treatments/prostate-cancer/prostate-cancer-questions/how-does-food-affect-prostate-cancer https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/brady-urology-institute/specialties/conditions-and-treatments/prostate-cancer/prostate-cancer-questions/exploring-the-link-between-evolution-and-prostate-cancer Also, There is some research that turmeric can improve prostate cancer outcomes. I am seeing a functional medicine doctor at the Cleveland Clinic and when she first heard I was just treated for Prostate Cancer, the first thing she mentioned was turmeric (Curcumin). And her claim is backed up by a research study ... https://www.hindawi.com/journals/bmri/2014/761608/. I know these are somewhat difficult to understand unless you're a doctor. Let us know if you can get your hands on some real data from your dad's biopsy and your forum friends will be better able to advise you. However, still keep in mind that none of us are doctors so we can only advise you based upon our personal experiences and what we hear (from our doctors) and read. I wish your dad the best of luck and I wish you the best of luck in convincing your dad that conventional medicine will give him the best outcome and longest life. At his age (69) his doctor will most likely recommend radiation, I believe. Though his doctor may ultimately leave it up to him. Tim",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by Another Three suggestions; stop all alcohol and caffeine. In addition to those three suggestions, when you get up from sitting contract the muscle first and clamp your penis with your hand. Full bowels also place pressure on the bladder. Keep them empty and preferably first thing in the morning. Restore your core muscles, do planks. Get your BMI between 19 and 24. All doable if you want it. Thanks Another; All great suggestions. Just thought I'd mention that I don't drink alcohol or caffeine. My BMI is 24.3 so very close to healthy. Sometimes I do clamp my penis with my hand and that does work but can't do that at work . Am trying a penile clamp for at work which should arrive today. I have been doing research on the internet and some doctor's suggest them and it seems as if lots of PCa patients use them. I'll have to keep that in mind regarding keeping my bowels empty. I do follow an extremly healthy lifestyle which includes eating lots of fiber so have one bowel movement atleast once a day. Though despite my healthy lifestyle, I am lacking in the Exercise department so I need to work on that. Great suggestion to exercise my core muscles. I hadn't thought about that. I am not sure what planks are so I'll have to google them as well as core exercises. Thanks so much for the great ideas. Tim",

      "Content": "Hi All; I am planning to return to work. It has been just a few days over one month since my surgery on August 1st. I am a project manager and my job entails mostly sitting all day (at a computer) except an occasional walk to lunch or to a meeting. I am still not continent during the day. I am OK sitting down but once i get up, I start to urinate. I have tried kegel's prior to getting up but this doesn't stop the flow (yet). So for those of you who have had to return to work before being mostly continent, what did you do and how did you handle the situation so you didn't smell or become embarrassed ? I tried an external catheter but it didn't seem to work very well. Maybe I need to try a different brand. I ordered a penile clamp (to use only during working hours) to give that a try and it should arrive tomorrow. Tim",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by Another Three suggestions; stop all alcohol and caffeine. In addition to those three suggestions, when you get up from sitting contract the muscle first and clamp your penis with your hand. Full bowels also place pressure on the bladder. Keep them empty and preferably first thing in the morning. Restore your core muscles, do planks. Get your BMI between 19 and 24. All doable if you want it. Thanks Another; All great suggestions. Just thought I'd mention that I don't drink alcohol or caffeine. My BMI is 24.3 so very close to healthy. Sometimes I do clamp my penis with my hand and that does work but can't do that at work . Am trying a penile clamp for at work which should arrive today. I have been doing research on the internet and some doctor's suggest them and it seems as if lots of PCa patients use them. I'll have to keep that in mind regarding keeping my bowels empty. I do follow an extremly healthy lifestyle which includes eating lots of fiber so have one bowel movement atleast once a day. Though despite my healthy lifestyle, I am lacking in the Exercise department so I need to work on that. Great suggestion to exercise my core muscles. I hadn't thought about that. I am not sure what planks are so I'll have to google them as well as core exercises. Thanks so much for the great ideas. Tim",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by RobLee You may wish to read THIS THREAD from late last year. Lots of guys contributed to it. Personally I never had much luck with the clamp, or with pads for that matter. They didn't hold enough and my shaft had the tendency to flop off to one side or the other and miss the pad altogether. I came to rely primarily on external catheters and have written extensively on several different forums on the subject. My favorite, most comfortable and most reliable was the Freedom silicone with aloe, about $1.25 ea on Az, leg bag by Rusch about $2 ea also from Az. I would try to go a day or two each week w/o the CC and would use Prevail belted shields, which are also sold at CVS as their own brand. I think we discussed this in an earlier thread, so maybe you tried these and they did not work for you. Different strokes, as they say. Several ppl had suggested to me to place a pad inside a Depends brief, with only a small portion of the adhesive exposed. That way you can change the pad without changing the brief. I found it all to be way too bulky... but then I am slender and wear snug fitting trousers, so it definitely looked like I was wearing a diaper. Today I wear only a Tena moderate absorbent pad, the \"3 drops\" package. Hi Roblee; Correct ... you did mention earlier and I tried all of your suggestions ... see results below ... I did try the Freedom Silicon Catheter last week and it did work and I was able to collect urine in a leg bag but for some reason, it seemed to leak. I thought I measured the correct size but may measure again. They also seem to be available in limited sizes. There was another catheter that was recommended by someone else - may try that if I can find what it was. From what I'm reading, men seem to have variable success with the penile clamp - it seems as if most are able to use it but some have problems with it falling off. Maybe I will be one who has success. I did buy some belted shields - actually two packages of them - one locally and one off the internet and did try them and they seem to work though they didn't collect as much urine as a diaper did which makes sense. I did find them a bit difficult to button on but may revisit that. Would be nice if they had either velcro or snaps but I know that would increase the cost tremendously. Tim",

      "Content": "I am experiencing pain in my left leg after robotic radical prostectomy. This is a dull pain that I notice more while I'm in bed and just getting up. It seems to have started in my thigh but then now moved to the lower left leg below my knee. It seems to minimize throughout the day when I'm walking around and active. I was concerned about a possible blood clot because I hear they're somewhat more common after a long surgery but I had my family doctor order a ultrasound of my left leg just to be sure and they did the test yesterday and the technician told me I do not have any blood clots. I know that the left leg is fairly close to the surgical area so wonder if the doc inadvertently disturbed a nerve or pulled a muscle. I plan to email the surgeon on Monday to let him know about this pain and seek suggestions about further testing if necessary. Anyone else experience anything like this after surgery ? I am now 2-1/2 weeks since surgery. Thanks. Tim",

I actually discovered this site after selecting my surgeon, Dr. Andrew Stephenson at the Cleveland Clinic who got only one star.

I still think it's a good decision to go with anyone at the Cleveland Clinic which has been rated 2nd in Urology and 7th in cancer. Since this was my 2nd opinion, I'm don't think I'm going to seek a third opinion with 5 stars (Thus delaying surgery further) solely on the basis of a review. He has done 700+ robotic prostate cancer surgeries averaging about 4 a week. I also looked at all of the surgeons in my area and only a few got 5 stars and most got 3 stars and a few got 1 star. I'm not so sure that 1 star vs. 3 stars is that big a difference anyway. With a Gleason 7 (3+4) on a 1st and 2nd opinion biopsy with only 5% G4 in two cores, I am hoping that my case won't be that difficult and that my final pathology will remain Gleason 7 (3+4) or better.

I have been reading on this forum that a Free PSA test does not mean anything following RP so am wondering why my surgeon would order it ? Should I email him and ask him ? I know from my last Free PSA test (Prior to surgery) that both the Free PSA and the PSA was listed though I doubt it's the ultrasensitive variety. Should I send an email to my surgeon and question this ? Tim",

His nurse answered it and responded ... \"This PSA will still collect data and whether the result is detectable or not which is what the doctor is looking for.\" This is correct because my pre-surgery Free PSA test also included PSA as well (two tests). I will question him about this at my 3-month post-op followup to find out his rationale for ordering the Free PSA test rather than a PSA test alone and let him know my concerns about added cost. I am also wondering why he didn't order an ultrasensitive PSA test that lots of you seem to be getting. Tim",

Now the new doctor is requesting the biopsy slides for their pathology department to examine. I noticed in some of your signature lines some of you noted the results of an initial biopsy and then later listed the results of that same biopsy reexamined. For those of you that did this, could you tell me how you requested that your slides taken by one doctor were sent to another doctor ? Did you call the initial doctor or did you write a letter, or send a FAX requesting them to send the slides somewhere else ? I'd like some suggestions for how to proceed. Thanks. Tim",

      "Content": "Hello All; My Robotic Prostatectomy is in only two days (August 1st) and I have some questions ... I am feeling pretty hopeful with a Gleason 3+4 and only 5% of patttern 4 in each of two 3+4 cores. Additionally, now seeing my pre-surgery PSA rise only .2 in 6 months makes me feel even more confident that I have a slow growing disease. 1. It seems as if a lot of men suffer from Bladder Spasm's due to having their catheter in. And some describe them as a constant urge to urinate and others describe it as an excruciating pain. I am curious how often this happens and how much of a problem this was for you? Be honest here. Also, if this did happen to you, did you find anything that brought them on and anything that minimized or eliminated them ? 2. What will my diet be like following surgery and how long will it take to improve? I believe it is recommended to have a liquid diet following surgery but I am curious why this is, and how soon (days?) generally until I could have solid food ? 3. Am curious how long your hospital stay was and if there were any complications in your case ? I was told by a nurse 2-3 days but most everywhere I read seems to indicate only overnight. 4. It seems the general advice is to sleep on a recliner rather than a bed following Robotic Prostatectomy. I am curious why this is and what is the actual thing that makes sleeping in a bed difficult ? Reason I ask is because I don't have a recliner. For those of you who didn't have a recliner, how did you manage sleeping ? Also, how long does it take (Days?) until you were able to sleep on a regular bed ? 5. When you returned home from the hospital, is there anything that you absolutely couldn't do by yourself and needed help with ? Reason I ask is because I live alone but can have a friend stop over once in a while. 6. What did you take to the hospital on your surgery day ? Thanks. Tim",

      "Content": "Congratulations, Dave. Great to hear things went smoothly for you and happy to hear you are finished. I have begun seeling a RO a few weeks ago and he's monitoring my PSA monthly. My PSA hasn't increased beyond .05 in 4 months and in the last 3 weeks it stayed .05 so I'm guessing he won't want to start radiation when I see him next Tuesday until I see a rise beyond .05. My RO said I didn't need HT given the large number of side effects. I assume he thought that the benefits didn't outweigh the side effects given my pathology. He did say there was a new pill coming out that I could try as an alternative to HT which doesn't have all of the side effects. I didn't think to ask if this was a clinical trial or an already-approved drug. If it gets to that, I'll find out. I'll ask my Urologist to weigh in on whether HT would have any benefit for me as well. Tim",

Since you're considering the Cleveland Clinic as one possible hospital, I'll mention that I went there and had a pretty good outcome though my cancer was still confined to the prostate with a very tiny positive margin. The Cleveland Clinic is #1 in Urology in the nation and I think #3 or #4 in Cancer. Good Luck to your Stepdad. Tim",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by DavefromMD Wow, I feel so fortunate. My urologist automatically sent them to Hopkins for a second opinion. Yeah ... but is your doctor part of a medical practice that also does surgery? That was my case and they try to steer you in the direction of having it done by them because that's profits for them. I wish my urologist would have immediately sent me to the Cleveland clinic first as that would have saved a few weeks. I'm leaving work early today to talk to my urologist this afternoon to cancel their surgery and arrange to have them send the biopsy slides to my new Cleveland Clinic Surgeon. Tim",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by Michael F Hi Tim! Just want to add 1 point: You should have received a copy of your Bx path report. Be sure to get a copy and keep it in your records. Do the same with your post RP Path Report and all future PSA lab reports. Good luck! The CC is a phenomenal place! MF Thanks for the tips. I already have a copy of the biopsy report and will be sure to get and keep a copy of the final pathology report following surgery and all future PSA tests. Thanks for your endorsement of the Cleveland Clinic. I only wish I didn't have to wait 2 months for surgery - hopefully I'll get lucky and there will be a cancellation. I hate to have something continuing to grow inside of me. Tim",

      "Content": "Hello All; My Robotic Prostatectomy is in only two days (August 1st) and I have some questions ... I am feeling pretty hopeful with a Gleason 3+4 and only 5% of patttern 4 in each of two 3+4 cores. Additionally, now seeing my pre-surgery PSA rise only .2 in 6 months makes me feel even more confident that I have a slow growing disease. 1. It seems as if a lot of men suffer from Bladder Spasm's due to having their catheter in. And some describe them as a constant urge to urinate and others describe it as an excruciating pain. I am curious how often this happens and how much of a problem this was for you? Be honest here. Also, if this did happen to you, did you find anything that brought them on and anything that minimized or eliminated them ? 2. What will my diet be like following surgery and how long will it take to improve? I believe it is recommended to have a liquid diet following surgery but I am curious why this is, and how soon (days?) generally until I could have solid food ? 3. Am curious how long your hospital stay was and if there were any complications in your case ? I was told by a nurse 2-3 days but most everywhere I read seems to indicate only overnight. 4. It seems the general advice is to sleep on a recliner rather than a bed following Robotic Prostatectomy. I am curious why this is and what is the actual thing that makes sleeping in a bed difficult ? Reason I ask is because I don't have a recliner. For those of you who didn't have a recliner, how did you manage sleeping ? Also, how long does it take (Days?) until you were able to sleep on a regular bed ? 5. When you returned home from the hospital, is there anything that you absolutely couldn't do by yourself and needed help with ? Reason I ask is because I live alone but can have a friend stop over once in a while. 6. What did you take to the hospital on your surgery day ? Thanks. Tim",

      "Content": "Hi all; Thanks so much for your quick response. I actually already talked to the lab that was listed on the biopsy report. They said they sent the slides back to the original requesting doctor. Did this ever happen to any of you ? From what I could gather (but I could still be wrong), the doctor does the biopsy and then prepares the slides. Then they send them to another company for analysis and then this other company sends them back. Does this sound right? So it sounds like I will need to go to my original doctor to have them forward these slides on to the new doctor. I should be on good terms of course when he finds out I didn't use his organization to do the surgery, he may no longer be on good terms. However, if he's a nice doctor (as I believe him to be), he shouldn't care if I go somewhere else. Plus, I did pay for them. So I should own them. Hmmm ... maybe I better check to be sure I paid that bill, ha ha ha. Tim",

      "Content": "Hello All; My Robotic Prostatectomy is in only two days (August 1st) and I have some questions ... I am feeling pretty hopeful with a Gleason 3+4 and only 5% of patttern 4 in each of two 3+4 cores. Additionally, now seeing my pre-surgery PSA rise only .2 in 6 months makes me feel even more confident that I have a slow growing disease. 1. It seems as if a lot of men suffer from Bladder Spasm's due to having their catheter in. And some describe them as a constant urge to urinate and others describe it as an excruciating pain. I am curious how often this happens and how much of a problem this was for you? Be honest here. Also, if this did happen to you, did you find anything that brought them on and anything that minimized or eliminated them ? 2. What will my diet be like following surgery and how long will it take to improve? I believe it is recommended to have a liquid diet following surgery but I am curious why this is, and how soon (days?) generally until I could have solid food ? 3. Am curious how long your hospital stay was and if there were any complications in your case ? I was told by a nurse 2-3 days but most everywhere I read seems to indicate only overnight. 4. It seems the general advice is to sleep on a recliner rather than a bed following Robotic Prostatectomy. I am curious why this is and what is the actual thing that makes sleeping in a bed difficult ? Reason I ask is because I don't have a recliner. For those of you who didn't have a recliner, how did you manage sleeping ? Also, how long does it take (Days?) until you were able to sleep on a regular bed ? 5. When you returned home from the hospital, is there anything that you absolutely couldn't do by yourself and needed help with ? Reason I ask is because I live alone but can have a friend stop over once in a while. 6. What did you take to the hospital on your surgery day ? Thanks. Tim",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by gwinkler Hello everyone, I am 43 years old and was put on testosterone therapy(injections 200ml biweekly) after a month of use I started having urinary problems. Went to my GP and he did a DRE and found a nodule on the left side of my prostate. My PSA 3 months ago was 1.0. He sent me to a Urologist which has set me up for CT scan tomorrow of my pelvis. He has scheduled me also for biopsy and a cysto on 9/11/17. I've of course have stopped the testosterone immediately! I'm so worried and don't know if my mind is playing tricks on me, but I started having back pain. Any advise or knowledge you can pass my way would be helpful.. Thank you all!! Hi gwinkler; I can attest that our mind is a very powerful thing and it is possible to make pain in any body part that you fixate on. I think as you fixate on a particular area such as your back, you are more aware of pains that originate there and of course you think the worst. I tend to worry about a lots of things and when I worry about a brain tumor, I get small pains in my head, and the same goes for when I was diagnosed with prostate cancer - I began thinking that my pelvic lymph nodes hurt because they were enlarged but later found that they were perfectly normal. At your age, Prostate Cancer is very rare. But consider this a learning experience and begin getting your PSA tested every year after 45, or 50. Many doctor' don't believe in PSA tests so you may need to specifically request it and don't accept NO for an answer. If you are concerned about PCa, you should let your general doctor know (or a urologist if you're seeing one). So ... keep your doctor's informed of your worries and symptoms but you probably don't have prostate cancer at this young age. Tim",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by Khendo14 Update on my surgery: Robotic Radical Prostectomy on 8/9. No lymph nodes taken, nerve sparing, one seminal vessels taken. Foley was taken out on day 6. 100% full bladder control since removal, and no issues since returning home. I have been experiencing pain just below my hips and down into my legs. I believe it is restless leg syndrome. Does anyone have any experience with this? My surgeon expects a full recovering as all margins were negative. Very thankful for the support from this forum. I had my surgery nine days before you (August 1, 2017). Good to see things turned out well for you. Interestingly, I also experienced pain in my left hip and down my left leg. I was so paranoid that I had a blood clot (because they are more common in abdominal surgeries) that I had my family doctor order a ultrasound of my left leg but it was negative. So I think what you experienced is likely normal and perhaps maybe due to the unusual position they had you in during the surgery. The pain is pretty much gone now but once in a while I still experience some pain in my left leg like while sleeping. But it hardly never happens - think it's just the position I'm in. Tim Tim",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by Khendo14 Update on my surgery: Robotic Radical Prostectomy on 8/9. No lymph nodes taken, nerve sparing, one seminal vessels taken. Foley was taken out on day 6. 100% full bladder control since removal, and no issues since returning home. I have been experiencing pain just below my hips and down into my legs. I believe it is restless leg syndrome. Does anyone have any experience with this? My surgeon expects a full recovering as all margins were negative. Very thankful for the support from this forum. I had my surgery nine days before you (August 1, 2017). Good to see things turned out well for you. Interestingly, I also experienced pain in my left hip and down my left leg. I was so paranoid that I had a blood clot (because they are more common in abdominal surgeries) that I had my family doctor order a ultrasound of my left leg but it was negative. So I think what you experienced is likely normal and perhaps maybe due to the unusual position they had you in during the surgery. The pain is pretty much gone now but once in a while I still experience some pain in my left leg like while sleeping. But it hardly never happens - think it's just the position I'm in. Tim Tim",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by Ardsee Went back to my uro today. 8 days post DaVinci. Removed my staples, but I got to keep my lovely catherter. My doc said to remove it too soon could have seriously bad effects. If the urethra has not healed well enough it would have to re-inserted in the OR. So I guess I'm waiting another week with this \"wonderful\" attachment. Just a minor inconvenience but I sure am tired of it. Hi Ardsee; If you consider your cathether a minor inconvenience you should consider yourself very lucky. I just had mine removed today (Thank Goodness) and for the past 5 days it was so painful (Burning pain continuously and sharper burning pain when moving and bending) I consider it a Major pain in the butt and would have screamed and yelled if they would have told me to keep it in another week.

      "Content": "Hello All; I thought I'd update you since I have just passed the 3 month mark following surgery. First, I'll say that I am feeling great. I had my second post-surgery PSA test yesterday and it was the same as at 6 weeks or <.03. So I'm feeling good about that. I have a 3-month followup with my surgeon next Wednesday. The only big issue I'm still dealing with is incontinence. Though I feel it is getting better. Basically, my status is this ... During the day, my incontinence isn't bad and I am able to get through the day with only one belted shield. However, during the night, I still seem to wet the bed though I'm not sure why. I have taken some of this discomfort out by using the uro-dry condom catheter only during the night but it still tends to leak a little but not nearly as much as without it. My urge to urinate post surgery has never been as great as it was pre-surgery. Maybe that has something to do with it. I do seem to get up when my bladder is full but I still seem to find myself wet most of the time. I do tend to drink liquids and eat fruit later into the evening and while that never caused a problem pre-surgery, maybe it is causing a problem now. Need to experiment with stopping fluids at 6 PM or 7 PM to see if that has any effect. I will discuss my incontinence status with my surgeon on Wednesday to see if he has any suggestions. Tim",

      "Content": "Hi All; Here's another update. I had my 3 month followup with my surgeon last Wednesday. He didn't really tell me anything but I told him a lot. I expressed concern over my incontinence issues and also bedwetting. He did not seem overly concerned about both and said that at only 3 months from surgery, I should give it more time. He did schedule physical therapy which I requested so I start that in about a month. He said it's really important I continue Kegel Exercises. I also explained that my frequency of urination at night was about once every 2 hours same as pre-surgery and I expected that to get better after removing prostate but it did not. He said there is nothing wrong with my bladder and frequency of urination too should improve with time - this is a comment that surprised me but also encouraged me. I would absolutely love to be able to sleep throughout the whole night and if I am able to someday soon, that will be the second biggest benefit to me (besides getting rid of cancer) of having Prostate surgery. I did sleep without a catheter this past week and the quantity of urine I expel during the night seems to have reduced quite a bit so I am confident in time, this issue will go away too. My surgeon scheduled my next PSA test for 6 months and I was a bit surprised it wasn't 3 months. However, I suppose he based that frequency on my medical history and final pathology. Tim",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by sudds63 Hello, Final Report, Prostrate Radical Prostatectomy: Prostatic Adenocarcinoma , poorly differentiated Gleason Score of 4+5=9 (grade 5) Dominant Nodule with a Greatest dimension of 2.4 cm confined within prostate Estimated at 29% of tissue volume (7.14ml) involving surgical resection margins( anterior, at apex); benign seminal vesicles positive for perineral invasions: negative for invasion angiolymphatic invasion no lymph node identified. (NGPIN) High-grade Prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia. Well here it is from my biopsy I was told of Gleason score of 4+3=7 and the final is a 9. The doctor told me that I need 8 to 10 weeks of radiation now because it a more aggressive cancer then thought and I have to get my first post psa test at the end of the mth and that is will determine the amount of weeks I go. He also said its a good thing I got this done now then if I was to wait. I'm worried. I also got so sick after my catheter was removed I got a bad uti with high fever and had catheter put back in for another 8 days because I couldn't pee. Has not been a good week. Also the same week my hot water heater blew and our dog died of cancer, then I got my path report.... Well that's enough thanks for listening. Sudds Sudds; Sorry to hear about the negative pathology report though after radiation, you may still be cured. Interestingly, I got sick the day I had my catheter removed - Not the way you did, but late at night on the day I got my catheter removed, my back started hurting and I couldn't sleep because I couldn't get comfortable ... then the issue seemed to migrate to stomach with extreme pain. It was so bad I decided to check myself into the emergency room at about 3 am. Doc did a CT scan and blood tests and determined that my CT was fine but my pancreas number was higher than normal which the doc said she sees from time to time. She sent me home and the pain finally started to subside. It's now been almost 2 months since that fateful day and the problem never returned (fortunately) so I think it was related in some way to my surgery or catheter removal. Tim",

      "Content": "Hello All; Just thought I'd mention that a doctor from the Cleveland Clinic called today about my two consecutive PSA rises and advised me to make an appointment with a radiation oncologist. I'm really impressed that an actual doctor called and not just a nurse or appointment secretary. He said my PSA isn't rising that fast and he also noted that it was over a year post RP that it started rising so I took these to be good signs. I asked him about my surgeon and he wouldn't give me any details - said he just left the clinic suddenly. I hope nothing bad happened to him like an accident or nervous breakdown. But the big thing I told him when he suggested I make an appointment with a Radiation Oncologist is that I was one step ahead of him and already did ... for next Monday. I also asked him for a few excellent urologist recommendations for followup care as an alternative for my current Nurse Practicioner recommendation and he gave me several. One stuck in my mind so I will likely make an appointment eventually, depending upon what my radiation oncologist says and if or when we will start radiation. Tim",

I had surgery by a doctor at the Cleveland Clinic but that doctor apparently left the clinic a few months ago and now I can't even message him. They made me a followup appointment with a Certified Nurse Practitioner for 3 months from now and I can't even message her to have questions answered because apparently you can only message doctors through Mychart. How do I find a Radiation Oncologist ? Are there world class radiation oncologists like there are world class doctors? How do I find one? Should I receive treatment at the Cleveland Clinic or should I travel somewhere ? I really want to do something as soon as possible because .03 to .05 is quite a big jump. If I wait even 3 months, it may jump to .07. Tim",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by garyi I assume your CC is the Ohio one. They aren't living up to their sterling reputation. Djin is giving you good advise. I wouldn't be in such a hurry to rush into SRT at your relatively low PSA. Give it some time to settle, and find another RO soon. Thanks or both of your advice, garyi, and Djin and the other folks who offered suggestions too. Yes, garyi - CC is supposed to be #1 in urology, and #5 in cancer. I think my surgeon did pretty good since there were no complications of the actual surgery and he can't see microscopic cancer cells that could escape. Based upon my extensive research and reading some folks BCR even from hospitals more respected than the Cleveland Clinic and even without positive margins. Well I made an appointment with a RO for early in March at a Cleveland Clinic facility near me. I'll see what he suggests. I think I'll ask for monthly ultra sensitive PSA tests just to keep tabs on what my PSA is doing more closely. I am nervous because I want to knock out any remaining cancer cells before they get out of hand. I probably should get a second opinion too from another RO too, perhaps not from the Cleveland Clinic. There are several other pretty good hospitals near me. I see some folks pulling the trigger on SRT at ridiculously low PSA values like .018 providing they see a trend upward. While I've passed .02, I'm willing to pull the trigger too if I see a clear trend upward too after beginning monthly PSA tests. But I'm also anxious to hear what the RO thinks too. I was hoping to delay SRT until I retire next year but that may not be possible to wait that long. Tim",

Thanks for your input, Fairwind and MM16 That's kind-of the idea I got based upon reading this forum and reviewing some studies from John Hopkins Medical. My doc is having me get a series of PSA tests upcoming in I believe 6 weeks and 3 months. He has already ordered them so all I need to show up at the lab at these various times. I also have a followup appt I think in 3 months so I'll maybe inquire a bit more to have him eplain what all of this means. Tim",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by Another If I had a recurrence the only fact I think I'd want from the surgeon is where did anyting look suspicious to direct the next round of treatment. Unless they made notes I can't imagine they'd remember or even want the responsibility of sharing information like that. I've heard of surgeons sometimes placing clips to mark a spot. Other than that, it's on to the next expert. I was reading this thread and your comment about the \"surgeon taking notes\" jumped out at me. After my surgery at the Cleveland Clinic, I specifically asked if my surgeon took notes and indeed he did - all three typed pages of them providing a highly detailed explanation of exactly what he did through the entire RP procedure. I couldn't imagine him typing while he was cutting so I'm guessing he spoke them to someone else to type. Maybe all surgeons keep detailed notes on every procedure they do, perhaps now even more to protect themselves from a lawsuit. Dave From MD, you may ask Partin's office he he took notes during your procedure. I would expect any surgeon would be happy to give a patient their notes, especially if they're proud of their work. My surgeon didn't hesitate giving me his notes when I asked for them which I'll take as a sign he was proud of his work . I do want to warn that it's a little strange reading about the procedure that was done on you, but it's also informative. Of course, my doctor and probably yours too used a ton of strange names that you have no idea what they mean unless you google them. I will make another comment. Not sure if Hopkins is different but my surgeon is happy to see me for followup care. I've had two followup visits post-rp and at my 1 year anniversary I see him once a year with quarterly PSA tests. Though perhaps after 5 years of undetectable (fingers crossed) he'll taper off my visits. I wish you the very best of success moving forward, Dave from md. Tim",

      "Content": "Hi lostsoul65; I have been interested in nutritional benefits of food and supplements for many years before I was diagnosed with PCa. Have studied a lot and looked at a ton of research studies linking food to health benefits. Saw Palmetto is suspected of having benefit to prostate health. However, I have never heard of it being used as a benefit to prostate cancer. I tried it for a while it didn't seem to make my prostate issues go away or reduce prior to having my prostate removed. Of course, when the prostate is removed, Saw Palmetto has no benefit to prostate health. For overall health, you may want to look at eating a healthful diet - less sugar and carbs, more vegetables, and healthy fat. Also, it is far, far better to get your nutrition from food than it is from any supplements. Plus, Supplements are very, very expensive. One of my daily rituals in the morning is to blend a bunch of broccoli and cabbage with a tablespoon each of chia seeds, hemp seeds, flax seeds, and pumpkin seeds along with a small piece of fresh turmeric root (Which you can get at health food stores and some grocery stores). This is my breakfast. This is a Prostate Cancer forum so I'll mention there have been a few studies and some articles written by well-known medical facilities linking a healthful diet to preventing or improving the outcomes of existing prostate cancer. I posted a few of them and you can find them by searching on my name. You do not specify if you are affected by Prostate Cancer. If not (And we on this forum are hoping not), you can use this information in an attempt to prevent it from affecting you in the future. Tim",

      "Content": "Hello All; I have a few questions regarding your experiences of having a BM after surgery. I am 6 days from surgery and below is my bowel movement history .... Up until leaving the hospital - None due to mostly liquid diet except soft foods on last day. Last Thursday - Friday - Only liquid and air (Soft foods diet - only soup) Saturday - Mostly liquid and air except very small solids Last Sunday - tonight - None. All of the time since being home - soft foods diet - generally soup So now on Monday evening, I am concerned that I did not have a BM yet. My hospital paperwork specifies prune juice but my friend got me whole prunes instead. Will eating these help me have a BM that isn't painful despite the fiber ? I am also taking a stool softener eventhough the paperwork specifies to only take these if taking pain medication. Tim",

      "Content": "Hi All; If you'll recall, I was diagnosed with Prostate Cancer about a month ago and went to one surgeon but didn't like him so I sought a second opinion from the world famous Cleveland Clinic. I decided to go with the CC but they wanted to confirm the biopsy results with their own pathologist as a condition of doing the surgery. Well, I got the Biopsy results back today from the CC and to me, they look good but maybe some of you can chime in too. Looks like my Gleason number didn't change (Yay !!!) - it is still a 7 (3 + 4). Also, this new biopsy did something the other biopsy didn't - it specified the percentage of Gleason 4 in the (3+4) tumors and both are only 5% which to me seems good. I'll bet if I would have had a biopsy a year ago, the pattern 4 wouldn't have even been there. Of course even better news would be that those 3+4's turned into 3+3's but no such luck. Now the last thing to stress about is the final pathology after surgery at the Cleveland Clinic but hopefully it will remain 3+4 (or better). Actual results are below ... FINAL DIAGNOSIS 1. Prostate, left lateral base, needle biopsy (THS17-1380 A, 05/01/2017) - Benign prostatic tissue. - Portion of benign seminal vesicle/ejaculatory duct tissue. 2. Prostate, left lateral mid, needle biopsy (THS17-1380 B) - Adenocarcinoma of the prostate, Gleason score 3+3=6 (Grade Group 1), discontinuously involving 45% of one of one core and measuring 6 mm. 3. Prostate, left lateral apex, needle biopsy (THS17-1380 C) - Benign prostatic tissue. 4. Prostate, left base, needle biopsy (THS17-1380 D) - Benign prostatic tissue. 5. Prostate, left mid, needle biopsy (THS17-1380 E) - Benign prostatic tissue. 6. Prostate, left apex, needle biopsy (THS17-1380 F) - Benign prostatic tissue. 7. Prostate, right base, needle biopsy (THS17-1380 G) - Adenocarcinoma of the prostate, Gleason s core 3+4=7 (Grade Group 2), discontinuously involving 70% of one of one core and measuring 11 mm. - Gleason pattern 4 comprises approximately 5% of the tumor. - Cribriform pattern 4 is not identified. 8. Prostate, right mid, needle biopsy (THS17-1380 H) - Prostatic tissue with small focus of atypical glands. 9. Prostate, right apex, needle biopsy (THS17-1380 I) - Benign prostatic tissue. 10.

      "Content": "Originally Posted by DavefromMD Just got the results from my 3 month PSA check. Standard test, < .1, undetectable. Note on my signature that I had a 6mm positive margin, with Gleason 6 at the margin area. I had seen a study that suggested that a margin less than 3mm is insignificant and larger is more signicant, with Gleason at the margin a secondary indicator. I thought the chance of having detectable PSA was greater than undetectable. So for those of you who have a positive margin in the pathology report after surgery, keep the faith! Oh, I guess I now can submit my application to the zero club. Just as additional encouragement, I had an open RP. No catheter issues, kept it cleaned and lubed as instructed. At 2 weeks felt as if I hadn't had major abdominal surgery. I did a lot of pacing in the house while I had the catheter. At 3 weeks I stayed dry overnight. At 10 weeks I stayed dry in daily activities. I'm still working on staying dry when I do anything that compresses or strains the abdomen. According to the docs instructions, I'm on course. Hi Dave; Thanks for posting. I am wondering if you have a link to that study you referred to about a positive margin less than 3mm being insignificant? The information you sent me previously, provides the basis for small positive margins of G6 being insignificant but does not list any particular limits such as 3mm. So I'm wondering if there is a specific study that you can locate ? I know sometimes these studies are difficult to re-locate even after you find them once. Thanks. Tim",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by Prowler My question does not pertain to how a Gleason score is determined, that's defined in every PCa website. My question is whether a tumor with Gleason 4 or 5 cancer cells are a result of Gleason 3 cells that have existed for a longer time and matured into a more aggressive cancer. Or are they different types of prostate cancer that are more aggressive than others. I realize the the more the prostate cancer cell looks less like a prostate tissue cell, the higher the Gleason score. But what makes them be more aggressive? Hello Prowler; There was a research study done which indicates that Gleason Score progression is uncommon. It is generally thought that the grade of prostate cancer remains the same. Here is an article discussing this study - http://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/p...s-201308146604 And if you really want to dig deep, here is a link to the research study - http://cancerres.aacrjournals.org/co...4-ae9e67eaf77f I have mostly G3 but a very small amount of G4 (5%) was detected in two cores which increased my Gleason Sum to 7 (3+4). While one may conclude that the G3 turned into G4 recently, I suppose the G4 could be a new growth. Since the G4 is such a small percentage of the core, I am assuming it started recently. I am getting Robotic RP surgery August 1st to take care of this before the 5% of G4 turns into a higher percentage. Tim",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by garyi Great question! I sure hope not. garyi, I am curious why you say you hope not? What other explanation could there be? G4 cells didn't just appear in a split second. In my mind, it only makes sense that time would be the only factor in whether you have a 3+4 or a 4+3 by the very definition of what Gleason scoring is. Say you start out with G3 only in a core. Then your Gleason sum would be 3+3=6. Then a new tumor starts in that same core that is G4. It starts out as a single cell and then continues to multiply faster than a G3. Now you have a Gleason Sum of 3+4. Eventually, if you let the G4 grow long enough, the G4 tumor will get larger than the G3. Now your Gleason Sum is 4+3. Tim",

      "Content": "Hello All; Just thought I'd mention that a doctor from the Cleveland Clinic called today about my two consecutive PSA rises and advised me to make an appointment with a radiation oncologist. I'm really impressed that an actual doctor called and not just a nurse or appointment secretary. He said my PSA isn't rising that fast and he also noted that it was over a year post RP that it started rising so I took these to be good signs. I asked him about my surgeon and he wouldn't give me any details - said he just left the clinic suddenly. I hope nothing bad happened to him like an accident or nervous breakdown. But the big thing I told him when he suggested I make an appointment with a Radiation Oncologist is that I was one step ahead of him and already did ... for next Monday. I also asked him for a few excellent urologist recommendations for followup care as an alternative for my current Nurse Practicioner recommendation and he gave me several. One stuck in my mind so I will likely make an appointment eventually, depending upon what my radiation oncologist says and if or when we will start radiation. Tim",

      "Content": "Hello All; Looks like I'm heading for salvage radiation. My PSA 3 months ago was .03 and yesterday it is .05. I had surgery by a doctor at the Cleveland Clinic but that doctor apparently left the clinic a few months ago and now I can't even message him. They made me a followup appointment with a Certified Nurse Practitioner for 3 months from now and I can't even message her to have questions answered because apparently you can only message doctors through Mychart. How do I find a Radiation Oncologist ? Are there world class radiation oncologists like there are world class doctors? How do I find one? Should I receive treatment at the Cleveland Clinic or should I travel somewhere ? I really want to do something as soon as possible because .03 to .05 is quite a big jump. If I wait even 3 months, it may jump to .07. Tim",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by garyi I assume your CC is the Ohio one. They aren't living up to their sterling reputation. Djin is giving you good advise. I wouldn't be in such a hurry to rush into SRT at your relatively low PSA. Give it some time to settle, and find another RO soon. Thanks or both of your advice, garyi, and Djin and the other folks who offered suggestions too. Yes, garyi - CC is supposed to be #1 in urology, and #5 in cancer. I think my surgeon did pretty good since there were no complications of the actual surgery and he can't see microscopic cancer cells that could escape. Based upon my extensive research and reading some folks BCR even from hospitals more respected than the Cleveland Clinic and even without positive margins. Well I made an appointment with a RO for early in March at a Cleveland Clinic facility near me. I'll see what he suggests. I think I'll ask for monthly ultra sensitive PSA tests just to keep tabs on what my PSA is doing more closely. I am nervous because I want to knock out any remaining cancer cells before they get out of hand. I probably should get a second opinion too from another RO too, perhaps not from the Cleveland Clinic. There are several other pretty good hospitals near me. I see some folks pulling the trigger on SRT at ridiculously low PSA values like .018 providing they see a trend upward. While I've passed .02, I'm willing to pull the trigger too if I see a clear trend upward too after beginning monthly PSA tests. But I'm also anxious to hear what the RO thinks too. I was hoping to delay SRT until I retire next year but that may not be possible to wait that long. Tim",

I asked him about my surgeon and he wouldn't give me any details - said he just left the clinic suddenly. I hope nothing bad happened to him like an accident or nervous breakdown. But the big thing I told him when he suggested I make an appointment with a Radiation Oncologist is that I was one step ahead of him and already did ... for next Monday. I also asked him for a few excellent urologist recommendations for followup care as an alternative for my current Nurse Practicioner recommendation and he gave me several.

Thanks. ezra meallem I don't have any experience with your PCa situation and hopefully never will. However, am wondering if you have diabetes and if so, maybe letting your sugar get past 220? I have type 2 diabetes and if my sugar gets fairly high, I can fall asleep while using the computer while seated in a chair. I end up getting up an hour or so later. This is the only time that seems to happen. It could be a potential explanation. Tim",

      "Content": "Hello All; I went to see my PCP last Friday for a yearly physical - the first physical from him after I had my prostate out. He asked me if I wanted to have a DRE done as he always asks except this time I thought that strange since I thought the purpose of a DRE is to feel the prostate which I no longer had. I reminded him I didn't have a prostate anymore but he said that the purpose of a DRE is to also inspect the rectum for blood so I told him to go ahead. So when I got home, I did some research and found out that indeed a DRE could also be used for other things than a prostate examination. However, I didn't have any indication of any problems in that area. So I thought I'd ask for your thoughts - Do you think it's strange for a doctor to do a DRE with no prostate ? Does your doctor do that ? I also thought after he did it that since I had a very tiny positive margin, what if the doctor disloged a few cancer cells with his finger. Anyway wonder what you think about this ? Tim",

He also said its a good thing I got this done now then if I was to wait. I'm worried. I also got so sick after my catheter was removed I got a bad uti with high fever and had catheter put back in for another 8 days because I couldn't pee. Has not been a good week. Also the same week my hot water heater blew and our dog died of cancer, then I got my path report.... Well that's enough thanks for listening. Sudds Sudds; Sorry to hear about the negative pathology report though after radiation, you may still be cured. Interestingly, I got sick the day I had my catheter removed - Not the way you did, but late at night on the day I got my catheter removed, my back started hurting and I couldn't sleep because I couldn't get comfortable ... then the issue seemed to migrate to stomach with extreme pain. It was so bad I decided to check myself into the emergency room at about 3 am. Doc did a CT scan and blood tests and determined that my CT was fine but my pancreas number was higher than normal which the doc said she sees from time to time. She sent me home and the pain finally started to subside. It's now been almost 2 months since that fateful day and the problem never returned (fortunately) so I think it was related in some way to my surgery or catheter removal. Tim",

      "Content": "Hello All; Looks like I'm heading for salvage radiation. My PSA 3 months ago was .03 and yesterday it is .05. I had surgery by a doctor at the Cleveland Clinic but that doctor apparently left the clinic a few months ago and now I can't even message him. They made me a followup appointment with a Certified Nurse Practitioner for 3 months from now and I can't even message her to have questions answered because apparently you can only message doctors through Mychart. How do I find a Radiation Oncologist ? Are there world class radiation oncologists like there are world class doctors? How do I find one? Should I receive treatment at the Cleveland Clinic or should I travel somewhere ? I really want to do something as soon as possible because .03 to .05 is quite a big jump. If I wait even 3 months, it may jump to .07. Tim",

Based upon my extensive research and reading some folks BCR even from hospitals more respected than the Cleveland Clinic and even without positive margins. Well I made an appointment with a RO for early in March at a Cleveland Clinic facility near me. I'll see what he suggests. I think I'll ask for monthly ultra sensitive PSA tests just to keep tabs on what my PSA is doing more closely. I am nervous because I want to knock out any remaining cancer cells before they get out of hand. I probably should get a second opinion too from another RO too, perhaps not from the Cleveland Clinic. There are several other pretty good hospitals near me. I see some folks pulling the trigger on SRT at ridiculously low PSA values like .018 providing they see a trend upward. While I've passed .02, I'm willing to pull the trigger too if I see a clear trend upward too after beginning monthly PSA tests. But I'm also anxious to hear what the RO thinks too.

      "Content": "Hello All; I just got back from the doc's office today and had my doc explain my pathology report but he didn't take too long explaining things. He said my cancer was likely cured. Wonder if anyone can shed some light on your overall impression of the report ... It's pretty detailed and I listed the full report below but I noticed a few things in the report ... 1. Stage PT2: Organ Confined 2. But it also lists a very small positive margin (1mm) which the doctor wasn't too concerned with. Why? 3. Gleason pattern at positive margin - Pattern 3. Full report below ... FINAL DIAGNOSIS 1. Preprostatic fat, excision (A) - Fibromuscular and adipose tissue negative for tumor. 2. Prostatic radical prostatectomy (B) - Adenocarcinoma of the prostate, Gleason score 3+4=7 (Grade Group 2). See synoptic report. - Benign prostatic hyperplasia, glandular and stromal types. - Seminal vesicles are negative for tumor. - Margin of resection is focally positive for tumor. 3. Pelvic lymph node part A, excision (C) - One lymph node, negative for tumor (0/1). 4. Pelvic lymph node part B, excision (D) - Three lymph nodes, negative for tumor (0/3).

I have started doing Kegel Exercises following my surgeon's instructions that I was provided at followup. I assume that improving involves a combination of healing from the surgery (Automatic) and performing regular and lots of daily Kegel Exercises (patient-dependent). I have a couple of questions ... 1. How long did it take for you to begin improving ? 2. Did you do anything spectal to improve faster ? 3. What product(s) have you found to be most effective (Either available locally or mail-order)? I have found that regular Depends briefs seriously leak during the overnight and day as well. Are there any products widely available locally which don't leak ? Right now I am using about 5 or 6 briefs a day - it's that bad. Which means I go through a whole pack in only 4 days. It will cost me big bucks if I have to buy a new pack every 4 days. What strategy have you used to cut down on the number of briefs used per day ? 4. Have any of you tried to use penile clamps and are they effective ? They would seem to be an elegant solution similar to how water is turned off using a valve. Do doctor's recommend them ? Could they cause damage ? Thanks. Tim",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by Fairwind The tiny spot of positive margin was Gleason 3...G-3 is not aggressive or invasive. I would agree with your doctor. You are done with prostate cancer.. Thanks for your input, Fairwind and MM16 That's kind-of the idea I got based upon reading this forum and reviewing some studies from John Hopkins Medical. My doc is having me get a series of PSA tests upcoming in I believe 6 weeks and 3 months. He has already ordered them so all I need to show up at the lab at these various times. I also have a followup appt I think in 3 months so I'll maybe inquire a bit more to have him eplain what all of this means. Tim",

      "Content": "Hi all; I thought I'd report on my continence/incontinence status since I posted a lot about of in the few weeks and months following RALP. It has now been 5 months since surgery and I am doing pretty well with my continence though not perfect (yet). One problem I had that concerned me greatly was my bedwetting fairly long (at least it seemed to me) following surgery. I am happy to report that it appears that has completely gone away. I will wear a belted shield because I appear to pee a very tiny amount but never enough to cause my bed to get wet. I also noticed to my surprise that I seem to be sleeping better and don't need to get up so often at night to urinate. Now I usually get up only one time at night when in the past it used to be 2 or 3 times. Other than that, I do sometimes still have incontinence during the waking hours usually just after I drink something and am standing up. I also have incontinence when i cough or have a bowel movement but I know that is common. For this reason, I always wear a belted shield during the day but I usually only require one during the entire day so its usually not that much of a problem with daily activities. During my 3-month followup with my surgeon and was still having problems I requested and was provided with a physical therapy referral. My first appointment is in a few weeks. Even though I am better now than I was when I saw my surgeon for the followup, I still plan to keep that appointment because I feel it could help me improve the rest of the way quicker. I know there's a lot of interest here on the benefits or lack of benefits from physical therapy so I'll let you know how things go. Tim",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by Another If I had a recurrence the only fact I think I'd want from the surgeon is where did anyting look suspicious to direct the next round of treatment. Unless they made notes I can't imagine they'd remember or even want the responsibility of sharing information like that. I've heard of surgeons sometimes placing clips to mark a spot. Other than that, it's on to the next expert. I was reading this thread and your comment about the \"surgeon taking notes\" jumped out at me. After my surgery at the Cleveland Clinic, I specifically asked if my surgeon took notes and indeed he did - all three typed pages of them providing a highly detailed explanation of exactly what he did through the entire RP procedure. I couldn't imagine him typing while he was cutting so I'm guessing he spoke them to someone else to type. Maybe all surgeons keep detailed notes on every procedure they do, perhaps now even more to protect themselves from a lawsuit. Dave From MD, you may ask Partin's office he he took notes during your procedure. I would expect any surgeon would be happy to give a patient their notes, especially if they're proud of their work. My surgeon didn't hesitate giving me his notes when I asked for them which I'll take as a sign he was proud of his work . I do want to warn that it's a little strange reading about the procedure that was done on you, but it's also informative. Of course, my doctor and probably yours too used a ton of strange names that you have no idea what they mean unless you google them. I will make another comment. Not sure if Hopkins is different but my surgeon is happy to see me for followup care. I've had two followup visits post-rp and at my 1 year anniversary I see him once a year with quarterly PSA tests. Though perhaps after 5 years of undetectable (fingers crossed) he'll taper off my visits. I wish you the very best of success moving forward, Dave from md. Tim",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by Prowler My question does not pertain to how a Gleason score is determined, that's defined in every PCa website. My question is whether a tumor with Gleason 4 or 5 cancer cells are a result of Gleason 3 cells that have existed for a longer time and matured into a more aggressive cancer. Or are they different types of prostate cancer that are more aggressive than others. I realize the the more the prostate cancer cell looks less like a prostate tissue cell, the higher the Gleason score. But what makes them be more aggressive? Hello Prowler; There was a research study done which indicates that Gleason Score progression is uncommon. It is generally thought that the grade of prostate cancer remains the same. Here is an article discussing this study - http://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/p...s-201308146604 And if you really want to dig deep, here is a link to the research study - http://cancerres.aacrjournals.org/co...4-ae9e67eaf77f I have mostly G3 but a very small amount of G4 (5%) was detected in two cores which increased my Gleason Sum to 7 (3+4). While one may conclude that the G3 turned into G4 recently, I suppose the G4 could be a new growth. Since the G4 is such a small percentage of the core, I am assuming it started recently. I am getting Robotic RP surgery August 1st to take care of this before the 5% of G4 turns into a higher percentage. Tim",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by garyi Great question! I sure hope not. garyi, I am curious why you say you hope not? What other explanation could there be? G4 cells didn't just appear in a split second. In my mind, it only makes sense that time would be the only factor in whether you have a 3+4 or a 4+3 by the very definition of what Gleason scoring is. Say you start out with G3 only in a core. Then your Gleason sum would be 3+3=6. Then a new tumor starts in that same core that is G4. It starts out as a single cell and then continues to multiply faster than a G3. Now you have a Gleason Sum of 3+4. Eventually, if you let the G4 grow long enough, the G4 tumor will get larger than the G3. Now your Gleason Sum is 4+3. Tim",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by Consult1 From what I have researched, the surgeon will see how easily the tissue peels off at the edges. If it peels off easily, that typically indicates no cancer. If it's sticky, then they either have take out more or do pathology during the surgery to decide (if they have the capability to do that). I rejected my first urologist based on him saying he would automatically take out the nerve bundles based almost solely on my genetic test results. I want someone who will make decisions based on the circumstances they find during the surgery- I wouldn't expect a guarantee of nerve sparing or nerve ending in advance unless there was conclusive evidence from an MRI or some other test. Hey, Consult1; I hadn't thought about it your way but makes lots of sense that nerve sparring is a real-time decision during surgery. I got two opinions for surgery and my first surgeon (Who I thankfully didn't chose) wrote on his notes that he was going to take out one nerve bundle plus 15 lymph nodes (Which seemed really excessive to me) two months before the surgery. He was part of a dedicated urology practice. My other surgeon who I did chose from the Cleveland Clinic did as you said, I believe and decided at surgery time whether or how much of the nerve bundle he wanted to remove or spare and also removed significantly less lymph nodes (4 rather than 15) so now I feel better.

      "Content": "Hello All; I thought I'd post some information I discovered recently. You should know that I research everything and this is especially true when it comes to my health. It is generally reported in this forum that Gleason 3+4 behaves almost exactly like 3+3. However, I found this to be only partially true. I received the results of my biopsy second opinion from the Cleveland Clinic and noticed that they added some information that wasn't on the initial biopsy. for my two 3+4 cores, they listed the percentage of pattern 4 which for both cores in my case was 5%. I began investigating further and I found a research study that stated that a 3+4 behaves like a 3+3 and has similar outcomes but only if the percentage of pattern 4 is less than or equal to 6%. See ... https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26750655. Because my second opinion biopsy listed pattern 4 in both cores as 5%, I match the criteria for it acting similar to 3+3 but maybe others may not. I am going to assume that the major hospitals like John Hopkins, etc ... will list the percentage of pattern 4 in a 3+4 or 4+3 sample but smaller hospitals or perhaps mail-order testing labs (Like my initial biopsy) may not.

      "Content": "Hello All; I thought I'd post some information I discovered recently. You should know that I research everything and this is especially true when it comes to my health. It is generally reported in this forum that Gleason 3+4 behaves almost exactly like 3+3. However, I found this to be only partially true. I received the results of my biopsy second opinion from the Cleveland Clinic and noticed that they added some information that wasn't on the initial biopsy. for my two 3+4 cores, they listed the percentage of pattern 4 which for both cores in my case was 5%. I began investigating further and I found a research study that stated that a 3+4 behaves like a 3+3 and has similar outcomes but only if the percentage of pattern 4 is less than or equal to 6%. See ... https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26750655. Because my second opinion biopsy listed pattern 4 in both cores as 5%, I match the criteria for it acting similar to 3+3 but maybe others may not. I am going to assume that the major hospitals like John Hopkins, etc ... will list the percentage of pattern 4 in a 3+4 or 4+3 sample but smaller hospitals or perhaps mail-order testing labs (Like my initial biopsy) may not. Hopefully the Gleason score won't be upgraded for my final pathology will remain 3+4 or even be reduced to 3+3 - I'll know in about a month.

      "Content": "Originally Posted by Consult1 The first test my urologist ordered after the prostate biopsy was a bone scan. I had two cores with Gleason 6 and my PSA was 7.49. Because there was a questionable rib from the scan, I had to endure a stressful bone biopsy which was not a fun way to spend a Friday. Then more stress until the result finally was released a week later, and fortunately it was negative. Since then I have tried to determine if that course of action was appropriate or not. According to Dr. Walsh's Guide to Surviving Prostate Cancer, he doesn't recommend a scan unless the PSA is higher than 20, or Gleason greater than 7, or Stage T3 or greater. This criteria is similar to what Dr. Chodak recommends as he states that 13% of the scans have a questionable result which leads to a biopsy. His statistics are that only 3 of 1000 biopsy's lead to a positive finding for cancer in the bone when that criteria isn't used. Maybe this will help someone in a similar situation. From what I have read a 3T MRI should have been the first test ordered. Are there others with a different take on this? By the way, my first urologist is no longer my urologist. Consult1; So sorry to hear you had to go through a bone biopsy. My urologist had me go through a bone scan only because my biopsy was 3+4. He specifically remarked that if I were a 3+3, it would be a waste of money. And even with a 3+4, he also specifically remarked that with such a low psa as I (5.9), he said he highly doubted that the bone scan would be positive. In addition, when I went through the bone scan, I was a little concerned because the technician said she wanted to take a few extra pictures in case the physician ordered them - so for 2 weeks while waiting for the results, I was worried sick but only found out when I asked the doctor that there was a previous injury to my shoulder (which I didn't even know about). So even though they saw something unusual in the bone scan, the doctor apparently knew that this finding was due to an injury and not cancer. I am not sure why your urologist had you submit to a bone biopsy with only a 3+3 and such low psa (under 10) but I think I would be hesitant to keep that doctor. In my opinion, I would look for a different urologist. Tim",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by bigalcalbisque Back at home, trying to walk as much as possible. basically around the interior of the house, then resting quite a bit. been passing gas but no bowel movement yet. Pretty chipper mood but ugghh, the dull pain, its not bad its just there and I want to go sparingly on the drugs as I dont want to get constipated as I also have Diverticulosis. Doing pretty decent with my pee bag after the first episode by myself which was not bad if I say so myself. Just a drip from the outer end of the catheter as I am looking at it wondering why it is dripping...oh yeah, my bladder. Quick question, is 2 days without a bowel movement in the normal range and. Back to the pain, it really isn't that bad when I am still, its just when I am moving from 1 position to another, I am assuming that is normal also. Boy what an experience huh? One last thing, my surgery was last Wednesday morning at 8 am and I am scheduled to meet with my Urologist this coming up Tuesday at 12 noon, the Office manager set up the appointment, is that a little too early to get it out or should I just go with the flow and keep that appointment, no pun intended! A big thanks to everybody here that took the time to support me, only forum I have ever been on that was so supportive. You all have helped me more than you will ever know. I am very thankful. Al As I recall, I had my first wattery bM about 4 days after surgery but no real solid BM for quite some time, almost a week post-surgery. I was getting so concerned and even bought prunes to help and that did help for sure. If you had Robotic Surgery and your surgeon did a good job, your catheter should only need to be in for 7-8 days. Mine was. Most surgeons will order a cystogram before they take the catheter out to verify there are no leaks. Sounds like you're doing good and recovering well. Well keep us posted on your progress.

      "Content": "Originally Posted by Consult1 From what I have researched, the surgeon will see how easily the tissue peels off at the edges. If it peels off easily, that typically indicates no cancer. If it's sticky, then they either have take out more or do pathology during the surgery to decide (if they have the capability to do that). I rejected my first urologist based on him saying he would automatically take out the nerve bundles based almost solely on my genetic test results. I want someone who will make decisions based on the circumstances they find during the surgery- I wouldn't expect a guarantee of nerve sparing or nerve ending in advance unless there was conclusive evidence from an MRI or some other test. Hey, Consult1; I hadn't thought about it your way but makes lots of sense that nerve sparring is a real-time decision during surgery. I got two opinions for surgery and my first surgeon (Who I thankfully didn't chose) wrote on his notes that he was going to take out one nerve bundle plus 15 lymph nodes (Which seemed really excessive to me) two months before the surgery. He was part of a dedicated urology practice. My other surgeon who I did chose from the Cleveland Clinic did as you said, I believe and decided at surgery time whether or how much of the nerve bundle he wanted to remove or spare and also removed significantly less lymph nodes (4 rather than 15) so now I feel better.

      "Content": "Originally Posted by MrEd That's good news Tim, It's been 2 weeks since I had my PSA check and your post reminded me I did not know my results yet. I called and after waiting for 20 minutes the lady came back and told me it was .1. I asked her is that .1 or <.1. She said it was good and anything less than .25 was good. I said no, its not good and I asked again if there was a less than sign ahead of that .1 and she said \"oh yeah there is a less than sign in front of it\". I told her to get that posted up in the portal so I could see it. Anyway I guess if your BG was high enough it might put you in a deeper sleep than normal. Also a couple of drinks before sleep could relax you a bit too much but it sounds like your on an average path and doing will. Thanks for the update. Take care. Ed Hi Mr. Ed - Thanks for your comments. Regarding my blood glucose being high, it tends to do the opposite and keeps me up due to urinating a lot more than usual. It doesn't cause me to sleep deeper. This usually happens predictably if I eat something I'm not supposed to so I try to avoid such a situation. So sorry to hear you had to get stressed out by the long wait for your PSA result and the lady who didn't understand the significance of the less-than sign. My result is automatically posted to Mychart at the Cleveland Clinic the day after the blood is drawn. Your result should be posted the day after if done at a major hospital though it could take longer if they have to send it out to a remote lab. Tim",

If I encounter a research study or article that only gives me a summary and charges for the full text, I copy and paste the title to google and can usually find somewhere where the full text is displayed for free. Even if you can't find it for free anywhere (Which in my experience is pretty rare), usually if it's a study of interest to a lot of people, someone will write an article about it somewhere. I have found, though that I am able to read the full text of most any research article that I find without paying for it. Keep in mind, though that especially with medical issues, some text may be difficult to understand if you're not a doctor and familiar with the terminology but usually by skipping to the end, they will include a summary of the results in less technical terms. Oops \u2026 sorry Info Gathering. I stand corrected - after I posted this reply, I realize that you posted a reply yesterday that suggested pretty much the same thing. Tim",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by MrEd That's good news Tim, It's been 2 weeks since I had my PSA check and your post reminded me I did not know my results yet. I called and after waiting for 20 minutes the lady came back and told me it was .1. I asked her is that .1 or <.1. She said it was good and anything less than .25 was good. I said no, its not good and I asked again if there was a less than sign ahead of that .1 and she said \"oh yeah there is a less than sign in front of it\". I told her to get that posted up in the portal so I could see it. Anyway I guess if your BG was high enough it might put you in a deeper sleep than normal. Also a couple of drinks before sleep could relax you a bit too much but it sounds like your on an average path and doing will. Thanks for the update. Take care. Ed Hi Mr. Ed - Thanks for your comments. Regarding my blood glucose being high, it tends to do the opposite and keeps me up due to urinating a lot more than usual. It doesn't cause me to sleep deeper. This usually happens predictably if I eat something I'm not supposed to so I try to avoid such a situation. So sorry to hear you had to get stressed out by the long wait for your PSA result and the lady who didn't understand the significance of the less-than sign. My result is automatically posted to Mychart at the Cleveland Clinic the day after the blood is drawn. Your result should be posted the day after if done at a major hospital though it could take longer if they have to send it out to a remote lab. Tim",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by bigalcalbisque Back at home, trying to walk as much as possible. basically around the interior of the house, then resting quite a bit. been passing gas but no bowel movement yet. Pretty chipper mood but ugghh, the dull pain, its not bad its just there and I want to go sparingly on the drugs as I dont want to get constipated as I also have Diverticulosis. Doing pretty decent with my pee bag after the first episode by myself which was not bad if I say so myself. Just a drip from the outer end of the catheter as I am looking at it wondering why it is dripping...oh yeah, my bladder. Quick question, is 2 days without a bowel movement in the normal range and. Back to the pain, it really isn't that bad when I am still, its just when I am moving from 1 position to another, I am assuming that is normal also. Boy what an experience huh? One last thing, my surgery was last Wednesday morning at 8 am and I am scheduled to meet with my Urologist this coming up Tuesday at 12 noon, the Office manager set up the appointment, is that a little too early to get it out or should I just go with the flow and keep that appointment, no pun intended! A big thanks to everybody here that took the time to support me, only forum I have ever been on that was so supportive. You all have helped me more than you will ever know. I am very thankful. Al As I recall, I had my first wattery bM about 4 days after surgery but no real solid BM for quite some time, almost a week post-surgery. I was getting so concerned and even bought prunes to help and that did help for sure. If you had Robotic Surgery and your surgeon did a good job, your catheter should only need to be in for 7-8 days. Mine was. Most surgeons will order a cystogram before they take the catheter out to verify there are no leaks. Sounds like you're doing good and recovering well. Well keep us posted on your progress.

      "Content": "Hi Sma; You would just tell him. Folks can correct me if I'm wrong but I imagine something as large as major robotic prostectomy would require a team of people to accomplish the surgery. However, I believe it is reasonable to expect your surgeon to be at the controls of the robot at all times. It is my understanding that this sometimes doesn't happen with big teaching hospitals as was my case when I had my surgery done at the World Famous Cleveland Clinic. I specifically asked my surgeon if he would be doing the surgery himself and I got a very detailed answer. He said he would be performing all of the major parts himself but there were a lots of other people in my care during the surgery also helping. And this turned out to be a good thing in my case because I had a reaction to the anesthetic and my heart stopped but it was quickly restarted within 20 seconds with no ill effects (Thank goodness). He did say that I can request not so many people present but I told him that was OK and that my only concern was that he was doing the actual surgery. At my first followup when I got my catheter out and my final pathology, I asked for (and was provided) a very detailed report on every step he took to perform the surgery and it was really fascinating to read but he did mention having two surgeon assistants helping with the surgery. The report doesn't specifically state that another surgeon (other than my primary surgeon) did the actual surgery but I believe they did however, I am confident they played a minor role such as opening and closing, etc ... In the end I feel he did a good overall job. Also the report specified that my primary surgeon was present throughout the surgery and was always watching what the assistant surgeons were doing. I did have a very tiny positive margin though not sure who was at the controls to cause that if it could have even been avoided. At 3 months following surgery and my 3-month followup with surgeon this week, I am happy with the overall outcome. If you are having your surgery done at a teaching hospital, you will likely have doctor's assistants helping as that is how doctor's train. If you want your surgeon to perform the full surgery, just tell him. If he refuses, it is within your right to find another surgeon. However, if this is what your surgeon routinely does and you like him and trust him, I don't think I would particularly demand he not use assistants but instead that he do all of the major parts and for those minor parts, he is watching them continuously.

      "Content": "Originally Posted by Michael F Hi Tim! The most important thing to do at this point is: NOT Panic! Your final Path places you in Grade Group 2 which is not high risk. Talk to your URO Surgeon and discuss the implications, if any. Ask when you should repeat the PSA. Be sure your PSAs are being analyzed by The Same Lab Using The Same PSA Methodology each time! Please post the exact Post Op PSA values and dates drawn. Hoping your next PSA is < 0.03! Keep us updated! MF Thanks, Michael for your encouragement and advice not to panic. I'll post my post-op psa values tomorrow but I recall every one up until today were <.03. So today, I just lost the less-than sign. I'll post exact data tomorrow. Also, my surgeon has been checking my psa every 3 months and I have my last one ordered (before I see him for a followup) 3 months from now. Do you think 3 months is too long to wait and should I email him and ask him to order a test every month ? I had my last test only 2 months ago and it was <.03. Tim",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by Consult1 After a fairly stable PSA of 4.0 (plus/minus 0.15) for 3 straight 6 month readings, it jumped up to 7.49 in May 2017. Biopsy in June revealed left and right apex Gleason 6, one less than 5% and the other core 35%. Dr. ordered an OncotypeDx GPS genetic test on the Gleason 6 cores and it came back high risk- a 43 score. Volume of prostate 50-60 cc. He wanted to schedule surgery with no nerve sparing possibility which sent me into a daze. Got a few other opinions after that, and the Dr. I felt most comfortable with (he started doing DaVinci's in 2003) ordered a 3T MRI which didn't show anything new regarding the prostate but did show a small growth behind the bladder which is probably a liposarcoma. Of the opinions I have sought, only the original Dr. seemed to feel anything unusual on the prostate. At the Cleveland Clinic the urologist said if it wasn't for the genetic test showing high risk, I would have been a perfect candidate for Active Surveillance- his opinion was that I'm a T1c. All urologists with the exception of the first think that nerve sparing is very likely. The original Dr. ordered a bone scan, which revealed one rib with a \"lesion\", which from what I can tell can mean nothing or something. I've read Gleason 6 almost never spreads beyond the prostate unless the biopsy didn't find the most aggressive portion. But my MRI didn't indicate there was more involved. So I was referred to a Ortho Oncologist and she ordered a bone biopsy (not a lot of fun) and am now waiting for the results with even more stress on top of everything. I will need at least an operation to remove the small tumor, but talked to Radiation Oncologists about Cyberknife and HDR Bracytherapy. While I'm a devout coward when it comes to surgery and at least temporary side effects, it seems to make the most sense to have one operation for both and not go through two different treatments. I'm healthy (other than my stress levels getting my blood pressure up higher than normal) and take no meds. A small aside is that I'm a stomach sleeper, which probably means I wouldn't get good quality sleep with the catheter. Any thoughts from those who have been there and done that would be appreciated. If I've missed anything I will be happy to add details. Hi Consult1; I actually had surgery at the Cleveland Clinic about 1-1/2 weeks ago (August 1, 2017) by Dr. Andrew Stephenson and am recovering at home now. I found that surgery was a breeze with very little to no pain but the catheter (which I thankfully only had for 8 days) was a major pain (literally) - it hurt so bad. Some men don't experience pain like I did, guess I was just unlucky. You will have to put up with sleeping on your back for only a week. Interestingly, I always sleep on my back so wasn't a problem for me but many men who need a catheter don't and they still manage to get through the week OK. Obviously, sleeping on your stomach isn't an option with a catheter. You can read about my complete day-to-day experiences before and after surgery here ... https://www.cancerforums.net/threads...Some-questions As I have learned, most of the people on this forum are pro-surgery. In my case, I wanted to just get rid of the cancer rather than just burn it out with radiation. Plus, Radiation has the potential to lead to secondary cancers. In addition, if you have surgery and your PSA comes back, then you can be treated with radiation to knock out the rest of the cancer. But if you're treated with radiation, and you have a reoccurrence, you generally can't go back and have surgery. So in other words, if your cancer comes back following treatment, you get a second shot at a cure with surgery but not so with radiation. So just my opinion, I think you shouldn't fear surgery and give it a consideration. I am not really familiar with the lab test results you got but I'm sure others will chime in here too with additional insight. A few studies and information seem to indicate that Gleason 6 is not capable of spreading, but some men with Gleason 6 are found to actually have a higher grade of cancer once the full prostate is examined by a pathologist (If you opt for surgery - which is another benefit to having surgery that isn't available with radiation). Fortunately for me, that didn't happen and I remained the same gleason grade that I was on biopsy but others on this forum have been upgraded following surgery when they received the results of their final pathology. It is said to happen in about 20% of cases. Tim",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by FeatherBoy Regarding urinary ketones. Is your father a diabetic? Please see link below. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ketonuria Yes Keytones can be a problem if your father is diabetic like Featherboy said. Usually a Type 1 Diabetic is my understanding. Also, high keytones can occur if your father is on a very low carb ketogenic diet where he gets most of his energy from fat, less from protein, and hardly none from carbs. I know because I experimented with a very low carb diet several times to try to help my type 2 diabetes and I got some keytones in my urine, even twice on lab tests but I also checked my keytones at home. If you do it through a low carb diet, it's safe but if you generated keytones due to being a type 1 diabetic, it can be life threatening. Also, regarding the biopsy. I had mine (12 core) done under general anesthesia and I didn't feel anything after I woke up from the procedure. I have heard that lots of doctors don't use general anesthesia and instead use local which I hear isn't painful but can be a little uncomfortable. I would think pain wouldn't be a problem with a biopsy though others can chime in if they had other experiences. Tim",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by FeatherBoy Regarding urinary ketones. Is your father a diabetic? Please see link below. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ketonuria Yes Keytones can be a problem if your father is diabetic like Featherboy said. Usually a Type 1 Diabetic is my understanding. Also, high keytones can occur if your father is on a very low carb ketogenic diet where he gets most of his energy from fat, less from protein, and hardly none from carbs. I know because I experimented with a very low carb diet several times to try to help my type 2 diabetes and I got some keytones in my urine, even twice on lab tests but I also checked my keytones at home. If you do it through a low carb diet, it's safe but if you generated keytones due to being a type 1 diabetic, it can be life threatening. Also, regarding the biopsy. I had mine (12 core) done under general anesthesia and I didn't feel anything after I woke up from the procedure. I have heard that lots of doctors don't use general anesthesia and instead use local which I hear isn't painful but can be a little uncomfortable. I would think pain wouldn't be a problem with a biopsy though others can chime in if they had other experiences. Tim",

      "Content": "Hello All; I got my quarterly PSA result today and it was an unwelcome .03 (I lost the < sign). Can you give me some advice about what I should do based on the experience of those that have had this happen to them ? Should I wait until my next PSA test in 3 months, or should I request a PSA test every month now? Should I call my surgeon asking for advice or a referral to a Radiation Oncologist ? I was so hoping I would avoid this but I hear stories of this happening on here fairly often. From what I'm reading, the sooner radiation starts after a detectable PSA rise, the better chance for a cure. Thanks. Tim",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by Consult1 After a fairly stable PSA of 4.0 (plus/minus 0.15) for 3 straight 6 month readings, it jumped up to 7.49 in May 2017. Biopsy in June revealed left and right apex Gleason 6, one less than 5% and the other core 35%. Dr. ordered an OncotypeDx GPS genetic test on the Gleason 6 cores and it came back high risk- a 43 score. Volume of prostate 50-60 cc. He wanted to schedule surgery with no nerve sparing possibility which sent me into a daze. Got a few other opinions after that, and the Dr. I felt most comfortable with (he started doing DaVinci's in 2003) ordered a 3T MRI which didn't show anything new regarding the prostate but did show a small growth behind the bladder which is probably a liposarcoma. Of the opinions I have sought, only the original Dr. seemed to feel anything unusual on the prostate. At the Cleveland Clinic the urologist said if it wasn't for the genetic test showing high risk, I would have been a perfect candidate for Active Surveillance- his opinion was that I'm a T1c. All urologists with the exception of the first think that nerve sparing is very likely. The original Dr. ordered a bone scan, which revealed one rib with a \"lesion\", which from what I can tell can mean nothing or something. I've read Gleason 6 almost never spreads beyond the prostate unless the biopsy didn't find the most aggressive portion. But my MRI didn't indicate there was more involved. So I was referred to a Ortho Oncologist and she ordered a bone biopsy (not a lot of fun) and am now waiting for the results with even more stress on top of everything. I will need at least an operation to remove the small tumor, but talked to Radiation Oncologists about Cyberknife and HDR Bracytherapy. While I'm a devout coward when it comes to surgery and at least temporary side effects, it seems to make the most sense to have one operation for both and not go through two different treatments. I'm healthy (other than my stress levels getting my blood pressure up higher than normal) and take no meds. A small aside is that I'm a stomach sleeper, which probably means I wouldn't get good quality sleep with the catheter. Any thoughts from those who have been there and done that would be appreciated. If I've missed anything I will be happy to add details. Hi Consult1; I actually had surgery at the Cleveland Clinic about 1-1/2 weeks ago (August 1, 2017) by Dr. Andrew Stephenson and am recovering at home now. I found that surgery was a breeze with very little to no pain but the catheter (which I thankfully only had for 8 days) was a major pain (literally) - it hurt so bad. Some men don't experience pain like I did, guess I was just unlucky. You will have to put up with sleeping on your back for only a week. Interestingly, I always sleep on my back so wasn't a problem for me but many men who need a catheter don't and they still manage to get through the week OK. Obviously, sleeping on your stomach isn't an option with a catheter. You can read about my complete day-to-day experiences before and after surgery here ... https://www.cancerforums.net/threads...Some-questions As I have learned, most of the people on this forum are pro-surgery. In my case, I wanted to just get rid of the cancer rather than just burn it out with radiation. Plus, Radiation has the potential to lead to secondary cancers. In addition, if you have surgery and your PSA comes back, then you can be treated with radiation to knock out the rest of the cancer. But if you're treated with radiation, and you have a reoccurrence, you generally can't go back and have surgery. So in other words, if your cancer comes back following treatment, you get a second shot at a cure with surgery but not so with radiation. So just my opinion, I think you shouldn't fear surgery and give it a consideration. I am not really familiar with the lab test results you got but I'm sure others will chime in here too with additional insight. A few studies and information seem to indicate that Gleason 6 is not capable of spreading, but some men with Gleason 6 are found to actually have a higher grade of cancer once the full prostate is examined by a pathologist (If you opt for surgery - which is another benefit to having surgery that isn't available with radiation). Fortunately for me, that didn't happen and I remained the same gleason grade that I was on biopsy but others on this forum have been upgraded following surgery when they received the results of their final pathology. It is said to happen in about 20% of cases. Tim",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by Consult1 After a fairly stable PSA of 4.0 (plus/minus 0.15) for 3 straight 6 month readings, it jumped up to 7.49 in May 2017. Biopsy in June revealed left and right apex Gleason 6, one less than 5% and the other core 35%. Dr. ordered an OncotypeDx GPS genetic test on the Gleason 6 cores and it came back high risk- a 43 score. Volume of prostate 50-60 cc. He wanted to schedule surgery with no nerve sparing possibility which sent me into a daze. Got a few other opinions after that, and the Dr. I felt most comfortable with (he started doing DaVinci's in 2003) ordered a 3T MRI which didn't show anything new regarding the prostate but did show a small growth behind the bladder which is probably a liposarcoma. Of the opinions I have sought, only the original Dr. seemed to feel anything unusual on the prostate. At the Cleveland Clinic the urologist said if it wasn't for the genetic test showing high risk, I would have been a perfect candidate for Active Surveillance- his opinion was that I'm a T1c. All urologists with the exception of the first think that nerve sparing is very likely. The original Dr. ordered a bone scan, which revealed one rib with a \"lesion\", which from what I can tell can mean nothing or something. I've read Gleason 6 almost never spreads beyond the prostate unless the biopsy didn't find the most aggressive portion. But my MRI didn't indicate there was more involved. So I was referred to a Ortho Oncologist and she ordered a bone biopsy (not a lot of fun) and am now waiting for the results with even more stress on top of everything. I will need at least an operation to remove the small tumor, but talked to Radiation Oncologists about Cyberknife and HDR Bracytherapy. While I'm a devout coward when it comes to surgery and at least temporary side effects, it seems to make the most sense to have one operation for both and not go through two different treatments. I'm healthy (other than my stress levels getting my blood pressure up higher than normal) and take no meds. A small aside is that I'm a stomach sleeper, which probably means I wouldn't get good quality sleep with the catheter. Any thoughts from those who have been there and done that would be appreciated. If I've missed anything I will be happy to add details. Hi Consult1; I actually had surgery at the Cleveland Clinic about 1-1/2 weeks ago (August 1, 2017) by Dr. Andrew Stephenson and am recovering at home now. I found that surgery was a breeze with very little to no pain but the catheter (which I thankfully only had for 8 days) was a major pain (literally) - it hurt so bad. Some men don't experience pain like I did, guess I was just unlucky. You will have to put up with sleeping on your back for only a week. Interestingly, I always sleep on my back so wasn't a problem for me but many men who need a catheter don't and they still manage to get through the week OK. Obviously, sleeping on your stomach isn't an option with a catheter. You can read about my complete day-to-day experiences before and after surgery here ... https://www.cancerforums.net/threads...Some-questions As I have learned, most of the people on this forum are pro-surgery. In my case, I wanted to just get rid of the cancer rather than just burn it out with radiation. Plus, Radiation has the potential to lead to secondary cancers. In addition, if you have surgery and your PSA comes back, then you can be treated with radiation to knock out the rest of the cancer. But if you're treated with radiation, and you have a reoccurrence, you generally can't go back and have surgery. So in other words, if your cancer comes back following treatment, you get a second shot at a cure with surgery but not so with radiation. So just my opinion, I think you shouldn't fear surgery and give it a consideration. I am not really familiar with the lab test results you got but I'm sure others will chime in here too with additional insight. A few studies and information seem to indicate that Gleason 6 is not capable of spreading, but some men with Gleason 6 are found to actually have a higher grade of cancer once the full prostate is examined by a pathologist (If you opt for surgery - which is another benefit to having surgery that isn't available with radiation). Fortunately for me, that didn't happen and I remained the same gleason grade that I was on biopsy but others on this forum have been upgraded following surgery when they received the results of their final pathology. It is said to happen in about 20% of cases. Tim",

Thanks for the tip, Another. I actually did try before seeing your post. However, I didn't feel as if it came out any ... perhaps that was good. Interestingly, I called my surgeon's nurse today to try to get some catheter comfort and she pretty much indicated I had to put up with the pain until Wed. I also asked about lubing the tube using the hospital-provided surgilube and she thought it was a bad idea to try to lube the tube as I could inadvertently introduce some germs which could cause a UTI. Of course tomorrow, that may be a non-issue as I have been instructed to take a antibiotic one day before, the day of, and the day after catheter removal. She did say I could lube the tip of my penis but I don't see the sense in that as a way to reduce pain. So I guess I have to live with the pain until Wed. Tim",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by Consult1 After a fairly stable PSA of 4.0 (plus/minus 0.15) for 3 straight 6 month readings, it jumped up to 7.49 in May 2017. Biopsy in June revealed left and right apex Gleason 6, one less than 5% and the other core 35%. Dr. ordered an OncotypeDx GPS genetic test on the Gleason 6 cores and it came back high risk- a 43 score. Volume of prostate 50-60 cc. He wanted to schedule surgery with no nerve sparing possibility which sent me into a daze. Got a few other opinions after that, and the Dr. I felt most comfortable with (he started doing DaVinci's in 2003) ordered a 3T MRI which didn't show anything new regarding the prostate but did show a small growth behind the bladder which is probably a liposarcoma. Of the opinions I have sought, only the original Dr. seemed to feel anything unusual on the prostate. At the Cleveland Clinic the urologist said if it wasn't for the genetic test showing high risk, I would have been a perfect candidate for Active Surveillance- his opinion was that I'm a T1c. All urologists with the exception of the first think that nerve sparing is very likely. The original Dr. ordered a bone scan, which revealed one rib with a \"lesion\", which from what I can tell can mean nothing or something. I've read Gleason 6 almost never spreads beyond the prostate unless the biopsy didn't find the most aggressive portion. But my MRI didn't indicate there was more involved. So I was referred to a Ortho Oncologist and she ordered a bone biopsy (not a lot of fun) and am now waiting for the results with even more stress on top of everything. I will need at least an operation to remove the small tumor, but talked to Radiation Oncologists about Cyberknife and HDR Bracytherapy. While I'm a devout coward when it comes to surgery and at least temporary side effects, it seems to make the most sense to have one operation for both and not go through two different treatments. I'm healthy (other than my stress levels getting my blood pressure up higher than normal) and take no meds. A small aside is that I'm a stomach sleeper, which probably means I wouldn't get good quality sleep with the catheter. Any thoughts from those who have been there and done that would be appreciated. If I've missed anything I will be happy to add details. Hi Consult1; I actually had surgery at the Cleveland Clinic about 1-1/2 weeks ago (August 1, 2017) by Dr. Andrew Stephenson and am recovering at home now. I found that surgery was a breeze with very little to no pain but the catheter (which I thankfully only had for 8 days) was a major pain (literally) - it hurt so bad. Some men don't experience pain like I did, guess I was just unlucky. You will have to put up with sleeping on your back for only a week. Interestingly, I always sleep on my back so wasn't a problem for me but many men who need a catheter don't and they still manage to get through the week OK. Obviously, sleeping on your stomach isn't an option with a catheter. You can read about my complete day-to-day experiences before and after surgery here ... https://www.cancerforums.net/threads...Some-questions As I have learned, most of the people on this forum are pro-surgery. In my case, I wanted to just get rid of the cancer rather than just burn it out with radiation. Plus, Radiation has the potential to lead to secondary cancers. In addition, if you have surgery and your PSA comes back, then you can be treated with radiation to knock out the rest of the cancer. But if you're treated with radiation, and you have a reoccurrence, you generally can't go back and have surgery. So in other words, if your cancer comes back following treatment, you get a second shot at a cure with surgery but not so with radiation. So just my opinion, I think you shouldn't fear surgery and give it a consideration. I am not really familiar with the lab test results you got but I'm sure others will chime in here too with additional insight. A few studies and information seem to indicate that Gleason 6 is not capable of spreading, but some men with Gleason 6 are found to actually have a higher grade of cancer once the full prostate is examined by a pathologist (If you opt for surgery - which is another benefit to having surgery that isn't available with radiation). Fortunately for me, that didn't happen and I remained the same gleason grade that I was on biopsy but others on this forum have been upgraded following surgery when they received the results of their final pathology. It is said to happen in about 20% of cases. Tim",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by ASAdvocate There are a number of outdated statements in this post. The possibility of secondary cancers from radiation was true in the 1980's and maybe 1990's, but is insignificant today due to improved technology. Also, if there is a recurrence after primary radiation, that can now be successfully treated by SBRT radiation. So, many of the talking points about surgery having advantages over radiation are no longer true. As Tim admitted, this is a pro-surgery prostate cancer forum. There are others that favor radiation, and still others that favor an alphabet soup of lesser known treatments. You owe it to yourself to get as many opinions as you can. Good luck. ASAAdvocate; I would like to see a non-biased study demonstrating that SBRT (Or other forms of high-energy radiation treatment for Prostate Cancer) doesn't cause secondary cancer's. My statements were based upon the well-known fact that ionization radiation has the ability to initiate cancer growth. Doctor's always downplay the risks because their treatments represent big bucks to them. Obviously, if you have cancer already, then you don't have anything to lose by destroying it with radiation. However, given the choice, I would chose surgery as I did to try to avoid radiation treatment. But as everyone knows here, with Prostate Cancer, even surgery (or radiation) isn't a guarantee of a cure. Tim",

I must have missed something. Why in the world are they testing for Free PSA when u do not have a prostate? In any event, CONGRATS. Great number. Good Luck, MM MM - I have no idea why they are testing Free PSA (Which includes PSA) rather than just PSA alone. I inquired and the nurse said that this test would tell if the result is undetectable or not. However, I think I am paying for an extra test which isn't useful. I will inquire with my doctor at my 3-month followup at which time I take another Free PSA test. Tim",

      "Content": "I am 2-1/2 months post surgery and still have fairly bad incontinence. I have noticed an improvement since the first month when I was really, really bad but still have squirting everytime I get up and also sometimes walk. For the first two months post surgery, I needed a diaper but now at 2-1/2 months post surgery I found out that I am able to get through the day with one belted shield. I am also experiencing wetting the bed at night at 2-1/2 months post surgery. Not sure why that is a problem but hoping that goes away in time. So for some reason, I am being slow to recover my continence. I have tried every manner of thing to control my incontinence. I tried a penile clamp but found it to be too uncomfortable so don't use it that often except for very short periods. I've tried an external condom catheter with a long tubing and leg bag but found the adhesive used by the condom to be too unfomfortable too so I stopped using it. Then one of the fellas on here told me about the AlphaDry Condom Catheter by Urodry and I have found it to be an amazing product. It does have some minor problems like mild leaking and some irritation at times but it is by far the best of all of the products I used. It's expensive but I have found it to be reusable for a month or more. I used to use it everyday for work but now I only use it at night due to my bedwetting. For work, I now use a belted shield and so far, I have only needed one a day. Hope all of this info helps. Good luck in returning to continence faster than I am. Tim",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by MichiganMan16 Tim: Rest easy. It is a great result. Please remember that they are measuring this in trillionthssss of grams. Don't overthink it. I must have missed something. Why in the world are they testing for Free PSA when u do not have a prostate? In any event, CONGRATS. Great number. Good Luck, MM MM - I have no idea why they are testing Free PSA (Which includes PSA) rather than just PSA alone. I inquired and the nurse said that this test would tell if the result is undetectable or not. However, I think I am paying for an extra test which isn't useful. I will inquire with my doctor at my 3-month followup at which time I take another Free PSA test. Tim",

      "Sample": "Originally Posted by Duck2 Met with Dr Kaouk at Cleveland Clinic for preop today. Palpation suggest no prostate adhesions and he will be performing a single incision RALP Monday outpatient....I believe it is recommended to have a liquid diet following surgery but I am curious why this is, and how soon (days?) generally until I could have solid food ? 3. Am curious how long your hospital stay was and if there were any complications in your case ? I was told by a nurse 2-3 days but most everywhere I read seems to indicate only overnight....I wanted that cancerous thing out of my body permanently! While I could have had the surgery closer to home, my urologist recommended either Johns Hopkins or Cleveland Clinic....Perhaps the doctor will eventually suggest radiation too after getting the final pathology report after surgery but hopefully not. I would feel better just to have the whole prostate removed....While I could have had the surgery closer to home, my urologist recommended either Johns Hopkins or Cleveland Clinic. I'm located about equidistant from both, and elected to go to Cleveland....That's why I personally opted for surgery. Perhaps the doctor will eventually suggest radiation too after getting the final pathology report after surgery but hopefully not....I was able to get a copy of the surgeon's notes and he stated \"Given the patient's age, PSA value, volume of disease, and Gleason Score, curative therapy was recommended. Patient has elected to proceed with LEFT nerve sparing robotic-assisted laproscopic prostatectomy/BPLND)\"....",
