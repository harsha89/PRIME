      "Content": "After reading the post on the alarming increase of PC in men and the report regarding women getting genital cancers from using talcum powder, it has me more then a little intrigued and somewhat worried. I tried searching to see if there were any reports or studies on the possibility of men having prostate cancer from using talcum powder. Haven't found anything substantial yet. But just started looking. I know this is a stretch but wanted to put out some feelers as to whether there might be a common thread with other PC patients. My husband has used talcum powder since I have known him. He is a motorcycle rider and has been riding since he was a young kid (some of you may remember \"monkey butt\"). He used the powder whenever he rode motorcycle. He was also a truck driver his whole life in hot, sweaty Nevada. He used talcum powder then too. He has had hemorrhoid surgery several times and used the powder to help relieve the discomfort. He uses it pretty much daily. Sorry for the graphic description but wanted to make a solid point. Any input is sure welcome. Thanks, Gail and Cliff P.S. On another subject: Still having problems with voiding normally. Had his second out of six injections of the Verapamil to try to shrink down scar tissue in the urethra. We know they use it for treatment of Peyronie's disease. That is not his case. This is a trial run for him to avoid having to have surgery to remove the scar tissue. Has anyone out there had success or otherwise with using Verapamil for urethral scar tissue?",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by Michael F Hi Gail! I believe the \"suspected\" Talc/CA issue has not been associated with urologic cancers. It appears the possible association is with ovarian and endometrial cancers. This suggests a different route of exposure. For prostate cancer, it would be nearly impossible for talcum powder to enter the urethra. Even if there were some entry, it could not travel very far retrograde as it would be completely expelled upon urination. There was some published information stating that talcum powder at one time contained asbestos but that has long since been removed. Hope Cliff is getting back to normal and all is quite well! Best wishes. MF Hi Michael! It was from the advertisements about women possibly getting the cancer through their genitals. On the urethra, I wasn't thinking of that being the entry area, I thought of the fact that the DRE goes through the rectum. The prostate rests against the rectum. My husband's doctor told him after the surgery that he had to peel the prostate away from the rectum. That is was sticky. I know that this sounds kinda wacky and is a long shot. But it just made me think, why not if it is possible for women through an opening, why not men? And....the lawsuit is over Talcum powder and Ovarian Cancer. So that tells me that it's possible that the powder penetrated the ovaries????? What are your thoughts on that? Haven't read up on it enough yet. Cliff asked me to say that he hasn't used it daily for many years but he has used it often in the last 15 years or so.",

      "Content": "After reading the post on the alarming increase of PC in men and the report regarding women getting genital cancers from using talcum powder, it has me more then a little intrigued and somewhat worried. I tried searching to see if there were any reports or studies on the possibility of men having prostate cancer from using talcum powder. Haven't found anything substantial yet. But just started looking. I know this is a stretch but wanted to put out some feelers as to whether there might be a common thread with other PC patients. My husband has used talcum powder since I have known him. He is a motorcycle rider and has been riding since he was a young kid (some of you may remember \"monkey butt\"). He used the powder whenever he rode motorcycle. He was also a truck driver his whole life in hot, sweaty Nevada. He used talcum powder then too. He has had hemorrhoid surgery several times and used the powder to help relieve the discomfort. He uses it pretty much daily. Sorry for the graphic description but wanted to make a solid point. Any input is sure welcome. Thanks, Gail and Cliff P.S. On another subject: Still having problems with voiding normally. Had his second out of six injections of the Verapamil to try to shrink down scar tissue in the urethra. We know they use it for treatment of Peyronie's disease. That is not his case. This is a trial run for him to avoid having to have surgery to remove the scar tissue. Has anyone out there had success or otherwise with using Verapamil for urethral scar tissue?",

      "Content": "After 6 weekly injections into the urethra and bladder neck scar tissue, we are disappointed that so far it hasn't been successful for us. We aren't done it may just take some more time. Others have had great success with it. Not sure when we start again. Cliff has issues with always feeling like he has to go during the night and then he tries to force it out but not much luck with that. I think sometimes that there just isn't anything in there and might be a little psychological. Then daylight comes around and after a couple cups of coffee etc. things seem to start working again. So we wait that out. 2nd issue: As you can see on the signature, His PSA came back elevated to 1.07. The doctor did not like that and said Cliff should go back on the Lupron and that it looked like the cancer was coming back. He did say will see what the next PSA brings. Cliff asked him how long on the Lupron and the doc said indefinitely! Well that didn't go over to well considering he swore he wasn't going to have anymore HT. So at that appt. I asked the doc if it was possible that maybe the fact that he had a UTI going on from the Verapamil procedure if that could have stirred if up and he said no. So we left very disappointed and down in the dumps to have to wait for the next PSA draw in a few months. We were under a lot of stress from June 3rd to September 21st waiting to get that next PSA done! 3rd issue: We had a PSA draw on the 21st (Wednesday). Had an appt with the Radiologist the next day (yesterday) for follow up. He told us the cancer was probably back and pretty much said that if it was, there probably wasn't going to be anything much that could be done because of the aggressive Gleason 9 etc. He also said let's see what the PSA says when it comes back. I ask him too. if he thought things might have gotten stirred up and he said no he didn't think so. He did write the names of some HT meds other than Lupron. But didn't think they would do him much good either! He then basically said you will die from it but I can't tell you how long it will be could be a year could be 10 years and then reminded us Michael Milken got PCa 20 years ago and is still living. Tears are flowing . Keep in mind we really like this guy! He is an atheist and he and Cliff have had some good talks about that and the Bible. Anyway.....on to the next issue. 4th issue: I (Gail) got on my computer this morning and the PSA results were back! And....low and behold....I couldn't believe my eyes! OMG! It read <0.01. I was so worried it was another mistake! Any way we called and left a message with the doc's office. He called around dinner time and was all excited and happy and kept saying this is great, awesome etc. etc. Of course Cliff had to get his two cents in and told the Doc that \"The Lord works in mysterious ways!\" He laughed and said he sure does or something like that. Cliff asked him \"Well, when do you want to see me again?\" He said 6 months go enjoy your life for awhile! 5th issue: I tried to find the posts where I was exchanging comments with one of the guys about the Labs really screwing up his PSA several months back. I can't remember who it was though. Anyway the Lab either wrote in the wrong result or sent him someone else's results.....Not good! Chuck (Highlander) maybe you remember who that was. We had a pretty good conversation going about it. Keep us in your thoughts and prayers and we will do the same! Gail and Cliff",

At first he was the radiologist that our URO surgeon sent us to for a \"second\" opinion as far as whether we chose Radiation or Surgery. The RAD/ONO had spoken with our surgeon of course and at the time he recommended IGRT with HT. Don't know if he changed mind. We are trying to reach him today to get in to discuss it with him again.

Anyone's thoughts on this decision? Anyone taken that same route? Any suggestions would be appreciated. I did try to message a few. But no responses yet so went this route. I was actually kind of upset when Cliff started talking about not taking the HT. I understand his feelings about it. He thinks he still would have some quality and quanity of life if he doesn't take the HT. Thanks to any who respond, it's appreciated. Gail and Cliff",

Anyone's thoughts on this decision? Anyone taken that same route? Any suggestions would be appreciated. I did try to message a few. But no responses yet so went this route. I was actually kind of upset when Cliff started talking about not taking the HT. I understand his feelings about it. He thinks he still would have some quality and quanity of life if he doesn't take the HT. Thanks to any who respond, it's appreciated. Gail and Cliff",

At first he was the radiologist that our URO surgeon sent us to for a \"second\" opinion as far as whether we chose Radiation or Surgery. The RAD/ONO had spoken with our surgeon of course and at the time he recommended IGRT with HT. Don't know if he changed mind. We are trying to reach him today to get in to discuss it with him again.

Doc is worried the cancer is back but will wait for another PSA in a couple of months. If its up he recommends that Cliff starts back on HT or Castration. He has had a lot of bone pain in his knee and lower right leg and both feet. The doc is scheduling another bone scan. Cliff doesn't want the HT and was wondering if anyone would also have thoughts on the castration option. Just really would like anyone's thoughts and suggestions. Thanks, Gail and Cliff",

      "Content": "Ha! Ok, I'll just talk to myself for awhile. Venting is good for all of us! . I filled out a survey last night from another Cancer Forum I used to look at. Wondering if others received one in their email too? The reason I am bringing it up was it sort of lead me to think that possibly someone in the medical community is not entirely happy with the way the doctors and medical fields are handling patient care. Along with many questions one comment from the survey was something like.....\"Please, don't hold back on your answers!\" We too have gotten a lot of \"oh, that's normal,\" or \"we don't really know.\" \"Everyone is different.\" We personally, (Cliff and Gail) feel the frustration of having to guess and root out what every single side effect and symptom means. There's \"no call if you have any issues\" unless you are willing to wait for an answer for two weeks or they just don't return your call at all and you have to recall them. Prepare yourself to be very pro-active because they have a protocol \"they\" follow.....\"computer apps\" now days. We complained months ago about the pain in my husbands legs and feet and back. They had no answers and no suggestions. No one said, \"if you start having pains in your bones, it might be a sign the cancer has come back.\" What????\"Last week we brought it up again, \"no comment from them\". So we brought it up again before the appt. ended. The doctor said \"hold on\", left the room and came back and said we haven't done a bone scan in 14 months so we will schedule another bone scan. They we're able to schedule the bone scan for this coming Tuesday. That was quick! Has anyone here had their PSA go from \"you're in remission\" for 7 months and then \"your PSA is up, it's possible it might go back down, but it probably means the cancer is back and you will have to go back on HT or we can castrate you physically, it's up to you.\"",

      "Content": "Update and we would appreciate any thoughts! Cliff met with his Urology surgeon on Friday. His PSA and Testosterone results were updated. Testosterone 219 PSA 1.07. Doc is worried the cancer is back but will wait for another PSA in a couple of months. If its up he recommends that Cliff starts back on HT or Castration. He has had a lot of bone pain in his knee and lower right leg and both feet. The doc is scheduling another bone scan. Cliff doesn't want the HT and was wondering if anyone would also have thoughts on the castration option. Just really would like anyone's thoughts and suggestions. Thanks, Gail and Cliff",

      "Content": "Ha! Ok, I'll just talk to myself for awhile. Venting is good for all of us! . I filled out a survey last night from another Cancer Forum I used to look at. Wondering if others received one in their email too? The reason I am bringing it up was it sort of lead me to think that possibly someone in the medical community is not entirely happy with the way the doctors and medical fields are handling patient care. Along with many questions one comment from the survey was something like.....\"Please, don't hold back on your answers!\" We too have gotten a lot of \"oh, that's normal,\" or \"we don't really know.\" \"Everyone is different.\" We personally, (Cliff and Gail) feel the frustration of having to guess and root out what every single side effect and symptom means. There's \"no call if you have any issues\" unless you are willing to wait for an answer for two weeks or they just don't return your call at all and you have to recall them. Prepare yourself to be very pro-active because they have a protocol \"they\" follow.....\"computer apps\" now days. We complained months ago about the pain in my husbands legs and feet and back. They had no answers and no suggestions. No one said, \"if you start having pains in your bones, it might be a sign the cancer has come back.\" What????\"Last week we brought it up again, \"no comment from them\". So we brought it up again before the appt. ended. The doctor said \"hold on\", left the room and came back and said we haven't done a bone scan in 14 months so we will schedule another bone scan. They we're able to schedule the bone scan for this coming Tuesday. That was quick! Has anyone here had their PSA go from \"you're in remission\" for 7 months and then \"your PSA is up, it's possible it might go back down, but it probably means the cancer is back and you will have to go back on HT or we can castrate you physically, it's up to you.\"",

      "Content": "Ha! Ok, I'll just talk to myself for awhile. Venting is good for all of us! . I filled out a survey last night from another Cancer Forum I used to look at. Wondering if others received one in their email too? The reason I am bringing it up was it sort of lead me to think that possibly someone in the medical community is not entirely happy with the way the doctors and medical fields are handling patient care. Along with many questions one comment from the survey was something like.....\"Please, don't hold back on your answers!\" We too have gotten a lot of \"oh, that's normal,\" or \"we don't really know.\" \"Everyone is different.\" We personally, (Cliff and Gail) feel the frustration of having to guess and root out what every single side effect and symptom means. There's \"no call if you have any issues\" unless you are willing to wait for an answer for two weeks or they just don't return your call at all and you have to recall them. Prepare yourself to be very pro-active because they have a protocol \"they\" follow.....\"computer apps\" now days. We complained months ago about the pain in my husbands legs and feet and back. They had no answers and no suggestions. No one said, \"if you start having pains in your bones, it might be a sign the cancer has come back.\" What????\"Last week we brought it up again, \"no comment from them\". So we brought it up again before the appt. ended. The doctor said \"hold on\", left the room and came back and said we haven't done a bone scan in 14 months so we will schedule another bone scan. They we're able to schedule the bone scan for this coming Tuesday. That was quick! Has anyone here had their PSA go from \"you're in remission\" for 7 months and then \"your PSA is up, it's possible it might go back down, but it probably means the cancer is back and you will have to go back on HT or we can castrate you physically, it's up to you.\"",

      "Content": "Update and we would appreciate any thoughts! Cliff met with his Urology surgeon on Friday. His PSA and Testosterone results were updated. Testosterone 219 PSA 1.07. Doc is worried the cancer is back but will wait for another PSA in a couple of months. If its up he recommends that Cliff starts back on HT or Castration. He has had a lot of bone pain in his knee and lower right leg and both feet. The doc is scheduling another bone scan. Cliff doesn't want the HT and was wondering if anyone would also have thoughts on the castration option. Just really would like anyone's thoughts and suggestions. Thanks, Gail and Cliff",

      "Content": "For Cliff the side effects got stronger as the Testosterone slowly was depleted the longer he was on the Lupron the more side effects he felt. He has been on Gabapentin/Neurontin for several years for nerve pain from shoulder surgeries. He swears that it all but cured him of the Hot flashes. My brother who is in a wheel chair was the one that alerted us to his doctors prescribing it for him for hot flashes and nerve pain. We were told that this drug was originally developed to help people with shingles for the pain from their nerve endings. We aren't saying it would work for everyone but like I said he swears by it. We see his surgeon again tomorrow for another shot of Lupron and consultation.",

      "Content": "Cliff was fitted yesterday, 8-27-15 for his saddle for the image guided Calypso GPS Radiation Therapy Plan. We will have a practice run on September 3rd and then begin the treatments about a week later on 8-8-15. He will have 40 treatments, hopefully finishing up on about the 3rd of November. He has also decided to take another 3 month shot of Lupron, on the 3rd of September. When he finishes with that injection he will have a total of 7 months. He fully intends to take another look at whether he will continue with the Lupron or take a break from the HT and possibly take it again after a break. It is a very hard decision for him. Can't believe we started this journey over a year ago (actually 17 months) and are just now finally getting to the RT. Not our choice, it just took a long time to get this put together because of a lot of confusion and follow up stuff and may I say.....Not on our part! It is hard to figure out how we got from \"You have a very aggressive type of Prostate Cancer\" to well over a year later getting started on RT. Enough said!",

He did take a couple of pain pills beforehand and they numbed the area but he said he felt no pain and just a little pressure. Because he has no prostate anymore, they were implanted in the prostate bed. He will be fitted for a \"saddle\" on August 27th. Possible start date 1 week from then. 7-8 weeks of 5 days a week treatments. More details later.. Gail and Cliff PS....Had a PSA and Testosterone Lab done Monday. No results yet.
