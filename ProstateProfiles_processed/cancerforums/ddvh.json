      "Content": "Hello all, I'm glad to find this forum. My father(Age 59), has recently been diagnosed with PC on 2/25, we are still trying to soak it all in. His health over the years was normal, but his PSA was always high, below I listed it out by date since 2006. The Dr. gave him a score of 4+3=7, Grade 3 after his prostate biopsy. From MRI and bone Scan, doesn't seem to have spread in the bone or chest. However the Dr. suggested CT, got that and noticed something unusual on/in the skull. The Dr. recommends skull biopsy and will notify us further on how to proceed. Initially, Dr. gave 3 options, surgery, outside radiation or seed radiation, any suggestions? (Sorry, I don't know all the terminology yet) How likely is it that PC can spread to the skull? If so, what treatment would it be? He has an appt. tomorrow with the radiation doctor/center to discuss options, but I think it will be really basic due to the uncertainty of the skull spread. Does anyone suggest getting a second opinion? If so, any recommendations in the ATL area?
