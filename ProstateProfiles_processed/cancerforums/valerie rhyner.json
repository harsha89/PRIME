      "Content": "Hello, My husband recently had Robotic surgery and his pathology report came back with Negative margins, Gleason 3+4,pT2c. He also had 2 of 9 removed lymph nodes that were cancerous. Largest node was 1mm. Before the surgery his PSA was 5.9. I was wondering if anyone on here had a similar result. It seems strange to me that He would have lymph node metastasis when everything else was clear and the tumor was confined with negative margins. We were told to wait 3 months and get another PSA and decide on treatment based on that. I was wondering if anyone was advised differently in a similar situation. It seems a long time to wait when cancer could be moving through your lymph system. We want to get another opinion but what kind of doctor should we go to? Has anyone had radiation for lymph nodes mets? Just don't really know what to do at this point. Thanks for any input you have.
