      "Content": "Hi, I'm new to this forum. I'm 56 and was diagnosed with prostate cancer 2 wks ago. My PSA was 8.07 and my Gleason score was 4+3=7. My urologist normally would recommend to have it removed, but due to my weight, he recommended radiation treatments instead. He said he would not be able to do the surgery and if that is the way I wanted to go, then would need to seek advise from a more specialized doctor in the Kansas City area. No matter what, this would be a high risk surgery with the common side effects. My concern is that if I do not have it removed now, that it would come back down the road because of my family history and my age. I'm meeting with a doctor at KU Cancer Center for a second opinion next month regarding the surgery. If I do not find someone locally to do the surgery, I am scheduled for radiation in 2 months if I decide to go that route. My main question is there anyone out there that is extremely overweight and has had the surgery done successfully? Thank you in advance for the help, I'm extremely concerned about making the wrong decision.",
