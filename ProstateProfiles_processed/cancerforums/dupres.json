      "Content": "In Aug, 2010, I was diagnosed with PCa (PSA-29, Gleason 4+3). In Dec, 2010 I began a 6 month program of Androgen Deprivation Therapy and had IMRT beginning in Feb. 2011. Since that time, my PSA has been raising and, to me, seems high. My results are as follows (note- the 5/31/11 test was while I was still on ADT, which ended in mid June): PSA <0.1 05/31/2011 PSA 0.9 08/30/2011 PSA 1.2 11/29/2011 PSA 1.2 02/27/2012 PSA 1.4 05/22/2012 My urologist says \u0093Your PSA remains stable.\u0094 SAY WHAT?!!! I haven\u0092t been able to find out much about post radiation PSA levels, but what I have found would indicate that my case is unusual (to say the least). My PSA seems high and seems to be on an upward trend. When a PSA reaches 2.0 post radiation, it usually is taken to mean the treatment failed. I am on this forum looking for information (how common ARE my results so far), advice, opinions, references to published research, etc. Thanks.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by Otago PSA 29.1 07/14/2010---- I'm curious, what was your psa history prior to 7/14/2010 ? Was it really slow and gradual, or don't you have enough data points to know? Yes, I have considered that possibility. However, at the time of diagnosis, I was told that my cancer was a rare fast growing type. However, I would not be surprised if the slow growth hypothesis turns out to be correct. The urologist seems unphazed by my stats post radiation. I had not had a PSA test before 2010 (indeed, I had not had a physical exam since the early 90's, when PSA test were not in common usage). I only went in for a physical because I has recently retired and thought I would get some \"base line stats\" to compare against as I grew older. I had no symptoms or physical complaints. I was not quite 64 at the time of diagnosis (I am 69 now). My Gleason was 7 (4+3), DRE negative (no less than 5 doctors tried to find something that way, none succeeded- seems like they could believe a 29 could not be felt). I should add that at the time of diagnosis, I knew very little about prostate cancer. In 2010 I did a great deal of research and feel I know a good bit about it. But my research did not uncover much on cases such as mine.",

      "Content": "I am seeking pointers to research or theoretical discussions of cases such as mine. I was diagnosed in July of 2010 (PSA: 29.1), started treatment (external beam radiation plus 6 month hormone blockade) in December 2010, finished treatment in June 2011. The first PSA test after treatment (at 3 months) was 0.9. Since that time, now over 4 years, my PSA has fluctuated within the range of 1.2 to 2.1. My urologist says only that my PSA is stable and he wants to continue testing at 6 month intervals. But here\u0092s the thing. If you graph the PSA results you see that while the minimums have been consistent at 1.2, the peaks show a slight raising trend. This has me concerned. By this time, FOUR, FIVE MONTHS after treatment ended, the effects of the radiation should no longer be happening. My PSA should either be very close to zero or quite high and rising. I seem to be caught in between the two. My understanding is that my case is very rare and I can find little in the way of research of other medical science papers dealing with cases such as mine. So, can anyone point me towards some literature which might be relevant? Thanks you.

      "Content": "a couple of things: the 29.1 was NOT the first PSA test after radiation treatment; it, as well as the other two 20-somethings, were PRE-treatment. the tests though May 2011 were during the hormone blockade and, thus i believe, do not \"count\" as the nadir. neither does the 0.9 in August 2011 as the blockade continues to have a residual effect for several months (often takes a few months for the chemicals to completely clear the body and testosterone levels return to normal). this may be more my hope that anything, but my psa may not have reached a nadir as yet. indeed, i guess that is the key question. it often takes 18 to 24 months (occasionally longer) of fluctuating results before the psa drops to a nadir- but (and indicative of failure) it can also climb more or less steadily after treatment without ever actually reaching a nadir. i've read that EITHER a post treatment psa of greater than 2.0 or three consecutive rises is taken to indicate failure. i haven't had three rises in a row as yet, but i am getting close to the 2.0. that is worrisome. thanks for the good luck wishes,",
