      "Content": "Hi, first post. I am 53. Recently my urologist ordered an MRI of my prostate due to family history and rising PSA. The PSA was not particularly high, but had risen over several tests to 2.55. More recently it fell to 1.77. The MRI showed two lesions on either side of the prostate, the largest 2.8 x 0.2 x 3.2 cm. They were assigned PI-RADS scores of 4 for the smaller, 5 for the larger. The MRI detected no abnormalities outside the prostate. This past week I had an ultrasound guided biopsy, targeting the areas of concern identified by the MRI as well as the usual random samples. The results were negative for prostate cancer. I'm told this biopsy technique is state-of-the-art. It was performed by a urologic oncologist at a university medical center. Ordinarily I would be reassured. However, I cannot dismiss the PI-RADS 5, which I understand has a fairly high diagnostic accuracy in this region of the prostate (peripheral). False negative biopsies can occur, even with the best procedures. The oncologist recommends PSA monitoring followed by a re-biopsy if indicated. While this seems like a rational approach, I am disturbed by the rather large size of the lesion. I'm uncomfortable with the idea of waiting some indefinite length of time on the chance that PSA may continue to rise. I am leaning toward requesting a second biopsy as soon as would be clinically appropriate. Have any of you experienced something similar? Of course, I would love to learn that I do not have prostate cancer. But only if this is true.",
