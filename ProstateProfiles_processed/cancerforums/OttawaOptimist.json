I had been thinking that most people (including my urologist) would indicate Active Surveillance. Indeed though that Pirads-4 issue needs to be understood or reclassified. So that as well as all the other suggestions! You can be sure I am noting them and studying them closely. I agree with the comments that a Gleason 7 may have been missed. Whether the biopsy is a good enough indication is my biggest concern about AS and waiting another year for another biopsy but I would understand some of the other suggested tests now might lessen those concerns or cause me to revisit having treatments. I note the doctor's report of the actual biopsy procedure said about the MRI Pirads-4 lesion: \u201cSonographic nodule corresponding to MRI target lesion: No. Therefore the area of concern on MRI was targeted with multiple extra samples.\u201d She did note the bottles containing targeted biopsies and one was labeled as #9 (right apex).

      "Content": "I am new to the forum and recently replied to a post on another thread by mapleleaf. I have been diagnosed with Gleason 6 prostate cancer. I have gathered pros and cons on treatments / no treatment, a lot of which were distilled from this forum and would be interested in thoughts on the results of my biopsy and tests before indicating where my mind is at. Please see my signature below. I am meeting with my urologist in a week and a half to go over the biopsy results. Up till this year my health has been uneventful. I am retired, a life-long non-smoker, exercise regularly, eat properly and am slim. I have a lot of relatives, most of whom live into their late 80's to mid-90's. I am counting on doing the same! My Dad died at almost 93 and had Alzheimers. I am told he also had prostate cancer but he did not die of that. No other family prostate cancer that I know of. Thank you for your thoughts!",
