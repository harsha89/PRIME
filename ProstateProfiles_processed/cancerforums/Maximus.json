      "Content": "Originally Posted by Another Unless you have other issues it will improve quickly. I remember looking down as it just ran out. Within a few days I was good with the big pads and one or two nights with diapers and a sit pad in bed. Only ended up using a few diapers. Did you do kegels in preparation? Start them now. It will take a few days for the numbness to clear up and catheter use itself leaves some incontinence because everything stops being used. I don't see a signature so have no info on your age. Typically, the older you are the longer it takes. Surgeon should be able to tell you if he had to take a lot and will have a good idea on how quickly it will come back. 3 months is good. 6 months is average. Getting to a point where pads work happens quickly. I was back to work with the catheter. I have an office job. Thanks, Another. I am 50 years old and have a job where I am mostly standing. My doctor instructed me to wait 6 weeks before beginning kegels (I will begin physical therapy at that time). One other thing - I do not feel the urge to urinate. Did you experience this? Am I still supposed to try and pee, or just let it all leak in the pad until the urge returns?",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by Another Unless you have other issues it will improve quickly. I remember looking down as it just ran out. Within a few days I was good with the big pads and one or two nights with diapers and a sit pad in bed. Only ended up using a few diapers. Did you do kegels in preparation? Start them now. It will take a few days for the numbness to clear up and catheter use itself leaves some incontinence because everything stops being used. I don't see a signature so have no info on your age. Typically, the older you are the longer it takes. Surgeon should be able to tell you if he had to take a lot and will have a good idea on how quickly it will come back. 3 months is good. 6 months is average. Getting to a point where pads work happens quickly. I was back to work with the catheter. I have an office job. Thanks, Another. I am 50 years old and have a job where I am mostly standing. My doctor instructed me to wait 6 weeks before beginning kegels (I will begin physical therapy at that time). One other thing - I do not feel the urge to urinate. Did you experience this? Am I still supposed to try and pee, or just let it all leak in the pad until the urge returns?",

If you have a look at Topic (I) Surgery, #19, #25, #35 and #36 in the Subforum (near the top of the main Forum page), you can read studies on RP timing.

Djin Hi DjinTonic - Yes, I have had a bone scan and CT, and thankfully both were negative. My surgeon does want me to still have an MRI prior to surgergy, and that has been scheduled for 4 weeks from now.
