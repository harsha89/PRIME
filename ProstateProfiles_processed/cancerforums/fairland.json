I asked My Doctor's assistant and she said 3T MP-MRI is not very useful as I already had the Biopsy. I will ask my doctor when I talk with him. My Doctor has sent my sample to test for Prolaris Score. It is supposed to provide information about the aggressiveness of my prostate cancer. Have you or anyone done this test? How useful it is?

Can someone give me some help? Anyone who have similar situation? Here is my test results: A) Needle core biopsy of the right base of the prostate gland: - Prostatic parenchyma with infiltrating moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma of the prostate gland, Gleason's combined histologic grade 6 (3+3). Adenocarcinoma, acinar type. Gleason score: 6 (3 + 3) Number of cores involved: 2 of 2 Percentage of tumor: 70% of specimen involved by tumor Total length of tumor: 20 mm of tumor >50% tumor in any core: Yes Periprostatic fat invasion: No Seminal vesicle invasion: No Perineural/lymphatic invasion: No B) Needle core biopsy of the right mid lobe of the prostate gland: - Prostatic parenchyma with infiltrating moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma of the prostate gland, Gleason's combined histologic grade 7 (3+4). Adenocarcinoma, acinar type. Gleason score: 7 (3 + 4) Number of cores involved: 3 of 3 Percentage of tumor: 70% of specimen involved by tumor Tot al length of tumor: 20 mm of tumor >50% tumor in any core: Yes Periprostatic fat invasion: No Seminal vesicle invasion: No Perineural/lymphatic invasion: No C) Needle core biopsy of the right apex of the prostate gland: - Prostatic parenchyma with benign glandular hyperplasia and with focal high grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia (PIN). D) Needle core biopsy of the left base of the prostate gland: - Prostatic parenchyma with benign glandular hyperplasia, no evidence of malignancy. E) Needle core biopsy of the left mid lobe of the prostate gland: - Prostatic parenchyma with benign glandular hyperplasia, no evidence of malignancy. F) Needle core biopsy of the left apex of the prostate gland: - Prostatic parenchyma with benign glandular hyperplasia, no evidence of malignancy.

      "Content": "Chuck: Thank you for your advice and encouragement. I am getting the Book you recommended by Dr. Pat Walsh. With only a few days of exposure to prostate cancer, I kind of feel that the best thing about my cancer is that all the samples show negative on invasion: Periprostatic fat invasion: No Seminal vesicle invasion: No Perineural/lymphatic invasion: No Combined with the fact that I have a PSA of 2.9 and all the 5 samples showed cancer are all from the right side, I feel that my cancer has not spread out. Do you think that this a sound conclusion? Also, could you tell me how to put all my information like what you have done? Thanks, Fairland",
