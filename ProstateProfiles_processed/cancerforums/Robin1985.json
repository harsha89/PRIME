      "Content": "Hi everyone, after reading this forum for couple days, i decide to join in and ask some questions thats been haunting me for a long time. it all started from last September, when i found myself have a low grade fever every day. Its like having a flu, comes around noon and slowly fades away at night. i felt dizzy and in a nut shell - terribly. i am 29 years old male asian(chinese) and study in Germany. I started to visit doctors and even oncologists, took lots of blood tests, nothing. Not a single doctor knew what is causing this fever. i was understandably afraid, since i heard that 1/3 of FUO (fever of unknown origin) are caused by cancer. I went back to china in Feb 2014, had a PET-CT in March, hoping to find out the source of the fever. PET-CT showed that i have inflammation in tonsils and prostate. But the PET-CT doc said that its possible that i have PCa, since the radioactive intake of my prostate is very high (SUV 4.0). At that point i ve heard nothing about PCa, but the doc insisted i visit a urologist and have a PSA test. So i went, got laughed at by the urologist. To quote him, \"I have been a Urologist for 20 odd years, never heard of a 28 years old have PCa (i was 28 in March, 2014)\". I asked him if i should have a psa test. He said no. He also said PCa doesnt cause fever and PET-CT has a lot of false positives in prostate problems. But he did asked his resident to perform a DRE, young resident said he felt nothing. I tell myself, maybe i was overreacting, the fever probably has nothing to do with prostate. Then i came back to Germany in April. Fever still comes and goes every day. I consider myself kind of a worrier, so i went to see my GP in Germany and asked for a PSA. Got it and the result was more worrying. PSA 2.87 (fPSA/PSA 16.7%). According to the lab PSA should <1.5 for people younger than 50. Not to mention the fPSA/PSA quotient should be higher than 18%. I went to a Urologist. He didnt seem as worried and ordered a sperm test to see if there is any bacteria in my sperm, turned out there was some bacteria called Enterococcus faecalis (common in intestine) in my sperm. He said its a common bacteria and gave me some antibiotics - Doxycycline for 20 days. A month later we had another PSA, this time it was 2.68 and the fPSA/PSA quotient went up to 26%. In the meantime i had done some research on the Internet and thought 2.68 is still a very high number for my age. I went to another Urologist. He too thought my situation is nothing and done another sperm test which found the same bacteria, only resistant this time to the antibiotics i took. He thus prescribed Levofloxacin 20 days. After a month i had another PSA test and this time its 3.2. He said fPSA/PSA quotient isnt meaningful if PSA<4. Seeing my PSA going up even after treatment, i went to panic mode. I went to yet another Urologist in a bigger clinic. The third Urologist, however was worried. He said he never saw a 28 years old with such high PSA and PSA dont go down after a long time of antibiotics is certainly an alarm signal, albeit a 28 years old, not to mention being asian, has a very very very low risk of PCa, which literally is almost non-existent. He then ordered another sperm test and find again the same bacteria but very little of them, Uro said its a clinically insignificant amount, only this time it \"evolves\" further, resistant to both Levofloxacin and Doxycycline. He then gave me Nitrofurantoin for 20 days, which should work according to the bacteria test. A month later another PSA, this time it rose to 3.92. (I must say that i was ignorant and doesnt know that i should avoid ejaculation before PSA test. I had sex the night before PSA) This time the Urologist is really on alert. He said he cannot explain my situation, (I did mention that I had sex before the last PSA test, he said the effect is minimal) and ordered the biopsy. He meant that only biopsy can tell us whats happening in my prostate. I took the biopsy yesterday and read more stuff about PCa yesterday. When I found out that people actually CAN have PCa under 30.(in fact i saw a member was 27 at Dx) And some gene is responsible for prostate cancer and breast cancer, which my mom had and died of 20 years ago. I also found that i sometimes have a tingling in my right lower leg, which started two weeks ago. its said that spinal cord compression, which is caused by bone mets, can have this kind of effect. After reading this im literally SHOCKED. Cant eat, cant sleep. Doc says i would get my biopsy result next Wednesday. God its gonna be a long week for me. I would really want to hear some of your opinions. Am i overreacting? I should mention that I found myself urinate a bit more frequent than my wife and other people, esp. in nights, when i lie in bed i always want to pee, but if i am asleep then i dont wake up and pee. Also, every Urologist i visited had performed a DRE and they are all negative. I also had a MRI which show my prostate is small and no lesion. Plus i dont have blood relatives who had PCa. However My PSA went from 2.68 in April to 3.2 in July and to 3.92 in October(may have been affected by sex before PSA) after 3 long antibiotic treatments. Therefor i have some questions: - how much can ejaculation affect PSA, can it elevate your psa from 3.2 to 3.9, or even more? - is being 29 and having a PSA of 3.2 already a BIG alarm signal for me? - I had PET/CT in March and MRI in June, both showed no sign of mets to seminal vesicles and bone. Is it possible that PCa can spread to spines in just a few months? if yes, how much of a possibility we are talking about? - If the biopsy comes back positive, i am definitely gonna push for a bone scan, but if the biopsy comes back negative and my PSA is still high, what should i do then? Should i push for a bone scan anyway? - If i have PCa, can it cause fever and even as early as from last september? would really appreciate you guys give some info and guidance. Robin",

      "Content": "Thank you, Allen and Jim, for your kind replies. Allen, my Uro said we wait for the biopsy and decide what to do next. May i ask you how much radiation bone scan has, since i have already undergone PET-CT this March. Would it be too much radiation for my body? oh BTW I had ejaculation roughly 8-10 hours prior to the PSA test. When you say a slight bump, how much could it be? 50% or couple ng/ml? Jim, my PET-CT report says nothing wrong about my brain, i am under the impression that my fever may well be caused by my chronic tonsillitis since my right tonsil is always a bit bigger than the left one and it definitely has a higher SUV value than the left one. Had both tonsils biopsied, all benign. Im having them pulled out at the end of the month, could solve the fever. well, i am worried about getting cancer, since my mom was diagnosed with breast cancer when she was 28 and died of it 5 years later. I heard that cancer runs in families. So my risk of getting cancer must be elevated than others. The thing that scares the crap out of me is not just PCa, but advanced PCa - PCa that has spread to bones and other organs. I have read some statistics that says if PCa is confined to prostate that many could have a normal life span. But if the cancer has spread out of prostate that most patients die within no more than a couple of years. So I wanted to know has anyone heard of advaned PCa with negative DRE in people under 30 or 35?",

Since your infection is in the groin, I think it is very likely that you have some enlarged groin lymph nodes. It is not a stretch to think that one of these is also impinging on a leg nerve that passes through the area. As to elevated PSA levels, here is a link which identifies 7 non-cancerous causes of elevated PSA: http://www.everydayhealth.com/prosta...-are-high.aspx Hi po18guy, thanks for your reply.

He too thought my situation is nothing and done another sperm test which found the same bacteria, only resistant this time to the antibiotics i took. He thus prescribed Levofloxacin 20 days. After a month i had another PSA test and this time its 3.2. He said fPSA/PSA quotient isnt meaningful if PSA<4. Seeing my PSA going up even after treatment, i went to panic mode. I went to yet another Urologist in a bigger clinic. The third Urologist, however was worried. He said he never saw a 28 years old with such high PSA and PSA dont go down after a long time of antibiotics is certainly an alarm signal, albeit a 28 years old, not to mention being asian, has a very very very low risk of PCa, which literally is almost non-existent. He then ordered another sperm test and find again the same bacteria but very little of them, Uro said its a clinically insignificant amount, only this time it \"evolves\" further, resistant to both Levofloxacin and Doxycycline. He then gave me Nitrofurantoin for 20 days, which should work according to the bacteria test. A month later another PSA, this time it rose to 3.92. (I must say that i was ignorant and doesnt know that i should avoid ejaculation before PSA test. I had sex the night before PSA) This time the Urologist is really on alert. He said he cannot explain my situation, (I did mention that I had sex before the last PSA test, he said the effect is minimal) and ordered the biopsy. He meant that only biopsy can tell us whats happening in my prostate. I took the biopsy yesterday and read more stuff about PCa yesterday. When I found out that people actually CAN have PCa under 30.(in fact i saw a member was 27 at Dx) And some gene is responsible for prostate cancer and breast cancer, which my mom had and died of 20 years ago. I also found that i sometimes have a tingling in my right lower leg, which started two weeks ago. its said that spinal cord compression, which is caused by bone mets, can have this kind of effect. After reading this im literally SHOCKED. Cant eat, cant sleep. Doc says i would get my biopsy result next Wednesday. God its gonna be a long week for me. I would really want to hear some of your opinions. Am i overreacting? I should mention that I found myself urinate a bit more frequent than my wife and other people, esp. in nights, when i lie in bed i always want to pee, but if i am asleep then i dont wake up and pee. Also, every Urologist i visited had performed a DRE and they are all negative. I also had a MRI which show my prostate is small and no lesion. Plus i dont have blood relatives who had PCa. However My PSA went from 2.68 in April to 3.2 in July and to 3.92 in October(may have been affected by sex before PSA) after 3 long antibiotic treatments. Therefor i have some questions: - how much can ejaculation affect PSA, can it elevate your psa from 3.2 to 3.9, or even more? - is being 29 and having a PSA of 3.2 already a BIG alarm signal for me? - I had PET/CT in March and MRI in June, both showed no sign of mets to seminal vesicles and bone. Is it possible that PCa can spread to spines in just a few months? if yes, how much of a possibility we are talking about? - If the biopsy comes back positive, i am definitely gonna push for a bone scan, but if the biopsy comes back negative and my PSA is still high, what should i do then? Should i push for a bone scan anyway? - If i have PCa, can it cause fever and even as early as from last september? would really appreciate you guys give some info and guidance. Robin",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by po18guy Right now, I have pain, numbness and tingling in my left arm and jaw. Heart attack? Nope. Enlarged lymph nodes impinging on nerves. Since your infection is in the groin, I think it is very likely that you have some enlarged groin lymph nodes. It is not a stretch to think that one of these is also impinging on a leg nerve that passes through the area. As to elevated PSA levels, here is a link which identifies 7 non-cancerous causes of elevated PSA: http://www.everydayhealth.com/prosta...-are-high.aspx Hi po18guy, thanks for your reply. I forgot to mention that both PET-CT and MRI showed no lymph nodes swollen in groin. i have read your signature, wish you all the best in your fight against lymphoma.",
