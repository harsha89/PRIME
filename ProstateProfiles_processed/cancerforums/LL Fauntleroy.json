      "Content": "Thanks for the replies, I was just hoping not to have the biopsy done. The local urologist graduated from Johns Hopkins, board certified, PHD and has a good rep.

After the seed implants he said he would have gone back to work the next day, except for other unrelated health issues. I was surprised at that. I think if all goes well, expect urgency to urinate, nocturnia and some burning while urinating, which gradually decreases. Also depends on many factors, your health, the staging and the experience of the RO is probably the most important. His and mine has done over 4000 seed implants, has this figured out. The other posters so far had this as \"salvage therapy\" which adds complications",

BTW, the original biopsy the prostate measured 64cc Comments appreciated as my treatment has started, Casdex/Avodart and need to choose between RO's in the next day or two.",

They are out of network, but my maximum per person for out of network is $5,000 per year. I take that to mean anything over $5,000 would be covered. If I go in network, my max out of pocket is $2,500 per person per year Does anyone have any experience with them, and if it makes sense to have treatment that far from where you live and pay the additional costs? Have to look a this as having one good shot at beating this thing. I need a break from the internet and thinking about prostate anything",

      "Content": "From my first DRE, Urologist estimated prostate size at 40 grams, second DRE one year later, same doc now says 30 grams. He specifically stated to my wife and myself,\"your prostate is small\". This concerned me due to the BPH related symptoms I had been having, which started this whole excursion, and the problems with urinary retention 1 day after the biopsy, almost prompting a trip to the ER If my prostate is not enlarged why these problems? From ultra sound guided biopsy, it measured 64.82cc From most recent pelvic MRI with contrast states \"The prostate gland is enlarged measuring 5.0cm x 4.2cm x 4.0cm indenting the base of the bladder\" Can anyone translate this info as to large this is? The rest of the report was basically\"unremarkable\" which was a huge relief, even though it's not sensitive enough to pick up smaller cancers, at least I was spared the added shock and misery of larger tumors, Is there a prostate size that would eliminate one from being a candidate from radiation? I know they will chemically shrink the gland prior to starting, but if radiation is successful, I will still have to deal with enlarged prostate issues after the treatment. With my stats, if I elect surgery that issue will be eliminated but I most likely will need radiation anyway, so I'm doubling the risk from both treatments, as Terry Herbert says, the only rules of prostate cancer is there are no rules... Any advice on these ramblings?",

Biopsy results, 8 of 12 cores positive, G6's and 7's. 5%-40% cancer involvement in various cores, both lobes, including apex and base with perineural invasion noted on my second pathology read, from Oppenheimer labs. First path report had G7 as 4+3, second from nationally known lab had them at 3+4's Currently Prostate slightly enlarged at 39cc, latest PSA 5.9, but that's after various poking and prodding. I have opted for the trifecta, or triple play, short term hormone, 2 weeks of Casodex, followed by a 6 month course of Lupron. Three months into the hormone therapy, I start a 5 week course of IMRT, or external beam radiation, followed by permanent Brachy therapy (seed implant) Any comments on what to expect, and anyone have any personal experience with radiation oncologist Dr John Steel the Tampa Bay Florida area?

      "Content": "From their website, any comments on how much of this is marketing hype? For more than 40 years the evolution of radiation delivery technologies has been based upon a single objective: maximize the dose to the tumor while minimizing the dose to surrounding normal tissue. Today the most advanced beam technology available is DART using all methods of 4D IG-IMRT and the Dattoli Cancer Center was the first facility in America to offer it to patients. More patients with prostate cancer have been treated with DART at Dattoli Cancer Center than any other center in the world by fourfold. Moreover, DCC boasts having the most sophisticated technologies to achieve DART, providing every patient with a cutting edge experience. DART may also referred to as \"Smart Beam\" technology because of its extraordinary ability to cast thousands of precisely targeted radiation \"beamlets\" or \"microbeams,\"on a 360-degree radius, not only into the prostate, plus a carefully delineated margin, but also in escalating doses directly into the tumor(-s) while de-escalating doses to the urethra. A unique treatment blueprint is mapped out in advance for each patient. With computer planning and three-dimensional imaging techniques, it is possible to more accurately deliver radiation to satisfy pre-defined dose specifications to the tumor while avoiding nearby healthy tissue. Thus, the risk of damaging the bowel, bladder, rectum and other organs is significantly reduced. At the same time, the cancer-killing dose of radiation is maximized on the designated target.",

Now that I've had time to calm down and gather info, I am going with external beam radiation, 5 weeks, 15 minutes a day, five days a week, followed by Brachy therapy, or radioactive seed implants. Makes the most sense to me with my stats. I recommend that you consult with a radiologist oncologist who specializes in PC Because of your PSA level, temporary hormone therapy may be included for a 3 prong approach. This will shrink the prostate and start working against the cancer cells right away.

      "Content": "I was recently diagnosed 11/09. Treatment needs to be tailored to each particular case. For me, a combo of low dose EBRT, followed by seeds with short term hormone is my choice. A urological oncologist I consulted recommended surgery with radiation to follow. I decided not to face the possibility of side effects from both treatment forms. With surgery, they make the decision how much to remove during the surgery, they will check for positive margins and they widen the area to be removed, if warranted, while you're sleeping, making the decision how far to go, nerve bundles, lymph nodes, and they may still leave positive margins... I researched this non-stop since listening in disbelief to my own report..take your time and do not rush into anything. For either choice you want the best most experienced practitioner you can find. For me I am at peace with my decision at The Dattoli Center in Florida. Check out their website.. The other RO I was consulting with had done over 4,000 seed implants, experience is key even if you have to travel, if financially feasible Other good site for info YANA NOW Good luck,",

With a low PSA and those numbers, the cancer may indolent and be a non factor in his eventual departure from this world, meaning he will most likely die of something else, not prostate cancer. If I had those numbers I personally would go into the active surveillance mode and not rush into anything. Educate yourself to all the options first. Any treatment has risks, some with permanent side effects that can diminish your quality of life forever. There is no rush for the case you presented. And these pro surgery stories are anecdotal anyway, there are no shortage of people who regret the decisions they've made. The treatment also depends on staging and tumor location, with a higher percentage of tumors in the apex with perineural invasion, other treatments make more sense, at least for me Good place to start, see what others chose and how they fared http://www.yananow.org/query_stories.php",

The PSA is not spot-on accurate, I believe there is a range that it can fluctuate between testing and for many reasons. What to look for is doubling time, symptoms and a suspicious DRE. Also did you have the free PSA checked? A free-PSA percentage of less than 15% is associated with a higher risk of prostate cancer. A free-PSA percentage of more than 25% is associated with a low risk of prostate cancer. Based on what you posted, you seem like a perfect AS candidate. I wish I had that report, I'd be waiting(my personal take on it only) With all the treatments, there can be significant problems.
