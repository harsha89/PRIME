      "Content": "Wow, talk about an unexpected event! Your case is very interesting to me. My brothers pathology was a G6 pre and post-surgery. He is not compliant with PSA testing and bases his behavior on what he sites as very unlikely to progress based on the science. I have included a link which actually is supportive of Active Surveillance. However the first two bullet points have significant relevance to your situation. If your pathology is accurate it would place you in an extremely uncommon position. One possibility could be that you are one of the very rare people that have biological grade progression, Gleason 3 cells giving rise to Gleason 4 or 5 progeny. As noted in the attached document this can occur overtime but is very uncommon. Did you have a second opinion on your pathology? I did not have an official second opinion (4+3-7) but it would be a consideration given the situation that you find yourself in. Good Luck, Very interesting, please keep updating http://prostatecancerinfolink.net/20...lated-factors/",

I am sure that you have well trained and caring providers but state of the art equipment is very important. Here in the States I encourage men to go to a center of excellence for radiotherapy, these locations have the most modern equipment available. But even in that environment some unpleasant side effects can develop (radiation is a powerful thing). Hopefully medication management can improve your father\u2019s condition.
