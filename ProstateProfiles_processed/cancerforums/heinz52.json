    "Content": "Hi, I went in December for cancer prevention, because i felt a big pain when i went for pee. My father had already prostate cancer . My bloodresults showed a raised PSA value. After further medical examinations, it was clear that I also have prostata cancer. I had the dial to operate the cancer, but I didn`t want an agressive chemotherapy- in any case. I informed myself about alternative therapies for cancer. On this way i found the MedicalCenter-Frankfurt. There I was informed by doctors about intagrative medicine treatment against the cancer. I`ve decide to do the prostate hyperthermia, with some powerinfussions and the photodynamic therapy. My initial value of PSA`s was on 01/20/14 at 2712.0 ng / ml. After my first treatment the PSA value was diagnosed on 3804.4 ng / ml on 2/12/14. The doctor assured me that an increase of PSA after therapy be normal due to inflammation. At least, I had 3 sessions of prostate hyperthermia. On 05/27/2014 we checked again the PSA level and I was amazed by the result showing of 109.07 ng / ml and very happy that, the treatment was so successfull. Two weeks ago (8/20/2014) i checked the PSA again and it showed that the value has fallen further to 97.5 ng / ml. I feel very good and really believe that I have choosen the right therapy for me.
