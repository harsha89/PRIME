      "Content": "Hello, I am a new member, 53 years old and was recently diagnosed with prostate cancer. Gleason 6 (3+3), PSA 4.7, Stage T1c, cancer positive on only one core of twenty. I haven't had symptoms, but have always tracked my PSA as my father was diagnosed with this disease in his forties and died within 10 years after multiple surgeries/treatment attempts. I am struggling with the pros and cons of the two procedures. I have met with both a surgeon and a radiation oncologist and they both agree either method is viable at this stage and (surprise) each favors their own method somewhat over the other. I have ruled out other potential methods for a variety of reasons. Do the potential long term effects of the seeds outweigh the definite short term and potential long term effects from surgery? I do like the idea of having the thing out of me and be able to know for sure if the cancer has come back by tracking the PSA, which can be more of a problem to evaluate with the seeds since some PSA is expected. I have read some related threads, but I thought I would ask for input on members experiences as this is tough and possibly life-changing decision.",

      "Content": "I should say also my prostate isn't very large and I have only minor associated symptoms at present. The family history is extremely strong though. Not only did my father have the disease, he had a total of 7 or 8 uncles on both sides of his family that were also diagnosed (although most were in their 60s or 70s) and several eventually succumbed to it. My wife and son (med student) are both strong proponents of the surgery option, but the ED issue is important to me. I guess there are no guarantees either way in this case. I have weighed the pros and cons a hundred times and lean towards a different option each day it seems. I have time to make this decision, but I would like to come to a conclusion soon and plan a course of action.",

Little weak and sore and I always gets chills on and off for a while after anesthesia. I had a fair amount of bleeding post-op. They had to do a small (2.5 inch) incision at the belly button to finish things up. Still have catheter for another week, but got the staples and drain line out today. I have been walking every day and feel OK all things considered. The nurse called today and read the doctors notes and relayed his comments which seem a bit contradictory. He said the tumor was contained within the prostate, but there was a small focus of cancer at the margin. She also said he would discuss options during my office visit next week.

They can pinpoint their target and avoid damage to healthy tissue much better than in the past. You owe it to yourself to at least talk to a Radiation Oncologist about Salvage Radiation..It's not the horror show it once was..They might want to put you on HT for 12 months or so along with the radiation..The combined treatment works considerably better than either one alone..For sure it's no fun but it's better than dying.. If my PSA gets above 0.1 and approaches 0.2 I will probably end up doing the radiation but I don't think I want HT. Just a personal issue, but I am sure my wife will try to convince me.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by Fairwind Radiation treatment still offers you the possibility of a cure...If you wait too long, that opportunity is lost..The LINACS used today by most hospitals are MUCH improved over the equipment they were using just 10 years ago when most of the radiation horror stories were written. They can pinpoint their target and avoid damage to healthy tissue much better than in the past. You owe it to yourself to at least talk to a Radiation Oncologist about Salvage Radiation..It's not the horror show it once was..They might want to put you on HT for 12 months or so along with the radiation..The combined treatment works considerably better than either one alone..For sure it's no fun but it's better than dying.. If my PSA gets above 0.1 and approaches 0.2 I will probably end up doing the radiation but I don't think I want HT. Just a personal issue, but I am sure my wife will try to convince me.",
