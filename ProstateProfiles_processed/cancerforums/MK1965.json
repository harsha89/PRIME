      "Content": "I am 51 y/0 incidentally diagnosed with prostate Ca after my TURP on June 1st. It was Gleason 6 found in prostate chips removed during TURP procedure. Had prostate biopsy on August 11th and prostate Ca was confirmed just with higher Gleason score 7 (4+3). I saw other are classifying this Gleason as 7b. Had consults with surgeon and RO. Both agreed on surgery as better option considering my good healt and young age. I saw quite good number of younger people in late 40's and lower 50's on this and other forums who had difficult time to recover continence and erectile function. I myself am worried now about SE and length to recover from them. I found 2 studies one done at John Hopkins and one European about patients who underwent TURP and after that radical prostatectomy for cancer. This group was compared to group without TURP and results are not impressive on TURP side. Every step of recovery was prolonged and succes rate barely at half of patients without TURP. I decided to go with surgery with urologist who diagnosed me and performed TURP on me. He is young guy who performed 300 robotic surgeries and I hope he gained some experience at least enough for not making recovery extremely hard and unsuccessful. My surgery is scheduled on November 2nd, at 7:30am. I am wondering if anyone was / is in same situation that could shed some lights on this. Surgeons always sugar coat side effects and recovery. Thanks in advance. In just a few days I will post about my experience with surgery and aftermath. God bless all, MK",

      "Content": "Highlander and all, Thank you very much for your encouragement and well wishes. Here are some details: My PSA was always low between 0.6 and 1.01. Last November 2016 was 0.7 and August 2016 before biopsy wS 0.6. My DRE was always normal since I had my first one at age of 48. Started experiencing urination problems with urge to go, increasing frequency of going at night and not being able to empty my bladder completely. Prescribed Tamsulosin 0.4 mg in July 2015, increased to 2x day at the end of November 2015 when I had PVR of 200+ ml. On my February 2016 visit to urologist my PVR went to 400+ ml. In March 2016 I had cystoscopy and Uro said that my lateral lobes are kissing each other and median lobe is obstructing my bladder neck. He said my prostate is not overly big and about 40 gr. He suggested TURP which I declined. On April 3, 2016 I run into AUR and needed to go to ER. 550 ml was evacuated from my bladder. Started IC as recommended 4x a day but I mostly did 2x day mornings and evenings. Was able to urinate between self catheterisation but not completely emptied. So called Uro and scheduled TURP which was carried on June 1st. My prostate biopsy was done on August 11 and got results on August 23. That was standard TRUS guided biopsy with 12 samples taken. 1 of 12 came back positive Gleason 7 (4+3) with 2 mm of 13 mm cancerous, location left base lateral. Uro said this is different location from one that was removed during TURP which is from transitional zone. WHO/ ISOP Grade 3. This is info I have about my diagnosis. MK",

      "Content": "Toloh, Good news on your PSA. You had your RP 2 weeks before me. Reading about your progress in regaining continence and comparing to mine, you are doing well. I am 4 weeks post catheter removal and I do not think I made much progress if at all. I am still using 2 pull ups and 4-5 high absorbency pads per day. Some nights are dry or with small leakage and others where I am completely soaked and have to change in the middle of night. Mornings are better then evenings. If I am standing or walking, I barely can keep anything in my bladder. I am tired of being wet and feel miserable. I had TURP 5 months prior to RP and this might be aggravating my incontinence. I read about many lucky men without leakage from time catheter was removed. I just have hard time to understand how it is possible for some to be dry right after catheter removal and other suffering for months and years and I can tell age is not always factor. It is extremely hard to lead active life while having urinary incontinece. I really wish I chose different treatment because SE of surgery are long lasting and very discouraging. Quality of life should be #1 factor in selecting treatment. MK",
