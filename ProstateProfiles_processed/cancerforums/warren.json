      "Content": "Hi, my name is Warren and I just turned 66. Last year 2011 I decided to have a urologist check me out....frequent nightly trips to the bathroom were of some concern. The first visit an ultrasound showed an enlarged prostrate putting extra pressure onto the bladder..... My family has no known history of PC. Of course testing wasn't even available for my deceased relatives. Who knows? Realizing the prospect of having PC is something I need to discuss with other survivors. The more information and research that I do regarding my exams and lab reports is not encouraging....take a look. Here are the hard numbers for the exams and lab results. and the winner is: 8 -2011 psa 4.2 DRE-OK ??mm (sample meds?? given for helping night urination frequency did not work) 6 -2012 psa 4.8 DRE-OK 48mm 10 -2012 psa 8.6 DRE-OK 52mm free psa 11% 10 -2012 massaged prostate and then urine sample-NEGATIVE 11-28-2012 DRE-OK TRB? BIOPSY prostrate 12 samples. (I am anxiously awaiting these biopsy reports) (3-4 days no more bllood in urire) Because of the very rapid increase of the psa as well as the enlargement of the prostrate itself, I can only HOPE this is not PC. The more research and statistics I obtain, the more discouraged I get. If I were to make a wager, I give myself a 20% chance of this being just BHP. Not Good! Doc says 30% for PC. Any wagers DaVinci? Just trying to be objective............. no fear! I may be at the train station, but do not want to get on this train. Appreciate your feedback! Thx Warren",
