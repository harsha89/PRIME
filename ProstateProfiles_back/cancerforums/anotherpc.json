      "Content": "Hello all, Unfortunately, today I've joined the club. I am from Los Angeles, 39, went to urologist because I was having a hard time to pee. PSA test was 1.0 but doctor said he felt something when doing DRE, later got bleeding when urinate on and off so doctor sent to CAT scan for kidney stone but instead saw a mass in prostate. Today I got report of Biopsy 16 cores all positive, some 5% some 50-60% with Gleason score 9. One lymph node is bigger than normal but doctor said it's strange because it's not the node that usually the cancer will first spread to. I've requested to get the biopsy report for more details of each core and to get 2nd opinion. Will have cystoscopy and bone scan this and next week, the only hope I have so far is the cancer has not spread to bone yet. Wish me luck.",
