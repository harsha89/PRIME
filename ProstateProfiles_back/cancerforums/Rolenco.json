    "Content": "Originally Posted by Alex prostate cancer Hi all, just wanted to know if anyone else suffers with back pain? I always suffer with this prior and since diagnosis (in 2011) at the moment orignal PSA 900 now 32. Had another MRI but not had results yet. The oncologist examined me last week and thinks that it is no more that Muscular. Hi Alex, Your treatment seems to have been very effective judging by your PSA results. I would have thought that there would have been a noticeable easing of your back pain if it was caused by bone metastasis. So perhaps your doctor is right, but I agree with other replies, it would be good to know. My back pain was caused by my cancer and the pain eased cosiderably as my PSA came down. Anyway I wish you all the best and hope that you get the apprpriate treatment to ease your pain. Robert",
