      "Content": "Sorry to add to this thread so many months after it was started. I had my prostate removed at the end of last Sep ( 2015). Prior to surgery, I had little to no ED issues. I was on anti-anxiety medication sporadically and this did, at times, impact the degree of my erection. Anyway, I am 8 months from surgery and I have what I consider an weak to moderate erection. The odd thing is it only achieves the moderate state as I am just nearing orgasm .. weird. What I've tried. My urologist initially placed me on 5MG daily dosage of Cialis along with a concurrent dose of Viagra. Unfortunately my insurance will only cover 3 Viagra tablets so I didn't get this prescription filled too often. In reality, I think the daily Cialis helped somewhat but the 100MG Viagra did little more. I did get a pump, but I found it to be useless .. yes it will get me hard but by the time I fumble with elastic bands etc, my erection has dwindled down to virtually nothing. I still use it occasionally to keep \"blood flowing\" but I think all it doing is inflating my penis with air. My urologist did have me see the resident \"dick\" Dr ( is what I like to call him). He suggested the \"needle\" on a few occasions but I refrained from doing so. My Cialis prescription needs to be refilled but I'm almost to the point of packing it in and feeling I've enjoyed a lifetime of good to very good sex and have to think about closing that chapter in the book but I remain conflicted about this situation",

      "Content": "PSA History ( If I can remember with any detail) Started to have routine checkups ( DRE / PSA ) around 2004 My PSA hovered around 1.2 - 2.5 over the years from 2004 - 2012 In 2013 ( if I recall correctly) it went to about 3.5. My then urologist wanted to do a free-to-total PSA. I believe that came back at around 12%. based on those numbers in 2013, he wanted to do a biopsy. I found another urologist who felt my current ( soon to be ex ) was being a tad aggressive with asking to perform a biopsy. he told me that the baseline numbers are now higher to warrant a biopsy. I saw the new guy every 6 months there after. My PSA remained around 2.8 - 3.2 .. it would fluctuate back and forth. In June 2015 during my routine checkup, DRE was normal but the PSA shot up to 4.5 in the 6 months since my last test. New Dr ordered a free-to-total as well. That came back with my PSA elevated to 5.2 with a 13% FTT-PSA. he felt very strongly for me to have a biopsy. 5 out of 16 cores were positive. he normally does 12 but he ( based on his experience) concentrated a few double samples in a particular area. The malignant cores varied from GS 6 to GS 7 ( 3+4) with one core around 70%. I had a followup CAT scan which didn't indicate any \"spread\", if that is an accurate description. I was told that active surveillance really wasn't the best option for me and didn't question it. I was numb and scared. I made three appointments - one with Winthrop University Hospital ( Cyberknife) and two with surgeons. I opted for surgery with Dr Tewari who is affiliated with Mt Sinai Hospital in NYC. He had me do an MRI which\"appeared\" to indicate that the cancer was contained but getting close to the edge on the left side. he performed robotic (DaVinci) surgery on me using the best nerve sparing technique that he developed. My post pathology indicated that my overall cancer GS was 6 ( not sure how he came to that conclusion ) and all my margins were clear. Three postoperative PSAs were <0.02 0.00 and <0.02. I was told that <.0.02 was negligible and should be considered as no indication of any cancer. Minor incontinence lasted for a few days if that and now the ED issue is what I am dealing with as described above. As I said, I have been taking 5 MG of Cialis daily probably about 15 days after surgery. I had taken a total of 6 100 MG Viagra on those occasions when I wanted to engage in sex and the Viagra pretty much did nothing. I have to mention that I do take a very small dosage of Ativan for minor anxiety and I know that Ativan can often impact one's erection but I had been taking that drug prior to surgery and it really didn't have any significant impact on me. Everything else I think I covered, as it relates to my ED in my original post. I'm sitting here looking at an empty bottle of Cialis that has 4 months left on it and I'm wondering considering where I've progressed to .. which isn't a great deal, if I should bother getting the remaining 4 prescriptions filled. I don't know / think the \"shot\" at this point will do much better or so that's my perception",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by Jebstart Thanks for your comment. Sounds like the Trimix Gel should be very popular. This deal seems to be all about the dosage. My injection really hurt a lot in its last 2 hours. I don't know if it was the alprostidil or just the priapism thing. Viagra definitely makes a difference for me but just not enough to play in the major leagues. Jebstart This may have been covered somewhere else in this forum but has anyone been covered for trimix gel with insurance .. partially of course",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by SeaCock LOL...sorry to laugh...but what we will do to our self to get back into action! I'm one year and couple days post-op and was given the Trimix Gel. It comes a syringe too...real skinny, but I use 5 units and it's like being a teenager again! It's starting to last a little too long so I really need to scale back the dosage. Viagra does work now...last weekend used 50mg and did very well...even good response the next morning. Not quite usable, but very close... Congrats on being able to get back in the saddle again! I posted this somewhere else on the site, but it appears that it may have been more appropriate here since SeaCock has had personal experience ... here it goes I know there is another thread here about Trimix Gel but I was unable to find it so I hope there's no issue with posting a question here. I will be visiting my urologist ( surgeon) in a few weeks. After reading some positive comments about Trimix gel here and a few other places, I am going to give it a try. the daily 5mg of Cialis are definitely helping. I still have some moderate ED and I can never predict when I'm going to need to be 'ready' for lack of a better term. I went to the Trimix site and there are instructions to print out a note to the Dr along with a example prescription form for the Dr to FAX. I see in the literature that there are varying \"mixtures\" of the gel - Prostaglandin, Papaverine, Phentolamine in addition to 4 varying formulations whereby the one component ( Prostaglandin) varys from 500mcg to 2000ncg. Does anyone here know why these different formulations are offered? I guess my urologist should know, but I can also opt ( I'm assuming ) to have the prescription filled by my GP and I want to be able to have some knowledge to know his rational when he chooses a specific formulation - Thanks in advance",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by Mark H. My panic was premature. This morning I noted that it is lighter than yesterday. So in spite of my prior reading of others experiences, I have been pained by bloating and seeming (probably illusionary) strong feelings of constipation. I was feeling great by the time I was released (comparatively speaking) so I was not prepared to feel worse when I came home. Oxycodone has been my pain killer of last resort and it has surprised me that I have needed it several times to deal with the belly and constipated discomfort. This morning I feel much better but I have not had a bowel movement in nearly two days (other than tiny releases of gas). I am wondering if a suppository laxative would be safe? I left teh hospital with a myriad of prescriptions to be filled when arriving home. One was prescription strength Docusate. I can't speak for other surgeons in terms of post-surgical prescribed medications but this definitely helped me",
