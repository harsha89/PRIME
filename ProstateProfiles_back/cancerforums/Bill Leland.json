    "Content": "2001 I had PSA over 50 & gleason over 10, Lupron shots and 42 weeks of radiation got me to now. I'm 73 now Dr. calls this AM and tells me my PSA test from last week came in over 300 & he has issued a referral to a urologist . oh good. I watch my Step dad go through this in late 80's the cancer metastased into his bones he was in some serious pain and ended up checking out. I did some research on GOOGLE and see well it may be an infection causing psa elevation test. except the pain in my ribs has been quite trouble some middle of back both sides I had Xrays done don't know if they actually reveal cancer or not. I have no health insurance being a victim of the Obama economic recovery. I was unable to afford the ACA quote of over $700 per month for just me. thoughts? Stick up a bank & get tossed in jail where medical care is free? OR.......? thx, Bill",
