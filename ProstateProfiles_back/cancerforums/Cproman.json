      "Content": "I recently had a robotic radical prostatectomy. Gleason was 4+3, stage T3a, a single positive margin, extracapsular extension, lymph node negative, there was perineurial invasion and seminal vehicle negative. I was told I will likely need radiation therapy to have a chance at survival as opposed to waiting for salvage therapy. I sought an opinion at a major institution and they recommended either IMRT or proton beam. They told me I might have a good outcome if I go this route. I am 1 month out from surgery. The whole process has been full of anxiety for me wondering if I will beat this. Anyway, I have been looking at proton beam therapy but cannot find anything on it in regard to adjuvant RT. Does anyone have any thoughts having been down this road? Proton beam vs IMRT? Thanks for all your help.",

      "Content": "Hi Chuck. I am 56 yrs old. Biopsy showed 1 core out of 12 was positive at 20%. At surgery I actually had 40% involvement in the left lobe and 10% on the right lobe. I did follow up at one of the institutions mentioned. Just trying to see what others have found in the process. Thanks for reaching out and answering my post",
