      "Content": "Hello Am a newbie here but maybe I can help Had 60 seeds impanted 10/11/12 and still having problems urinating especially at nite. Doc put me on Flomax and have a few side effects, none of which are good. Dont even know if its helped as I dribble at nite but have a weak stream during the day. Dont want to increase Flomax as Im on 2 drugs for high bp. Have not passed any seeds, but feel like Im sitting on a deflated tennis ball when I sit anywhere anyone else having these same symtoms? Maybe I should have had the darn thing removed instead. Hope this is helpful. Best of luck in the future!",

      "Content": "Hello ezhelp712, Had similar situation , S1, G8 (4+4) at 73 yrs young. Psa 7.x Bone and ct scans indicated it was isolated within the gland. Surgery or Brachy were the options of which docs did not recommend surgery. Went thru the tri-modal therapy. 1---casodex pill daily for 8 wks plus a 6 month Leupodine (sp?)hormone shot. After 5 wks of that the prostate really shrunk and urinating was like I was much younger! 2---28 ext.beam radiation sessions, following this, psa was 0.004. 3---permanent brachy with 60 cesium-131 seeds which was a lot easier than I expected with few after effects Now, 6 wks after the Brachy, feel fine but still having difficulty with urination especially at nite. Was on Flomax but too many bad side effects so doc put me on Mobic last week, so far, so good. Hope this helps. Very best of luck to you!",
