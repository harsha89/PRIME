    "Content": "My recent biopsy indicate early stage prostate cancer which needs treatment. I have a very good regional hospital near home, but Johns Hopkins seems like a better choice. With the renowned Patrick Walsh, MD still in charge, it would appear that I would be in good hands with any of the surgeons, provided they have done something like a minimum of 400 of the open radical prostatectomy operations. Does anyone have recommendations/comments on members of the surgical staff. The following surgeons appear to perform the open radical prostatectomy operations. Trinity Bivalacqua, Arthur Burnett, H. Ballentine Carter, Alan Partin, Christian Pavlovich, Ashley Ross and Edward Schaeffer. Once again, I assume that any one of these surgeons is probably excellent, and I should expect to hear only favorable comments. But any comments would be appreciated.",
