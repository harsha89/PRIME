      "Content": "Originally Posted by Fairwind I have never heard it claimed that the PSA test could diagnose prostate cancer..No matter how high your PSA reading, that does not automatically mean you have Prostate Cancer...All it does is it gives an indication that you are at MUCH higher risk of having prostate cancer and that further testing would be advisable if you wish to find this cancer while it is still curable..Or, just as likely, rule out the possibility you have PC... Dr. Albin states the PSA test has a 80% false positive rate, making it useless for detecting prostate cancer..But the PSA test SHOULD NEVER BE USED FOR DETECTING PROSTATE CANCER so it can't possibly have an 80% false positive rate. Only a BIOPSY can detect prostate cancer with 100% accuracy.. A PSA test is just a tool that points out a biopsy might be a good idea...In the past, men had to wait until a abnormal DRE triggered a biopsy..For many, that was too late... good point we need fastest results and PSA helps with that.",
