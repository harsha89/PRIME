      "Content": "Thank you for all the advice. I will track down that book that you guys have described. The thing is that when my dad was diagnosed they had done a blood test and a DRE exam. He doesn't know anything about his PSA levels or Gleason score. He is one to never go to the doctors, so these series of tests have been done for the first time (as far as I understand). He went for a nuclear bone scan today, and he will be going for a CT scan on Thursday. So, we are all in the dark when it comes to this. My mom and I went with him for the nuclear bone scan this morning, and we were told that we would know the results in a week's time. I'm just wondering if the biopsy would be done after the CT scan? I've been asking my dad about PSA and Gleason score, but he keeps saying that he was never told about anything like that.",

      "Content": "Hi everyone, I am a complete mess right now. I am a 25 year old female, my dad was just diagnosed with Prostate Cancer on Wednesday. I don't know who to turn to, who to talk to, or what to do right now. He's 63, he was one to never go to the doctors, but the past couple months he has been having tests. He went for blood work, something was off, they said his prostate was out of whack. He then went to see a urologist on Wednesday and they told him the news. I am terrified, and in complete shock. Are there any books/resources we could look into? Any foods that should be eaten? Should I be worrying at this stage? Is there anything I can do? I need answers. He will be going in for a bone marrow scan (I believe that what they called it) on Monday, and he still has to get a CT scan. He has always been a healthy guy. This is just so terrifying because I never thought we'd have to deal with cancer. I don't know what to do. He is very easy going and not worried, but this is my daddy. He's the best dad in the world and to know he has cancer is soul crushing. I don't know what to do.",
