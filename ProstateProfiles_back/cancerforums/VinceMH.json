(B) RIGHT PELVIC LYMPH NODES: Two lymph nodes, no tumor present (0/2). KS/gw DD: 6/30/2017 10:14 AM (A) LEFT PELVIC LODES - Consists of an aggregate of adipose tissue (5.0 x 1.5 x 0.9 cm). The specimen is sectioned to reveal two tan lymph nodes (2.0 and 2.7 cm in greatest dimension). Entirely submitted. SECTION CODE: A1-2, one possible lymph node bisected in each cassette; A3, remaining fat. ECS/kkt (B) RIGHT PELVIC LYMPH NODES - Consists of an aggregate of adipose tissue (7.0 x 2.0 x 1.1 cm). The specimen is sectioned to reveal two possible tan lymph nodes (1.4 and 1.7 cm in greatest dimension). Entirely submitted. SECTION CODE: B1-B2, one possible lymph node bisected in each cassette; B3-B6, remaining adipose tissue. ECS/kkt (C) PROSTATE AND SEMINAL VESICLES - Specimen consisting of a prostate, attached right and left seminal vesicles and attached segments of right and left vasa deferentia. The prostate gland (3.5 x 3.2 x 4.2 cm, 21.1 grams, post-fixation) has the usual shape. The soft tissue present along the posterolateral aspects of the prostate is scant and more abundant along the left side. Serial cross sections after fixation demonstrate an area consistent with tumor involving the right and left transition zone of the first three of the four cross sections of the prostate. The seminal vesicles and segments of vasa deferentia are grossly free of tumor. SECTION CODE: C1, C2, base of right seminal vesicle and right vas deferens; C3, C4, base of left seminal vesicle and left vas deferens; C5, C6, prostatic base right border; C7-C8, prostatic base right posterior border; C9-C10, prostatic base central portion; C11, prostatic base left border; C12-C13, prostatic base left posterior border; C14, apex anterior; C15, apex left; C16, apex posterior; C17, apex right; C18-C31, sections of the four cross sections of the prostate according to specimen radiograph. The anterior aspect of the prostate is inked in green, left surface in red, right surface in yellow and posterior surface in black. PT/kkt DIAGNOSIS (C) PROSTATE AND SEMINAL VESICLES: PROSTATIC ADENOCARCINOMA, GLEASON SCORE 7 (3+4) WITH TERTIARY GLEASON GRADE 5. (SEE COMMENT) TUMOR EXTENDING TO THE MARGIN OF RESECTION. No extraprostatic extension present. Right and left seminal vesicles, no tumor present. Segments of right and left vasa deferentia, no tumor present. PERINEURAL INVASION PRESENT. LYMPHOVASCULAR INVASION PRESENT. The prostate gland contains two foci of prostatic adenocarcinoma, one in the transition zone and one in the peripheral zone. The largest tumor focus although not the one of the highest histologic grade (Gleason score 7/3+4) is located in the right and left transition zone. This tumor focus measures 2.3 x 0.5 cm in the largest crosssectional dimension and it is present in the four cross sections of the prostate, extensively in the apex and focally in the base. In the apex (right, anterior and left) this tumor focus extends to the cauterized margin of resection. The added length of marginal involvement is 4.0 mm. The second tumor focus is located in the right lateral, right posterolateral, right posterior, mid posterior, left posterior and left posterolateral peripheral zone. This tumor focus (Gleason 7/3+4 with tertiary Gleason Grade 5) measures 2.4 x 0.5 cm in the largest cross-sectional dimension and it is present in the four cross sections of the prostate and extensively in the apex. This tumor focus is confined to the prostate with negative margins.

But it looks like you got a negative margin at the site of the grade 5, so it could be all out. You might need SRT. BUT THE LONGER YOU WAIT THE LESS CHANCE OF LASTING INCONTINENCE, and ED. So give yourself as much time To heal as possible. Any improvement of incontinence and erectile function, is frozen once you start radiation. For me, I'd want to see what my post op PSA is and if it's undetectable then I'd not be inclined to rush into salvage radiation. Thank you!

      "Content": "Originally Posted by DanATX I will also preface that I am not a doctor, but will chuck my thoughts into the ring. I'm currently going through a similar though/decision process that you are (or have been). As you can see from my signature, my original biopsy of 3+3 was upgraded to 4+3 with tertiary 5. In my case, the more aggressive (4 with the 5) tumor(s) were near the positive margin area. The RO said that the size and location of the margins relative to tumors meant that in my case, I should consider myself stage 3 for purposes of treatment planning. The question then became whether to move forward with adjuvant radiation in the nearer term, or hold off until BR for salvage radiation, if needed. I still don't know the \"right\" answer, but I chose adjuvant for a few reasons. First, separately, both my RO and URO recommended it based on current guidance (a link, if it works). http://www.auanet.org/guidelines/rad...uideline-2013) I found similar references in Urology journals and such, too. Secondly, a big part of the recommendation, particularly from the RO, had to do with my age. He suggested that the benefits for me were further down the road, more than ten years in all likelihood. It has to do with when/how recurrence may occur and he likened it to pushing BR down the road 10+ more years. Were I not relatively young, he'd probably recommend waiting on PSA rise/BR. I am currently struggling with the side effect part of it, though. My first PSA is next week and then things start moving more quickly or I have to call a halt. I'm basically fully continent at this point. Certainly nothing that I couldn't live with. Erectile Function still on strike, however. Can't tell if that's permanent or temporary, but I had been hoping for some improvement by now. Fixing at the current level is a little \"scary\". My docs say that if it never improves there are other things we can do to try and work that problem. Hmmm. Finally, in a mention of the ugly side of things, for me doing adjuvant this year saves me and my family somewhere between $12K and $15K of our money, under our current insurance. Who knows for future depending on where insurance goes -- it's now preexisting. Unfortunately, this is not trivial for us and does enter the decision matrix, although as a secondary concern. I mention this solely in the pursuit of full disclosure about my decision process. Either way, just a point of view supporting the adjuvant idea -- many/most of the folks here seem to prefer or lean toward BR/salvage. There is a logic to both viewpoints. So I'd recommend finding the RO you trust and will rely upon and get information related to your specific situation. Good Luck! Very good information!! I really appreciate the reply. Will read that article soon and make notes for my follow up. I just messaged MDA to schedule consult with RO at my follow up. Thanks again!",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by DanATX I will also preface that I am not a doctor, but will chuck my thoughts into the ring. I'm currently going through a similar though/decision process that you are (or have been). As you can see from my signature, my original biopsy of 3+3 was upgraded to 4+3 with tertiary 5. In my case, the more aggressive (4 with the 5) tumor(s) were near the positive margin area. The RO said that the size and location of the margins relative to tumors meant that in my case, I should consider myself stage 3 for purposes of treatment planning. The question then became whether to move forward with adjuvant radiation in the nearer term, or hold off until BR for salvage radiation, if needed. I still don't know the \"right\" answer, but I chose adjuvant for a few reasons. First, separately, both my RO and URO recommended it based on current guidance (a link, if it works). http://www.auanet.org/guidelines/rad...uideline-2013) I found similar references in Urology journals and such, too. Secondly, a big part of the recommendation, particularly from the RO, had to do with my age. He suggested that the benefits for me were further down the road, more than ten years in all likelihood. It has to do with when/how recurrence may occur and he likened it to pushing BR down the road 10+ more years. Were I not relatively young, he'd probably recommend waiting on PSA rise/BR. I am currently struggling with the side effect part of it, though. My first PSA is next week and then things start moving more quickly or I have to call a halt. I'm basically fully continent at this point. Certainly nothing that I couldn't live with. Erectile Function still on strike, however. Can't tell if that's permanent or temporary, but I had been hoping for some improvement by now. Fixing at the current level is a little \"scary\". My docs say that if it never improves there are other things we can do to try and work that problem. Hmmm. Finally, in a mention of the ugly side of things, for me doing adjuvant this year saves me and my family somewhere between $12K and $15K of our money, under our current insurance. Who knows for future depending on where insurance goes -- it's now preexisting. Unfortunately, this is not trivial for us and does enter the decision matrix, although as a secondary concern. I mention this solely in the pursuit of full disclosure about my decision process. Either way, just a point of view supporting the adjuvant idea -- many/most of the folks here seem to prefer or lean toward BR/salvage. There is a logic to both viewpoints. So I'd recommend finding the RO you trust and will rely upon and get information related to your specific situation. Good Luck! Very good information!! I really appreciate the reply. Will read that article soon and make notes for my follow up. I just messaged MDA to schedule consult with RO at my follow up. Thanks again!",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by HighlanderCFH Depending on the percentage of your \"4\" grades within your 3+4=7 Gleason score, you might have a case that behaves more like the NON-life threatening Gleason 3+3=6. That is what I was thinking, and hoping for, so we'll see what Doc says in a few weeks. Thank you! I'm not 100% sure on this, but I believe that a tertiary Gleason grade is usually meaningless. Perhaps Michael F can comment on this. Google \"Gleason 7 with tertiary Gleason Grade 5\" and you'll find a few articles and studies. Most aren't good. Here are a couple. https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18076949 http://www.medpagetoday.com/urology/prostatecancer/6855 The LVI, however, could change things a bit and you should have a good discussion about this with your surgeon and perhaps an oncologist who specializes in prostate cancer. Here is a link to an article I found on Google regarding SVI: [/COLOR]https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4857072 That article is LVI with pT3, which has EPE. Mine did not have EPE, at pT2. I don't know if that means the LVI was contained within the prostate or not. Good point to talk about with Doc. thank you!",

      "Content": "See the short story in my signature. The full report is below. The things that concern me are: 1. Gleason 7 (3+4) with tertiary Gleason Grade 5 2. Lymphovascular Invasion present 3. Positive margin on the lesser graded tumor I have not seen the Doc since surgery, so only have intel from the internet. From the reading I've done, these are bad. For #1 and 2, the likelihood of recurrence at 5 years is very high. Anyone out there with the same pathology who can share info? If the tumor with the tertiary Gleason Grade 5 was removed with negative margins, why is this a concern? Should I start radiation now or wait until PSA rises (assuming it's near zero now)? Pros/cons of radiation now or later? Any intel is appreciated. DIAGNOSIS (A) LEFT PELVIC LODES: Two lymph nodes, no tumor present (0/2). (B) RIGHT PELVIC LYMPH NODES: Two lymph nodes, no tumor present (0/2). KS/gw DD: 6/30/2017 10:14 AM (A) LEFT PELVIC LODES - Consists of an aggregate of adipose tissue (5.0 x 1.5 x 0.9 cm). The specimen is sectioned to reveal two tan lymph nodes (2.0 and 2.7 cm in greatest dimension). Entirely submitted. SECTION CODE: A1-2, one possible lymph node bisected in each cassette; A3, remaining fat. ECS/kkt (B) RIGHT PELVIC LYMPH NODES - Consists of an aggregate of adipose tissue (7.0 x 2.0 x 1.1 cm). The specimen is sectioned to reveal two possible tan lymph nodes (1.4 and 1.7 cm in greatest dimension). Entirely submitted. SECTION CODE: B1-B2, one possible lymph node bisected in each cassette; B3-B6, remaining adipose tissue. ECS/kkt (C) PROSTATE AND SEMINAL VESICLES - Specimen consisting of a prostate, attached right and left seminal vesicles and attached segments of right and left vasa deferentia. The prostate gland (3.5 x 3.2 x 4.2 cm, 21.1 grams, post-fixation) has the usual shape. The soft tissue present along the posterolateral aspects of the prostate is scant and more abundant along the left side. Serial cross sections after fixation demonstrate an area consistent with tumor involving the right and left transition zone of the first three of the four cross sections of the prostate. The seminal vesicles and segments of vasa deferentia are grossly free of tumor. SECTION CODE: C1, C2, base of right seminal vesicle and right vas deferens; C3, C4, base of left seminal vesicle and left vas deferens; C5, C6, prostatic base right border; C7-C8, prostatic base right posterior border; C9-C10, prostatic base central portion; C11, prostatic base left border; C12-C13, prostatic base left posterior border; C14, apex anterior; C15, apex left; C16, apex posterior; C17, apex right; C18-C31, sections of the four cross sections of the prostate according to specimen radiograph. The anterior aspect of the prostate is inked in green, left surface in red, right surface in yellow and posterior surface in black. PT/kkt DIAGNOSIS (C) PROSTATE AND SEMINAL VESICLES: PROSTATIC ADENOCARCINOMA, GLEASON SCORE 7 (3+4) WITH TERTIARY GLEASON GRADE 5. (SEE COMMENT) TUMOR EXTENDING TO THE MARGIN OF RESECTION. No extraprostatic extension present. Right and left seminal vesicles, no tumor present. Segments of right and left vasa deferentia, no tumor present. PERINEURAL INVASION PRESENT. LYMPHOVASCULAR INVASION PRESENT. The prostate gland contains two foci of prostatic adenocarcinoma, one in the transition zone and one in the peripheral zone. The largest tumor focus although not the one of the highest histologic grade (Gleason score 7/3+4) is located in the right and left transition zone. This tumor focus measures 2.3 x 0.5 cm in the largest crosssectional dimension and it is present in the four cross sections of the prostate, extensively in the apex and focally in the base. In the apex (right, anterior and left) this tumor focus extends to the cauterized margin of resection. The added length of marginal involvement is 4.0 mm. The second tumor focus is located in the right lateral, right posterolateral, right posterior, mid posterior, left posterior and left posterolateral peripheral zone. This tumor focus (Gleason 7/3+4 with tertiary Gleason Grade 5) measures 2.4 x 0.5 cm in the largest cross-sectional dimension and it is present in the four cross sections of the prostate and extensively in the apex. This tumor focus is confined to the prostate with negative margins. PT/mcb DD: 7/13/2017 7/13/2017 12:07 PM (C) PROSTATE AND SEMINAL VESICLES - A specimen consisting of a prostate, attached right and left seminal vesicles and attached segments of right and left vasa deferentia. The prostate gland (3.5 x 3.2 x 4.2 cm, 21.1 grams, post-fixation) has the usual shape.

For #1 and 2, the likelihood of recurrence at 5 years is very high. Anyone out there with the same pathology who can share info? If the tumor with the tertiary Gleason Grade 5 was removed with negative margins, why is this a concern? Should I start radiation now or wait until PSA rises (assuming it's near zero now)? Pros/cons of radiation now or later? Any intel is appreciated. DIAGNOSIS (A) LEFT PELVIC LODES: Two lymph nodes, no tumor present (0/2). (B) RIGHT PELVIC LYMPH NODES: Two lymph nodes, no tumor present (0/2). KS/gw DD: 6/30/2017 10:14 AM (A) LEFT PELVIC LODES - Consists of an aggregate of adipose tissue (5.0 x 1.5 x 0.9 cm). The specimen is sectioned to reveal two tan lymph nodes (2.0 and 2.7 cm in greatest dimension). Entirely submitted. SECTION CODE: A1-2, one possible lymph node bisected in each cassette; A3, remaining fat. ECS/kkt (B) RIGHT PELVIC LYMPH NODES - Consists of an aggregate of adipose tissue (7.0 x 2.0 x 1.1 cm). The specimen is sectioned to reveal two possible tan lymph nodes (1.4 and 1.7 cm in greatest dimension). Entirely submitted. SECTION CODE: B1-B2, one possible lymph node bisected in each cassette; B3-B6, remaining adipose tissue. ECS/kkt (C) PROSTATE AND SEMINAL VESICLES - Specimen consisting of a prostate, attached right and left seminal vesicles and attached segments of right and left vasa deferentia. The prostate gland (3.5 x 3.2 x 4.2 cm, 21.1 grams, post-fixation) has the usual shape. The soft tissue present along the posterolateral aspects of the prostate is scant and more abundant along the left side. Serial cross sections after fixation demonstrate an area consistent with tumor involving the right and left transition zone of the first three of the four cross sections of the prostate. The seminal vesicles and segments of vasa deferentia are grossly free of tumor. SECTION CODE: C1, C2, base of right seminal vesicle and right vas deferens; C3, C4, base of left seminal vesicle and left vas deferens; C5, C6, prostatic base right border; C7-C8, prostatic base right posterior border; C9-C10, prostatic base central portion; C11, prostatic base left border; C12-C13, prostatic base left posterior border; C14, apex anterior; C15, apex left; C16, apex posterior; C17, apex right; C18-C31, sections of the four cross sections of the prostate according to specimen radiograph. The anterior aspect of the prostate is inked in green, left surface in red, right surface in yellow and posterior surface in black. PT/kkt DIAGNOSIS (C) PROSTATE AND SEMINAL VESICLES: PROSTATIC ADENOCARCINOMA, GLEASON SCORE 7 (3+4) WITH TERTIARY GLEASON GRADE 5. (SEE COMMENT) TUMOR EXTENDING TO THE MARGIN OF RESECTION. No extraprostatic extension present. Right and left seminal vesicles, no tumor present. Segments of right and left vasa deferentia, no tumor present. PERINEURAL INVASION PRESENT. LYMPHOVASCULAR INVASION PRESENT. The prostate gland contains two foci of prostatic adenocarcinoma, one in the transition zone and one in the peripheral zone. The largest tumor focus although not the one of the highest histologic grade (Gleason score 7/3+4) is located in the right and left transition zone. This tumor focus measures 2.3 x 0.5 cm in the largest crosssectional dimension and it is present in the four cross sections of the prostate, extensively in the apex and focally in the base. In the apex (right, anterior and left) this tumor focus extends to the cauterized margin of resection. The added length of marginal involvement is 4.0 mm. The second tumor focus is located in the right lateral, right posterolateral, right posterior, mid posterior, left posterior and left posterolateral peripheral zone. This tumor focus (Gleason 7/3+4 with tertiary Gleason Grade 5) measures 2.4 x 0.5 cm in the largest cross-sectional dimension and it is present in the four cross sections of the prostate and extensively in the apex. This tumor focus is confined to the prostate with negative margins. PT/mcb DD: 7/13/2017 7/13/2017 12:07 PM (C) PROSTATE AND SEMINAL VESICLES - A specimen consisting of a prostate, attached right and left seminal vesicles and attached segments of right and left vasa deferentia. The prostate gland (3.5 x 3.2 x 4.2 cm, 21.1 grams, post-fixation) has the usual shape. The soft tissue present along the posterolateral aspects of the prostate is scant and more abundant along the left side.

      "Content": "Originally Posted by DanATX I will also preface that I am not a doctor, but will chuck my thoughts into the ring. I'm currently going through a similar though/decision process that you are (or have been). As you can see from my signature, my original biopsy of 3+3 was upgraded to 4+3 with tertiary 5. In my case, the more aggressive (4 with the 5) tumor(s) were near the positive margin area. The RO said that the size and location of the margins relative to tumors meant that in my case, I should consider myself stage 3 for purposes of treatment planning. The question then became whether to move forward with adjuvant radiation in the nearer term, or hold off until BR for salvage radiation, if needed. I still don't know the \"right\" answer, but I chose adjuvant for a few reasons. First, separately, both my RO and URO recommended it based on current guidance (a link, if it works). http://www.auanet.org/guidelines/rad...uideline-2013) I found similar references in Urology journals and such, too. Secondly, a big part of the recommendation, particularly from the RO, had to do with my age. He suggested that the benefits for me were further down the road, more than ten years in all likelihood. It has to do with when/how recurrence may occur and he likened it to pushing BR down the road 10+ more years. Were I not relatively young, he'd probably recommend waiting on PSA rise/BR. I am currently struggling with the side effect part of it, though. My first PSA is next week and then things start moving more quickly or I have to call a halt. I'm basically fully continent at this point. Certainly nothing that I couldn't live with. Erectile Function still on strike, however. Can't tell if that's permanent or temporary, but I had been hoping for some improvement by now. Fixing at the current level is a little \"scary\". My docs say that if it never improves there are other things we can do to try and work that problem. Hmmm. Finally, in a mention of the ugly side of things, for me doing adjuvant this year saves me and my family somewhere between $12K and $15K of our money, under our current insurance. Who knows for future depending on where insurance goes -- it's now preexisting. Unfortunately, this is not trivial for us and does enter the decision matrix, although as a secondary concern. I mention this solely in the pursuit of full disclosure about my decision process. Either way, just a point of view supporting the adjuvant idea -- many/most of the folks here seem to prefer or lean toward BR/salvage. There is a logic to both viewpoints. So I'd recommend finding the RO you trust and will rely upon and get information related to your specific situation. Good Luck! Very good information!! I really appreciate the reply. Will read that article soon and make notes for my follow up. I just messaged MDA to schedule consult with RO at my follow up. Thanks again!",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by HighlanderCFH Depending on the percentage of your \"4\" grades within your 3+4=7 Gleason score, you might have a case that behaves more like the NON-life threatening Gleason 3+3=6. That is what I was thinking, and hoping for, so we'll see what Doc says in a few weeks. Thank you! I'm not 100% sure on this, but I believe that a tertiary Gleason grade is usually meaningless. Perhaps Michael F can comment on this. Google \"Gleason 7 with tertiary Gleason Grade 5\" and you'll find a few articles and studies. Most aren't good. Here are a couple. https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18076949 http://www.medpagetoday.com/urology/prostatecancer/6855 The LVI, however, could change things a bit and you should have a good discussion about this with your surgeon and perhaps an oncologist who specializes in prostate cancer. Here is a link to an article I found on Google regarding SVI: [/COLOR]https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4857072 That article is LVI with pT3, which has EPE. Mine did not have EPE, at pT2. I don't know if that means the LVI was contained within the prostate or not. Good point to talk about with Doc. thank you!",

Michael F - Thank you for a very helpful reply!!! Kegels- what is too much? My kegels are; flex/hold to a 10 count, 10 repetitions, 4 sets spread over the day. I'm also walking 2.5 miles a day. Doc said nerve sparing was successful and he was pleased with the entire procedure. He didn't mention anything about bladder reposition. I'll ask at 6 week follow up. Thanks again!",

      "Content": "Hi all, I've been lurking for a few months and have gained very valuable information from everyone's conversations (thank you!). Until now haven't felt a need to post anything. I was totally fine with the diagnosis, treatment decision, surgery, post-op, and even removed my own catheter last Sunday. I was aware of possible incontinence and that it might take a while to overcome, but now that it's happening I'm FREAKING! This isn't what I expected! During the day I have some control because my bladder fills, but it seems to dribble all day. And then there are the squirts that you can feel coming but have absolutely no control to stop. At night I wake up every couple of hours to urinate and stay dryer than during the day, which is puzzling. Maybe it doesn't dribble because I'm laying down and there's less pressure on the bladder. I am a very active person; cross country cycling, hundred mile backpacking trips, fishing, and lots of water sports. Now the reality of incontinence is setting in. I can't do any of these things easily if I'm incontinent. I can't carry a case of Depends strapped to my backpack! I can't change my pad while in a boat fishing with others! The prospect of this being permanent is terrifying! OMG, I want my prostate back! I really could stand to hear some positive stories from those who started out like me and eventually got to 100% dry. I pray that you are out there. How long did it take to get dry? What did you do to improve continence? Any advice is greatly appreciated!! Thanks! Vince",

      "Content": "Just got this today from the surgeon. Definitely disappointed there is cancer at the margins. I'm not sure what to think about the decision to not treat this. My followup appointment is in four weeks. I'd like to be prepared with questions. Would appreciate any feedback or advice. Examination of the prostate showed multiple foci of prostate cancer. The cancer was contained within the capsule of the prostate. The surgical margins had involvement of the cancer to the margin in the lesser graded foci at the apex. This is a small (4mm) margin in a location without a well defined capsule. We do not treat this type of margin with adjunctive therapy. The higher grade tumor (Gleason 5 component) had negative margins. This is a significant prostate cancer that I am glad we have removed!",
