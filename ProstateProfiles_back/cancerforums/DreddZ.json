      "Content": "Hi everyone. My dad has been diagnosed with prostate cancer just yesterday. PSA=357 Gleason Score=7. He is in catheter right now and I don't know if he can urinate whe it will be removed. I'm so worried for him and i hope and pray that inspite to all of these he can recover. I have not told my dad yet as I was the only one who went to the doctor to have the biopsy read. I don't know, maybe I need somebody who can comfort and advise me on what will be my next steps. I'm so confused right now. We were advised by the euro to have a bone scan.",

      "Content": "Thank you all for your reply. Somehow it makes me feel relieved that I have people with the same situation to share to. Joe1 St. Lukes is quite far from my location. I'm in Cebu and quite frankly we don't have that much of means in terms of financial. I am the only one with work. I have a brother who is jobless. I have already told my dad regarding his situation. I don't know if I made the right move but I don't want to lie. I am trying to be strong for the family as my family seems to be depending on my for strength. I try to be but sometimes when i am not with my dad i cry. But i dont him to see that. Tomorrow we will have the bone scan. I will update here once i have the result. I appreciate all your words it uplift me somehow. Also i would like to ask. Is there a chance for my dad to be able to pee again? What did you do or what medicines did you take. I know that i will have to ask the doctor regarding this but i want to know other people's experience. Again thank you guys and God bless us all. I pray for healing to all of us both from the disease and the loveones as i know the burden and emotions are tough also.",

      "Content": "Thank you for your reply. My dad is 75 years old. We are from the Philippines. Aside from the catheter my dad looks fine. He was also recently diagnosed with TB and he is already taking medicines for it. This is also his first PSA and it was done because we admitted him because he had a hard time urinating. It was his first time admission and all the test were done during yhe time we were in the hospital. I plan of telling him tomorrow and to inform him of the bone scan the doctor requested.",
