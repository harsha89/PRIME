      "Content": "Sorry for late response: My case is a little different than most, I took casodex for 30 days before surgery. Therefore my surgical pathology report could not determine a true gleason score or PT score. Results: Prostatic Adenocarcinoma, High grade with partial hormonal ablation therapy effect. Tumor extending focal into extraprostatic tissue. Tumor invading left seminal vesicle Right seminal vesicle and segments of vas deferentia, no tumor present Perineular present Lymphovascular invasion present Partial epithelial atrophy consistent with partial hormonal ablation theraphy effect Detached fragment of adipose tissue, no tumor present Tumor invades the left seminal vesicle including intra and extraprostitac regions Margins of resection are free of tumor 24 lymph nodes removed, no cancer Radiation Oncologist recommends radiation as soon as possible, do not wait for PSA to tick up Urologist wanted to wait and see, appointment in August So sorry in delay of getting info to you, thanks for your help and advice",

      "Content": "Once all of my testing was completed I had a couple of options, radiation or surgery. First option presented was Hormone treatment and radiation sounded like a plan I was ready to get started and get treated. Next day had an appointment with urologist and he said either option should give me same results, said he was a surgeon and thought taking it out would work out real well. Two days later met with Dr John Popadopalous at MD Anderson in Houston and he agreed with surgery. Wife and I discussed and decided to get it removed, because of gleason 9, felt MD Anderson could treat cancer better IF it returned. Had surgery on 7/28/17, recovering really well. Received call from Dr. on Monday, day catheter left my body, to let me know 24 lymph nodes removed and were all cancer free. Just wanted to say thank you to everyone who has posted here, your post have helped me so much.",
