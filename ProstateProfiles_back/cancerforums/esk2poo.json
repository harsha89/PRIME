      "Content": "D, Sorry to hear of your diagnosis and for the need for a forum like this. I do not have an answer for you as I had a different cancer but I would have to say it is good that you are just heaving problems now in that area at your age. Some of us start to have issues well before that age. I am going to move your post into the prostate forum as that is where you'll get the most views and answers. My first worry would be getting rid of the cancer and dealing with any issues afterwards. Good luck, Allen",
