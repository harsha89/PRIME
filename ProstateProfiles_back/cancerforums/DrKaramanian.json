      "Content": "In the US, almost as many men die of prostate cancer as women die of breast cancer. Women have rightly demanded excellent care and have made enormous strides in that direction. In many states, if I think that a woman has dense breasts (as her radiologist), her insurance company is obliged to pay for a breast ultrasound. And yet if there is a man in my clinic who has prostate cancer and wants to weigh his treatment options, many times I have to fight with an insurance company to get his MRI pre-authorized. MRI has better sensitivity for a clinically significant prostate cancer than a mammogram has for breast cancer. There are ways of doing MRI screening for prostate cancer that will cost about the same per man per year as mammograms for women. One of the counter arguments is overtreatment, with all of the side effects and financial costs. There are exciting new treatment options such as MRI guided focal laser ablation which really minimize the risk of side-effects. Most patients would have a clean MRI and need no treatment at all. Many could be watched with \"magnetic surveillance.\" And those who have more extensive disease could be treated with invasive treatment such as radical prostatectomy. Yes there are often side effects, but in properly selected patients, there is no question that this surgery saves lives. If we catch the cancer early, we can treat it effectively, before it spreads. I believe that we can do better, but there needs to be the political will and funding through insurance and medicare to make this a reality. What do you think? Is it time to make MRI screening for prostate cancer a reality? Sincerely, Ara Karamanian, MD",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by Jack1954 Hi At what stage i.e during biopsy, MRI or surgery it is confirmed that the cancer has spread or confined? thanks. Disclaimer: This is general medical information and does not establish a physician-patient relationship. There are different types of spreading, local extracapsular extension, seminal vesicle invasion, lymph node involvement, and distant metastasis. A 3T multiparametric MRI is a good test for evaluating extracapsular extension: direct outgrowth of a tumor in the prostate through and beyond the capsule. Surgery is the gold standard because they can cut up the tissue and look at it under a microscope. The MRI is also good at looking for seminal vesicle invasion, although not quite as good. Not ejaculating for 3 days prior to the MRI helps the seminal vesicles fill with fluid and makes tumor invasion easier to identify. Lymph node involvement is possible to be seen, but if it is microscopic, will generally not be seen with MRI. A surgical lymph node dissection can pick up microscopic disease in the prostate, but again, this is because the pathologist can look at it under a microscope. Distant metastasis (e.g., metastasis to the spine) obviously won't be seen on a prostate MRI. I hope this helps clarify the role of MRI. Best regards, Ara Karamanian, MD",

      "Content": "Hi Joe, Disclaimer: I offer this as general medical information. This does not establish a physician-patient relationship. You must go to a qualified physician for your evaluation and treatment. Background: PI-RADS is a reporting tool that helps standardize the reads of multiparametric MRI. We are now in PI-RADS version 2, and the benefits of the PI-RADS has been prospectively validated in the radiology literature. A TRUS biopsy has only about a 70-80% sensitivity for a clinically significant prostate cancer. A 3T multiparametric MRI performed reasonably well has a greater than 90% sensitivity for clinically significant prostate cancer. Makes me wonder why we don't always start with the MRI, but I digress. So a TRUS biopsy is going to miss about 1 out of 4 clinically significant prostate cancers. Your situation: You have an elevated PSA, a PI-RADS 4 lesion. I cannot speak precisely to your situation, but in general a patient in this situation usually needs an image guided biopsy. There are three ways of doing this: 1) MRI guided in-bore biopsy. This is the gold standard. The interventional radiologist who performs this procedure can actually see the biopsy device go through the lesion under MRI. 2) Fusion biopsy. The MRI images are overlaid on top of the ultrasound images, and the urologist tries to hit the same area using ultrasound guidance. This approach is less expensive than an in-bore biopsy, but less accurate especially for small lesions. Results are definitely superior than a TRUS biopsy. 3) Cognitive fusion. The urologist tries to hit the spot from the MRI based on fusing the images in his or her mind. This approach is not recommended given the better options we have now (MRI in-bore biopsy or fusion). Given the advances of MRI imaging for prostate cancer, this opens the possibility of focal treatment such as MRI guided focal laser ablation. The benefits of focal treatment are significantly fewer side effects, but long term studies showing improved overall survival have yet to be performed (because the technology is new). There are short term studies, and I am preparing the largest study to date for publication later this year. Best regards, Ara Karamanian, MD",
