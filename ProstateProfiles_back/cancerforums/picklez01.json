      "Content": "Hello all. I would just like to know if anyone has heard of this before, as I didn't know it was possible to make this kind of diagnosis from a catheter change... My dad has had the \"pussycat\"variety of prostate cancer, the less serious of the two for 14 years. Up until a year ago he was fine going to the toilet but now since then, has had a catheter. My dad was not informed of this, but he says he overheard the doctors talking when he had to go to hospital to have has catheter changed. He overheard one of the doctors say it was \"tiger\", the aggressive prostate cancer. Is it possible to make that kind of diagnosis from only a catheter change? Appreciate anything anyone has to say about it. Thankyou.",

      "Content": "Hi Steve. I live in UK. My dad has had blood tests as well, but after looking online it seems like only a rectal examination or a biopsy could detect whether the prostate cancer had become more aggressive. I don't know whether he has miss heard or not... But he seems certain.. I will have to try and phone the hospital and see if they will tell me anything..",

      "Content": "Thankyou everyone for your responses. I don't live very close to my dad so I haven't had the chance to speak to one of his doctors at all, unfortunately. He has had blood tests, so maybe they picked it up from that? Looking online, it seems they could only make such a diagnosis from a biopsy or a rectal examination. Please correct me if I'm wrong. He seems adamant about what he overheard the doctors saying, he's been crying his eyes out terrified, very much preparing for the worst.. He is 84 though, it's possible he completely miss heard what was being said. I'm going to phone his doctors surgery tomorrow and see if I can find anything more out.",
