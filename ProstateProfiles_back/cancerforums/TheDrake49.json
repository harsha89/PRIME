      "Content": "Originally Posted by MRJ I tried it for a few days. It does get cramped, but the larger issue was keeping the pad in place. If you use the sticky strip on the pad, it will tear the inside of the briefs on removal. I will be 5 weeks out from surgery 5/03 While control is getting better, I still need pads and briefs. But like you said it does get cramped, so I thought about just wearing briefs at home and pads and briefs when we go out (easy just to change pads in public restroom).",
