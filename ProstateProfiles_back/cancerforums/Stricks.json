    "Content": "Hello! New to the group and hoping for some guidance. My SO of 3 years had a radical prostatectomy in 2000. The cancer was apparently very advanced and they did not spare the nerves, though he's been told by his Uro that they probably would have been able to spare them had the surgery been performed today. Why tell him that? At any rate, he's had few partners in the patst 18 years, mostly because of his own insecurities about it, I think. He was using Aprostadil for the past several years, with OK results, and then the VA changed their supplier and he was put on Trimix Standard Strength. It does give him an erection, but even at maximum strength, we have never had intercourse in 3 years, on either drug. Our oral sex life is fantastic and maybe that's just going to have to be enough. But I just found out that he is not telling his Uro that we aren't having intercourse. He finds it very difficult to talk to her about this. I told him I would like to go with him next time. I think he resigned himself years ago that his sex life was gone, but he says that's before I came into his life. And the drugs have changed so much over the past 18 years, I'm hoping there might be something a bit more powerful he could try or other things we could add. We are SO close! FYI, I am 47 and he is 71 and some people don't understand it, but I am crazy in love with this man! We exercise together and I prepare healthy foods and he looks like he's 61. I think he may outlive me! But I want whatever time we have together to be the best it can be, and want to send him out of this world with a BANG, so to speak. Lol Thank you for any thoughts or guidance in this matter.",
