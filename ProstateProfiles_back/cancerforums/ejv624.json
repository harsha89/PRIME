      "Content": "Thanks for your input Chuck and Mikla, I realize that some men will have PC with a \"Normal PSA\" and others wont with a high level. My real issue is that it sounds like all men if they live long enough will eventually develop some form of PC. Given that, we all have ancestors that had PC but probably didn't know it. With that in mind it doing a Biopsy every time it \"seems\" a little high is like going fishing. Sometimes you catch something sometimes you don't. If for example I had a suspicious nodule or he felt something on the DRE then I would lean more toward doing the biopsy since we have something we suspect. But given negative DRE's and assuming negative TRUS (other than enlarged prostate 65gms I believe) then we are just randomly taken samples based on a somewhat elevated but within range PSA. Sloan Kettering recommends that men between the age of 51-59 have a PSA taken every 2-4 years if the PSA test is between 1 and 3. Over 3 they recommend biopsy. In my case had I followed that guideline I would not of had another PSA test until 10/9/2015 or 4/4/2016 if I went from the 2.00 test. Taking it every 6 months seems a bit over doing it (let alone 2 months which the 3.29 was 1 month after having the TRUS done) so my guess is that fluctuations will and do happen. If I went for another PSA test in say two months and it was at same level or higher I would then feel a biopsy is warranted. But if I wait and the PSA is back in the 2.0-2.7 range that would still seem normal and I would wait on a biopsy. I realize doing a biopsy is the only way to know if PC is present but a negative biopsy isn't a guarantee your PC free. It gets to be a slippery slope, I have friends that have done 2 and 3 biopsies all negative. Given all men will develop PC eventually one of the biopsies will come back positive! An even bigger concern is if the biopsy comes back positive for say a low non aggressive cancer. One that I may have never known about or died from if not for the PSA test (since DRE and TRUS show neg). Then we get into the whole over treating.. ED and Incontinence are not something I want to have to deal with unless I really have no choice. Sure I don't want to die sooner then i have to, but I don't want to live longer and have a poor quality of life. Guess like you said Chuck we are all \"floating in the same boat\" ! I'll will wait to see what my Doctor says but he seems very pro biopsy and that's I guess what concerns me. Ultimately I guess we all have to make these decisions based on our own feelings and way of thinking but getting others experiences helps. So thanks again for your help. Ed",

      "Content": "Thanks everyone. I met with my Urologist tonight and he didn't have a problem with me waiting to take another PSA test in 3 months before deciding on a biopsy. He does feel that I should and will have to do it but didn't try to force me into doing it now. He did another DRE which was negative and the TRUS I had two months ago was fine. One thing I thought was odd but he didn't seem to think a big deal was that 1 year ago after the TRUS my prostate size was 74grams. This last one showed 57grams so it got smaller. In my mind its smaller but has higher PSA but he didn't seem to think that mattered much. One good thing on this last PSA, the % of free PSA was 18. Last two times when psa was 2.00 it was 16 and last one at 2.74 it was 15 so that went up which I understand is a good thing. In any event I will go in april for my PSA and if it has gone up I will get the biopsy if it goes down I will prob continue to wait. One other question I did have. My urologist said that before the biopsy procedure they could give me an anesthetic. He said Lidocaine could be inserted in the rectum to deaden the pain. I thought they did that but also injected something into the prostate but he said no. Is that what others have experienced?",

      "Content": "Hi Board, I am new to the site and would like to get some advice. I have an appointment with my urologist in the next few days and I\u2019m pretty sure he is going to recommend that I have a biopsy done on my prostate. I am a little hesitant for the following reasons. I originally came to this urologist a year ago when microscopic blood was found in my urine during a routine urine test. I had a Cystoscope, TRUS and Urography and all came back normal. No blood in urine since the one test, Urologist suspected it could have come from prostate since the TRUS did show an enlarged prostate. At that time the urologist was already mentioning that he felt I should consider a biopsy given my age 58 , family history (Father diagnosed with PC at 69) and my PSA was 2.5. But decided to wait and retest PSA in 6 months. The results at 6 months came back 2.0. so we went another 6 months and PSA jumped to 2.72. then went 2 months later and up to 3.29. I also had another TRUS which I will find out the results of at the visit. Below is a log of my PSA results for last 10 years up to the recent 3.29. All my DRE\u2019s have been negative as was the TRUS done Nov 2014 (other than enlarged prostate). If the TRUS I just took in Nov 2015 comes back normal I feel I should wait and retest PSA in another 3-4 months to see if the 3.29 was just a spike. I have read a lot about PSA testing and how many men are subjected to tests and treatments that they may have never really needed. I know it\u2019s a risk, but waiting another 3-4 months given the slow rate most prostate cancers grow would seem to be ok. Reading this board it seems to me many men have had much higher PSA results before going for a biopsy. I appreciate any and all comments and advice.
