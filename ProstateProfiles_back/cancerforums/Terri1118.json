The other 5 were not positive for cancer. Next steps are CT scan and bone scan. Scheduled for 6/16. Hubby is going to call the urologist Monday to see if he can get the scans done sooner at another facility. The urologist said because hubby was on Finasteride it puts his PSA at \"at least 16\". SO: PSA 16 DRE nodule, 1 cm in size Density Ratio bad (can't remember the number) 2 biopsy cores Gleason 8 Not sure if I have any questions ---have to wait for the scans. Because its high grade aggressive cancer should I assume it has spread. We do know one person who had a Gleason 8 and it was contained--just not sure if that's unusual or not. MD Anderson is near us. We will be calling them too. Anyone have direct experience with MD Anderson? Thank you. Terri",

      "Content": "Hi All, First, I want to say I am very thankful for this site. It has already helped me to understand a lot about prostate cancer. Hubby (58 years old) was sent to a urologist because his PSA was high. It was 3 --08/2016, 6.6-- 03/2017, and 8.2-- 04/2017. When he saw the urologist the urologist wanted to know how long he had been on Finasteride ( 9 years) and why he was on it (BPH). Then he did a DRE and felt a nodule. He did an ultrasound and said the density ratio was bad. He said all indicators are leading to prostate cancer. He had his biopsy today and we are prepared to hear its cancer. We won't know until next week. I guess my question is: Has anyone had these particular set of circumstances? If so, what are your outcomes/experiences? Our hope is that it is contained but from what I've read I think that is unlikely. I have read Dr. Walsh's book on prostate cancer and found it to be very helpful. It was a suggested book from here in the prostate cancer site. It is my understanding when we meet for the biopsy report we should have all of the information we need to proceed to the next step. The report should have whether or not it is cancer, the type and staging. Will it be able to tell us if it has spread or not? Do you have any question suggestions for when we meet with the urologist about the biopsy results? The only other thing I would suggest to anyone who is on Finasteride is to talk to your doctor about it. It can mask the real numbers for your PSA and give you and your doctor a false sense of everything is ok. According to Dr. Walsh if you are on it multiply your number by 2.5 if you have been on it more than 5 years. Puts my hubby's at 20.5 PSA. Thank you for any information or thoughts you might have on this.",

My hubby was just diagnosed with Gleason 8 'high grade aggressive cancer\". This forum has been very helpful. We are waiting for his appointments for bone scan and Ct scan. Hoping for the best. I was snooping around this site before my first post and Dr. Patrick Walsh's Book, Surviving Prostate Cancer, kept coming up. I bought it on Amazon. Downloaded and read it. It got me up to speed rather quickly. It has a lot of info--- maybe too much but has helped in understanding whats going on and what questions to ask. Glad you have found it too. I don't really have any advice-- we are so new too all of this too. But this site has helped to make us feel like we are not alone in all of this. We are calling MDAnderson tomorrow. I think finding a top notch cancer center/hospital is important at this stage. Hoping and praying for the best for you and your husband. Terri",

      "Content": "Hi Redhtz, I just want to welcome you, unfortunately, to this very special forum. I just found it in the last couple of weeks. My hubby was just diagnosed with Gleason 8 'high grade aggressive cancer\". This forum has been very helpful. We are waiting for his appointments for bone scan and Ct scan. Hoping for the best. I was snooping around this site before my first post and Dr. Patrick Walsh's Book, Surviving Prostate Cancer, kept coming up. I bought it on Amazon. Downloaded and read it. It got me up to speed rather quickly. It has a lot of info--- maybe too much but has helped in understanding whats going on and what questions to ask. Glad you have found it too. I don't really have any advice-- we are so new too all of this too. But this site has helped to make us feel like we are not alone in all of this. We are calling MDAnderson tomorrow. I think finding a top notch cancer center/hospital is important at this stage. Hoping and praying for the best for you and your husband. Terri",
