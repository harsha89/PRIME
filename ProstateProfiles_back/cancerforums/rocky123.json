    "Content": "Age 57, white. at age 50 (2007) started having BPH issues, PSA climbed from 2 to 6 over 3 yr period. Negative biopsy in 2010. PSA rose to 9.8 in 2014. Biopsy 1 of 12 cores positive, with 5-10% of core cancer. Gleason 6. Robot RP Jan 2015 Dr. Kane UCSD San Digeo. Gleason 6 1 tumor in center of prostate 8mm max size prostate size was 63 grams 1% of prostate overall tumor mass seminal vesicles and lymphs removed both nerves spared negative margins on everything. Lots paint from phrenic nerve irritation for 7 days --super intense, then subsided. Still faint pain. Thrombosis wrist vein from surgical IV antibiotic. Intense pain. Catheter was painless but inconvenient. Out on day 8. Now one week after catheter out, and 99% dry at nite and need 2 pads during day. Stay off caffeine, and reduce liquid intake before bed helps a lot. I do kegels only while urinating. Stop and start flow about 6-7 times. Blood drops after urinating for few days after catheter remove has now stopped. Still have significant pain while urinating and stopping/starting. Testicles tender and sore. Low level pelvic area pain and pain at 5 surgical sites. Penis seems 10% 'shorter' . Had semi-erection day 5 after catheter removed. Head down surgical position for 4 hours caused some superficial capillary veins on my face to flame up. Seeing dermatologist next week to fix that. First post surgery PSA test March 3rd. Will report back results. General comments: surgery far more painful then I thought it would be perhaps cause I had phrenic and thrombosis issues. Stayed 2 nites hospital due to these other issues. Take the stool softeners--big help when you have initial BMs. Get a rope or chain tied to end of your bed so you can pull yourself up from horizontal position with arms instead of crunching abs--too painful and risky to sutures. Get Dr. Walsh's book how to survive prostate cancer-- big help. TIP: Don't complain about pain or any other issues to wife or family. This is your issue and they can't rally help and it only makes them feel bad. Deal with it in your own mind. Focus on how you'll feel in a week, month year when your PSA results are 'zero'. Go to your happy place. You're going to be fine-- and live a long life regardless of the outcome. Get busy right now with that new life. Live in the moment and enjoy",
