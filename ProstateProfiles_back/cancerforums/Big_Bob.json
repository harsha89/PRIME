      "Content": "Originally Posted by Information Seeker When my surgeon called about initial results of final diagnosis after RALP he mentioned sending off samples for Deciper genomic testing. This is basically what I have found out about this. It is for predicting the probability of metastasis after surgery and provides an independent assessment of tumor aggressiveness; information distinct from that provided by Gleason score or PSA. Is anyone familiar with this deciper testing program?? TKS In the midst of my haste to have my G6 addressed in started with my biopsy results in April, I had \"consented\" to BOTH the Polaris & Decipher testing done. Neither was covered by insurance but my hospital network has an agreement with the labs concerning the financial obligations the patient will be incur IF insurance does not cover. Polaris testing was done off my biopsy core, which since I had already decided to go the RALP direction was a complete waste of $375 out of pocket. Then after my surgery in June, Genome Biosciences Lab submitted a $5,200 claim which my insurer promptly kicked to the curb as not medically necessary. I will owe $100 out of pocket for this. My Decipher result was .45 which indicates a 4% risk of recurrence after 5 years and 4.5% after 10 years. After surgery my pathology was upgraded to G7 (3+4) and my 7 week uPSA was .02 and my checking account is $475 lighter. I wish I had asked more questions (I did not even know I signed up for the Decipher) rather than nodding like a bobble-head wanting to get things rolling as fast as possible. If you decide to have it, make sure you find out what YOU will be billed (GET THIS IN WRITING), if the carrier does not pay. Sorry I had to vent a little. Big Bob",

I'm now walking up a long 1/2 mile hill loop I have near my home morning & evening with my wife. I took the advice of the gentlemen here and got myself motivated in June by running and lifting weights knowing I would be on the shelf in July. In addition, my weight has dropped from 185 to 180 since I haven't been hitting up those Burger King specials as much!! Hoping for a good pathology report at follow-up this week. regards, Bob",

      "Content": "Gentleman: After my initial visit to the urologist in March, I agreed to \"Polaris\" testing. I was resigned to surgery after a biopsy in April showed 2 cores of gleason 6 cancer. To make a long story short, I had RALP 6/26/2017 and things have been progressing well in healing up. Today I almost blew a motherboard when I got the bill of $375 !!! I don't have a copy of the report but my Uro said it showed the genetics of my cancer was \"non aggressive\". Has anyone else ordered this testing and does this testing have value in it if your having surgery anyway? I feel I may have been duped in my haste to get a leg up on my PCa. Any comments appreciated. Big_Bob",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by Michael F Hi Big_Bob! Your biopsy (Bx)result was Gleason (3+3). As it turned out, you elected surgery and were upgraded to Gleason (3+4). Was Prolaris able to \"predict\" the upgrade to G (3+4)? Others' Opinions invited please!: - Do Prolaris results always mirror pGleason Stages? - Does Prolaris have any ability to ultimately improve outcomes? How much was your insurance billed and how much did they reimburse? In the end, we are all very happy that you are not in a high risk category! MF 1. The insurance did not pay.... although the gross from Myriad was 3,400 less an adjustment of 3,025 2. The polaris test said I was a 2 which the Uro said was low-risk ... not sure of the scale but I'm asking for a copy of the report anyway. 3. The path report was a gleason 3+4, multi-focal tumor extending to the apical margin. I'm glad with end decision to do the RALP in any case but a little jacked about the $375. Big_Bob",
