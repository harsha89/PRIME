      "Content": "Originally Posted by ASAdvocate Allmo, Thanks for this detailed post. Last year, I attended a support group meeting where a veteran urologist did a slide show presenting the same facts as you did. His conclusion was that PSA testing was only saving one man per one thousand tested.. The men in the room were pretty much in an uproar, as they respected that doctor, but refused to accept the conclusion. It was a quite a meeting. I recall that everyone agreed with testing, and blamed the urologists for being too eager to rush men into surgery. The presenter assured them that AS was on dramatic recent rise, and that more options were being discussed, at least in larger practices. ASA, Regarding my question to forum brothers: I am curious what the poll results of forum brothers would be regarding screening with psa for 55-69 males with normal life expectancy. Do you agree with 1, 2, or 3? 1. no screening - 2012 USPSTF 2. maybe screen - 2018 USPSTF --- actually to be fair - dubbed smarter screening; parsing risk analysis, e.g. family history, african american, etc 3. Screen. Period. End of story. ASA - Thank you for taking the poll. You got me my answer, kind of/with caveats. The answer: Door number 3 - \"everyone agreed with testing\", but if you will allow me to take it to further emotional hyperbole, backed up by your scientific observation of \"uproar\" Your poll results stated more emotionally: - Everyone agreed with testing. Period. End of story. Clint Eastwood style. Errata: No. Not Clint Eastwood. He is calm, cool, and collected and just asks how lucky do you feel; with his one shot magnum - More like Stallone aka rocky or rambo who comes out with punches/automatic weapons ablazing/\"uproar\"; Your patient cohort for this poll, I suspect, has tremendous selection bias and lead time bias probably a much more savy, educated group; having already been diagnosed with prostate ca and able and motivated to do research, including enough to join a support group; certainly not at all comparable to average cohort of newly diagnosed, shock and awe patients, who know less to nothing, newly walking into our world: welcome to the forum: with fear of cancer and then fear of delay in treatment of cancer. The forum does a great job of re-assuring and talking many off the cliff of panic. Including myself - thank you Chuck and the forum. Stated another way: I had 15 to 30 minutes total with my urologist post delivery of the shock and awe message: you have cancer. How much could I have possibly asked, how much could I have possibly absorbed: before emotionally arriving at - treat and treat fast. ask questions later. This selection and lead time bias explains your support group's complete acceptance of the concept of active surveillance and thus their reasoned and correct objection to the experts USTFP 2012 directive and since your poll is dated 2017, I suspect even to the revised 2018 directive of \"maybe\" But what they are not taking into account is the directive is aimed at all patients, and all patients are not as aware or accepting of AS as your support group. And that acceptance is necessary in our era of shared decision making. ----- And just as you reported your veteran urologist countered: \"The presenter assured them that AS was on dramatic recent rise, and that more options were being discussed, at least in larger practices.\" The task force : countered - \"...recognition that active surveillance, rather than treatment, of low-risk cancers was becoming much more common\". The key in this whole taskforce change: is both a. the concept and refinement of the concept of active surveillance and b. patient's and for that matter doctor's emotional acceptance of active surveillance which is completely emotionally counterintuitive to our core. A. is fixed by facts/science B. is fluid and emotional ---- The B is what is causing our lag behind Europe and Australia. What everyone including your veteran urologist may not have emphasized. This change could not have happened without Dr. Epstein's - the one and only titan period of Prostate cancer grading - breakthru: E=mc2 moment of both creating a smaller better prognosis cohort of Gleason 3 patients; but furthermore creating one that surrendipitously does not metastasize - study of 17k patients. I know many of the caveats including ca heterogeneity, ca transformation, sampling error, pathologist grading error, etc.; I am sure Djin can come up with many more. but that is all baked into the active surveillance concept which is at the statistical clinical translational level; not at the light microscopic level: pathologist sampling error, or pathologist grading error, or even at the molecular biology level of tumor heterogeneity and transformation: by way of oncogenes/accelerators of psadt, tumor suppressor genes/brakes/dna repair/cell death/apoptosis, anti-immune and pro-angiogenesis mechanisms, etc. One of the huge laments on this board and by all patients is the uncertainty of all this stuff and you have to go with your gut/emotion, and thus the concept of shared decision making. But on the statistical clinical translational research level: 100% no metastasis to lymph nodes, 100% no lymphovascular space invasion, rare 0.03% seminal vesicle invasion, and uncommon 2% non-focal EPE is as good as you could possibly get studying 17k Radical prostatectomy with lymphadenectomy specimens at Johns Hopkins for de facto evidence of no metastatic potential. Actually, it is mind boggling serendipitous to me. E=mc2 Dr. Epstein. How did you pull that rabbit out of your hat? In part, thru several revisions over many years, 2014 was not the 1st revision, there were several Epstein revisions prior to 2014: continually reducing the Gleason 3 category into smaller and smaller cohorts of better prognosis patients. How he got to absolute zero though was serendipitous. The concept of active surveillance allows for knowledge to counter gut/emotion. And I believe another breakthru could be semantic from an English/psychology professor. I quote from a recent Epstein article: \"The lack of metastatic potential of GS6 cancer has led to the argument to remove the label cancer from this lesion. Instead some experts have suggested labeling GS6 cancer as IDLE to reduce the patient fear of cancer, which would hopefully lead to an increase in active surveillance. Several articles in the literature have listed the pros and cons of relabeling GS6 as not cancer.\" So, academic urologic pathologists proposed: IDLE (indolent lesion of epithelial origin) - by clinical translation research, 100% correct - But quite awkward if I do so say myself. And rejected by Epstein. But even if Epstein gave it his imprimatur, it never would have had a chance in hell to catch on with rank and file urologists, the minions, who would have to deliver the cryptic/awkward \"good\" news. Go explain IDLE to the average joe in 15 minutes. Good luck. And then get them on board with Active surveillance; even better luck; especially if that average Joe is Clint Eastwood. Tangent: One of the most mind tweak concepts I have come across regarding prostate cancer is the Will Rogers phenomenon. You have to google it and try to wrap your head around it --- it is truly a mind tweak, like no other; and if mentioned at all in research papers is buried as a caveat/limitation -- grade migration or some other non-eloquent set of words. Which comes into play loud and clear regarding Epstein's shrinking Gleason 3 cancer into a much better prognosis cancer; nay non-metastasizing non-cancer.",

      "Content": "Footnote Disclaimer: 2018 US Preventative Task force recommendation on Psa screening document is 212 pages long; a tome; mind numbingly exhaustive per literature references. I challenge anyone to read it front to back including the experts aside from the authors ----- so admittedly my delivery could only at best be a vast oversimplification ---- Some studies showed a difference; others did not; yada yada yada; including the most important metric to big picture, health policy experts: pcsm=prostate cancer specific mortality --- and specifically in regard to screening: The metric: Numbers to screen in order to prevent one prostate ca death: health policy makers most important metric for valuing a screening method remember: Gilda Radner, Ovarian ca, and CA-125. I even remember Gene Wilder on TV pushing CA-125 for screening. In essence, imploring the public to rise up against the USPSTF and by implication the Federal government for keeping CA-125 secret. I mean, damn it we could be preventing ovarian cancer. Women across the country swamped their gynecologists with demand for CA-125 test. Some were positive. What ensued was an onslaught of unnecessary studies and operations with no significant impact. You do not hear about CA-125 for screening anymore. For screening, CA-125 is in the dust heap of medical history. Forgotten. Admittedly, CA-125 is great for monitoring, same story for CA19-9 for pancreatic cancer, and there are many others; but not for screening.---- PSA stands alone. It is the only cancer blood marker for screening - period. Yet, another unique feature of prostate cancer. But even it is not perfect; but only in the sense that it needs an incredibly detailed decision tree and probably more importantly near total buyin to Active surveillance to drive down overtreatment to a number which will change the guidance to: recommending screening on all 55-69 yr olds with normal life expectancy; ---- I agree with you Djin over the lifetime of a patient; admittedly a commitment; but then it is near perfect. Per the numbers to screen to prevent 1 pcsm: the studies cited vary widely from no prevention at all to 1 for 270 screened; as opposed to 1 in 1000, I quoted from the task force evidence report; clearly the taskforce calculated some sort of average of all the studies in the literature, weighted by quality of the study etc. to arrive at 1 in 1000. Objections could be made to most of the hard numbers I listed, along these lines; but that was not the point of my post; and who am I too argue with the 212 page tome vetted by many experts; not some fringe group. Just look at the whos who of the vetters. I was focusing on stuff, not covered or skirted over by the tome: a. the psychology and penetrance/acceptance of active surveillance b. the development by Epstein of a non-metastasizing Gleason grade 3 CA which dovetailed perfectly into the concept of active surveillance; making prostate CA truly unique in this other way aside from all other unique features; c. political/sociological differences between U.S and the rest of the advanced scientific world.",

And last - of course positive DRE = higher stage >/= pT2 largely taking it out of AS; clinicalT2a exceptions exist for AS. otherwise all of your caveats and nuances are baked into the beauty/science of Active Surveillance as the solution to the 2012 guidance against screening with Psa - AS will be the subject of continued research and refinement and thus only get more perfect, marginally and AS will continue to have increasing acceptance by USA doctors, softened by \"shared decision making\", with greater acceptance by patients ---- Acceptance rates in US: from a low of 6.7% in the years from 1990 to 2009, to 40.4% in the period 2010 to 2013; but AS at 40% in 2013 still lags behind the frontrunners/leaders Europe and Australia - their acceptance rates are much higher. In part because, they have less patient advocacy, less shared decision making, emotional stuff to deal with. There doctors can just follow the hard facts including not doing standard of care - the latter a legal concept in the U.S. which handcuffs doctors, even the experts into doing what the herd does. Admittedly the herd is right in the vast majority of instances; but when a groundbreaking advance occurs such as ultrasensitive imaging especially psma based imaging; there is no clinical translational data to to know for sure for the foreseeable future: for consensus/standard of care directives to be made; and in Europe and Australia, patients more readily just trust their doctors. There are pros and cons to both systems. You should just be aware of the differences. Tangential thought: Europe, Asia, and Australia lead the USA in other prostate Ca mind tweak concepts, which run against longstanding conventional concepts, besides AS. This includes the mentioned above ultrasensitive imaging technologies; but also one of its major corollaries directed therapies, in general, and salvage surgery in particular; and active surveillance in the bcr phase of the disease for select patients who have low risk bcr: including low detectable but stable bcr and late to bcr, low psa velocity, low Grade group and stage patients. Both these future mind tweak concepts which have relevance in the bcr stage of disease: challenge us for a word for recurrent stage 4 ca that can be treated with non-systemic/directed therapy in combination with systemic therapy, and probably eventually with delayed and eventually without standard of care systemic therapy; for a select subset of patients; from indolent bcr to prostate bed only recurrence to pelvic and immediately extrapelvic lymph node recurrence to oligometastatic recurrent ca including oligometastases to bone. Basal cell carcinoma of the skin will not inform us; nor will ductal carcinoma in situ of the breast inform us; nor will papillary carcinoma of the thyroid inform us ---- all peculiar forms of low end cancer for different reasons which do not completely fit low volume, low psa, low molecular score, Gleason 3 prostate biopsy cancer or indolent bcr or prostate bed only recurrence. The bcr recurrent phase: another shock and awe that I myself am facing/heading for. I am at 0.026 -- with beyond psa anxiety. I better take Pom-T, exercise, lose weight, cholesterol and glucose lower, etc. etc. and pray. The only things in my control at this point. lol. This/these concepts are and will be mind tweaks/counterintuitive even to doctors. Doctor's are emotional beings, also, and were trained as a first, second, and third approximation -- the best treatment of cancer, except for prevention, is treat early, end of story. trained that in the U.S., the only treatment is standard of care, end of story, informed by our legal malpractice system; even if you know your European and Australian counterparts are pushing the facts/frontiers forward in front of you. And for stage 4 disease: treat systemically. end of story. No, I need to correct myself; there is a well accepted exception to the above in pca: stage 4 prostate bed only recurrence post RP: standard of care is salvage RT; except that at the low psa levels required for benefit, with our standard of care conventional CT and bone scan, we are blind as to where the recurrence really is, including whether or not it is really confined to the prostate bed --- the new ultrasensitive imaging technologies open the blinders, at least in the 0.2 to 10-20 range where conventional studies, bone and CT scan, could not. Furthermore we may really be curing nothing with salvage RT in low risk patients (uncancer/precancer and even benign tissue), but admittedly resetting the psa clock back to zero in the majority - Up to 70% for low risk patients, informed by MSK nomogram. And several current large retrospective studies coming out of Italy, some in conjunction with USA including Mayo clinic, showing that after substratifying by risk this lowest risk 70% cured by salvage RT really are not benefitted at all, except for setting the psa clock back to zero. Active surveillance was a hard sell even to doctors. Just as directed therapies for early recurrence which are coming are going to be hard sells; because it flies in the face of conventional oncologic theory. But prostate ca is different. And ultrasensitive imaging will reveal the natural pattern of spread of the disease in the 0.2 to 10-20 psa range which was up until now hidden. It will be shown to be much more stepwise than almost any cancer known except basal cell carcinoma and papillary carcinoma of the thyroid. ----- In summary, the guidance changed for 3 reasons, in my opinion: 1. Acceptance rate of active surveillance increased 2. AS science improved 3. Ahlering research that lack of screening resulted in actual theoretic harm: stage migration 4. cynically, political pressure - uproar from the masses. Not. USPTF were a scientific body despite the Federal mandate and thus title. But correct me, if I am wrong.",

And last - of course positive DRE = higher stage >/= pT2 largely taking it out of AS; clinicalT2a exceptions exist for AS. otherwise all of your caveats and nuances are baked into the beauty/science of Active Surveillance as the solution to the 2012 guidance against screening with Psa - AS will be the subject of continued research and refinement and thus only get more perfect, marginally and AS will continue to have increasing acceptance by USA doctors, softened by \"shared decision making\", with greater acceptance by patients ---- Acceptance rates in US: from a low of 6.7% in the years from 1990 to 2009, to 40.4% in the period 2010 to 2013; but AS at 40% in 2013 still lags behind the frontrunners/leaders Europe and Australia - their acceptance rates are much higher. In part because, they have less patient advocacy, less shared decision making, emotional stuff to deal with. There doctors can just follow the hard facts including not doing standard of care - the latter a legal concept in the U.S. which handcuffs doctors, even the experts into doing what the herd does. Admittedly the herd is right in the vast majority of instances; but when a groundbreaking advance occurs such as ultrasensitive imaging especially psma based imaging; there is no clinical translational data to to know for sure for the foreseeable future: for consensus/standard of care directives to be made; and in Europe and Australia, patients more readily just trust their doctors. There are pros and cons to both systems. You should just be aware of the differences. Tangential thought: Europe, Asia, and Australia lead the USA in other prostate Ca mind tweak concepts, which run against longstanding conventional concepts, besides AS. This includes the mentioned above ultrasensitive imaging technologies; but also one of its major corollaries directed therapies, in general, and salvage surgery in particular; and active surveillance in the bcr phase of the disease for select patients who have low risk bcr: including low detectable but stable bcr and late to bcr, low psa velocity, low Grade group and stage patients. Both these future mind tweak concepts which have relevance in the bcr stage of disease: challenge us for a word for recurrent stage 4 ca that can be treated with non-systemic/directed therapy in combination with systemic therapy, and probably eventually with delayed and eventually without standard of care systemic therapy; for a select subset of patients; from indolent bcr to prostate bed only recurrence to pelvic and immediately extrapelvic lymph node recurrence to oligometastatic recurrent ca including oligometastases to bone. Basal cell carcinoma of the skin will not inform us; nor will ductal carcinoma in situ of the breast inform us; nor will papillary carcinoma of the thyroid inform us ---- all peculiar forms of low end cancer for different reasons which do not completely fit low volume, low psa, low molecular score, Gleason 3 prostate biopsy cancer or indolent bcr or prostate bed only recurrence. The bcr recurrent phase: another shock and awe that I myself am facing/heading for. I am at 0.026 -- with beyond psa anxiety. I better take Pom-T, exercise, lose weight, cholesterol and glucose lower, etc. etc. and pray. The only things in my control at this point. lol. This/these concepts are and will be mind tweaks/counterintuitive even to doctors. Doctor's are emotional beings, also, and were trained as a first, second, and third approximation -- the best treatment of cancer, except for prevention, is treat early, end of story. trained that in the U.S., the only treatment is standard of care, end of story, informed by our legal malpractice system; even if you know your European and Australian counterparts are pushing the facts/frontiers forward in front of you. And for stage 4 disease: treat systemically. end of story. No, I need to correct myself; there is a well accepted exception to the above in pca: stage 4 prostate bed only recurrence post RP: standard of care is salvage RT; except that at the low psa levels required for benefit, with our standard of care conventional CT and bone scan, we are blind as to where the recurrence really is, including whether or not it is really confined to the prostate bed --- the new ultrasensitive imaging technologies open the blinders, at least in the 0.2 to 10-20 range where conventional studies, bone and CT scan, could not. Furthermore we may really be curing nothing with salvage RT in low risk patients (uncancer/precancer and even benign tissue), but admittedly resetting the psa clock back to zero in the majority - Up to 70% for low risk patients, informed by MSK nomogram. And several current large retrospective studies coming out of Italy, some in conjunction with USA including Mayo clinic, showing that after substratifying by risk this lowest risk 70% cured by salvage RT really are not benefitted at all, except for setting the psa clock back to zero. Active surveillance was a hard sell even to doctors. Just as directed therapies for early recurrence which are coming are going to be hard sells; because it flies in the face of conventional oncologic theory. But prostate ca is different. And ultrasensitive imaging will reveal the natural pattern of spread of the disease in the 0.2 to 10-20 psa range which was up until now hidden. It will be shown to be much more stepwise than almost any cancer known except basal cell carcinoma and papillary carcinoma of the thyroid. ----- In summary, the guidance changed for 3 reasons, in my opinion: 1. Acceptance rate of active surveillance increased 2. AS science improved 3. Ahlering research that lack of screening resulted in actual theoretic harm: stage migration 4. cynically, political pressure - uproar from the masses. Not. USPTF were a scientific body despite the Federal mandate and thus title. But correct me, if I am wrong.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by ASAdvocate Allmo, Thanks for this detailed post. Last year, I attended a support group meeting where a veteran urologist did a slide show presenting the same facts as you did. His conclusion was that PSA testing was only saving one man per one thousand tested.. The men in the room were pretty much in an uproar, as they respected that doctor, but refused to accept the conclusion. It was a quite a meeting. I recall that everyone agreed with testing, and blamed the urologists for being too eager to rush men into surgery. The presenter assured them that AS was on dramatic recent rise, and that more options were being discussed, at least in larger practices. ASA, Regarding my question to forum brothers: I am curious what the poll results of forum brothers would be regarding screening with psa for 55-69 males with normal life expectancy. Do you agree with 1, 2, or 3? 1. no screening - 2012 USPSTF 2. maybe screen - 2018 USPSTF --- actually to be fair - dubbed smarter screening; parsing risk analysis, e.g. family history, african american, etc 3. Screen. Period. End of story. ASA - Thank you for taking the poll. You got me my answer, kind of/with caveats. The answer: Door number 3 - \"everyone agreed with testing\", but if you will allow me to take it to further emotional hyperbole, backed up by your scientific observation of \"uproar\" Your poll results stated more emotionally: - Everyone agreed with testing. Period. End of story. Clint Eastwood style. Errata: No. Not Clint Eastwood. He is calm, cool, and collected and just asks how lucky do you feel; with his one shot magnum - More like Stallone aka rocky or rambo who comes out with punches/automatic weapons ablazing/\"uproar\"; Your patient cohort for this poll, I suspect, has tremendous selection bias and lead time bias probably a much more savy, educated group; having already been diagnosed with prostate ca and able and motivated to do research, including enough to join a support group; certainly not at all comparable to average cohort of newly diagnosed, shock and awe patients, who know less to nothing, newly walking into our world: welcome to the forum: with fear of cancer and then fear of delay in treatment of cancer. The forum does a great job of re-assuring and talking many off the cliff of panic. Including myself - thank you Chuck and the forum. Stated another way: I had 15 to 30 minutes total with my urologist post delivery of the shock and awe message: you have cancer. How much could I have possibly asked, how much could I have possibly absorbed: before emotionally arriving at - treat and treat fast. ask questions later. This selection and lead time bias explains your support group's complete acceptance of the concept of active surveillance and thus their reasoned and correct objection to the experts USTFP 2012 directive and since your poll is dated 2017, I suspect even to the revised 2018 directive of \"maybe\" But what they are not taking into account is the directive is aimed at all patients, and all patients are not as aware or accepting of AS as your support group. And that acceptance is necessary in our era of shared decision making. ----- And just as you reported your veteran urologist countered: \"The presenter assured them that AS was on dramatic recent rise, and that more options were being discussed, at least in larger practices.\" The task force : countered - \"...recognition that active surveillance, rather than treatment, of low-risk cancers was becoming much more common\". The key in this whole taskforce change: is both a. the concept and refinement of the concept of active surveillance and b. patient's and for that matter doctor's emotional acceptance of active surveillance which is completely emotionally counterintuitive to our core. A. is fixed by facts/science B. is fluid and emotional ---- The B is what is causing our lag behind Europe and Australia. What everyone including your veteran urologist may not have emphasized. This change could not have happened without Dr. Epstein's - the one and only titan period of Prostate cancer grading - breakthru: E=mc2 moment of both creating a smaller better prognosis cohort of Gleason 3 patients; but furthermore creating one that surrendipitously does not metastasize - study of 17k patients. I know many of the caveats including ca heterogeneity, ca transformation, sampling error, pathologist grading error, etc.; I am sure Djin can come up with many more. but that is all baked into the active surveillance concept which is at the statistical clinical translational level; not at the light microscopic level: pathologist sampling error, or pathologist grading error, or even at the molecular biology level of tumor heterogeneity and transformation: by way of oncogenes/accelerators of psadt, tumor suppressor genes/brakes/dna repair/cell death/apoptosis, anti-immune and pro-angiogenesis mechanisms, etc. One of the huge laments on this board and by all patients is the uncertainty of all this stuff and you have to go with your gut/emotion, and thus the concept of shared decision making. But on the statistical clinical translational research level: 100% no metastasis to lymph nodes, 100% no lymphovascular space invasion, rare 0.03% seminal vesicle invasion, and uncommon 2% non-focal EPE is as good as you could possibly get studying 17k Radical prostatectomy with lymphadenectomy specimens at Johns Hopkins for de facto evidence of no metastatic potential. Actually, it is mind boggling serendipitous to me. E=mc2 Dr. Epstein. How did you pull that rabbit out of your hat? In part, thru several revisions over many years, 2014 was not the 1st revision, there were several Epstein revisions prior to 2014: continually reducing the Gleason 3 category into smaller and smaller cohorts of better prognosis patients. How he got to absolute zero though was serendipitous. The concept of active surveillance allows for knowledge to counter gut/emotion. And I believe another breakthru could be semantic from an English/psychology professor. I quote from a recent Epstein article: \"The lack of metastatic potential of GS6 cancer has led to the argument to remove the label cancer from this lesion. Instead some experts have suggested labeling GS6 cancer as IDLE to reduce the patient fear of cancer, which would hopefully lead to an increase in active surveillance. Several articles in the literature have listed the pros and cons of relabeling GS6 as not cancer.\" So, academic urologic pathologists proposed: IDLE (indolent lesion of epithelial origin) - by clinical translation research, 100% correct - But quite awkward if I do so say myself. And rejected by Epstein. But even if Epstein gave it his imprimatur, it never would have had a chance in hell to catch on with rank and file urologists, the minions, who would have to deliver the cryptic/awkward \"good\" news. Go explain IDLE to the average joe in 15 minutes. Good luck. And then get them on board with Active surveillance; even better luck; especially if that average Joe is Clint Eastwood. Tangent: One of the most mind tweak concepts I have come across regarding prostate cancer is the Will Rogers phenomenon. You have to google it and try to wrap your head around it --- it is truly a mind tweak, like no other; and if mentioned at all in research papers is buried as a caveat/limitation -- grade migration or some other non-eloquent set of words. Which comes into play loud and clear regarding Epstein's shrinking Gleason 3 cancer into a much better prognosis cancer; nay non-metastasizing non-cancer.",

      "Content": "In 2012, the USPSTF (U.S. Preventive Services Task Force) recommended against Psa screening for prostate cancer. That 2012 taskforce was right, in the aggregate, bean counterway, that PSA screening resulted in alot, alot of overtreatment and resultant cost without significant impact on mortality; but one huge downside is for example: there are Forum Brothers who are casualties of that failure to screen including myself. Dr. Ahlering's recent study: highlighting the consequences of that 2012 taskforce recommendation; a rise in the incidence of higher stage disease - a step backwards in the fight against prostate CA. entitled \"Unintended consequences of decreased PSA-based prostate cancer screening [2018]; was significant in the crusade against this recommendation. - in Djin's research subforum This crusade against the 2012 recommendation resulted in the USPSTF changing course. Just recently, USPSTF changed their guidance: and now recommends that for the 55-69 age group, the decision to be screened for PCa with PSA-based testing should be an individual one. I started this thread not to list the above general directives: 2012 - don't screen; 2018 - individual decision but to list the hard numbers used to arrive at these consensus statements; so you can attempt to draw your own, in part emotional, conclusions yourself. What follows are the unedited hard numbers that were used to reach the above recommendations: USPSTF described the number of harms and benefits with PSA screening, which can be quantified over a 10- to 15-year period. They estimate that if 1,000 men were offered a PSA test, 240 would screen positive, leading to positive biopsies in 100. But 20.7% to 50.4% of these men will actually have indolent disease that never grows or metastasizes, according to the evidence report. Of the 100 men with biopsy positive PCa, 80 will opt for definitive treatment with surgery or radiotherapy (RT) immediately or after a period of active surveillance (AS). Post-treatment, 50 men will experience long-term erectile dysfunction (ED) and 15 will experience long-term urinary incontinence (UI). And while 1.3 PCa deaths would be prevented over 13 yrs., five men would still die from PCa despite definitive treatment. To repeat, the main reason I started this thread is to challenge everyone to draw their own conclusions regarding the above numbers. One emotional exercise is to imagine yourself in a room of one thousand men; then imagine 240 of you would be shunted into a room to get a biopsy; and then after the biopsy, 100 of you would be told you have cancer. Remember the shock and awe of being told you have cancer. I certainly do. It was one of those John F. Kennedy was assassinated, the man on the moon, or 9/11 moments. Then after 100 of you have been told you have cancer; 21-50 are then mind tweaked - told that you really do not have clinically meaningful cancer we still do not have a good semantic word for this uncancer/precancer Gleason 3 which can not metastasize: defined and confirmed by Dr. Epstein in a study of 17k cases. Furthermore, the semantic: indolent cancer, has not solved the low acceptance rate of AS by patients in the U.S. compared to Europe and Australia. Because maybe to choose AS, you have to feel Clint Eastwood lucky? - Tangential thought: for this semantic argument, we do not need the expert molecular biologist Robert Weinberg who defined what cancer is, do not need the expert urologic pathologist, Dr. Epstein who redefined Gleason 3, in effect shrinking it into a smaller better prognosis cohort which serendipitously virtually never metastasizes and dovetails perfectly into the concept of active surveillance; an expert urologic surgeon, radiation or medical oncologist; but a dual English/Psychology expert because cancer is such an emotionally charged word with the automatic Clint Eastwood reflex to treat early and ask questions later. Or if I may: I could not help myself, my apologies: \"I know what you're thinking. Did he fire six shots or only five? Well, to tell you the truth, in all this excitement, I've kinda lost track myself. But being as this is a .44 magnum, the most powerful handgun in the world, and would blow your head clean off, you've got to ask yourself one question: \"Do I feel lucky?\" Well, do ya, punk?\u201d After the 100 of you who are told you have cancer are mind tweaked that 21-50 of you really have something else which we do not have a good term for; we are then told most of the 100 will opt for treatment and many will have ED or continence issues; but only 1 will be cured of prostate cancer and 5 will actually die of prostate cancer despite treatment. Would you want to step in that room of 1000 men and be screened? And btw; I forgot to bring up cost, time, and anxiety would you want to get on that emotional roller coaster knowing that a. only 1 of you will be cured by the interventions, b. 20-50 will be overtreated c. and 5 will die anyway despite treatment, their grieving family thinking that if only we had pulled the trigger sooner as opposed to the probable truth that either the horse had already left the barn years before primary treatment even began or conventional therapy did not work. In this exercise, I am of course ignoring many new developments in prostate cancer Psa based screening including psa density, phi score, MRI guidance, molecular tests, 2014 Gleason grading revision, Ahlering's study, among many others which lead to better guidance for who bests qualifies for biopsy, active surveillance etc. ----- which taken together in combination with greater acceptance of AS resulted in the corrected USPSTF guidance. The 2012 taskforce did not have the benefit of all of this new information in 2012. And I quote \"...recognition that active surveillance, rather than treatment, of low-risk cancers was becoming much more common\". I translate this: Just as Wall Street translates the Fed Chairman's cryptic measured imprimaturs - the U.S. has greater consumer buyin to AS in 2018 vs 12. Now that you have reached your conclusion. I now want to reveal what the answer is: according to the experts --- regarding the hard data above, in 2018; not 2012. Prostate-Specific Antigen-Based Screening for Prostate Cancer: A Systematic Evidence Review for the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30085502 Also, linked in Djin research forum. USPTF CONCLUSIONS: \"PSA screening for prostate cancer may reduce risk of prostate cancer mortality but is associated with harms including false-positive results, biopsy complications, and overdiagnosis in 20 percent to 50 percent of screen-detected prostate cancers. Early, active treatment for screen-detected prostate cancer may reduce the risk of metastatic disease, although the long-term impact of early, active treatment on prostate cancer mortality remains unclear. Active treatments for prostate cancer are frequently associated with sexual and urinary difficulties.\" Overdiagnosis = Gleason 3 semantic issue. But if Gleason 3 is cancer, which it is by molecular biology, then it is not an overdiagnosis to call it cancer; But if it does not metastasize and the only surrogate for pcsm and overall survival is distant metastasis; not bcr - then, by clinical translational research, it is not cancer. To translate, even the USPSTF considers Gleason 3 cancer; not cancer: Epstein truly is God. But what should we call it; the semantic problem and thus emotional problem. Emotional problem because if you can walk around with untreated CA, and you emotion like Clint Eastwood, you must feel lucky. But if you are walking around with e.g. family history of pca or some other risk factor, you just monitor closely and don't sweat it. And, unlike most of us prostate Ca patients, the experts use measured Fedspeak regarding screening: \"mays\" and \"unclears\" as their concluding statements; even in 2018. The emotional conclusion of patients, if I may speak for everyone, is not measured USPTFspeak: but Get screened by PSA, for the 50-69 age group with normal life expectancy, period, end of story; despite the experts above 2018 measured waffle ----- but be ever mindful of the real numbers and what you are getting yourself into including, be very mindful, of our natural emotional inclination to drastically underestimate overtreatment in the face of the word cancer. It is one of the most scary words in our language. One example how human beings are very bad emotionally at judging risk is: The car versus plane paradigm. I know the facts: flying is actually the safest mode of transportation. In fact, the odds of a plane crash are one for every 1.2 million flights, with odds of dying one in 11 million. Your chances of dying in a car accident are one in 5,000; approximately 37k deaths per year. Yet, even knowing these facts, I have a fear of flying and do not have one qualm about getting into a car. To state it another way: I can not think of another reason why AS is not more accepted, or as accepted as in Europe or Australia except for this emotional issue. Am I missing something? I believe we should be aware of this emotional skewing of the facts ---- And really we should be asking our doctors; if you were in my risk boat, not weighing in my emotional leaning/shared decision making, what would you choose. Just food, hard numbers, for thought. And caution of how emotions play into risk analysis. I am curious what the poll results of forum brothers would be regarding screening with psa for 50-69 males with normal life expectancy 1. no screening - 2012 2. maybe - 2018; actually to be fair - dubbed smarter screening; parsing risk analysis 3. screen, one size fits all/across the board screening, period end of story.",

But on the statistical clinical translational research level: 100% no metastasis to lymph nodes, 100% no lymphovascular space invasion, rare 0.03% seminal vesicle invasion, and uncommon 2% non-focal EPE is as good as you could possibly get studying 17k Radical prostatectomy with lymphadenectomy specimens at Johns Hopkins for de facto evidence of no metastatic potential. Actually, it is mind boggling serendipitous to me. E=mc2 Dr. Epstein. How did you pull that rabbit out of your hat? In part, thru several revisions over many years, 2014 was not the 1st revision, there were several Epstein revisions prior to 2014: continually reducing the Gleason 3 category into smaller and smaller cohorts of better prognosis patients. How he got to absolute zero though was serendipitous. The concept of active surveillance allows for knowledge to counter gut/emotion. And I believe another breakthru could be semantic from an English/psychology professor. I quote from a recent Epstein article: \"The lack of metastatic potential of GS6 cancer has led to the argument to remove the label cancer from this lesion. Instead some experts have suggested labeling GS6 cancer as IDLE to reduce the patient fear of cancer, which would hopefully lead to an increase in active surveillance. Several articles in the literature have listed the pros and cons of relabeling GS6 as not cancer.\" So, academic urologic pathologists proposed: IDLE (indolent lesion of epithelial origin) - by clinical translation research, 100% correct - But quite awkward if I do so say myself. And rejected by Epstein. But even if Epstein gave it his imprimatur, it never would have had a chance in hell to catch on with rank and file urologists, the minions, who would have to deliver the cryptic/awkward \"good\" news. Go explain IDLE to the average joe in 15 minutes. Good luck. And then get them on board with Active surveillance; even better luck; especially if that average Joe is Clint Eastwood. Tangent: One of the most mind tweak concepts I have come across regarding prostate cancer is the Will Rogers phenomenon. You have to google it and try to wrap your head around it --- it is truly a mind tweak, like no other; and if mentioned at all in research papers is buried as a caveat/limitation -- grade migration or some other non-eloquent set of words. Which comes into play loud and clear regarding Epstein's shrinking Gleason 3 cancer into a much better prognosis cancer; nay non-metastasizing non-cancer.",

      "Content": "In 2012, the USPSTF (U.S. Preventive Services Task Force) recommended against Psa screening for prostate cancer. That 2012 taskforce was right, in the aggregate, bean counterway, that PSA screening resulted in alot, alot of overtreatment and resultant cost without significant impact on mortality; but one huge downside is for example: there are Forum Brothers who are casualties of that failure to screen including myself. Dr. Ahlering's recent study: highlighting the consequences of that 2012 taskforce recommendation; a rise in the incidence of higher stage disease - a step backwards in the fight against prostate CA. entitled \"Unintended consequences of decreased PSA-based prostate cancer screening [2018]; was significant in the crusade against this recommendation. - in Djin's research subforum This crusade against the 2012 recommendation resulted in the USPSTF changing course. Just recently, USPSTF changed their guidance: and now recommends that for the 55-69 age group, the decision to be screened for PCa with PSA-based testing should be an individual one. I started this thread not to list the above general directives: 2012 - don't screen; 2018 - individual decision but to list the hard numbers used to arrive at these consensus statements; so you can attempt to draw your own, in part emotional, conclusions yourself. What follows are the unedited hard numbers that were used to reach the above recommendations: USPSTF described the number of harms and benefits with PSA screening, which can be quantified over a 10- to 15-year period. They estimate that if 1,000 men were offered a PSA test, 240 would screen positive, leading to positive biopsies in 100. But 20.7% to 50.4% of these men will actually have indolent disease that never grows or metastasizes, according to the evidence report. Of the 100 men with biopsy positive PCa, 80 will opt for definitive treatment with surgery or radiotherapy (RT) immediately or after a period of active surveillance (AS). Post-treatment, 50 men will experience long-term erectile dysfunction (ED) and 15 will experience long-term urinary incontinence (UI). And while 1.3 PCa deaths would be prevented over 13 yrs., five men would still die from PCa despite definitive treatment. To repeat, the main reason I started this thread is to challenge everyone to draw their own conclusions regarding the above numbers. One emotional exercise is to imagine yourself in a room of one thousand men; then imagine 240 of you would be shunted into a room to get a biopsy; and then after the biopsy, 100 of you would be told you have cancer. Remember the shock and awe of being told you have cancer. I certainly do. It was one of those John F. Kennedy was assassinated, the man on the moon, or 9/11 moments. Then after 100 of you have been told you have cancer; 21-50 are then mind tweaked - told that you really do not have clinically meaningful cancer we still do not have a good semantic word for this uncancer/precancer Gleason 3 which can not metastasize: defined and confirmed by Dr. Epstein in a study of 17k cases. Furthermore, the semantic: indolent cancer, has not solved the low acceptance rate of AS by patients in the U.S. compared to Europe and Australia. Because maybe to choose AS, you have to feel Clint Eastwood lucky? - Tangential thought: for this semantic argument, we do not need the expert molecular biologist Robert Weinberg who defined what cancer is, do not need the expert urologic pathologist, Dr. Epstein who redefined Gleason 3, in effect shrinking it into a smaller better prognosis cohort which serendipitously virtually never metastasizes and dovetails perfectly into the concept of active surveillance; an expert urologic surgeon, radiation or medical oncologist; but a dual English/Psychology expert because cancer is such an emotionally charged word with the automatic Clint Eastwood reflex to treat early and ask questions later. Or if I may: I could not help myself, my apologies: \"I know what you're thinking. Did he fire six shots or only five? Well, to tell you the truth, in all this excitement, I've kinda lost track myself. But being as this is a .44 magnum, the most powerful handgun in the world, and would blow your head clean off, you've got to ask yourself one question: \"Do I feel lucky?\" Well, do ya, punk?\u201d After the 100 of you who are told you have cancer are mind tweaked that 21-50 of you really have something else which we do not have a good term for; we are then told most of the 100 will opt for treatment and many will have ED or continence issues; but only 1 will be cured of prostate cancer and 5 will actually die of prostate cancer despite treatment. Would you want to step in that room of 1000 men and be screened? And btw; I forgot to bring up cost, time, and anxiety would you want to get on that emotional roller coaster knowing that a. only 1 of you will be cured by the interventions, b. 20-50 will be overtreated c. and 5 will die anyway despite treatment, their grieving family thinking that if only we had pulled the trigger sooner as opposed to the probable truth that either the horse had already left the barn years before primary treatment even began or conventional therapy did not work. In this exercise, I am of course ignoring many new developments in prostate cancer Psa based screening including psa density, phi score, MRI guidance, molecular tests, 2014 Gleason grading revision, Ahlering's study, among many others which lead to better guidance for who bests qualifies for biopsy, active surveillance etc. ----- which taken together in combination with greater acceptance of AS resulted in the corrected USPSTF guidance. The 2012 taskforce did not have the benefit of all of this new information in 2012. And I quote \"...recognition that active surveillance, rather than treatment, of low-risk cancers was becoming much more common\". I translate this: Just as Wall Street translates the Fed Chairman's cryptic measured imprimaturs - the U.S. has greater consumer buyin to AS in 2018 vs 12. Now that you have reached your conclusion. I now want to reveal what the answer is: according to the experts --- regarding the hard data above, in 2018; not 2012. Prostate-Specific Antigen-Based Screening for Prostate Cancer: A Systematic Evidence Review for the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30085502 Also, linked in Djin research forum. USPTF CONCLUSIONS: \"PSA screening for prostate cancer may reduce risk of prostate cancer mortality but is associated with harms including false-positive results, biopsy complications, and overdiagnosis in 20 percent to 50 percent of screen-detected prostate cancers. Early, active treatment for screen-detected prostate cancer may reduce the risk of metastatic disease, although the long-term impact of early, active treatment on prostate cancer mortality remains unclear. Active treatments for prostate cancer are frequently associated with sexual and urinary difficulties.\" Overdiagnosis = Gleason 3 semantic issue. But if Gleason 3 is cancer, which it is by molecular biology, then it is not an overdiagnosis to call it cancer; But if it does not metastasize and the only surrogate for pcsm and overall survival is distant metastasis; not bcr - then, by clinical translational research, it is not cancer. To translate, even the USPSTF considers Gleason 3 cancer; not cancer: Epstein truly is God. But what should we call it; the semantic problem and thus emotional problem. Emotional problem because if you can walk around with untreated CA, and you emotion like Clint Eastwood, you must feel lucky. But if you are walking around with e.g. family history of pca or some other risk factor, you just monitor closely and don't sweat it. And, unlike most of us prostate Ca patients, the experts use measured Fedspeak regarding screening: \"mays\" and \"unclears\" as their concluding statements; even in 2018. The emotional conclusion of patients, if I may speak for everyone, is not measured USPTFspeak: but Get screened by PSA, for the 50-69 age group with normal life expectancy, period, end of story; despite the experts above 2018 measured waffle ----- but be ever mindful of the real numbers and what you are getting yourself into including, be very mindful, of our natural emotional inclination to drastically underestimate overtreatment in the face of the word cancer. It is one of the most scary words in our language. One example how human beings are very bad emotionally at judging risk is: The car versus plane paradigm. I know the facts: flying is actually the safest mode of transportation. In fact, the odds of a plane crash are one for every 1.2 million flights, with odds of dying one in 11 million. Your chances of dying in a car accident are one in 5,000; approximately 37k deaths per year. Yet, even knowing these facts, I have a fear of flying and do not have one qualm about getting into a car. To state it another way: I can not think of another reason why AS is not more accepted, or as accepted as in Europe or Australia except for this emotional issue. Am I missing something? I believe we should be aware of this emotional skewing of the facts ---- And really we should be asking our doctors; if you were in my risk boat, not weighing in my emotional leaning/shared decision making, what would you choose. Just food, hard numbers, for thought. And caution of how emotions play into risk analysis. I am curious what the poll results of forum brothers would be regarding screening with psa for 50-69 males with normal life expectancy 1. no screening - 2012 2. maybe - 2018; actually to be fair - dubbed smarter screening; parsing risk analysis 3. screen, one size fits all/across the board screening, period end of story.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by ASAdvocate Allmo, Thanks for this detailed post. Last year, I attended a support group meeting where a veteran urologist did a slide show presenting the same facts as you did. His conclusion was that PSA testing was only saving one man per one thousand tested.. The men in the room were pretty much in an uproar, as they respected that doctor, but refused to accept the conclusion. It was a quite a meeting. I recall that everyone agreed with testing, and blamed the urologists for being too eager to rush men into surgery. The presenter assured them that AS was on dramatic recent rise, and that more options were being discussed, at least in larger practices. ASA, Regarding my question to forum brothers: I am curious what the poll results of forum brothers would be regarding screening with psa for 55-69 males with normal life expectancy. Do you agree with 1, 2, or 3? 1. no screening - 2012 USPSTF 2. maybe screen - 2018 USPSTF --- actually to be fair - dubbed smarter screening; parsing risk analysis, e.g. family history, african american, etc 3. Screen. Period. End of story. ASA - Thank you for taking the poll. You got me my answer, kind of/with caveats. The answer: Door number 3 - \"everyone agreed with testing\", but if you will allow me to take it to further emotional hyperbole, backed up by your scientific observation of \"uproar\" Your poll results stated more emotionally: - Everyone agreed with testing. Period. End of story. Clint Eastwood style. Errata: No. Not Clint Eastwood. He is calm, cool, and collected and just asks how lucky do you feel; with his one shot magnum - More like Stallone aka rocky or rambo who comes out with punches/automatic weapons ablazing/\"uproar\"; Your patient cohort for this poll, I suspect, has tremendous selection bias and lead time bias probably a much more savy, educated group; having already been diagnosed with prostate ca and able and motivated to do research, including enough to join a support group; certainly not at all comparable to average cohort of newly diagnosed, shock and awe patients, who know less to nothing, newly walking into our world: welcome to the forum: with fear of cancer and then fear of delay in treatment of cancer. The forum does a great job of re-assuring and talking many off the cliff of panic. Including myself - thank you Chuck and the forum. Stated another way: I had 15 to 30 minutes total with my urologist post delivery of the shock and awe message: you have cancer. How much could I have possibly asked, how much could I have possibly absorbed: before emotionally arriving at - treat and treat fast. ask questions later. This selection and lead time bias explains your support group's complete acceptance of the concept of active surveillance and thus their reasoned and correct objection to the experts USTFP 2012 directive and since your poll is dated 2017, I suspect even to the revised 2018 directive of \"maybe\" But what they are not taking into account is the directive is aimed at all patients, and all patients are not as aware or accepting of AS as your support group. And that acceptance is necessary in our era of shared decision making. ----- And just as you reported your veteran urologist countered: \"The presenter assured them that AS was on dramatic recent rise, and that more options were being discussed, at least in larger practices.\" The task force : countered - \"...recognition that active surveillance, rather than treatment, of low-risk cancers was becoming much more common\". The key in this whole taskforce change: is both a. the concept and refinement of the concept of active surveillance and b. patient's and for that matter doctor's emotional acceptance of active surveillance which is completely emotionally counterintuitive to our core. A. is fixed by facts/science B. is fluid and emotional ---- The B is what is causing our lag behind Europe and Australia. What everyone including your veteran urologist may not have emphasized. This change could not have happened without Dr. Epstein's - the one and only titan period of Prostate cancer grading - breakthru: E=mc2 moment of both creating a smaller better prognosis cohort of Gleason 3 patients; but furthermore creating one that surrendipitously does not metastasize - study of 17k patients. I know many of the caveats including ca heterogeneity, ca transformation, sampling error, pathologist grading error, etc.; I am sure Djin can come up with many more. but that is all baked into the active surveillance concept which is at the statistical clinical translational level; not at the light microscopic level: pathologist sampling error, or pathologist grading error, or even at the molecular biology level of tumor heterogeneity and transformation: by way of oncogenes/accelerators of psadt, tumor suppressor genes/brakes/dna repair/cell death/apoptosis, anti-immune and pro-angiogenesis mechanisms, etc. One of the huge laments on this board and by all patients is the uncertainty of all this stuff and you have to go with your gut/emotion, and thus the concept of shared decision making. But on the statistical clinical translational research level: 100% no metastasis to lymph nodes, 100% no lymphovascular space invasion, rare 0.03% seminal vesicle invasion, and uncommon 2% non-focal EPE is as good as you could possibly get studying 17k Radical prostatectomy with lymphadenectomy specimens at Johns Hopkins for de facto evidence of no metastatic potential. Actually, it is mind boggling serendipitous to me. E=mc2 Dr. Epstein. How did you pull that rabbit out of your hat? In part, thru several revisions over many years, 2014 was not the 1st revision, there were several Epstein revisions prior to 2014: continually reducing the Gleason 3 category into smaller and smaller cohorts of better prognosis patients. How he got to absolute zero though was serendipitous. The concept of active surveillance allows for knowledge to counter gut/emotion. And I believe another breakthru could be semantic from an English/psychology professor. I quote from a recent Epstein article: \"The lack of metastatic potential of GS6 cancer has led to the argument to remove the label cancer from this lesion. Instead some experts have suggested labeling GS6 cancer as IDLE to reduce the patient fear of cancer, which would hopefully lead to an increase in active surveillance. Several articles in the literature have listed the pros and cons of relabeling GS6 as not cancer.\" So, academic urologic pathologists proposed: IDLE (indolent lesion of epithelial origin) - by clinical translation research, 100% correct - But quite awkward if I do so say myself. And rejected by Epstein. But even if Epstein gave it his imprimatur, it never would have had a chance in hell to catch on with rank and file urologists, the minions, who would have to deliver the cryptic/awkward \"good\" news. Go explain IDLE to the average joe in 15 minutes. Good luck. And then get them on board with Active surveillance; even better luck; especially if that average Joe is Clint Eastwood. Tangent: One of the most mind tweak concepts I have come across regarding prostate cancer is the Will Rogers phenomenon. You have to google it and try to wrap your head around it --- it is truly a mind tweak, like no other; and if mentioned at all in research papers is buried as a caveat/limitation -- grade migration or some other non-eloquent set of words. Which comes into play loud and clear regarding Epstein's shrinking Gleason 3 cancer into a much better prognosis cancer; nay non-metastasizing non-cancer.",

      "Content": "Djin: All of your points are well taken and I agree with them. Especially, and I quote you: the solution to overtreatment is simply to stop overtreatment with Active Surveillance, not to stop screening. But there were many problems to AS in 2012 including but not limited to, it predated Epstein's shrinking Gleason 3 to a better prognosis cohort that does not metastasize, among other subsequent refinements on the science side; and as pointed out by the taskforce, lack of buyin by patients and doctors for Active Surveillance on the consumer side. Barring the 10-15 year time period limitation, (btw, not Allmo's limitation, this is the taskforce/literature limitation) which is admittedly too short for prostate cancer; but come on, be realistic that is largely what the literature consists of; -- furthermore, you are going to have to wait a long time for prospective followup with the new screen parsing and Epstein regrading of 3 in 2014, way beyond the lifetime of most reading this, to get 20-25 year data; so that is a valid criticism of the data the taskforce used to inform its directives; but an unrealistic criticism: there will be no 20-25 yr old data for a long time - Let alone in 20-25 years, we are going to be in a new science fiction world of prostate cancer directed therapy at the molecular level which will cure cancer as opposed to the blind shotgun approach of for example RT. And last - of course positive DRE = higher stage >/= pT2 largely taking it out of AS; clinicalT2a exceptions exist for AS. otherwise all of your caveats and nuances are baked into the beauty/science of Active Surveillance as the solution to the 2012 guidance against screening with Psa - AS will be the subject of continued research and refinement and thus only get more perfect, marginally and AS will continue to have increasing acceptance by USA doctors, softened by \"shared decision making\", with greater acceptance by patients ---- Acceptance rates in US: from a low of 6.7% in the years from 1990 to 2009, to 40.4% in the period 2010 to 2013; but AS at 40% in 2013 still lags behind the frontrunners/leaders Europe and Australia - their acceptance rates are much higher. In part because, they have less patient advocacy, less shared decision making, emotional stuff to deal with. There doctors can just follow the hard facts including not doing standard of care - the latter a legal concept in the U.S. which handcuffs doctors, even the experts into doing what the herd does. Admittedly the herd is right in the vast majority of instances; but when a groundbreaking advance occurs such as ultrasensitive imaging especially psma based imaging; there is no clinical translational data to to know for sure for the foreseeable future: for consensus/standard of care directives to be made; and in Europe and Australia, patients more readily just trust their doctors. There are pros and cons to both systems. You should just be aware of the differences. Tangential thought: Europe, Asia, and Australia lead the USA in other prostate Ca mind tweak concepts, which run against longstanding conventional concepts, besides AS. This includes the mentioned above ultrasensitive imaging technologies; but also one of its major corollaries directed therapies, in general, and salvage surgery in particular; and active surveillance in the bcr phase of the disease for select patients who have low risk bcr: including low detectable but stable bcr and late to bcr, low psa velocity, low Grade group and stage patients. Both these future mind tweak concepts which have relevance in the bcr stage of disease: challenge us for a word for recurrent stage 4 ca that can be treated with non-systemic/directed therapy in combination with systemic therapy, and probably eventually with delayed and eventually without standard of care systemic therapy; for a select subset of patients; from indolent bcr to prostate bed only recurrence to pelvic and immediately extrapelvic lymph node recurrence to oligometastatic recurrent ca including oligometastases to bone. Basal cell carcinoma of the skin will not inform us; nor will ductal carcinoma in situ of the breast inform us; nor will papillary carcinoma of the thyroid inform us ---- all peculiar forms of low end cancer for different reasons which do not completely fit low volume, low psa, low molecular score, Gleason 3 prostate biopsy cancer or indolent bcr or prostate bed only recurrence. The bcr recurrent phase: another shock and awe that I myself am facing/heading for. I am at 0.026 -- with beyond psa anxiety. I better take Pom-T, exercise, lose weight, cholesterol and glucose lower, etc. etc. and pray. The only things in my control at this point. lol. This/these concepts are and will be mind tweaks/counterintuitive even to doctors. Doctor's are emotional beings, also, and were trained as a first, second, and third approximation -- the best treatment of cancer, except for prevention, is treat early, end of story. trained that in the U.S., the only treatment is standard of care, end of story, informed by our legal malpractice system; even if you know your European and Australian counterparts are pushing the facts/frontiers forward in front of you. And for stage 4 disease: treat systemically. end of story. No, I need to correct myself; there is a well accepted exception to the above in pca: stage 4 prostate bed only recurrence post RP: standard of care is salvage RT; except that at the low psa levels required for benefit, with our standard of care conventional CT and bone scan, we are blind as to where the recurrence really is, including whether or not it is really confined to the prostate bed --- the new ultrasensitive imaging technologies open the blinders, at least in the 0.2 to 10-20 range where conventional studies, bone and CT scan, could not. Furthermore we may really be curing nothing with salvage RT in low risk patients (uncancer/precancer and even benign tissue), but admittedly resetting the psa clock back to zero in the majority - Up to 70% for low risk patients, informed by MSK nomogram. And several current large retrospective studies coming out of Italy, some in conjunction with USA including Mayo clinic, showing that after substratifying by risk this lowest risk 70% cured by salvage RT really are not benefitted at all, except for setting the psa clock back to zero. Active surveillance was a hard sell even to doctors. Just as directed therapies for early recurrence which are coming are going to be hard sells; because it flies in the face of conventional oncologic theory. But prostate ca is different. And ultrasensitive imaging will reveal the natural pattern of spread of the disease in the 0.2 to 10-20 psa range which was up until now hidden. It will be shown to be much more stepwise than almost any cancer known except basal cell carcinoma and papillary carcinoma of the thyroid. ----- In summary, the guidance changed for 3 reasons, in my opinion: 1. Acceptance rate of active surveillance increased 2. AS science improved 3. Ahlering research that lack of screening resulted in actual theoretic harm: stage migration 4. cynically, political pressure - uproar from the masses. Not. USPTF were a scientific body despite the Federal mandate and thus title. But correct me, if I am wrong.",

      "Content": "In 2012, the USPSTF (U.S. Preventive Services Task Force) recommended against Psa screening for prostate cancer. That 2012 taskforce was right, in the aggregate, bean counterway, that PSA screening resulted in alot, alot of overtreatment and resultant cost without significant impact on mortality; but one huge downside is for example: there are Forum Brothers who are casualties of that failure to screen including myself. Dr. Ahlering's recent study: highlighting the consequences of that 2012 taskforce recommendation; a rise in the incidence of higher stage disease - a step backwards in the fight against prostate CA. entitled \"Unintended consequences of decreased PSA-based prostate cancer screening [2018]; was significant in the crusade against this recommendation. - in Djin's research subforum This crusade against the 2012 recommendation resulted in the USPSTF changing course. Just recently, USPSTF changed their guidance: and now recommends that for the 55-69 age group, the decision to be screened for PCa with PSA-based testing should be an individual one. I started this thread not to list the above general directives: 2012 - don't screen; 2018 - individual decision but to list the hard numbers used to arrive at these consensus statements; so you can attempt to draw your own, in part emotional, conclusions yourself. What follows are the unedited hard numbers that were used to reach the above recommendations: USPSTF described the number of harms and benefits with PSA screening, which can be quantified over a 10- to 15-year period. They estimate that if 1,000 men were offered a PSA test, 240 would screen positive, leading to positive biopsies in 100. But 20.7% to 50.4% of these men will actually have indolent disease that never grows or metastasizes, according to the evidence report. Of the 100 men with biopsy positive PCa, 80 will opt for definitive treatment with surgery or radiotherapy (RT) immediately or after a period of active surveillance (AS). Post-treatment, 50 men will experience long-term erectile dysfunction (ED) and 15 will experience long-term urinary incontinence (UI). And while 1.3 PCa deaths would be prevented over 13 yrs., five men would still die from PCa despite definitive treatment. To repeat, the main reason I started this thread is to challenge everyone to draw their own conclusions regarding the above numbers. One emotional exercise is to imagine yourself in a room of one thousand men; then imagine 240 of you would be shunted into a room to get a biopsy; and then after the biopsy, 100 of you would be told you have cancer. Remember the shock and awe of being told you have cancer. I certainly do. It was one of those John F. Kennedy was assassinated, the man on the moon, or 9/11 moments. Then after 100 of you have been told you have cancer; 21-50 are then mind tweaked - told that you really do not have clinically meaningful cancer we still do not have a good semantic word for this uncancer/precancer Gleason 3 which can not metastasize: defined and confirmed by Dr. Epstein in a study of 17k cases. Furthermore, the semantic: indolent cancer, has not solved the low acceptance rate of AS by patients in the U.S. compared to Europe and Australia. Because maybe to choose AS, you have to feel Clint Eastwood lucky? - Tangential thought: for this semantic argument, we do not need the expert molecular biologist Robert Weinberg who defined what cancer is, do not need the expert urologic pathologist, Dr. Epstein who redefined Gleason 3, in effect shrinking it into a smaller better prognosis cohort which serendipitously virtually never metastasizes and dovetails perfectly into the concept of active surveillance; an expert urologic surgeon, radiation or medical oncologist; but a dual English/Psychology expert because cancer is such an emotionally charged word with the automatic Clint Eastwood reflex to treat early and ask questions later. Or if I may: I could not help myself, my apologies: \"I know what you're thinking. Did he fire six shots or only five? Well, to tell you the truth, in all this excitement, I've kinda lost track myself. But being as this is a .44 magnum, the most powerful handgun in the world, and would blow your head clean off, you've got to ask yourself one question: \"Do I feel lucky?\" Well, do ya, punk?\u201d After the 100 of you who are told you have cancer are mind tweaked that 21-50 of you really have something else which we do not have a good term for; we are then told most of the 100 will opt for treatment and many will have ED or continence issues; but only 1 will be cured of prostate cancer and 5 will actually die of prostate cancer despite treatment. Would you want to step in that room of 1000 men and be screened? And btw; I forgot to bring up cost, time, and anxiety would you want to get on that emotional roller coaster knowing that a. only 1 of you will be cured by the interventions, b. 20-50 will be overtreated c. and 5 will die anyway despite treatment, their grieving family thinking that if only we had pulled the trigger sooner as opposed to the probable truth that either the horse had already left the barn years before primary treatment even began or conventional therapy did not work. In this exercise, I am of course ignoring many new developments in prostate cancer Psa based screening including psa density, phi score, MRI guidance, molecular tests, 2014 Gleason grading revision, Ahlering's study, among many others which lead to better guidance for who bests qualifies for biopsy, active surveillance etc. ----- which taken together in combination with greater acceptance of AS resulted in the corrected USPSTF guidance. The 2012 taskforce did not have the benefit of all of this new information in 2012. And I quote \"...recognition that active surveillance, rather than treatment, of low-risk cancers was becoming much more common\". I translate this: Just as Wall Street translates the Fed Chairman's cryptic measured imprimaturs - the U.S. has greater consumer buyin to AS in 2018 vs 12. Now that you have reached your conclusion. I now want to reveal what the answer is: according to the experts --- regarding the hard data above, in 2018; not 2012. Prostate-Specific Antigen-Based Screening for Prostate Cancer: A Systematic Evidence Review for the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30085502 Also, linked in Djin research forum. USPTF CONCLUSIONS: \"PSA screening for prostate cancer may reduce risk of prostate cancer mortality but is associated with harms including false-positive results, biopsy complications, and overdiagnosis in 20 percent to 50 percent of screen-detected prostate cancers. Early, active treatment for screen-detected prostate cancer may reduce the risk of metastatic disease, although the long-term impact of early, active treatment on prostate cancer mortality remains unclear. Active treatments for prostate cancer are frequently associated with sexual and urinary difficulties.\" Overdiagnosis = Gleason 3 semantic issue. But if Gleason 3 is cancer, which it is by molecular biology, then it is not an overdiagnosis to call it cancer; But if it does not metastasize and the only surrogate for pcsm and overall survival is distant metastasis; not bcr - then, by clinical translational research, it is not cancer. To translate, even the USPSTF considers Gleason 3 cancer; not cancer: Epstein truly is God. But what should we call it; the semantic problem and thus emotional problem. Emotional problem because if you can walk around with untreated CA, and you emotion like Clint Eastwood, you must feel lucky. But if you are walking around with e.g. family history of pca or some other risk factor, you just monitor closely and don't sweat it. And, unlike most of us prostate Ca patients, the experts use measured Fedspeak regarding screening: \"mays\" and \"unclears\" as their concluding statements; even in 2018. The emotional conclusion of patients, if I may speak for everyone, is not measured USPTFspeak: but Get screened by PSA, for the 50-69 age group with normal life expectancy, period, end of story; despite the experts above 2018 measured waffle ----- but be ever mindful of the real numbers and what you are getting yourself into including, be very mindful, of our natural emotional inclination to drastically underestimate overtreatment in the face of the word cancer. It is one of the most scary words in our language. One example how human beings are very bad emotionally at judging risk is: The car versus plane paradigm. I know the facts: flying is actually the safest mode of transportation. In fact, the odds of a plane crash are one for every 1.2 million flights, with odds of dying one in 11 million. Your chances of dying in a car accident are one in 5,000; approximately 37k deaths per year. Yet, even knowing these facts, I have a fear of flying and do not have one qualm about getting into a car. To state it another way: I can not think of another reason why AS is not more accepted, or as accepted as in Europe or Australia except for this emotional issue. Am I missing something? I believe we should be aware of this emotional skewing of the facts ---- And really we should be asking our doctors; if you were in my risk boat, not weighing in my emotional leaning/shared decision making, what would you choose. Just food, hard numbers, for thought. And caution of how emotions play into risk analysis. I am curious what the poll results of forum brothers would be regarding screening with psa for 50-69 males with normal life expectancy 1. no screening - 2012 2. maybe - 2018; actually to be fair - dubbed smarter screening; parsing risk analysis 3. screen, one size fits all/across the board screening, period end of story.",

That 2012 taskforce was right, in the aggregate, bean counterway, that PSA screening resulted in alot, alot of overtreatment and resultant cost without significant impact on mortality; but one huge downside is for example: there are Forum Brothers who are casualties of that failure to screen including myself. Dr. Ahlering's recent study: highlighting the consequences of that 2012 taskforce recommendation; a rise in the incidence of higher stage disease - a step backwards in the fight against prostate CA. entitled \"Unintended consequences of decreased PSA-based prostate cancer screening [2018]; was significant in the crusade against this recommendation. - in Djin's research subforum This crusade against the 2012 recommendation resulted in the USPSTF changing course. Just recently, USPSTF changed their guidance: and now recommends that for the 55-69 age group, the decision to be screened for PCa with PSA-based testing should be an individual one. I started this thread not to list the above general directives: 2012 - don't screen; 2018 - individual decision but to list the hard numbers used to arrive at these consensus statements; so you can attempt to draw your own, in part emotional, conclusions yourself. What follows are the unedited hard numbers that were used to reach the above recommendations: USPSTF described the number of harms and benefits with PSA screening, which can be quantified over a 10- to 15-year period. They estimate that if 1,000 men were offered a PSA test, 240 would screen positive, leading to positive biopsies in 100. But 20.7% to 50.4% of these men will actually have indolent disease that never grows or metastasizes, according to the evidence report. Of the 100 men with biopsy positive PCa, 80 will opt for definitive treatment with surgery or radiotherapy (RT) immediately or after a period of active surveillance (AS). Post-treatment, 50 men will experience long-term erectile dysfunction (ED) and 15 will experience long-term urinary incontinence (UI). And while 1.3 PCa deaths would be prevented over 13 yrs., five men would still die from PCa despite definitive treatment. To repeat, the main reason I started this thread is to challenge everyone to draw their own conclusions regarding the above numbers. One emotional exercise is to imagine yourself in a room of one thousand men; then imagine 240 of you would be shunted into a room to get a biopsy; and then after the biopsy, 100 of you would be told you have cancer. Remember the shock and awe of being told you have cancer. I certainly do. It was one of those John F. Kennedy was assassinated, the man on the moon, or 9/11 moments. Then after 100 of you have been told you have cancer; 21-50 are then mind tweaked - told that you really do not have clinically meaningful cancer we still do not have a good semantic word for this uncancer/precancer Gleason 3 which can not metastasize: defined and confirmed by Dr. Epstein in a study of 17k cases. Furthermore, the semantic: indolent cancer, has not solved the low acceptance rate of AS by patients in the U.S. compared to Europe and Australia. Because maybe to choose AS, you have to feel Clint Eastwood lucky? - Tangential thought: for this semantic argument, we do not need the expert molecular biologist Robert Weinberg who defined what cancer is, do not need the expert urologic pathologist, Dr. Epstein who redefined Gleason 3, in effect shrinking it into a smaller better prognosis cohort which serendipitously virtually never metastasizes and dovetails perfectly into the concept of active surveillance; an expert urologic surgeon, radiation or medical oncologist; but a dual English/Psychology expert because cancer is such an emotionally charged word with the automatic Clint Eastwood reflex to treat early and ask questions later. Or if I may: I could not help myself, my apologies: \"I know what you're thinking. Did he fire six shots or only five? Well, to tell you the truth, in all this excitement, I've kinda lost track myself. But being as this is a .44 magnum, the most powerful handgun in the world, and would blow your head clean off, you've got to ask yourself one question: \"Do I feel lucky?\" Well, do ya, punk?\u201d After the 100 of you who are told you have cancer are mind tweaked that 21-50 of you really have something else which we do not have a good term for; we are then told most of the 100 will opt for treatment and many will have ED or continence issues; but only 1 will be cured of prostate cancer and 5 will actually die of prostate cancer despite treatment. Would you want to step in that room of 1000 men and be screened? And btw; I forgot to bring up cost, time, and anxiety would you want to get on that emotional roller coaster knowing that a. only 1 of you will be cured by the interventions, b. 20-50 will be overtreated c. and 5 will die anyway despite treatment, their grieving family thinking that if only we had pulled the trigger sooner as opposed to the probable truth that either the horse had already left the barn years before primary treatment even began or conventional therapy did not work. In this exercise, I am of course ignoring many new developments in prostate cancer Psa based screening including psa density, phi score, MRI guidance, molecular tests, 2014 Gleason grading revision, Ahlering's study, among many others which lead to better guidance for who bests qualifies for biopsy, active surveillance etc. ----- which taken together in combination with greater acceptance of AS resulted in the corrected USPSTF guidance. The 2012 taskforce did not have the benefit of all of this new information in 2012. And I quote \"...recognition that active surveillance, rather than treatment, of low-risk cancers was becoming much more common\". I translate this: Just as Wall Street translates the Fed Chairman's cryptic measured imprimaturs - the U.S. has greater consumer buyin to AS in 2018 vs 12. Now that you have reached your conclusion. I now want to reveal what the answer is: according to the experts --- regarding the hard data above, in 2018; not 2012. Prostate-Specific Antigen-Based Screening for Prostate Cancer: A Systematic Evidence Review for the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30085502 Also, linked in Djin research forum. USPTF CONCLUSIONS: \"PSA screening for prostate cancer may reduce risk of prostate cancer mortality but is associated with harms including false-positive results, biopsy complications, and overdiagnosis in 20 percent to 50 percent of screen-detected prostate cancers. Early, active treatment for screen-detected prostate cancer may reduce the risk of metastatic disease, although the long-term impact of early, active treatment on prostate cancer mortality remains unclear. Active treatments for prostate cancer are frequently associated with sexual and urinary difficulties.\" Overdiagnosis = Gleason 3 semantic issue. But if Gleason 3 is cancer, which it is by molecular biology, then it is not an overdiagnosis to call it cancer; But if it does not metastasize and the only surrogate for pcsm and overall survival is distant metastasis; not bcr - then, by clinical translational research, it is not cancer. To translate, even the USPSTF considers Gleason 3 cancer; not cancer: Epstein truly is God. But what should we call it; the semantic problem and thus emotional problem. Emotional problem because if you can walk around with untreated CA, and you emotion like Clint Eastwood, you must feel lucky. But if you are walking around with e.g. family history of pca or some other risk factor, you just monitor closely and don't sweat it. And, unlike most of us prostate Ca patients, the experts use measured Fedspeak regarding screening: \"mays\" and \"unclears\" as their concluding statements; even in 2018. The emotional conclusion of patients, if I may speak for everyone, is not measured USPTFspeak: but Get screened by PSA, for the 50-69 age group with normal life expectancy, period, end of story; despite the experts above 2018 measured waffle ----- but be ever mindful of the real numbers and what you are getting yourself into including, be very mindful, of our natural emotional inclination to drastically underestimate overtreatment in the face of the word cancer. It is one of the most scary words in our language. One example how human beings are very bad emotionally at judging risk is: The car versus plane paradigm. I know the facts: flying is actually the safest mode of transportation. In fact, the odds of a plane crash are one for every 1.2 million flights, with odds of dying one in 11 million. Your chances of dying in a car accident are one in 5,000; approximately 37k deaths per year. Yet, even knowing these facts, I have a fear of flying and do not have one qualm about getting into a car. To state it another way: I can not think of another reason why AS is not more accepted, or as accepted as in Europe or Australia except for this emotional issue. Am I missing something? I believe we should be aware of this emotional skewing of the facts ---- And really we should be asking our doctors; if you were in my risk boat, not weighing in my emotional leaning/shared decision making, what would you choose. Just food, hard numbers, for thought. And caution of how emotions play into risk analysis. I am curious what the poll results of forum brothers would be regarding screening with psa for 50-69 males with normal life expectancy 1. no screening - 2012 2. maybe - 2018; actually to be fair - dubbed smarter screening; parsing risk analysis 3. screen, one size fits all/across the board screening, period end of story.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by ASAdvocate Allmo, Thanks for this detailed post. Last year, I attended a support group meeting where a veteran urologist did a slide show presenting the same facts as you did. His conclusion was that PSA testing was only saving one man per one thousand tested.. The men in the room were pretty much in an uproar, as they respected that doctor, but refused to accept the conclusion. It was a quite a meeting. I recall that everyone agreed with testing, and blamed the urologists for being too eager to rush men into surgery. The presenter assured them that AS was on dramatic recent rise, and that more options were being discussed, at least in larger practices. ASA, Regarding my question to forum brothers: I am curious what the poll results of forum brothers would be regarding screening with psa for 55-69 males with normal life expectancy. Do you agree with 1, 2, or 3? 1. no screening - 2012 USPSTF 2. maybe screen - 2018 USPSTF --- actually to be fair - dubbed smarter screening; parsing risk analysis, e.g. family history, african american, etc 3. Screen. Period. End of story. ASA - Thank you for taking the poll. You got me my answer, kind of/with caveats. The answer: Door number 3 - \"everyone agreed with testing\", but if you will allow me to take it to further emotional hyperbole, backed up by your scientific observation of \"uproar\" Your poll results stated more emotionally: - Everyone agreed with testing. Period. End of story. Clint Eastwood style. Errata: No. Not Clint Eastwood. He is calm, cool, and collected and just asks how lucky do you feel; with his one shot magnum - More like Stallone aka rocky or rambo who comes out with punches/automatic weapons ablazing/\"uproar\"; Your patient cohort for this poll, I suspect, has tremendous selection bias and lead time bias probably a much more savy, educated group; having already been diagnosed with prostate ca and able and motivated to do research, including enough to join a support group; certainly not at all comparable to average cohort of newly diagnosed, shock and awe patients, who know less to nothing, newly walking into our world: welcome to the forum: with fear of cancer and then fear of delay in treatment of cancer. The forum does a great job of re-assuring and talking many off the cliff of panic. Including myself - thank you Chuck and the forum. Stated another way: I had 15 to 30 minutes total with my urologist post delivery of the shock and awe message: you have cancer. How much could I have possibly asked, how much could I have possibly absorbed: before emotionally arriving at - treat and treat fast. ask questions later. This selection and lead time bias explains your support group's complete acceptance of the concept of active surveillance and thus their reasoned and correct objection to the experts USTFP 2012 directive and since your poll is dated 2017, I suspect even to the revised 2018 directive of \"maybe\" But what they are not taking into account is the directive is aimed at all patients, and all patients are not as aware or accepting of AS as your support group. And that acceptance is necessary in our era of shared decision making. ----- And just as you reported your veteran urologist countered: \"The presenter assured them that AS was on dramatic recent rise, and that more options were being discussed, at least in larger practices.\" The task force : countered - \"...recognition that active surveillance, rather than treatment, of low-risk cancers was becoming much more common\". The key in this whole taskforce change: is both a. the concept and refinement of the concept of active surveillance and b. patient's and for that matter doctor's emotional acceptance of active surveillance which is completely emotionally counterintuitive to our core. A. is fixed by facts/science B. is fluid and emotional ---- The B is what is causing our lag behind Europe and Australia. What everyone including your veteran urologist may not have emphasized. This change could not have happened without Dr. Epstein's - the one and only titan period of Prostate cancer grading - breakthru: E=mc2 moment of both creating a smaller better prognosis cohort of Gleason 3 patients; but furthermore creating one that surrendipitously does not metastasize - study of 17k patients. I know many of the caveats including ca heterogeneity, ca transformation, sampling error, pathologist grading error, etc.; I am sure Djin can come up with many more. but that is all baked into the active surveillance concept which is at the statistical clinical translational level; not at the light microscopic level: pathologist sampling error, or pathologist grading error, or even at the molecular biology level of tumor heterogeneity and transformation: by way of oncogenes/accelerators of psadt, tumor suppressor genes/brakes/dna repair/cell death/apoptosis, anti-immune and pro-angiogenesis mechanisms, etc. One of the huge laments on this board and by all patients is the uncertainty of all this stuff and you have to go with your gut/emotion, and thus the concept of shared decision making. But on the statistical clinical translational research level: 100% no metastasis to lymph nodes, 100% no lymphovascular space invasion, rare 0.03% seminal vesicle invasion, and uncommon 2% non-focal EPE is as good as you could possibly get studying 17k Radical prostatectomy with lymphadenectomy specimens at Johns Hopkins for de facto evidence of no metastatic potential. Actually, it is mind boggling serendipitous to me. E=mc2 Dr. Epstein. How did you pull that rabbit out of your hat? In part, thru several revisions over many years, 2014 was not the 1st revision, there were several Epstein revisions prior to 2014: continually reducing the Gleason 3 category into smaller and smaller cohorts of better prognosis patients. How he got to absolute zero though was serendipitous. The concept of active surveillance allows for knowledge to counter gut/emotion. And I believe another breakthru could be semantic from an English/psychology professor. I quote from a recent Epstein article: \"The lack of metastatic potential of GS6 cancer has led to the argument to remove the label cancer from this lesion. Instead some experts have suggested labeling GS6 cancer as IDLE to reduce the patient fear of cancer, which would hopefully lead to an increase in active surveillance. Several articles in the literature have listed the pros and cons of relabeling GS6 as not cancer.\" So, academic urologic pathologists proposed: IDLE (indolent lesion of epithelial origin) - by clinical translation research, 100% correct - But quite awkward if I do so say myself. And rejected by Epstein. But even if Epstein gave it his imprimatur, it never would have had a chance in hell to catch on with rank and file urologists, the minions, who would have to deliver the cryptic/awkward \"good\" news. Go explain IDLE to the average joe in 15 minutes. Good luck. And then get them on board with Active surveillance; even better luck; especially if that average Joe is Clint Eastwood. Tangent: One of the most mind tweak concepts I have come across regarding prostate cancer is the Will Rogers phenomenon. You have to google it and try to wrap your head around it --- it is truly a mind tweak, like no other; and if mentioned at all in research papers is buried as a caveat/limitation -- grade migration or some other non-eloquent set of words. Which comes into play loud and clear regarding Epstein's shrinking Gleason 3 cancer into a much better prognosis cancer; nay non-metastasizing non-cancer.",

      "Content": "Djin: All of your points are well taken and I agree with them. Especially, and I quote you: the solution to overtreatment is simply to stop overtreatment with Active Surveillance, not to stop screening. But there were many problems to AS in 2012 including but not limited to, it predated Epstein's shrinking Gleason 3 to a better prognosis cohort that does not metastasize, among other subsequent refinements on the science side; and as pointed out by the taskforce, lack of buyin by patients and doctors for Active Surveillance on the consumer side. Barring the 10-15 year time period limitation, (btw, not Allmo's limitation, this is the taskforce/literature limitation) which is admittedly too short for prostate cancer; but come on, be realistic that is largely what the literature consists of; -- furthermore, you are going to have to wait a long time for prospective followup with the new screen parsing and Epstein regrading of 3 in 2014, way beyond the lifetime of most reading this, to get 20-25 year data; so that is a valid criticism of the data the taskforce used to inform its directives; but an unrealistic criticism: there will be no 20-25 yr old data for a long time - Let alone in 20-25 years, we are going to be in a new science fiction world of prostate cancer directed therapy at the molecular level which will cure cancer as opposed to the blind shotgun approach of for example RT. And last - of course positive DRE = higher stage >/= pT2 largely taking it out of AS; clinicalT2a exceptions exist for AS. otherwise all of your caveats and nuances are baked into the beauty/science of Active Surveillance as the solution to the 2012 guidance against screening with Psa - AS will be the subject of continued research and refinement and thus only get more perfect, marginally and AS will continue to have increasing acceptance by USA doctors, softened by \"shared decision making\", with greater acceptance by patients ---- Acceptance rates in US: from a low of 6.7% in the years from 1990 to 2009, to 40.4% in the period 2010 to 2013; but AS at 40% in 2013 still lags behind the frontrunners/leaders Europe and Australia - their acceptance rates are much higher. In part because, they have less patient advocacy, less shared decision making, emotional stuff to deal with. There doctors can just follow the hard facts including not doing standard of care - the latter a legal concept in the U.S. which handcuffs doctors, even the experts into doing what the herd does. Admittedly the herd is right in the vast majority of instances; but when a groundbreaking advance occurs such as ultrasensitive imaging especially psma based imaging; there is no clinical translational data to to know for sure for the foreseeable future: for consensus/standard of care directives to be made; and in Europe and Australia, patients more readily just trust their doctors. There are pros and cons to both systems. You should just be aware of the differences. Tangential thought: Europe, Asia, and Australia lead the USA in other prostate Ca mind tweak concepts, which run against longstanding conventional concepts, besides AS. This includes the mentioned above ultrasensitive imaging technologies; but also one of its major corollaries directed therapies, in general, and salvage surgery in particular; and active surveillance in the bcr phase of the disease for select patients who have low risk bcr: including low detectable but stable bcr and late to bcr, low psa velocity, low Grade group and stage patients. Both these future mind tweak concepts which have relevance in the bcr stage of disease: challenge us for a word for recurrent stage 4 ca that can be treated with non-systemic/directed therapy in combination with systemic therapy, and probably eventually with delayed and eventually without standard of care systemic therapy; for a select subset of patients; from indolent bcr to prostate bed only recurrence to pelvic and immediately extrapelvic lymph node recurrence to oligometastatic recurrent ca including oligometastases to bone. Basal cell carcinoma of the skin will not inform us; nor will ductal carcinoma in situ of the breast inform us; nor will papillary carcinoma of the thyroid inform us ---- all peculiar forms of low end cancer for different reasons which do not completely fit low volume, low psa, low molecular score, Gleason 3 prostate biopsy cancer or indolent bcr or prostate bed only recurrence. The bcr recurrent phase: another shock and awe that I myself am facing/heading for. I am at 0.026 -- with beyond psa anxiety. I better take Pom-T, exercise, lose weight, cholesterol and glucose lower, etc. etc. and pray. The only things in my control at this point. lol. This/these concepts are and will be mind tweaks/counterintuitive even to doctors. Doctor's are emotional beings, also, and were trained as a first, second, and third approximation -- the best treatment of cancer, except for prevention, is treat early, end of story. trained that in the U.S., the only treatment is standard of care, end of story, informed by our legal malpractice system; even if you know your European and Australian counterparts are pushing the facts/frontiers forward in front of you. And for stage 4 disease: treat systemically. end of story. No, I need to correct myself; there is a well accepted exception to the above in pca: stage 4 prostate bed only recurrence post RP: standard of care is salvage RT; except that at the low psa levels required for benefit, with our standard of care conventional CT and bone scan, we are blind as to where the recurrence really is, including whether or not it is really confined to the prostate bed --- the new ultrasensitive imaging technologies open the blinders, at least in the 0.2 to 10-20 range where conventional studies, bone and CT scan, could not. Furthermore we may really be curing nothing with salvage RT in low risk patients (uncancer/precancer and even benign tissue), but admittedly resetting the psa clock back to zero in the majority - Up to 70% for low risk patients, informed by MSK nomogram. And several current large retrospective studies coming out of Italy, some in conjunction with USA including Mayo clinic, showing that after substratifying by risk this lowest risk 70% cured by salvage RT really are not benefitted at all, except for setting the psa clock back to zero. Active surveillance was a hard sell even to doctors. Just as directed therapies for early recurrence which are coming are going to be hard sells; because it flies in the face of conventional oncologic theory. But prostate ca is different. And ultrasensitive imaging will reveal the natural pattern of spread of the disease in the 0.2 to 10-20 psa range which was up until now hidden. It will be shown to be much more stepwise than almost any cancer known except basal cell carcinoma and papillary carcinoma of the thyroid. ----- In summary, the guidance changed for 3 reasons, in my opinion: 1. Acceptance rate of active surveillance increased 2. AS science improved 3. Ahlering research that lack of screening resulted in actual theoretic harm: stage migration 4. cynically, political pressure - uproar from the masses. Not. USPTF were a scientific body despite the Federal mandate and thus title. But correct me, if I am wrong.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by ASAdvocate Allmo, Thanks for this detailed post. Last year, I attended a support group meeting where a veteran urologist did a slide show presenting the same facts as you did. His conclusion was that PSA testing was only saving one man per one thousand tested.. The men in the room were pretty much in an uproar, as they respected that doctor, but refused to accept the conclusion. It was a quite a meeting. I recall that everyone agreed with testing, and blamed the urologists for being too eager to rush men into surgery. The presenter assured them that AS was on dramatic recent rise, and that more options were being discussed, at least in larger practices. ASA, Regarding my question to forum brothers: I am curious what the poll results of forum brothers would be regarding screening with psa for 55-69 males with normal life expectancy. Do you agree with 1, 2, or 3? 1. no screening - 2012 USPSTF 2. maybe screen - 2018 USPSTF --- actually to be fair - dubbed smarter screening; parsing risk analysis, e.g. family history, african american, etc 3. Screen. Period. End of story. ASA - Thank you for taking the poll. You got me my answer, kind of/with caveats. The answer: Door number 3 - \"everyone agreed with testing\", but if you will allow me to take it to further emotional hyperbole, backed up by your scientific observation of \"uproar\" Your poll results stated more emotionally: - Everyone agreed with testing. Period. End of story. Clint Eastwood style. Errata: No. Not Clint Eastwood. He is calm, cool, and collected and just asks how lucky do you feel; with his one shot magnum - More like Stallone aka rocky or rambo who comes out with punches/automatic weapons ablazing/\"uproar\"; Your patient cohort for this poll, I suspect, has tremendous selection bias and lead time bias probably a much more savy, educated group; having already been diagnosed with prostate ca and able and motivated to do research, including enough to join a support group; certainly not at all comparable to average cohort of newly diagnosed, shock and awe patients, who know less to nothing, newly walking into our world: welcome to the forum: with fear of cancer and then fear of delay in treatment of cancer. The forum does a great job of re-assuring and talking many off the cliff of panic. Including myself - thank you Chuck and the forum. Stated another way: I had 15 to 30 minutes total with my urologist post delivery of the shock and awe message: you have cancer. How much could I have possibly asked, how much could I have possibly absorbed: before emotionally arriving at - treat and treat fast. ask questions later. This selection and lead time bias explains your support group's complete acceptance of the concept of active surveillance and thus their reasoned and correct objection to the experts USTFP 2012 directive and since your poll is dated 2017, I suspect even to the revised 2018 directive of \"maybe\" But what they are not taking into account is the directive is aimed at all patients, and all patients are not as aware or accepting of AS as your support group. And that acceptance is necessary in our era of shared decision making. ----- And just as you reported your veteran urologist countered: \"The presenter assured them that AS was on dramatic recent rise, and that more options were being discussed, at least in larger practices.\" The task force : countered - \"...recognition that active surveillance, rather than treatment, of low-risk cancers was becoming much more common\". The key in this whole taskforce change: is both a. the concept and refinement of the concept of active surveillance and b. patient's and for that matter doctor's emotional acceptance of active surveillance which is completely emotionally counterintuitive to our core. A. is fixed by facts/science B. is fluid and emotional ---- The B is what is causing our lag behind Europe and Australia. What everyone including your veteran urologist may not have emphasized. This change could not have happened without Dr. Epstein's - the one and only titan period of Prostate cancer grading - breakthru: E=mc2 moment of both creating a smaller better prognosis cohort of Gleason 3 patients; but furthermore creating one that surrendipitously does not metastasize - study of 17k patients. I know many of the caveats including ca heterogeneity, ca transformation, sampling error, pathologist grading error, etc.; I am sure Djin can come up with many more. but that is all baked into the active surveillance concept which is at the statistical clinical translational level; not at the light microscopic level: pathologist sampling error, or pathologist grading error, or even at the molecular biology level of tumor heterogeneity and transformation: by way of oncogenes/accelerators of psadt, tumor suppressor genes/brakes/dna repair/cell death/apoptosis, anti-immune and pro-angiogenesis mechanisms, etc. One of the huge laments on this board and by all patients is the uncertainty of all this stuff and you have to go with your gut/emotion, and thus the concept of shared decision making. But on the statistical clinical translational research level: 100% no metastasis to lymph nodes, 100% no lymphovascular space invasion, rare 0.03% seminal vesicle invasion, and uncommon 2% non-focal EPE is as good as you could possibly get studying 17k Radical prostatectomy with lymphadenectomy specimens at Johns Hopkins for de facto evidence of no metastatic potential. Actually, it is mind boggling serendipitous to me. E=mc2 Dr. Epstein. How did you pull that rabbit out of your hat? In part, thru several revisions over many years, 2014 was not the 1st revision, there were several Epstein revisions prior to 2014: continually reducing the Gleason 3 category into smaller and smaller cohorts of better prognosis patients. How he got to absolute zero though was serendipitous. The concept of active surveillance allows for knowledge to counter gut/emotion. And I believe another breakthru could be semantic from an English/psychology professor. I quote from a recent Epstein article: \"The lack of metastatic potential of GS6 cancer has led to the argument to remove the label cancer from this lesion. Instead some experts have suggested labeling GS6 cancer as IDLE to reduce the patient fear of cancer, which would hopefully lead to an increase in active surveillance. Several articles in the literature have listed the pros and cons of relabeling GS6 as not cancer.\" So, academic urologic pathologists proposed: IDLE (indolent lesion of epithelial origin) - by clinical translation research, 100% correct - But quite awkward if I do so say myself. And rejected by Epstein. But even if Epstein gave it his imprimatur, it never would have had a chance in hell to catch on with rank and file urologists, the minions, who would have to deliver the cryptic/awkward \"good\" news. Go explain IDLE to the average joe in 15 minutes. Good luck. And then get them on board with Active surveillance; even better luck; especially if that average Joe is Clint Eastwood. Tangent: One of the most mind tweak concepts I have come across regarding prostate cancer is the Will Rogers phenomenon. You have to google it and try to wrap your head around it --- it is truly a mind tweak, like no other; and if mentioned at all in research papers is buried as a caveat/limitation -- grade migration or some other non-eloquent set of words. Which comes into play loud and clear regarding Epstein's shrinking Gleason 3 cancer into a much better prognosis cancer; nay non-metastasizing non-cancer.",

      "Content": "In 2012, the USPSTF (U.S. Preventive Services Task Force) recommended against Psa screening for prostate cancer. That 2012 taskforce was right, in the aggregate, bean counterway, that PSA screening resulted in alot, alot of overtreatment and resultant cost without significant impact on mortality; but one huge downside is for example: there are Forum Brothers who are casualties of that failure to screen including myself. Dr. Ahlering's recent study: highlighting the consequences of that 2012 taskforce recommendation; a rise in the incidence of higher stage disease - a step backwards in the fight against prostate CA. entitled \"Unintended consequences of decreased PSA-based prostate cancer screening [2018]; was significant in the crusade against this recommendation. - in Djin's research subforum This crusade against the 2012 recommendation resulted in the USPSTF changing course. Just recently, USPSTF changed their guidance: and now recommends that for the 55-69 age group, the decision to be screened for PCa with PSA-based testing should be an individual one. I started this thread not to list the above general directives: 2012 - don't screen; 2018 - individual decision but to list the hard numbers used to arrive at these consensus statements; so you can attempt to draw your own, in part emotional, conclusions yourself. What follows are the unedited hard numbers that were used to reach the above recommendations: USPSTF described the number of harms and benefits with PSA screening, which can be quantified over a 10- to 15-year period. They estimate that if 1,000 men were offered a PSA test, 240 would screen positive, leading to positive biopsies in 100. But 20.7% to 50.4% of these men will actually have indolent disease that never grows or metastasizes, according to the evidence report. Of the 100 men with biopsy positive PCa, 80 will opt for definitive treatment with surgery or radiotherapy (RT) immediately or after a period of active surveillance (AS). Post-treatment, 50 men will experience long-term erectile dysfunction (ED) and 15 will experience long-term urinary incontinence (UI). And while 1.3 PCa deaths would be prevented over 13 yrs., five men would still die from PCa despite definitive treatment. To repeat, the main reason I started this thread is to challenge everyone to draw their own conclusions regarding the above numbers. One emotional exercise is to imagine yourself in a room of one thousand men; then imagine 240 of you would be shunted into a room to get a biopsy; and then after the biopsy, 100 of you would be told you have cancer. Remember the shock and awe of being told you have cancer. I certainly do. It was one of those John F. Kennedy was assassinated, the man on the moon, or 9/11 moments. Then after 100 of you have been told you have cancer; 21-50 are then mind tweaked - told that you really do not have clinically meaningful cancer we still do not have a good semantic word for this uncancer/precancer Gleason 3 which can not metastasize: defined and confirmed by Dr. Epstein in a study of 17k cases. Furthermore, the semantic: indolent cancer, has not solved the low acceptance rate of AS by patients in the U.S. compared to Europe and Australia. Because maybe to choose AS, you have to feel Clint Eastwood lucky? - Tangential thought: for this semantic argument, we do not need the expert molecular biologist Robert Weinberg who defined what cancer is, do not need the expert urologic pathologist, Dr. Epstein who redefined Gleason 3, in effect shrinking it into a smaller better prognosis cohort which serendipitously virtually never metastasizes and dovetails perfectly into the concept of active surveillance; an expert urologic surgeon, radiation or medical oncologist; but a dual English/Psychology expert because cancer is such an emotionally charged word with the automatic Clint Eastwood reflex to treat early and ask questions later. Or if I may: I could not help myself, my apologies: \"I know what you're thinking. Did he fire six shots or only five? Well, to tell you the truth, in all this excitement, I've kinda lost track myself. But being as this is a .44 magnum, the most powerful handgun in the world, and would blow your head clean off, you've got to ask yourself one question: \"Do I feel lucky?\" Well, do ya, punk?\u201d After the 100 of you who are told you have cancer are mind tweaked that 21-50 of you really have something else which we do not have a good term for; we are then told most of the 100 will opt for treatment and many will have ED or continence issues; but only 1 will be cured of prostate cancer and 5 will actually die of prostate cancer despite treatment. Would you want to step in that room of 1000 men and be screened? And btw; I forgot to bring up cost, time, and anxiety would you want to get on that emotional roller coaster knowing that a. only 1 of you will be cured by the interventions, b. 20-50 will be overtreated c. and 5 will die anyway despite treatment, their grieving family thinking that if only we had pulled the trigger sooner as opposed to the probable truth that either the horse had already left the barn years before primary treatment even began or conventional therapy did not work. In this exercise, I am of course ignoring many new developments in prostate cancer Psa based screening including psa density, phi score, MRI guidance, molecular tests, 2014 Gleason grading revision, Ahlering's study, among many others which lead to better guidance for who bests qualifies for biopsy, active surveillance etc. ----- which taken together in combination with greater acceptance of AS resulted in the corrected USPSTF guidance. The 2012 taskforce did not have the benefit of all of this new information in 2012. And I quote \"...recognition that active surveillance, rather than treatment, of low-risk cancers was becoming much more common\". I translate this: Just as Wall Street translates the Fed Chairman's cryptic measured imprimaturs - the U.S. has greater consumer buyin to AS in 2018 vs 12. Now that you have reached your conclusion. I now want to reveal what the answer is: according to the experts --- regarding the hard data above, in 2018; not 2012. Prostate-Specific Antigen-Based Screening for Prostate Cancer: A Systematic Evidence Review for the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30085502 Also, linked in Djin research forum. USPTF CONCLUSIONS: \"PSA screening for prostate cancer may reduce risk of prostate cancer mortality but is associated with harms including false-positive results, biopsy complications, and overdiagnosis in 20 percent to 50 percent of screen-detected prostate cancers. Early, active treatment for screen-detected prostate cancer may reduce the risk of metastatic disease, although the long-term impact of early, active treatment on prostate cancer mortality remains unclear. Active treatments for prostate cancer are frequently associated with sexual and urinary difficulties.\" Overdiagnosis = Gleason 3 semantic issue. But if Gleason 3 is cancer, which it is by molecular biology, then it is not an overdiagnosis to call it cancer; But if it does not metastasize and the only surrogate for pcsm and overall survival is distant metastasis; not bcr - then, by clinical translational research, it is not cancer. To translate, even the USPSTF considers Gleason 3 cancer; not cancer: Epstein truly is God. But what should we call it; the semantic problem and thus emotional problem. Emotional problem because if you can walk around with untreated CA, and you emotion like Clint Eastwood, you must feel lucky. But if you are walking around with e.g. family history of pca or some other risk factor, you just monitor closely and don't sweat it. And, unlike most of us prostate Ca patients, the experts use measured Fedspeak regarding screening: \"mays\" and \"unclears\" as their concluding statements; even in 2018. The emotional conclusion of patients, if I may speak for everyone, is not measured USPTFspeak: but Get screened by PSA, for the 50-69 age group with normal life expectancy, period, end of story; despite the experts above 2018 measured waffle ----- but be ever mindful of the real numbers and what you are getting yourself into including, be very mindful, of our natural emotional inclination to drastically underestimate overtreatment in the face of the word cancer. It is one of the most scary words in our language. One example how human beings are very bad emotionally at judging risk is: The car versus plane paradigm. I know the facts: flying is actually the safest mode of transportation. In fact, the odds of a plane crash are one for every 1.2 million flights, with odds of dying one in 11 million. Your chances of dying in a car accident are one in 5,000; approximately 37k deaths per year. Yet, even knowing these facts, I have a fear of flying and do not have one qualm about getting into a car. To state it another way: I can not think of another reason why AS is not more accepted, or as accepted as in Europe or Australia except for this emotional issue. Am I missing something? I believe we should be aware of this emotional skewing of the facts ---- And really we should be asking our doctors; if you were in my risk boat, not weighing in my emotional leaning/shared decision making, what would you choose. Just food, hard numbers, for thought. And caution of how emotions play into risk analysis. I am curious what the poll results of forum brothers would be regarding screening with psa for 50-69 males with normal life expectancy 1. no screening - 2012 2. maybe - 2018; actually to be fair - dubbed smarter screening; parsing risk analysis 3. screen, one size fits all/across the board screening, period end of story.",

There are pros and cons to both systems. You should just be aware of the differences. Tangential thought: Europe, Asia, and Australia lead the USA in other prostate Ca mind tweak concepts, which run against longstanding conventional concepts, besides AS. This includes the mentioned above ultrasensitive imaging technologies; but also one of its major corollaries directed therapies, in general, and salvage surgery in particular; and active surveillance in the bcr phase of the disease for select patients who have low risk bcr: including low detectable but stable bcr and late to bcr, low psa velocity, low Grade group and stage patients. Both these future mind tweak concepts which have relevance in the bcr stage of disease: challenge us for a word for recurrent stage 4 ca that can be treated with non-systemic/directed therapy in combination with systemic therapy, and probably eventually with delayed and eventually without standard of care systemic therapy; for a select subset of patients; from indolent bcr to prostate bed only recurrence to pelvic and immediately extrapelvic lymph node recurrence to oligometastatic recurrent ca including oligometastases to bone. Basal cell carcinoma of the skin will not inform us; nor will ductal carcinoma in situ of the breast inform us; nor will papillary carcinoma of the thyroid inform us ---- all peculiar forms of low end cancer for different reasons which do not completely fit low volume, low psa, low molecular score, Gleason 3 prostate biopsy cancer or indolent bcr or prostate bed only recurrence. The bcr recurrent phase: another shock and awe that I myself am facing/heading for. I am at 0.026 -- with beyond psa anxiety. I better take Pom-T, exercise, lose weight, cholesterol and glucose lower, etc. etc. and pray. The only things in my control at this point. lol. This/these concepts are and will be mind tweaks/counterintuitive even to doctors. Doctor's are emotional beings, also, and were trained as a first, second, and third approximation -- the best treatment of cancer, except for prevention, is treat early, end of story. trained that in the U.S., the only treatment is standard of care, end of story, informed by our legal malpractice system; even if you know your European and Australian counterparts are pushing the facts/frontiers forward in front of you. And for stage 4 disease: treat systemically. end of story. No, I need to correct myself; there is a well accepted exception to the above in pca: stage 4 prostate bed only recurrence post RP: standard of care is salvage RT; except that at the low psa levels required for benefit, with our standard of care conventional CT and bone scan, we are blind as to where the recurrence really is, including whether or not it is really confined to the prostate bed --- the new ultrasensitive imaging technologies open the blinders, at least in the 0.2 to 10-20 range where conventional studies, bone and CT scan, could not. Furthermore we may really be curing nothing with salvage RT in low risk patients (uncancer/precancer and even benign tissue), but admittedly resetting the psa clock back to zero in the majority - Up to 70% for low risk patients, informed by MSK nomogram. And several current large retrospective studies coming out of Italy, some in conjunction with USA including Mayo clinic, showing that after substratifying by risk this lowest risk 70% cured by salvage RT really are not benefitted at all, except for setting the psa clock back to zero. Active surveillance was a hard sell even to doctors. Just as directed therapies for early recurrence which are coming are going to be hard sells; because it flies in the face of conventional oncologic theory. But prostate ca is different. And ultrasensitive imaging will reveal the natural pattern of spread of the disease in the 0.2 to 10-20 psa range which was up until now hidden. It will be shown to be much more stepwise than almost any cancer known except basal cell carcinoma and papillary carcinoma of the thyroid. ----- In summary, the guidance changed for 3 reasons, in my opinion: 1. Acceptance rate of active surveillance increased 2. AS science improved 3. Ahlering research that lack of screening resulted in actual theoretic harm: stage migration 4. cynically, political pressure - uproar from the masses. Not. USPTF were a scientific body despite the Federal mandate and thus title. But correct me, if I am wrong.",

      "Content": "In 2012, the USPSTF (U.S. Preventive Services Task Force) recommended against Psa screening for prostate cancer. That 2012 taskforce was right, in the aggregate, bean counterway, that PSA screening resulted in alot, alot of overtreatment and resultant cost without significant impact on mortality; but one huge downside is for example: there are Forum Brothers who are casualties of that failure to screen including myself. Dr. Ahlering's recent study: highlighting the consequences of that 2012 taskforce recommendation; a rise in the incidence of higher stage disease - a step backwards in the fight against prostate CA. entitled \"Unintended consequences of decreased PSA-based prostate cancer screening [2018]; was significant in the crusade against this recommendation. - in Djin's research subforum This crusade against the 2012 recommendation resulted in the USPSTF changing course. Just recently, USPSTF changed their guidance: and now recommends that for the 55-69 age group, the decision to be screened for PCa with PSA-based testing should be an individual one. I started this thread not to list the above general directives: 2012 - don't screen; 2018 - individual decision but to list the hard numbers used to arrive at these consensus statements; so you can attempt to draw your own, in part emotional, conclusions yourself. What follows are the unedited hard numbers that were used to reach the above recommendations: USPSTF described the number of harms and benefits with PSA screening, which can be quantified over a 10- to 15-year period. They estimate that if 1,000 men were offered a PSA test, 240 would screen positive, leading to positive biopsies in 100. But 20.7% to 50.4% of these men will actually have indolent disease that never grows or metastasizes, according to the evidence report. Of the 100 men with biopsy positive PCa, 80 will opt for definitive treatment with surgery or radiotherapy (RT) immediately or after a period of active surveillance (AS). Post-treatment, 50 men will experience long-term erectile dysfunction (ED) and 15 will experience long-term urinary incontinence (UI). And while 1.3 PCa deaths would be prevented over 13 yrs., five men would still die from PCa despite definitive treatment. To repeat, the main reason I started this thread is to challenge everyone to draw their own conclusions regarding the above numbers. One emotional exercise is to imagine yourself in a room of one thousand men; then imagine 240 of you would be shunted into a room to get a biopsy; and then after the biopsy, 100 of you would be told you have cancer. Remember the shock and awe of being told you have cancer. I certainly do. It was one of those John F. Kennedy was assassinated, the man on the moon, or 9/11 moments. Then after 100 of you have been told you have cancer; 21-50 are then mind tweaked - told that you really do not have clinically meaningful cancer we still do not have a good semantic word for this uncancer/precancer Gleason 3 which can not metastasize: defined and confirmed by Dr. Epstein in a study of 17k cases. Furthermore, the semantic: indolent cancer, has not solved the low acceptance rate of AS by patients in the U.S. compared to Europe and Australia. Because maybe to choose AS, you have to feel Clint Eastwood lucky? - Tangential thought: for this semantic argument, we do not need the expert molecular biologist Robert Weinberg who defined what cancer is, do not need the expert urologic pathologist, Dr. Epstein who redefined Gleason 3, in effect shrinking it into a smaller better prognosis cohort which serendipitously virtually never metastasizes and dovetails perfectly into the concept of active surveillance; an expert urologic surgeon, radiation or medical oncologist; but a dual English/Psychology expert because cancer is such an emotionally charged word with the automatic Clint Eastwood reflex to treat early and ask questions later. Or if I may: I could not help myself, my apologies: \"I know what you're thinking. Did he fire six shots or only five? Well, to tell you the truth, in all this excitement, I've kinda lost track myself. But being as this is a .44 magnum, the most powerful handgun in the world, and would blow your head clean off, you've got to ask yourself one question: \"Do I feel lucky?\" Well, do ya, punk?\u201d After the 100 of you who are told you have cancer are mind tweaked that 21-50 of you really have something else which we do not have a good term for; we are then told most of the 100 will opt for treatment and many will have ED or continence issues; but only 1 will be cured of prostate cancer and 5 will actually die of prostate cancer despite treatment. Would you want to step in that room of 1000 men and be screened? And btw; I forgot to bring up cost, time, and anxiety would you want to get on that emotional roller coaster knowing that a. only 1 of you will be cured by the interventions, b. 20-50 will be overtreated c. and 5 will die anyway despite treatment, their grieving family thinking that if only we had pulled the trigger sooner as opposed to the probable truth that either the horse had already left the barn years before primary treatment even began or conventional therapy did not work. In this exercise, I am of course ignoring many new developments in prostate cancer Psa based screening including psa density, phi score, MRI guidance, molecular tests, 2014 Gleason grading revision, Ahlering's study, among many others which lead to better guidance for who bests qualifies for biopsy, active surveillance etc. ----- which taken together in combination with greater acceptance of AS resulted in the corrected USPSTF guidance. The 2012 taskforce did not have the benefit of all of this new information in 2012. And I quote \"...recognition that active surveillance, rather than treatment, of low-risk cancers was becoming much more common\". I translate this: Just as Wall Street translates the Fed Chairman's cryptic measured imprimaturs - the U.S. has greater consumer buyin to AS in 2018 vs 12. Now that you have reached your conclusion. I now want to reveal what the answer is: according to the experts --- regarding the hard data above, in 2018; not 2012. Prostate-Specific Antigen-Based Screening for Prostate Cancer: A Systematic Evidence Review for the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30085502 Also, linked in Djin research forum. USPTF CONCLUSIONS: \"PSA screening for prostate cancer may reduce risk of prostate cancer mortality but is associated with harms including false-positive results, biopsy complications, and overdiagnosis in 20 percent to 50 percent of screen-detected prostate cancers. Early, active treatment for screen-detected prostate cancer may reduce the risk of metastatic disease, although the long-term impact of early, active treatment on prostate cancer mortality remains unclear. Active treatments for prostate cancer are frequently associated with sexual and urinary difficulties.\" Overdiagnosis = Gleason 3 semantic issue. But if Gleason 3 is cancer, which it is by molecular biology, then it is not an overdiagnosis to call it cancer; But if it does not metastasize and the only surrogate for pcsm and overall survival is distant metastasis; not bcr - then, by clinical translational research, it is not cancer. To translate, even the USPSTF considers Gleason 3 cancer; not cancer: Epstein truly is God. But what should we call it; the semantic problem and thus emotional problem. Emotional problem because if you can walk around with untreated CA, and you emotion like Clint Eastwood, you must feel lucky. But if you are walking around with e.g. family history of pca or some other risk factor, you just monitor closely and don't sweat it. And, unlike most of us prostate Ca patients, the experts use measured Fedspeak regarding screening: \"mays\" and \"unclears\" as their concluding statements; even in 2018. The emotional conclusion of patients, if I may speak for everyone, is not measured USPTFspeak: but Get screened by PSA, for the 50-69 age group with normal life expectancy, period, end of story; despite the experts above 2018 measured waffle ----- but be ever mindful of the real numbers and what you are getting yourself into including, be very mindful, of our natural emotional inclination to drastically underestimate overtreatment in the face of the word cancer. It is one of the most scary words in our language. One example how human beings are very bad emotionally at judging risk is: The car versus plane paradigm. I know the facts: flying is actually the safest mode of transportation. In fact, the odds of a plane crash are one for every 1.2 million flights, with odds of dying one in 11 million. Your chances of dying in a car accident are one in 5,000; approximately 37k deaths per year. Yet, even knowing these facts, I have a fear of flying and do not have one qualm about getting into a car. To state it another way: I can not think of another reason why AS is not more accepted, or as accepted as in Europe or Australia except for this emotional issue. Am I missing something? I believe we should be aware of this emotional skewing of the facts ---- And really we should be asking our doctors; if you were in my risk boat, not weighing in my emotional leaning/shared decision making, what would you choose. Just food, hard numbers, for thought. And caution of how emotions play into risk analysis. I am curious what the poll results of forum brothers would be regarding screening with psa for 50-69 males with normal life expectancy 1. no screening - 2012 2. maybe - 2018; actually to be fair - dubbed smarter screening; parsing risk analysis 3. screen, one size fits all/across the board screening, period end of story.",

But being as this is a .44 magnum, the most powerful handgun in the world, and would blow your head clean off, you've got to ask yourself one question: \"Do I feel lucky?\" Well, do ya, punk?\u201d After the 100 of you who are told you have cancer are mind tweaked that 21-50 of you really have something else which we do not have a good term for; we are then told most of the 100 will opt for treatment and many will have ED or continence issues; but only 1 will be cured of prostate cancer and 5 will actually die of prostate cancer despite treatment. Would you want to step in that room of 1000 men and be screened? And btw; I forgot to bring up cost, time, and anxiety would you want to get on that emotional roller coaster knowing that a. only 1 of you will be cured by the interventions, b. 20-50 will be overtreated c. and 5 will die anyway despite treatment, their grieving family thinking that if only we had pulled the trigger sooner as opposed to the probable truth that either the horse had already left the barn years before primary treatment even began or conventional therapy did not work. In this exercise, I am of course ignoring many new developments in prostate cancer Psa based screening including psa density, phi score, MRI guidance, molecular tests, 2014 Gleason grading revision, Ahlering's study, among many others which lead to better guidance for who bests qualifies for biopsy, active surveillance etc. ----- which taken together in combination with greater acceptance of AS resulted in the corrected USPSTF guidance. The 2012 taskforce did not have the benefit of all of this new information in 2012. And I quote \"...recognition that active surveillance, rather than treatment, of low-risk cancers was becoming much more common\". I translate this: Just as Wall Street translates the Fed Chairman's cryptic measured imprimaturs - the U.S. has greater consumer buyin to AS in 2018 vs 12. Now that you have reached your conclusion. I now want to reveal what the answer is: according to the experts --- regarding the hard data above, in 2018; not 2012. Prostate-Specific Antigen-Based Screening for Prostate Cancer: A Systematic Evidence Review for the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30085502 Also, linked in Djin research forum. USPTF CONCLUSIONS: \"PSA screening for prostate cancer may reduce risk of prostate cancer mortality but is associated with harms including false-positive results, biopsy complications, and overdiagnosis in 20 percent to 50 percent of screen-detected prostate cancers. Early, active treatment for screen-detected prostate cancer may reduce the risk of metastatic disease, although the long-term impact of early, active treatment on prostate cancer mortality remains unclear. Active treatments for prostate cancer are frequently associated with sexual and urinary difficulties.\" Overdiagnosis = Gleason 3 semantic issue. But if Gleason 3 is cancer, which it is by molecular biology, then it is not an overdiagnosis to call it cancer; But if it does not metastasize and the only surrogate for pcsm and overall survival is distant metastasis; not bcr - then, by clinical translational research, it is not cancer. To translate, even the USPSTF considers Gleason 3 cancer; not cancer: Epstein truly is God. But what should we call it; the semantic problem and thus emotional problem. Emotional problem because if you can walk around with untreated CA, and you emotion like Clint Eastwood, you must feel lucky. But if you are walking around with e.g. family history of pca or some other risk factor, you just monitor closely and don't sweat it. And, unlike most of us prostate Ca patients, the experts use measured Fedspeak regarding screening: \"mays\" and \"unclears\" as their concluding statements; even in 2018. The emotional conclusion of patients, if I may speak for everyone, is not measured USPTFspeak: but Get screened by PSA, for the 50-69 age group with normal life expectancy, period, end of story; despite the experts above 2018 measured waffle ----- but be ever mindful of the real numbers and what you are getting yourself into including, be very mindful, of our natural emotional inclination to drastically underestimate overtreatment in the face of the word cancer. It is one of the most scary words in our language. One example how human beings are very bad emotionally at judging risk is: The car versus plane paradigm. I know the facts: flying is actually the safest mode of transportation. In fact, the odds of a plane crash are one for every 1.2 million flights, with odds of dying one in 11 million. Your chances of dying in a car accident are one in 5,000; approximately 37k deaths per year. Yet, even knowing these facts, I have a fear of flying and do not have one qualm about getting into a car. To state it another way: I can not think of another reason why AS is not more accepted, or as accepted as in Europe or Australia except for this emotional issue. Am I missing something? I believe we should be aware of this emotional skewing of the facts ---- And really we should be asking our doctors; if you were in my risk boat, not weighing in my emotional leaning/shared decision making, what would you choose. Just food, hard numbers, for thought. And caution of how emotions play into risk analysis. I am curious what the poll results of forum brothers would be regarding screening with psa for 50-69 males with normal life expectancy 1. no screening - 2012 2. maybe - 2018; actually to be fair - dubbed smarter screening; parsing risk analysis 3. screen, one size fits all/across the board screening, period end of story.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by ASAdvocate Allmo, Thanks for this detailed post. Last year, I attended a support group meeting where a veteran urologist did a slide show presenting the same facts as you did. His conclusion was that PSA testing was only saving one man per one thousand tested.. The men in the room were pretty much in an uproar, as they respected that doctor, but refused to accept the conclusion. It was a quite a meeting. I recall that everyone agreed with testing, and blamed the urologists for being too eager to rush men into surgery. The presenter assured them that AS was on dramatic recent rise, and that more options were being discussed, at least in larger practices. ASA, Regarding my question to forum brothers: I am curious what the poll results of forum brothers would be regarding screening with psa for 55-69 males with normal life expectancy. Do you agree with 1, 2, or 3? 1. no screening - 2012 USPSTF 2. maybe screen - 2018 USPSTF --- actually to be fair - dubbed smarter screening; parsing risk analysis, e.g. family history, african american, etc 3. Screen. Period. End of story. ASA - Thank you for taking the poll. You got me my answer, kind of/with caveats. The answer: Door number 3 - \"everyone agreed with testing\", but if you will allow me to take it to further emotional hyperbole, backed up by your scientific observation of \"uproar\" Your poll results stated more emotionally: - Everyone agreed with testing. Period. End of story. Clint Eastwood style. Errata: No. Not Clint Eastwood. He is calm, cool, and collected and just asks how lucky do you feel; with his one shot magnum - More like Stallone aka rocky or rambo who comes out with punches/automatic weapons ablazing/\"uproar\"; Your patient cohort for this poll, I suspect, has tremendous selection bias and lead time bias probably a much more savy, educated group; having already been diagnosed with prostate ca and able and motivated to do research, including enough to join a support group; certainly not at all comparable to average cohort of newly diagnosed, shock and awe patients, who know less to nothing, newly walking into our world: welcome to the forum: with fear of cancer and then fear of delay in treatment of cancer. The forum does a great job of re-assuring and talking many off the cliff of panic. Including myself - thank you Chuck and the forum. Stated another way: I had 15 to 30 minutes total with my urologist post delivery of the shock and awe message: you have cancer. How much could I have possibly asked, how much could I have possibly absorbed: before emotionally arriving at - treat and treat fast. ask questions later. This selection and lead time bias explains your support group's complete acceptance of the concept of active surveillance and thus their reasoned and correct objection to the experts USTFP 2012 directive and since your poll is dated 2017, I suspect even to the revised 2018 directive of \"maybe\" But what they are not taking into account is the directive is aimed at all patients, and all patients are not as aware or accepting of AS as your support group. And that acceptance is necessary in our era of shared decision making. ----- And just as you reported your veteran urologist countered: \"The presenter assured them that AS was on dramatic recent rise, and that more options were being discussed, at least in larger practices.\" The task force : countered - \"...recognition that active surveillance, rather than treatment, of low-risk cancers was becoming much more common\". The key in this whole taskforce change: is both a. the concept and refinement of the concept of active surveillance and b. patient's and for that matter doctor's emotional acceptance of active surveillance which is completely emotionally counterintuitive to our core. A. is fixed by facts/science B. is fluid and emotional ---- The B is what is causing our lag behind Europe and Australia. What everyone including your veteran urologist may not have emphasized. This change could not have happened without Dr. Epstein's - the one and only titan period of Prostate cancer grading - breakthru: E=mc2 moment of both creating a smaller better prognosis cohort of Gleason 3 patients; but furthermore creating one that surrendipitously does not metastasize - study of 17k patients. I know many of the caveats including ca heterogeneity, ca transformation, sampling error, pathologist grading error, etc.; I am sure Djin can come up with many more. but that is all baked into the active surveillance concept which is at the statistical clinical translational level; not at the light microscopic level: pathologist sampling error, or pathologist grading error, or even at the molecular biology level of tumor heterogeneity and transformation: by way of oncogenes/accelerators of psadt, tumor suppressor genes/brakes/dna repair/cell death/apoptosis, anti-immune and pro-angiogenesis mechanisms, etc. One of the huge laments on this board and by all patients is the uncertainty of all this stuff and you have to go with your gut/emotion, and thus the concept of shared decision making. But on the statistical clinical translational research level: 100% no metastasis to lymph nodes, 100% no lymphovascular space invasion, rare 0.03% seminal vesicle invasion, and uncommon 2% non-focal EPE is as good as you could possibly get studying 17k Radical prostatectomy with lymphadenectomy specimens at Johns Hopkins for de facto evidence of no metastatic potential. Actually, it is mind boggling serendipitous to me. E=mc2 Dr. Epstein. How did you pull that rabbit out of your hat? In part, thru several revisions over many years, 2014 was not the 1st revision, there were several Epstein revisions prior to 2014: continually reducing the Gleason 3 category into smaller and smaller cohorts of better prognosis patients. How he got to absolute zero though was serendipitous. The concept of active surveillance allows for knowledge to counter gut/emotion. And I believe another breakthru could be semantic from an English/psychology professor. I quote from a recent Epstein article: \"The lack of metastatic potential of GS6 cancer has led to the argument to remove the label cancer from this lesion. Instead some experts have suggested labeling GS6 cancer as IDLE to reduce the patient fear of cancer, which would hopefully lead to an increase in active surveillance. Several articles in the literature have listed the pros and cons of relabeling GS6 as not cancer.\" So, academic urologic pathologists proposed: IDLE (indolent lesion of epithelial origin) - by clinical translation research, 100% correct - But quite awkward if I do so say myself. And rejected by Epstein. But even if Epstein gave it his imprimatur, it never would have had a chance in hell to catch on with rank and file urologists, the minions, who would have to deliver the cryptic/awkward \"good\" news. Go explain IDLE to the average joe in 15 minutes. Good luck. And then get them on board with Active surveillance; even better luck; especially if that average Joe is Clint Eastwood. Tangent: One of the most mind tweak concepts I have come across regarding prostate cancer is the Will Rogers phenomenon. You have to google it and try to wrap your head around it --- it is truly a mind tweak, like no other; and if mentioned at all in research papers is buried as a caveat/limitation -- grade migration or some other non-eloquent set of words. Which comes into play loud and clear regarding Epstein's shrinking Gleason 3 cancer into a much better prognosis cancer; nay non-metastasizing non-cancer.",

      "Content": "Djin: All of your points are well taken and I agree with them. Especially, and I quote you: the solution to overtreatment is simply to stop overtreatment with Active Surveillance, not to stop screening. But there were many problems to AS in 2012 including but not limited to, it predated Epstein's shrinking Gleason 3 to a better prognosis cohort that does not metastasize, among other subsequent refinements on the science side; and as pointed out by the taskforce, lack of buyin by patients and doctors for Active Surveillance on the consumer side. Barring the 10-15 year time period limitation, (btw, not Allmo's limitation, this is the taskforce/literature limitation) which is admittedly too short for prostate cancer; but come on, be realistic that is largely what the literature consists of; -- furthermore, you are going to have to wait a long time for prospective followup with the new screen parsing and Epstein regrading of 3 in 2014, way beyond the lifetime of most reading this, to get 20-25 year data; so that is a valid criticism of the data the taskforce used to inform its directives; but an unrealistic criticism: there will be no 20-25 yr old data for a long time - Let alone in 20-25 years, we are going to be in a new science fiction world of prostate cancer directed therapy at the molecular level which will cure cancer as opposed to the blind shotgun approach of for example RT. And last - of course positive DRE = higher stage >/= pT2 largely taking it out of AS; clinicalT2a exceptions exist for AS. otherwise all of your caveats and nuances are baked into the beauty/science of Active Surveillance as the solution to the 2012 guidance against screening with Psa - AS will be the subject of continued research and refinement and thus only get more perfect, marginally and AS will continue to have increasing acceptance by USA doctors, softened by \"shared decision making\", with greater acceptance by patients ---- Acceptance rates in US: from a low of 6.7% in the years from 1990 to 2009, to 40.4% in the period 2010 to 2013; but AS at 40% in 2013 still lags behind the frontrunners/leaders Europe and Australia - their acceptance rates are much higher. In part because, they have less patient advocacy, less shared decision making, emotional stuff to deal with. There doctors can just follow the hard facts including not doing standard of care - the latter a legal concept in the U.S. which handcuffs doctors, even the experts into doing what the herd does. Admittedly the herd is right in the vast majority of instances; but when a groundbreaking advance occurs such as ultrasensitive imaging especially psma based imaging; there is no clinical translational data to to know for sure for the foreseeable future: for consensus/standard of care directives to be made; and in Europe and Australia, patients more readily just trust their doctors. There are pros and cons to both systems. You should just be aware of the differences. Tangential thought: Europe, Asia, and Australia lead the USA in other prostate Ca mind tweak concepts, which run against longstanding conventional concepts, besides AS. This includes the mentioned above ultrasensitive imaging technologies; but also one of its major corollaries directed therapies, in general, and salvage surgery in particular; and active surveillance in the bcr phase of the disease for select patients who have low risk bcr: including low detectable but stable bcr and late to bcr, low psa velocity, low Grade group and stage patients. Both these future mind tweak concepts which have relevance in the bcr stage of disease: challenge us for a word for recurrent stage 4 ca that can be treated with non-systemic/directed therapy in combination with systemic therapy, and probably eventually with delayed and eventually without standard of care systemic therapy; for a select subset of patients; from indolent bcr to prostate bed only recurrence to pelvic and immediately extrapelvic lymph node recurrence to oligometastatic recurrent ca including oligometastases to bone. Basal cell carcinoma of the skin will not inform us; nor will ductal carcinoma in situ of the breast inform us; nor will papillary carcinoma of the thyroid inform us ---- all peculiar forms of low end cancer for different reasons which do not completely fit low volume, low psa, low molecular score, Gleason 3 prostate biopsy cancer or indolent bcr or prostate bed only recurrence. The bcr recurrent phase: another shock and awe that I myself am facing/heading for. I am at 0.026 -- with beyond psa anxiety. I better take Pom-T, exercise, lose weight, cholesterol and glucose lower, etc. etc. and pray. The only things in my control at this point. lol. This/these concepts are and will be mind tweaks/counterintuitive even to doctors. Doctor's are emotional beings, also, and were trained as a first, second, and third approximation -- the best treatment of cancer, except for prevention, is treat early, end of story. trained that in the U.S., the only treatment is standard of care, end of story, informed by our legal malpractice system; even if you know your European and Australian counterparts are pushing the facts/frontiers forward in front of you. And for stage 4 disease: treat systemically. end of story. No, I need to correct myself; there is a well accepted exception to the above in pca: stage 4 prostate bed only recurrence post RP: standard of care is salvage RT; except that at the low psa levels required for benefit, with our standard of care conventional CT and bone scan, we are blind as to where the recurrence really is, including whether or not it is really confined to the prostate bed --- the new ultrasensitive imaging technologies open the blinders, at least in the 0.2 to 10-20 range where conventional studies, bone and CT scan, could not. Furthermore we may really be curing nothing with salvage RT in low risk patients (uncancer/precancer and even benign tissue), but admittedly resetting the psa clock back to zero in the majority - Up to 70% for low risk patients, informed by MSK nomogram. And several current large retrospective studies coming out of Italy, some in conjunction with USA including Mayo clinic, showing that after substratifying by risk this lowest risk 70% cured by salvage RT really are not benefitted at all, except for setting the psa clock back to zero. Active surveillance was a hard sell even to doctors. Just as directed therapies for early recurrence which are coming are going to be hard sells; because it flies in the face of conventional oncologic theory. But prostate ca is different. And ultrasensitive imaging will reveal the natural pattern of spread of the disease in the 0.2 to 10-20 psa range which was up until now hidden. It will be shown to be much more stepwise than almost any cancer known except basal cell carcinoma and papillary carcinoma of the thyroid. ----- In summary, the guidance changed for 3 reasons, in my opinion: 1. Acceptance rate of active surveillance increased 2. AS science improved 3. Ahlering research that lack of screening resulted in actual theoretic harm: stage migration 4. cynically, political pressure - uproar from the masses. Not. USPTF were a scientific body despite the Federal mandate and thus title. But correct me, if I am wrong.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by ASAdvocate Allmo, Thanks for this detailed post. Last year, I attended a support group meeting where a veteran urologist did a slide show presenting the same facts as you did. His conclusion was that PSA testing was only saving one man per one thousand tested.. The men in the room were pretty much in an uproar, as they respected that doctor, but refused to accept the conclusion. It was a quite a meeting. I recall that everyone agreed with testing, and blamed the urologists for being too eager to rush men into surgery. The presenter assured them that AS was on dramatic recent rise, and that more options were being discussed, at least in larger practices. ASA, Regarding my question to forum brothers: I am curious what the poll results of forum brothers would be regarding screening with psa for 55-69 males with normal life expectancy. Do you agree with 1, 2, or 3? 1. no screening - 2012 USPSTF 2. maybe screen - 2018 USPSTF --- actually to be fair - dubbed smarter screening; parsing risk analysis, e.g. family history, african american, etc 3. Screen. Period. End of story. ASA - Thank you for taking the poll. You got me my answer, kind of/with caveats. The answer: Door number 3 - \"everyone agreed with testing\", but if you will allow me to take it to further emotional hyperbole, backed up by your scientific observation of \"uproar\" Your poll results stated more emotionally: - Everyone agreed with testing. Period. End of story. Clint Eastwood style. Errata: No. Not Clint Eastwood. He is calm, cool, and collected and just asks how lucky do you feel; with his one shot magnum - More like Stallone aka rocky or rambo who comes out with punches/automatic weapons ablazing/\"uproar\"; Your patient cohort for this poll, I suspect, has tremendous selection bias and lead time bias probably a much more savy, educated group; having already been diagnosed with prostate ca and able and motivated to do research, including enough to join a support group; certainly not at all comparable to average cohort of newly diagnosed, shock and awe patients, who know less to nothing, newly walking into our world: welcome to the forum: with fear of cancer and then fear of delay in treatment of cancer. The forum does a great job of re-assuring and talking many off the cliff of panic. Including myself - thank you Chuck and the forum. Stated another way: I had 15 to 30 minutes total with my urologist post delivery of the shock and awe message: you have cancer. How much could I have possibly asked, how much could I have possibly absorbed: before emotionally arriving at - treat and treat fast. ask questions later. This selection and lead time bias explains your support group's complete acceptance of the concept of active surveillance and thus their reasoned and correct objection to the experts USTFP 2012 directive and since your poll is dated 2017, I suspect even to the revised 2018 directive of \"maybe\" But what they are not taking into account is the directive is aimed at all patients, and all patients are not as aware or accepting of AS as your support group. And that acceptance is necessary in our era of shared decision making. ----- And just as you reported your veteran urologist countered: \"The presenter assured them that AS was on dramatic recent rise, and that more options were being discussed, at least in larger practices.\" The task force : countered - \"...recognition that active surveillance, rather than treatment, of low-risk cancers was becoming much more common\". The key in this whole taskforce change: is both a. the concept and refinement of the concept of active surveillance and b. patient's and for that matter doctor's emotional acceptance of active surveillance which is completely emotionally counterintuitive to our core. A. is fixed by facts/science B. is fluid and emotional ---- The B is what is causing our lag behind Europe and Australia. What everyone including your veteran urologist may not have emphasized. This change could not have happened without Dr. Epstein's - the one and only titan period of Prostate cancer grading - breakthru: E=mc2 moment of both creating a smaller better prognosis cohort of Gleason 3 patients; but furthermore creating one that surrendipitously does not metastasize - study of 17k patients. I know many of the caveats including ca heterogeneity, ca transformation, sampling error, pathologist grading error, etc.; I am sure Djin can come up with many more. but that is all baked into the active surveillance concept which is at the statistical clinical translational level; not at the light microscopic level: pathologist sampling error, or pathologist grading error, or even at the molecular biology level of tumor heterogeneity and transformation: by way of oncogenes/accelerators of psadt, tumor suppressor genes/brakes/dna repair/cell death/apoptosis, anti-immune and pro-angiogenesis mechanisms, etc. One of the huge laments on this board and by all patients is the uncertainty of all this stuff and you have to go with your gut/emotion, and thus the concept of shared decision making. But on the statistical clinical translational research level: 100% no metastasis to lymph nodes, 100% no lymphovascular space invasion, rare 0.03% seminal vesicle invasion, and uncommon 2% non-focal EPE is as good as you could possibly get studying 17k Radical prostatectomy with lymphadenectomy specimens at Johns Hopkins for de facto evidence of no metastatic potential. Actually, it is mind boggling serendipitous to me. E=mc2 Dr. Epstein. How did you pull that rabbit out of your hat? In part, thru several revisions over many years, 2014 was not the 1st revision, there were several Epstein revisions prior to 2014: continually reducing the Gleason 3 category into smaller and smaller cohorts of better prognosis patients. How he got to absolute zero though was serendipitous. The concept of active surveillance allows for knowledge to counter gut/emotion. And I believe another breakthru could be semantic from an English/psychology professor. I quote from a recent Epstein article: \"The lack of metastatic potential of GS6 cancer has led to the argument to remove the label cancer from this lesion. Instead some experts have suggested labeling GS6 cancer as IDLE to reduce the patient fear of cancer, which would hopefully lead to an increase in active surveillance. Several articles in the literature have listed the pros and cons of relabeling GS6 as not cancer.\" So, academic urologic pathologists proposed: IDLE (indolent lesion of epithelial origin) - by clinical translation research, 100% correct - But quite awkward if I do so say myself. And rejected by Epstein. But even if Epstein gave it his imprimatur, it never would have had a chance in hell to catch on with rank and file urologists, the minions, who would have to deliver the cryptic/awkward \"good\" news. Go explain IDLE to the average joe in 15 minutes. Good luck. And then get them on board with Active surveillance; even better luck; especially if that average Joe is Clint Eastwood. Tangent: One of the most mind tweak concepts I have come across regarding prostate cancer is the Will Rogers phenomenon. You have to google it and try to wrap your head around it --- it is truly a mind tweak, like no other; and if mentioned at all in research papers is buried as a caveat/limitation -- grade migration or some other non-eloquent set of words. Which comes into play loud and clear regarding Epstein's shrinking Gleason 3 cancer into a much better prognosis cancer; nay non-metastasizing non-cancer.",

      "Content": "Djin: All of your points are well taken and I agree with them. Especially, and I quote you: the solution to overtreatment is simply to stop overtreatment with Active Surveillance, not to stop screening. But there were many problems to AS in 2012 including but not limited to, it predated Epstein's shrinking Gleason 3 to a better prognosis cohort that does not metastasize, among other subsequent refinements on the science side; and as pointed out by the taskforce, lack of buyin by patients and doctors for Active Surveillance on the consumer side. Barring the 10-15 year time period limitation, (btw, not Allmo's limitation, this is the taskforce/literature limitation) which is admittedly too short for prostate cancer; but come on, be realistic that is largely what the literature consists of; -- furthermore, you are going to have to wait a long time for prospective followup with the new screen parsing and Epstein regrading of 3 in 2014, way beyond the lifetime of most reading this, to get 20-25 year data; so that is a valid criticism of the data the taskforce used to inform its directives; but an unrealistic criticism: there will be no 20-25 yr old data for a long time - Let alone in 20-25 years, we are going to be in a new science fiction world of prostate cancer directed therapy at the molecular level which will cure cancer as opposed to the blind shotgun approach of for example RT. And last - of course positive DRE = higher stage >/= pT2 largely taking it out of AS; clinicalT2a exceptions exist for AS. otherwise all of your caveats and nuances are baked into the beauty/science of Active Surveillance as the solution to the 2012 guidance against screening with Psa - AS will be the subject of continued research and refinement and thus only get more perfect, marginally and AS will continue to have increasing acceptance by USA doctors, softened by \"shared decision making\", with greater acceptance by patients ---- Acceptance rates in US: from a low of 6.7% in the years from 1990 to 2009, to 40.4% in the period 2010 to 2013; but AS at 40% in 2013 still lags behind the frontrunners/leaders Europe and Australia - their acceptance rates are much higher. In part because, they have less patient advocacy, less shared decision making, emotional stuff to deal with. There doctors can just follow the hard facts including not doing standard of care - the latter a legal concept in the U.S. which handcuffs doctors, even the experts into doing what the herd does. Admittedly the herd is right in the vast majority of instances; but when a groundbreaking advance occurs such as ultrasensitive imaging especially psma based imaging; there is no clinical translational data to to know for sure for the foreseeable future: for consensus/standard of care directives to be made; and in Europe and Australia, patients more readily just trust their doctors. There are pros and cons to both systems. You should just be aware of the differences. Tangential thought: Europe, Asia, and Australia lead the USA in other prostate Ca mind tweak concepts, which run against longstanding conventional concepts, besides AS. This includes the mentioned above ultrasensitive imaging technologies; but also one of its major corollaries directed therapies, in general, and salvage surgery in particular; and active surveillance in the bcr phase of the disease for select patients who have low risk bcr: including low detectable but stable bcr and late to bcr, low psa velocity, low Grade group and stage patients. Both these future mind tweak concepts which have relevance in the bcr stage of disease: challenge us for a word for recurrent stage 4 ca that can be treated with non-systemic/directed therapy in combination with systemic therapy, and probably eventually with delayed and eventually without standard of care systemic therapy; for a select subset of patients; from indolent bcr to prostate bed only recurrence to pelvic and immediately extrapelvic lymph node recurrence to oligometastatic recurrent ca including oligometastases to bone. Basal cell carcinoma of the skin will not inform us; nor will ductal carcinoma in situ of the breast inform us; nor will papillary carcinoma of the thyroid inform us ---- all peculiar forms of low end cancer for different reasons which do not completely fit low volume, low psa, low molecular score, Gleason 3 prostate biopsy cancer or indolent bcr or prostate bed only recurrence. The bcr recurrent phase: another shock and awe that I myself am facing/heading for. I am at 0.026 -- with beyond psa anxiety. I better take Pom-T, exercise, lose weight, cholesterol and glucose lower, etc. etc. and pray. The only things in my control at this point. lol. This/these concepts are and will be mind tweaks/counterintuitive even to doctors. Doctor's are emotional beings, also, and were trained as a first, second, and third approximation -- the best treatment of cancer, except for prevention, is treat early, end of story. trained that in the U.S., the only treatment is standard of care, end of story, informed by our legal malpractice system; even if you know your European and Australian counterparts are pushing the facts/frontiers forward in front of you. And for stage 4 disease: treat systemically. end of story. No, I need to correct myself; there is a well accepted exception to the above in pca: stage 4 prostate bed only recurrence post RP: standard of care is salvage RT; except that at the low psa levels required for benefit, with our standard of care conventional CT and bone scan, we are blind as to where the recurrence really is, including whether or not it is really confined to the prostate bed --- the new ultrasensitive imaging technologies open the blinders, at least in the 0.2 to 10-20 range where conventional studies, bone and CT scan, could not. Furthermore we may really be curing nothing with salvage RT in low risk patients (uncancer/precancer and even benign tissue), but admittedly resetting the psa clock back to zero in the majority - Up to 70% for low risk patients, informed by MSK nomogram. And several current large retrospective studies coming out of Italy, some in conjunction with USA including Mayo clinic, showing that after substratifying by risk this lowest risk 70% cured by salvage RT really are not benefitted at all, except for setting the psa clock back to zero. Active surveillance was a hard sell even to doctors. Just as directed therapies for early recurrence which are coming are going to be hard sells; because it flies in the face of conventional oncologic theory. But prostate ca is different. And ultrasensitive imaging will reveal the natural pattern of spread of the disease in the 0.2 to 10-20 psa range which was up until now hidden. It will be shown to be much more stepwise than almost any cancer known except basal cell carcinoma and papillary carcinoma of the thyroid. ----- In summary, the guidance changed for 3 reasons, in my opinion: 1. Acceptance rate of active surveillance increased 2. AS science improved 3. Ahlering research that lack of screening resulted in actual theoretic harm: stage migration 4. cynically, political pressure - uproar from the masses. Not. USPTF were a scientific body despite the Federal mandate and thus title. But correct me, if I am wrong.",

      "Content": "Footnote Disclaimer: 2018 US Preventative Task force recommendation on Psa screening document is 212 pages long; a tome; mind numbingly exhaustive per literature references. I challenge anyone to read it front to back including the experts aside from the authors ----- so admittedly my delivery could only at best be a vast oversimplification ---- Some studies showed a difference; others did not; yada yada yada; including the most important metric to big picture, health policy experts: pcsm=prostate cancer specific mortality --- and specifically in regard to screening: The metric: Numbers to screen in order to prevent one prostate ca death: health policy makers most important metric for valuing a screening method remember: Gilda Radner, Ovarian ca, and CA-125. I even remember Gene Wilder on TV pushing CA-125 for screening. In essence, imploring the public to rise up against the USPSTF and by implication the Federal government for keeping CA-125 secret. I mean, damn it we could be preventing ovarian cancer. Women across the country swamped their gynecologists with demand for CA-125 test. Some were positive. What ensued was an onslaught of unnecessary studies and operations with no significant impact. You do not hear about CA-125 for screening anymore. For screening, CA-125 is in the dust heap of medical history. Forgotten. Admittedly, CA-125 is great for monitoring, same story for CA19-9 for pancreatic cancer, and there are many others; but not for screening.---- PSA stands alone. It is the only cancer blood marker for screening - period. Yet, another unique feature of prostate cancer. But even it is not perfect; but only in the sense that it needs an incredibly detailed decision tree and probably more importantly near total buyin to Active surveillance to drive down overtreatment to a number which will change the guidance to: recommending screening on all 55-69 yr olds with normal life expectancy; ---- I agree with you Djin over the lifetime of a patient; admittedly a commitment; but then it is near perfect. Per the numbers to screen to prevent 1 pcsm: the studies cited vary widely from no prevention at all to 1 for 270 screened; as opposed to 1 in 1000, I quoted from the task force evidence report; clearly the taskforce calculated some sort of average of all the studies in the literature, weighted by quality of the study etc. to arrive at 1 in 1000. Objections could be made to most of the hard numbers I listed, along these lines; but that was not the point of my post; and who am I too argue with the 212 page tome vetted by many experts; not some fringe group. Just look at the whos who of the vetters. I was focusing on stuff, not covered or skirted over by the tome: a. the psychology and penetrance/acceptance of active surveillance b. the development by Epstein of a non-metastasizing Gleason grade 3 CA which dovetailed perfectly into the concept of active surveillance; making prostate CA truly unique in this other way aside from all other unique features; c. political/sociological differences between U.S and the rest of the advanced scientific world.",

      "Content": "In 2012, the USPSTF (U.S. Preventive Services Task Force) recommended against Psa screening for prostate cancer. That 2012 taskforce was right, in the aggregate, bean counterway, that PSA screening resulted in alot, alot of overtreatment and resultant cost without significant impact on mortality; but one huge downside is for example: there are Forum Brothers who are casualties of that failure to screen including myself. Dr. Ahlering's recent study: highlighting the consequences of that 2012 taskforce recommendation; a rise in the incidence of higher stage disease - a step backwards in the fight against prostate CA. entitled \"Unintended consequences of decreased PSA-based prostate cancer screening [2018]; was significant in the crusade against this recommendation. - in Djin's research subforum This crusade against the 2012 recommendation resulted in the USPSTF changing course. Just recently, USPSTF changed their guidance: and now recommends that for the 55-69 age group, the decision to be screened for PCa with PSA-based testing should be an individual one. I started this thread not to list the above general directives: 2012 - don't screen; 2018 - individual decision but to list the hard numbers used to arrive at these consensus statements; so you can attempt to draw your own, in part emotional, conclusions yourself. What follows are the unedited hard numbers that were used to reach the above recommendations: USPSTF described the number of harms and benefits with PSA screening, which can be quantified over a 10- to 15-year period. They estimate that if 1,000 men were offered a PSA test, 240 would screen positive, leading to positive biopsies in 100. But 20.7% to 50.4% of these men will actually have indolent disease that never grows or metastasizes, according to the evidence report. Of the 100 men with biopsy positive PCa, 80 will opt for definitive treatment with surgery or radiotherapy (RT) immediately or after a period of active surveillance (AS). Post-treatment, 50 men will experience long-term erectile dysfunction (ED) and 15 will experience long-term urinary incontinence (UI). And while 1.3 PCa deaths would be prevented over 13 yrs., five men would still die from PCa despite definitive treatment. To repeat, the main reason I started this thread is to challenge everyone to draw their own conclusions regarding the above numbers. One emotional exercise is to imagine yourself in a room of one thousand men; then imagine 240 of you would be shunted into a room to get a biopsy; and then after the biopsy, 100 of you would be told you have cancer. Remember the shock and awe of being told you have cancer. I certainly do. It was one of those John F. Kennedy was assassinated, the man on the moon, or 9/11 moments. Then after 100 of you have been told you have cancer; 21-50 are then mind tweaked - told that you really do not have clinically meaningful cancer we still do not have a good semantic word for this uncancer/precancer Gleason 3 which can not metastasize: defined and confirmed by Dr. Epstein in a study of 17k cases. Furthermore, the semantic: indolent cancer, has not solved the low acceptance rate of AS by patients in the U.S. compared to Europe and Australia. Because maybe to choose AS, you have to feel Clint Eastwood lucky? - Tangential thought: for this semantic argument, we do not need the expert molecular biologist Robert Weinberg who defined what cancer is, do not need the expert urologic pathologist, Dr. Epstein who redefined Gleason 3, in effect shrinking it into a smaller better prognosis cohort which serendipitously virtually never metastasizes and dovetails perfectly into the concept of active surveillance; an expert urologic surgeon, radiation or medical oncologist; but a dual English/Psychology expert because cancer is such an emotionally charged word with the automatic Clint Eastwood reflex to treat early and ask questions later. Or if I may: I could not help myself, my apologies: \"I know what you're thinking. Did he fire six shots or only five? Well, to tell you the truth, in all this excitement, I've kinda lost track myself. But being as this is a .44 magnum, the most powerful handgun in the world, and would blow your head clean off, you've got to ask yourself one question: \"Do I feel lucky?\" Well, do ya, punk?\u201d After the 100 of you who are told you have cancer are mind tweaked that 21-50 of you really have something else which we do not have a good term for; we are then told most of the 100 will opt for treatment and many will have ED or continence issues; but only 1 will be cured of prostate cancer and 5 will actually die of prostate cancer despite treatment. Would you want to step in that room of 1000 men and be screened? And btw; I forgot to bring up cost, time, and anxiety would you want to get on that emotional roller coaster knowing that a. only 1 of you will be cured by the interventions, b. 20-50 will be overtreated c. and 5 will die anyway despite treatment, their grieving family thinking that if only we had pulled the trigger sooner as opposed to the probable truth that either the horse had already left the barn years before primary treatment even began or conventional therapy did not work. In this exercise, I am of course ignoring many new developments in prostate cancer Psa based screening including psa density, phi score, MRI guidance, molecular tests, 2014 Gleason grading revision, Ahlering's study, among many others which lead to better guidance for who bests qualifies for biopsy, active surveillance etc. ----- which taken together in combination with greater acceptance of AS resulted in the corrected USPSTF guidance. The 2012 taskforce did not have the benefit of all of this new information in 2012. And I quote \"...recognition that active surveillance, rather than treatment, of low-risk cancers was becoming much more common\". I translate this: Just as Wall Street translates the Fed Chairman's cryptic measured imprimaturs - the U.S. has greater consumer buyin to AS in 2018 vs 12. Now that you have reached your conclusion. I now want to reveal what the answer is: according to the experts --- regarding the hard data above, in 2018; not 2012. Prostate-Specific Antigen-Based Screening for Prostate Cancer: A Systematic Evidence Review for the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30085502 Also, linked in Djin research forum. USPTF CONCLUSIONS: \"PSA screening for prostate cancer may reduce risk of prostate cancer mortality but is associated with harms including false-positive results, biopsy complications, and overdiagnosis in 20 percent to 50 percent of screen-detected prostate cancers. Early, active treatment for screen-detected prostate cancer may reduce the risk of metastatic disease, although the long-term impact of early, active treatment on prostate cancer mortality remains unclear. Active treatments for prostate cancer are frequently associated with sexual and urinary difficulties.\" Overdiagnosis = Gleason 3 semantic issue. But if Gleason 3 is cancer, which it is by molecular biology, then it is not an overdiagnosis to call it cancer; But if it does not metastasize and the only surrogate for pcsm and overall survival is distant metastasis; not bcr - then, by clinical translational research, it is not cancer. To translate, even the USPSTF considers Gleason 3 cancer; not cancer: Epstein truly is God. But what should we call it; the semantic problem and thus emotional problem. Emotional problem because if you can walk around with untreated CA, and you emotion like Clint Eastwood, you must feel lucky. But if you are walking around with e.g. family history of pca or some other risk factor, you just monitor closely and don't sweat it. And, unlike most of us prostate Ca patients, the experts use measured Fedspeak regarding screening: \"mays\" and \"unclears\" as their concluding statements; even in 2018. The emotional conclusion of patients, if I may speak for everyone, is not measured USPTFspeak: but Get screened by PSA, for the 50-69 age group with normal life expectancy, period, end of story; despite the experts above 2018 measured waffle ----- but be ever mindful of the real numbers and what you are getting yourself into including, be very mindful, of our natural emotional inclination to drastically underestimate overtreatment in the face of the word cancer. It is one of the most scary words in our language. One example how human beings are very bad emotionally at judging risk is: The car versus plane paradigm. I know the facts: flying is actually the safest mode of transportation. In fact, the odds of a plane crash are one for every 1.2 million flights, with odds of dying one in 11 million. Your chances of dying in a car accident are one in 5,000; approximately 37k deaths per year. Yet, even knowing these facts, I have a fear of flying and do not have one qualm about getting into a car. To state it another way: I can not think of another reason why AS is not more accepted, or as accepted as in Europe or Australia except for this emotional issue. Am I missing something?

      "Content": "Originally Posted by ASAdvocate Allmo, Thanks for this detailed post. Last year, I attended a support group meeting where a veteran urologist did a slide show presenting the same facts as you did. His conclusion was that PSA testing was only saving one man per one thousand tested.. The men in the room were pretty much in an uproar, as they respected that doctor, but refused to accept the conclusion. It was a quite a meeting. I recall that everyone agreed with testing, and blamed the urologists for being too eager to rush men into surgery. The presenter assured them that AS was on dramatic recent rise, and that more options were being discussed, at least in larger practices. ASA, Regarding my question to forum brothers: I am curious what the poll results of forum brothers would be regarding screening with psa for 55-69 males with normal life expectancy. Do you agree with 1, 2, or 3? 1. no screening - 2012 USPSTF 2. maybe screen - 2018 USPSTF --- actually to be fair - dubbed smarter screening; parsing risk analysis, e.g. family history, african american, etc 3. Screen. Period. End of story. ASA - Thank you for taking the poll. You got me my answer, kind of/with caveats. The answer: Door number 3 - \"everyone agreed with testing\", but if you will allow me to take it to further emotional hyperbole, backed up by your scientific observation of \"uproar\" Your poll results stated more emotionally: - Everyone agreed with testing. Period. End of story. Clint Eastwood style. Errata: No. Not Clint Eastwood. He is calm, cool, and collected and just asks how lucky do you feel; with his one shot magnum - More like Stallone aka rocky or rambo who comes out with punches/automatic weapons ablazing/\"uproar\"; Your patient cohort for this poll, I suspect, has tremendous selection bias and lead time bias probably a much more savy, educated group; having already been diagnosed with prostate ca and able and motivated to do research, including enough to join a support group; certainly not at all comparable to average cohort of newly diagnosed, shock and awe patients, who know less to nothing, newly walking into our world: welcome to the forum: with fear of cancer and then fear of delay in treatment of cancer. The forum does a great job of re-assuring and talking many off the cliff of panic. Including myself - thank you Chuck and the forum. Stated another way: I had 15 to 30 minutes total with my urologist post delivery of the shock and awe message: you have cancer. How much could I have possibly asked, how much could I have possibly absorbed: before emotionally arriving at - treat and treat fast. ask questions later. This selection and lead time bias explains your support group's complete acceptance of the concept of active surveillance and thus their reasoned and correct objection to the experts USTFP 2012 directive and since your poll is dated 2017, I suspect even to the revised 2018 directive of \"maybe\" But what they are not taking into account is the directive is aimed at all patients, and all patients are not as aware or accepting of AS as your support group. And that acceptance is necessary in our era of shared decision making. ----- And just as you reported your veteran urologist countered: \"The presenter assured them that AS was on dramatic recent rise, and that more options were being discussed, at least in larger practices.\" The task force : countered - \"...recognition that active surveillance, rather than treatment, of low-risk cancers was becoming much more common\". The key in this whole taskforce change: is both a. the concept and refinement of the concept of active surveillance and b. patient's and for that matter doctor's emotional acceptance of active surveillance which is completely emotionally counterintuitive to our core. A. is fixed by facts/science B. is fluid and emotional ---- The B is what is causing our lag behind Europe and Australia. What everyone including your veteran urologist may not have emphasized. This change could not have happened without Dr. Epstein's - the one and only titan period of Prostate cancer grading - breakthru: E=mc2 moment of both creating a smaller better prognosis cohort of Gleason 3 patients; but furthermore creating one that surrendipitously does not metastasize - study of 17k patients. I know many of the caveats including ca heterogeneity, ca transformation, sampling error, pathologist grading error, etc.; I am sure Djin can come up with many more. but that is all baked into the active surveillance concept which is at the statistical clinical translational level; not at the light microscopic level: pathologist sampling error, or pathologist grading error, or even at the molecular biology level of tumor heterogeneity and transformation: by way of oncogenes/accelerators of psadt, tumor suppressor genes/brakes/dna repair/cell death/apoptosis, anti-immune and pro-angiogenesis mechanisms, etc. One of the huge laments on this board and by all patients is the uncertainty of all this stuff and you have to go with your gut/emotion, and thus the concept of shared decision making. But on the statistical clinical translational research level: 100% no metastasis to lymph nodes, 100% no lymphovascular space invasion, rare 0.03% seminal vesicle invasion, and uncommon 2% non-focal EPE is as good as you could possibly get studying 17k Radical prostatectomy with lymphadenectomy specimens at Johns Hopkins for de facto evidence of no metastatic potential. Actually, it is mind boggling serendipitous to me. E=mc2 Dr. Epstein. How did you pull that rabbit out of your hat? In part, thru several revisions over many years, 2014 was not the 1st revision, there were several Epstein revisions prior to 2014: continually reducing the Gleason 3 category into smaller and smaller cohorts of better prognosis patients. How he got to absolute zero though was serendipitous. The concept of active surveillance allows for knowledge to counter gut/emotion. And I believe another breakthru could be semantic from an English/psychology professor. I quote from a recent Epstein article: \"The lack of metastatic potential of GS6 cancer has led to the argument to remove the label cancer from this lesion. Instead some experts have suggested labeling GS6 cancer as IDLE to reduce the patient fear of cancer, which would hopefully lead to an increase in active surveillance. Several articles in the literature have listed the pros and cons of relabeling GS6 as not cancer.\" So, academic urologic pathologists proposed: IDLE (indolent lesion of epithelial origin) - by clinical translation research, 100% correct - But quite awkward if I do so say myself. And rejected by Epstein. But even if Epstein gave it his imprimatur, it never would have had a chance in hell to catch on with rank and file urologists, the minions, who would have to deliver the cryptic/awkward \"good\" news. Go explain IDLE to the average joe in 15 minutes. Good luck. And then get them on board with Active surveillance; even better luck; especially if that average Joe is Clint Eastwood. Tangent: One of the most mind tweak concepts I have come across regarding prostate cancer is the Will Rogers phenomenon. You have to google it and try to wrap your head around it --- it is truly a mind tweak, like no other; and if mentioned at all in research papers is buried as a caveat/limitation -- grade migration or some other non-eloquent set of words. Which comes into play loud and clear regarding Epstein's shrinking Gleason 3 cancer into a much better prognosis cancer; nay non-metastasizing non-cancer.",

      "Content": "Djin: All of your points are well taken and I agree with them. Especially, and I quote you: the solution to overtreatment is simply to stop overtreatment with Active Surveillance, not to stop screening. But there were many problems to AS in 2012 including but not limited to, it predated Epstein's shrinking Gleason 3 to a better prognosis cohort that does not metastasize, among other subsequent refinements on the science side; and as pointed out by the taskforce, lack of buyin by patients and doctors for Active Surveillance on the consumer side. Barring the 10-15 year time period limitation, (btw, not Allmo's limitation, this is the taskforce/literature limitation) which is admittedly too short for prostate cancer; but come on, be realistic that is largely what the literature consists of; -- furthermore, you are going to have to wait a long time for prospective followup with the new screen parsing and Epstein regrading of 3 in 2014, way beyond the lifetime of most reading this, to get 20-25 year data; so that is a valid criticism of the data the taskforce used to inform its directives; but an unrealistic criticism: there will be no 20-25 yr old data for a long time - Let alone in 20-25 years, we are going to be in a new science fiction world of prostate cancer directed therapy at the molecular level which will cure cancer as opposed to the blind shotgun approach of for example RT. And last - of course positive DRE = higher stage >/= pT2 largely taking it out of AS; clinicalT2a exceptions exist for AS. otherwise all of your caveats and nuances are baked into the beauty/science of Active Surveillance as the solution to the 2012 guidance against screening with Psa - AS will be the subject of continued research and refinement and thus only get more perfect, marginally and AS will continue to have increasing acceptance by USA doctors, softened by \"shared decision making\", with greater acceptance by patients ---- Acceptance rates in US: from a low of 6.7% in the years from 1990 to 2009, to 40.4% in the period 2010 to 2013; but AS at 40% in 2013 still lags behind the frontrunners/leaders Europe and Australia - their acceptance rates are much higher. In part because, they have less patient advocacy, less shared decision making, emotional stuff to deal with. There doctors can just follow the hard facts including not doing standard of care - the latter a legal concept in the U.S. which handcuffs doctors, even the experts into doing what the herd does. Admittedly the herd is right in the vast majority of instances; but when a groundbreaking advance occurs such as ultrasensitive imaging especially psma based imaging; there is no clinical translational data to to know for sure for the foreseeable future: for consensus/standard of care directives to be made; and in Europe and Australia, patients more readily just trust their doctors. There are pros and cons to both systems. You should just be aware of the differences. Tangential thought: Europe, Asia, and Australia lead the USA in other prostate Ca mind tweak concepts, which run against longstanding conventional concepts, besides AS. This includes the mentioned above ultrasensitive imaging technologies; but also one of its major corollaries directed therapies, in general, and salvage surgery in particular; and active surveillance in the bcr phase of the disease for select patients who have low risk bcr: including low detectable but stable bcr and late to bcr, low psa velocity, low Grade group and stage patients. Both these future mind tweak concepts which have relevance in the bcr stage of disease: challenge us for a word for recurrent stage 4 ca that can be treated with non-systemic/directed therapy in combination with systemic therapy, and probably eventually with delayed and eventually without standard of care systemic therapy; for a select subset of patients; from indolent bcr to prostate bed only recurrence to pelvic and immediately extrapelvic lymph node recurrence to oligometastatic recurrent ca including oligometastases to bone. Basal cell carcinoma of the skin will not inform us; nor will ductal carcinoma in situ of the breast inform us; nor will papillary carcinoma of the thyroid inform us ---- all peculiar forms of low end cancer for different reasons which do not completely fit low volume, low psa, low molecular score, Gleason 3 prostate biopsy cancer or indolent bcr or prostate bed only recurrence. The bcr recurrent phase: another shock and awe that I myself am facing/heading for. I am at 0.026 -- with beyond psa anxiety. I better take Pom-T, exercise, lose weight, cholesterol and glucose lower, etc. etc. and pray. The only things in my control at this point. lol. This/these concepts are and will be mind tweaks/counterintuitive even to doctors. Doctor's are emotional beings, also, and were trained as a first, second, and third approximation -- the best treatment of cancer, except for prevention, is treat early, end of story. trained that in the U.S., the only treatment is standard of care, end of story, informed by our legal malpractice system; even if you know your European and Australian counterparts are pushing the facts/frontiers forward in front of you. And for stage 4 disease: treat systemically. end of story. No, I need to correct myself; there is a well accepted exception to the above in pca: stage 4 prostate bed only recurrence post RP: standard of care is salvage RT; except that at the low psa levels required for benefit, with our standard of care conventional CT and bone scan, we are blind as to where the recurrence really is, including whether or not it is really confined to the prostate bed --- the new ultrasensitive imaging technologies open the blinders, at least in the 0.2 to 10-20 range where conventional studies, bone and CT scan, could not. Furthermore we may really be curing nothing with salvage RT in low risk patients (uncancer/precancer and even benign tissue), but admittedly resetting the psa clock back to zero in the majority - Up to 70% for low risk patients, informed by MSK nomogram. And several current large retrospective studies coming out of Italy, some in conjunction with USA including Mayo clinic, showing that after substratifying by risk this lowest risk 70% cured by salvage RT really are not benefitted at all, except for setting the psa clock back to zero. Active surveillance was a hard sell even to doctors. Just as directed therapies for early recurrence which are coming are going to be hard sells; because it flies in the face of conventional oncologic theory. But prostate ca is different. And ultrasensitive imaging will reveal the natural pattern of spread of the disease in the 0.2 to 10-20 psa range which was up until now hidden. It will be shown to be much more stepwise than almost any cancer known except basal cell carcinoma and papillary carcinoma of the thyroid. ----- In summary, the guidance changed for 3 reasons, in my opinion: 1. Acceptance rate of active surveillance increased 2. AS science improved 3. Ahlering research that lack of screening resulted in actual theoretic harm: stage migration 4. cynically, political pressure - uproar from the masses. Not. USPTF were a scientific body despite the Federal mandate and thus title. But correct me, if I am wrong.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by ASAdvocate Allmo, Thanks for this detailed post. Last year, I attended a support group meeting where a veteran urologist did a slide show presenting the same facts as you did. His conclusion was that PSA testing was only saving one man per one thousand tested.. The men in the room were pretty much in an uproar, as they respected that doctor, but refused to accept the conclusion. It was a quite a meeting. I recall that everyone agreed with testing, and blamed the urologists for being too eager to rush men into surgery. The presenter assured them that AS was on dramatic recent rise, and that more options were being discussed, at least in larger practices. ASA, Regarding my question to forum brothers: I am curious what the poll results of forum brothers would be regarding screening with psa for 55-69 males with normal life expectancy. Do you agree with 1, 2, or 3? 1. no screening - 2012 USPSTF 2. maybe screen - 2018 USPSTF --- actually to be fair - dubbed smarter screening; parsing risk analysis, e.g. family history, african american, etc 3. Screen. Period. End of story. ASA - Thank you for taking the poll. You got me my answer, kind of/with caveats. The answer: Door number 3 - \"everyone agreed with testing\", but if you will allow me to take it to further emotional hyperbole, backed up by your scientific observation of \"uproar\" Your poll results stated more emotionally: - Everyone agreed with testing. Period. End of story. Clint Eastwood style. Errata: No. Not Clint Eastwood. He is calm, cool, and collected and just asks how lucky do you feel; with his one shot magnum - More like Stallone aka rocky or rambo who comes out with punches/automatic weapons ablazing/\"uproar\"; Your patient cohort for this poll, I suspect, has tremendous selection bias and lead time bias probably a much more savy, educated group; having already been diagnosed with prostate ca and able and motivated to do research, including enough to join a support group; certainly not at all comparable to average cohort of newly diagnosed, shock and awe patients, who know less to nothing, newly walking into our world: welcome to the forum: with fear of cancer and then fear of delay in treatment of cancer. The forum does a great job of re-assuring and talking many off the cliff of panic. Including myself - thank you Chuck and the forum. Stated another way: I had 15 to 30 minutes total with my urologist post delivery of the shock and awe message: you have cancer. How much could I have possibly asked, how much could I have possibly absorbed: before emotionally arriving at - treat and treat fast. ask questions later. This selection and lead time bias explains your support group's complete acceptance of the concept of active surveillance and thus their reasoned and correct objection to the experts USTFP 2012 directive and since your poll is dated 2017, I suspect even to the revised 2018 directive of \"maybe\" But what they are not taking into account is the directive is aimed at all patients, and all patients are not as aware or accepting of AS as your support group. And that acceptance is necessary in our era of shared decision making. ----- And just as you reported your veteran urologist countered: \"The presenter assured them that AS was on dramatic recent rise, and that more options were being discussed, at least in larger practices.\" The task force : countered - \"...recognition that active surveillance, rather than treatment, of low-risk cancers was becoming much more common\". The key in this whole taskforce change: is both a. the concept and refinement of the concept of active surveillance and b. patient's and for that matter doctor's emotional acceptance of active surveillance which is completely emotionally counterintuitive to our core. A. is fixed by facts/science B. is fluid and emotional ---- The B is what is causing our lag behind Europe and Australia. What everyone including your veteran urologist may not have emphasized. This change could not have happened without Dr. Epstein's - the one and only titan period of Prostate cancer grading - breakthru: E=mc2 moment of both creating a smaller better prognosis cohort of Gleason 3 patients; but furthermore creating one that surrendipitously does not metastasize - study of 17k patients. I know many of the caveats including ca heterogeneity, ca transformation, sampling error, pathologist grading error, etc.; I am sure Djin can come up with many more. but that is all baked into the active surveillance concept which is at the statistical clinical translational level; not at the light microscopic level: pathologist sampling error, or pathologist grading error, or even at the molecular biology level of tumor heterogeneity and transformation: by way of oncogenes/accelerators of psadt, tumor suppressor genes/brakes/dna repair/cell death/apoptosis, anti-immune and pro-angiogenesis mechanisms, etc. One of the huge laments on this board and by all patients is the uncertainty of all this stuff and you have to go with your gut/emotion, and thus the concept of shared decision making. But on the statistical clinical translational research level: 100% no metastasis to lymph nodes, 100% no lymphovascular space invasion, rare 0.03% seminal vesicle invasion, and uncommon 2% non-focal EPE is as good as you could possibly get studying 17k Radical prostatectomy with lymphadenectomy specimens at Johns Hopkins for de facto evidence of no metastatic potential. Actually, it is mind boggling serendipitous to me. E=mc2 Dr. Epstein. How did you pull that rabbit out of your hat? In part, thru several revisions over many years, 2014 was not the 1st revision, there were several Epstein revisions prior to 2014: continually reducing the Gleason 3 category into smaller and smaller cohorts of better prognosis patients. How he got to absolute zero though was serendipitous. The concept of active surveillance allows for knowledge to counter gut/emotion. And I believe another breakthru could be semantic from an English/psychology professor. I quote from a recent Epstein article: \"The lack of metastatic potential of GS6 cancer has led to the argument to remove the label cancer from this lesion. Instead some experts have suggested labeling GS6 cancer as IDLE to reduce the patient fear of cancer, which would hopefully lead to an increase in active surveillance. Several articles in the literature have listed the pros and cons of relabeling GS6 as not cancer.\" So, academic urologic pathologists proposed: IDLE (indolent lesion of epithelial origin) - by clinical translation research, 100% correct - But quite awkward if I do so say myself. And rejected by Epstein. But even if Epstein gave it his imprimatur, it never would have had a chance in hell to catch on with rank and file urologists, the minions, who would have to deliver the cryptic/awkward \"good\" news. Go explain IDLE to the average joe in 15 minutes. Good luck. And then get them on board with Active surveillance; even better luck; especially if that average Joe is Clint Eastwood. Tangent: One of the most mind tweak concepts I have come across regarding prostate cancer is the Will Rogers phenomenon. You have to google it and try to wrap your head around it --- it is truly a mind tweak, like no other; and if mentioned at all in research papers is buried as a caveat/limitation -- grade migration or some other non-eloquent set of words. Which comes into play loud and clear regarding Epstein's shrinking Gleason 3 cancer into a much better prognosis cancer; nay non-metastasizing non-cancer.",

      "Content": "In 2012, the USPSTF (U.S. Preventive Services Task Force) recommended against Psa screening for prostate cancer. That 2012 taskforce was right, in the aggregate, bean counterway, that PSA screening resulted in alot, alot of overtreatment and resultant cost without significant impact on mortality; but one huge downside is for example: there are Forum Brothers who are casualties of that failure to screen including myself. Dr. Ahlering's recent study: highlighting the consequences of that 2012 taskforce recommendation; a rise in the incidence of higher stage disease - a step backwards in the fight against prostate CA. entitled \"Unintended consequences of decreased PSA-based prostate cancer screening [2018]; was significant in the crusade against this recommendation. - in Djin's research subforum This crusade against the 2012 recommendation resulted in the USPSTF changing course. Just recently, USPSTF changed their guidance: and now recommends that for the 55-69 age group, the decision to be screened for PCa with PSA-based testing should be an individual one. I started this thread not to list the above general directives: 2012 - don't screen; 2018 - individual decision but to list the hard numbers used to arrive at these consensus statements; so you can attempt to draw your own, in part emotional, conclusions yourself. What follows are the unedited hard numbers that were used to reach the above recommendations: USPSTF described the number of harms and benefits with PSA screening, which can be quantified over a 10- to 15-year period. They estimate that if 1,000 men were offered a PSA test, 240 would screen positive, leading to positive biopsies in 100. But 20.7% to 50.4% of these men will actually have indolent disease that never grows or metastasizes, according to the evidence report. Of the 100 men with biopsy positive PCa, 80 will opt for definitive treatment with surgery or radiotherapy (RT) immediately or after a period of active surveillance (AS). Post-treatment, 50 men will experience long-term erectile dysfunction (ED) and 15 will experience long-term urinary incontinence (UI). And while 1.3 PCa deaths would be prevented over 13 yrs., five men would still die from PCa despite definitive treatment. To repeat, the main reason I started this thread is to challenge everyone to draw their own conclusions regarding the above numbers. One emotional exercise is to imagine yourself in a room of one thousand men; then imagine 240 of you would be shunted into a room to get a biopsy; and then after the biopsy, 100 of you would be told you have cancer. Remember the shock and awe of being told you have cancer. I certainly do. It was one of those John F. Kennedy was assassinated, the man on the moon, or 9/11 moments. Then after 100 of you have been told you have cancer; 21-50 are then mind tweaked - told that you really do not have clinically meaningful cancer we still do not have a good semantic word for this uncancer/precancer Gleason 3 which can not metastasize: defined and confirmed by Dr. Epstein in a study of 17k cases. Furthermore, the semantic: indolent cancer, has not solved the low acceptance rate of AS by patients in the U.S. compared to Europe and Australia. Because maybe to choose AS, you have to feel Clint Eastwood lucky? - Tangential thought: for this semantic argument, we do not need the expert molecular biologist Robert Weinberg who defined what cancer is, do not need the expert urologic pathologist, Dr. Epstein who redefined Gleason 3, in effect shrinking it into a smaller better prognosis cohort which serendipitously virtually never metastasizes and dovetails perfectly into the concept of active surveillance; an expert urologic surgeon, radiation or medical oncologist; but a dual English/Psychology expert because cancer is such an emotionally charged word with the automatic Clint Eastwood reflex to treat early and ask questions later. Or if I may: I could not help myself, my apologies: \"I know what you're thinking. Did he fire six shots or only five? Well, to tell you the truth, in all this excitement, I've kinda lost track myself. But being as this is a .44 magnum, the most powerful handgun in the world, and would blow your head clean off, you've got to ask yourself one question: \"Do I feel lucky?\" Well, do ya, punk?\u201d After the 100 of you who are told you have cancer are mind tweaked that 21-50 of you really have something else which we do not have a good term for; we are then told most of the 100 will opt for treatment and many will have ED or continence issues; but only 1 will be cured of prostate cancer and 5 will actually die of prostate cancer despite treatment. Would you want to step in that room of 1000 men and be screened? And btw; I forgot to bring up cost, time, and anxiety would you want to get on that emotional roller coaster knowing that a. only 1 of you will be cured by the interventions, b. 20-50 will be overtreated c. and 5 will die anyway despite treatment, their grieving family thinking that if only we had pulled the trigger sooner as opposed to the probable truth that either the horse had already left the barn years before primary treatment even began or conventional therapy did not work. In this exercise, I am of course ignoring many new developments in prostate cancer Psa based screening including psa density, phi score, MRI guidance, molecular tests, 2014 Gleason grading revision, Ahlering's study, among many others which lead to better guidance for who bests qualifies for biopsy, active surveillance etc. ----- which taken together in combination with greater acceptance of AS resulted in the corrected USPSTF guidance. The 2012 taskforce did not have the benefit of all of this new information in 2012. And I quote \"...recognition that active surveillance, rather than treatment, of low-risk cancers was becoming much more common\". I translate this: Just as Wall Street translates the Fed Chairman's cryptic measured imprimaturs - the U.S. has greater consumer buyin to AS in 2018 vs 12. Now that you have reached your conclusion. I now want to reveal what the answer is: according to the experts --- regarding the hard data above, in 2018; not 2012. Prostate-Specific Antigen-Based Screening for Prostate Cancer: A Systematic Evidence Review for the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30085502 Also, linked in Djin research forum. USPTF CONCLUSIONS: \"PSA screening for prostate cancer may reduce risk of prostate cancer mortality but is associated with harms including false-positive results, biopsy complications, and overdiagnosis in 20 percent to 50 percent of screen-detected prostate cancers. Early, active treatment for screen-detected prostate cancer may reduce the risk of metastatic disease, although the long-term impact of early, active treatment on prostate cancer mortality remains unclear. Active treatments for prostate cancer are frequently associated with sexual and urinary difficulties.\" Overdiagnosis = Gleason 3 semantic issue. But if Gleason 3 is cancer, which it is by molecular biology, then it is not an overdiagnosis to call it cancer; But if it does not metastasize and the only surrogate for pcsm and overall survival is distant metastasis; not bcr - then, by clinical translational research, it is not cancer. To translate, even the USPSTF considers Gleason 3 cancer; not cancer: Epstein truly is God. But what should we call it; the semantic problem and thus emotional problem. Emotional problem because if you can walk around with untreated CA, and you emotion like Clint Eastwood, you must feel lucky. But if you are walking around with e.g. family history of pca or some other risk factor, you just monitor closely and don't sweat it. And, unlike most of us prostate Ca patients, the experts use measured Fedspeak regarding screening: \"mays\" and \"unclears\" as their concluding statements; even in 2018. The emotional conclusion of patients, if I may speak for everyone, is not measured USPTFspeak: but Get screened by PSA, for the 50-69 age group with normal life expectancy, period, end of story; despite the experts above 2018 measured waffle ----- but be ever mindful of the real numbers and what you are getting yourself into including, be very mindful, of our natural emotional inclination to drastically underestimate overtreatment in the face of the word cancer. It is one of the most scary words in our language. One example how human beings are very bad emotionally at judging risk is: The car versus plane paradigm. I know the facts: flying is actually the safest mode of transportation. In fact, the odds of a plane crash are one for every 1.2 million flights, with odds of dying one in 11 million. Your chances of dying in a car accident are one in 5,000; approximately 37k deaths per year. Yet, even knowing these facts, I have a fear of flying and do not have one qualm about getting into a car. To state it another way: I can not think of another reason why AS is not more accepted, or as accepted as in Europe or Australia except for this emotional issue. Am I missing something? I believe we should be aware of this emotional skewing of the facts ---- And really we should be asking our doctors; if you were in my risk boat, not weighing in my emotional leaning/shared decision making, what would you choose. Just food, hard numbers, for thought. And caution of how emotions play into risk analysis. I am curious what the poll results of forum brothers would be regarding screening with psa for 50-69 males with normal life expectancy 1. no screening - 2012 2. maybe - 2018; actually to be fair - dubbed smarter screening; parsing risk analysis 3. screen, one size fits all/across the board screening, period end of story.",

      "Content": "Djin: All of your points are well taken and I agree with them. Especially, and I quote you: the solution to overtreatment is simply to stop overtreatment with Active Surveillance, not to stop screening. But there were many problems to AS in 2012 including but not limited to, it predated Epstein's shrinking Gleason 3 to a better prognosis cohort that does not metastasize, among other subsequent refinements on the science side; and as pointed out by the taskforce, lack of buyin by patients and doctors for Active Surveillance on the consumer side. Barring the 10-15 year time period limitation, (btw, not Allmo's limitation, this is the taskforce/literature limitation) which is admittedly too short for prostate cancer; but come on, be realistic that is largely what the literature consists of; -- furthermore, you are going to have to wait a long time for prospective followup with the new screen parsing and Epstein regrading of 3 in 2014, way beyond the lifetime of most reading this, to get 20-25 year data; so that is a valid criticism of the data the taskforce used to inform its directives; but an unrealistic criticism: there will be no 20-25 yr old data for a long time - Let alone in 20-25 years, we are going to be in a new science fiction world of prostate cancer directed therapy at the molecular level which will cure cancer as opposed to the blind shotgun approach of for example RT. And last - of course positive DRE = higher stage >/= pT2 largely taking it out of AS; clinicalT2a exceptions exist for AS. otherwise all of your caveats and nuances are baked into the beauty/science of Active Surveillance as the solution to the 2012 guidance against screening with Psa - AS will be the subject of continued research and refinement and thus only get more perfect, marginally and AS will continue to have increasing acceptance by USA doctors, softened by \"shared decision making\", with greater acceptance by patients ---- Acceptance rates in US: from a low of 6.7% in the years from 1990 to 2009, to 40.4% in the period 2010 to 2013; but AS at 40% in 2013 still lags behind the frontrunners/leaders Europe and Australia - their acceptance rates are much higher. In part because, they have less patient advocacy, less shared decision making, emotional stuff to deal with. There doctors can just follow the hard facts including not doing standard of care - the latter a legal concept in the U.S. which handcuffs doctors, even the experts into doing what the herd does. Admittedly the herd is right in the vast majority of instances; but when a groundbreaking advance occurs such as ultrasensitive imaging especially psma based imaging; there is no clinical translational data to to know for sure for the foreseeable future: for consensus/standard of care directives to be made; and in Europe and Australia, patients more readily just trust their doctors. There are pros and cons to both systems. You should just be aware of the differences. Tangential thought: Europe, Asia, and Australia lead the USA in other prostate Ca mind tweak concepts, which run against longstanding conventional concepts, besides AS. This includes the mentioned above ultrasensitive imaging technologies; but also one of its major corollaries directed therapies, in general, and salvage surgery in particular; and active surveillance in the bcr phase of the disease for select patients who have low risk bcr: including low detectable but stable bcr and late to bcr, low psa velocity, low Grade group and stage patients. Both these future mind tweak concepts which have relevance in the bcr stage of disease: challenge us for a word for recurrent stage 4 ca that can be treated with non-systemic/directed therapy in combination with systemic therapy, and probably eventually with delayed and eventually without standard of care systemic therapy; for a select subset of patients; from indolent bcr to prostate bed only recurrence to pelvic and immediately extrapelvic lymph node recurrence to oligometastatic recurrent ca including oligometastases to bone. Basal cell carcinoma of the skin will not inform us; nor will ductal carcinoma in situ of the breast inform us; nor will papillary carcinoma of the thyroid inform us ---- all peculiar forms of low end cancer for different reasons which do not completely fit low volume, low psa, low molecular score, Gleason 3 prostate biopsy cancer or indolent bcr or prostate bed only recurrence. The bcr recurrent phase: another shock and awe that I myself am facing/heading for. I am at 0.026 -- with beyond psa anxiety. I better take Pom-T, exercise, lose weight, cholesterol and glucose lower, etc. etc. and pray. The only things in my control at this point. lol. This/these concepts are and will be mind tweaks/counterintuitive even to doctors. Doctor's are emotional beings, also, and were trained as a first, second, and third approximation -- the best treatment of cancer, except for prevention, is treat early, end of story. trained that in the U.S., the only treatment is standard of care, end of story, informed by our legal malpractice system; even if you know your European and Australian counterparts are pushing the facts/frontiers forward in front of you. And for stage 4 disease: treat systemically. end of story. No, I need to correct myself; there is a well accepted exception to the above in pca: stage 4 prostate bed only recurrence post RP: standard of care is salvage RT; except that at the low psa levels required for benefit, with our standard of care conventional CT and bone scan, we are blind as to where the recurrence really is, including whether or not it is really confined to the prostate bed --- the new ultrasensitive imaging technologies open the blinders, at least in the 0.2 to 10-20 range where conventional studies, bone and CT scan, could not. Furthermore we may really be curing nothing with salvage RT in low risk patients (uncancer/precancer and even benign tissue), but admittedly resetting the psa clock back to zero in the majority - Up to 70% for low risk patients, informed by MSK nomogram. And several current large retrospective studies coming out of Italy, some in conjunction with USA including Mayo clinic, showing that after substratifying by risk this lowest risk 70% cured by salvage RT really are not benefitted at all, except for setting the psa clock back to zero. Active surveillance was a hard sell even to doctors. Just as directed therapies for early recurrence which are coming are going to be hard sells; because it flies in the face of conventional oncologic theory. But prostate ca is different. And ultrasensitive imaging will reveal the natural pattern of spread of the disease in the 0.2 to 10-20 psa range which was up until now hidden. It will be shown to be much more stepwise than almost any cancer known except basal cell carcinoma and papillary carcinoma of the thyroid. ----- In summary, the guidance changed for 3 reasons, in my opinion: 1. Acceptance rate of active surveillance increased 2. AS science improved 3. Ahlering research that lack of screening resulted in actual theoretic harm: stage migration 4. cynically, political pressure - uproar from the masses. Not. USPTF were a scientific body despite the Federal mandate and thus title. But correct me, if I am wrong.",

This selection and lead time bias explains your support group's complete acceptance of the concept of active surveillance and thus their reasoned and correct objection to the experts USTFP 2012 directive and since your poll is dated 2017, I suspect even to the revised 2018 directive of \"maybe\" But what they are not taking into account is the directive is aimed at all patients, and all patients are not as aware or accepting of AS as your support group. And that acceptance is necessary in our era of shared decision making. ----- And just as you reported your veteran urologist countered: \"The presenter assured them that AS was on dramatic recent rise, and that more options were being discussed, at least in larger practices.\" The task force : countered - \"...recognition that active surveillance, rather than treatment, of low-risk cancers was becoming much more common\". The key in this whole taskforce change: is both a. the concept and refinement of the concept of active surveillance and b. patient's and for that matter doctor's emotional acceptance of active surveillance which is completely emotionally counterintuitive to our core. A. is fixed by facts/science B. is fluid and emotional ---- The B is what is causing our lag behind Europe and Australia. What everyone including your veteran urologist may not have emphasized. This change could not have happened without Dr. Epstein's - the one and only titan period of Prostate cancer grading - breakthru: E=mc2 moment of both creating a smaller better prognosis cohort of Gleason 3 patients; but furthermore creating one that surrendipitously does not metastasize - study of 17k patients. I know many of the caveats including ca heterogeneity, ca transformation, sampling error, pathologist grading error, etc.; I am sure Djin can come up with many more. but that is all baked into the active surveillance concept which is at the statistical clinical translational level; not at the light microscopic level: pathologist sampling error, or pathologist grading error, or even at the molecular biology level of tumor heterogeneity and transformation: by way of oncogenes/accelerators of psadt, tumor suppressor genes/brakes/dna repair/cell death/apoptosis, anti-immune and pro-angiogenesis mechanisms, etc. One of the huge laments on this board and by all patients is the uncertainty of all this stuff and you have to go with your gut/emotion, and thus the concept of shared decision making. But on the statistical clinical translational research level: 100% no metastasis to lymph nodes, 100% no lymphovascular space invasion, rare 0.03% seminal vesicle invasion, and uncommon 2% non-focal EPE is as good as you could possibly get studying 17k Radical prostatectomy with lymphadenectomy specimens at Johns Hopkins for de facto evidence of no metastatic potential. Actually, it is mind boggling serendipitous to me. E=mc2 Dr. Epstein. How did you pull that rabbit out of your hat? In part, thru several revisions over many years, 2014 was not the 1st revision, there were several Epstein revisions prior to 2014: continually reducing the Gleason 3 category into smaller and smaller cohorts of better prognosis patients. How he got to absolute zero though was serendipitous. The concept of active surveillance allows for knowledge to counter gut/emotion. And I believe another breakthru could be semantic from an English/psychology professor. I quote from a recent Epstein article: \"The lack of metastatic potential of GS6 cancer has led to the argument to remove the label cancer from this lesion. Instead some experts have suggested labeling GS6 cancer as IDLE to reduce the patient fear of cancer, which would hopefully lead to an increase in active surveillance. Several articles in the literature have listed the pros and cons of relabeling GS6 as not cancer.\" So, academic urologic pathologists proposed: IDLE (indolent lesion of epithelial origin) - by clinical translation research, 100% correct - But quite awkward if I do so say myself. And rejected by Epstein. But even if Epstein gave it his imprimatur, it never would have had a chance in hell to catch on with rank and file urologists, the minions, who would have to deliver the cryptic/awkward \"good\" news. Go explain IDLE to the average joe in 15 minutes. Good luck. And then get them on board with Active surveillance; even better luck; especially if that average Joe is Clint Eastwood. Tangent: One of the most mind tweak concepts I have come across regarding prostate cancer is the Will Rogers phenomenon. You have to google it and try to wrap your head around it --- it is truly a mind tweak, like no other; and if mentioned at all in research papers is buried as a caveat/limitation -- grade migration or some other non-eloquent set of words. Which comes into play loud and clear regarding Epstein's shrinking Gleason 3 cancer into a much better prognosis cancer; nay non-metastasizing non-cancer.",

      "Content": "In 2012, the USPSTF (U.S. Preventive Services Task Force) recommended against Psa screening for prostate cancer. That 2012 taskforce was right, in the aggregate, bean counterway, that PSA screening resulted in alot, alot of overtreatment and resultant cost without significant impact on mortality; but one huge downside is for example: there are Forum Brothers who are casualties of that failure to screen including myself. Dr. Ahlering's recent study: highlighting the consequences of that 2012 taskforce recommendation; a rise in the incidence of higher stage disease - a step backwards in the fight against prostate CA. entitled \"Unintended consequences of decreased PSA-based prostate cancer screening [2018]; was significant in the crusade against this recommendation. - in Djin's research subforum This crusade against the 2012 recommendation resulted in the USPSTF changing course. Just recently, USPSTF changed their guidance: and now recommends that for the 55-69 age group, the decision to be screened for PCa with PSA-based testing should be an individual one. I started this thread not to list the above general directives: 2012 - don't screen; 2018 - individual decision but to list the hard numbers used to arrive at these consensus statements; so you can attempt to draw your own, in part emotional, conclusions yourself. What follows are the unedited hard numbers that were used to reach the above recommendations: USPSTF described the number of harms and benefits with PSA screening, which can be quantified over a 10- to 15-year period. They estimate that if 1,000 men were offered a PSA test, 240 would screen positive, leading to positive biopsies in 100. But 20.7% to 50.4% of these men will actually have indolent disease that never grows or metastasizes, according to the evidence report. Of the 100 men with biopsy positive PCa, 80 will opt for definitive treatment with surgery or radiotherapy (RT) immediately or after a period of active surveillance (AS). Post-treatment, 50 men will experience long-term erectile dysfunction (ED) and 15 will experience long-term urinary incontinence (UI). And while 1.3 PCa deaths would be prevented over 13 yrs., five men would still die from PCa despite definitive treatment. To repeat, the main reason I started this thread is to challenge everyone to draw their own conclusions regarding the above numbers. One emotional exercise is to imagine yourself in a room of one thousand men; then imagine 240 of you would be shunted into a room to get a biopsy; and then after the biopsy, 100 of you would be told you have cancer. Remember the shock and awe of being told you have cancer. I certainly do. It was one of those John F. Kennedy was assassinated, the man on the moon, or 9/11 moments. Then after 100 of you have been told you have cancer; 21-50 are then mind tweaked - told that you really do not have clinically meaningful cancer we still do not have a good semantic word for this uncancer/precancer Gleason 3 which can not metastasize: defined and confirmed by Dr. Epstein in a study of 17k cases. Furthermore, the semantic: indolent cancer, has not solved the low acceptance rate of AS by patients in the U.S. compared to Europe and Australia. Because maybe to choose AS, you have to feel Clint Eastwood lucky? - Tangential thought: for this semantic argument, we do not need the expert molecular biologist Robert Weinberg who defined what cancer is, do not need the expert urologic pathologist, Dr. Epstein who redefined Gleason 3, in effect shrinking it into a smaller better prognosis cohort which serendipitously virtually never metastasizes and dovetails perfectly into the concept of active surveillance; an expert urologic surgeon, radiation or medical oncologist; but a dual English/Psychology expert because cancer is such an emotionally charged word with the automatic Clint Eastwood reflex to treat early and ask questions later. Or if I may: I could not help myself, my apologies: \"I know what you're thinking. Did he fire six shots or only five? Well, to tell you the truth, in all this excitement, I've kinda lost track myself. But being as this is a .44 magnum, the most powerful handgun in the world, and would blow your head clean off, you've got to ask yourself one question: \"Do I feel lucky?\" Well, do ya, punk?\u201d After the 100 of you who are told you have cancer are mind tweaked that 21-50 of you really have something else which we do not have a good term for; we are then told most of the 100 will opt for treatment and many will have ED or continence issues; but only 1 will be cured of prostate cancer and 5 will actually die of prostate cancer despite treatment. Would you want to step in that room of 1000 men and be screened? And btw; I forgot to bring up cost, time, and anxiety would you want to get on that emotional roller coaster knowing that a. only 1 of you will be cured by the interventions, b. 20-50 will be overtreated c. and 5 will die anyway despite treatment, their grieving family thinking that if only we had pulled the trigger sooner as opposed to the probable truth that either the horse had already left the barn years before primary treatment even began or conventional therapy did not work. In this exercise, I am of course ignoring many new developments in prostate cancer Psa based screening including psa density, phi score, MRI guidance, molecular tests, 2014 Gleason grading revision, Ahlering's study, among many others which lead to better guidance for who bests qualifies for biopsy, active surveillance etc. ----- which taken together in combination with greater acceptance of AS resulted in the corrected USPSTF guidance. The 2012 taskforce did not have the benefit of all of this new information in 2012. And I quote \"...recognition that active surveillance, rather than treatment, of low-risk cancers was becoming much more common\". I translate this: Just as Wall Street translates the Fed Chairman's cryptic measured imprimaturs - the U.S. has greater consumer buyin to AS in 2018 vs 12. Now that you have reached your conclusion. I now want to reveal what the answer is: according to the experts --- regarding the hard data above, in 2018; not 2012. Prostate-Specific Antigen-Based Screening for Prostate Cancer: A Systematic Evidence Review for the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30085502 Also, linked in Djin research forum. USPTF CONCLUSIONS: \"PSA screening for prostate cancer may reduce risk of prostate cancer mortality but is associated with harms including false-positive results, biopsy complications, and overdiagnosis in 20 percent to 50 percent of screen-detected prostate cancers. Early, active treatment for screen-detected prostate cancer may reduce the risk of metastatic disease, although the long-term impact of early, active treatment on prostate cancer mortality remains unclear. Active treatments for prostate cancer are frequently associated with sexual and urinary difficulties.\" Overdiagnosis = Gleason 3 semantic issue. But if Gleason 3 is cancer, which it is by molecular biology, then it is not an overdiagnosis to call it cancer; But if it does not metastasize and the only surrogate for pcsm and overall survival is distant metastasis; not bcr - then, by clinical translational research, it is not cancer. To translate, even the USPSTF considers Gleason 3 cancer; not cancer: Epstein truly is God. But what should we call it; the semantic problem and thus emotional problem. Emotional problem because if you can walk around with untreated CA, and you emotion like Clint Eastwood, you must feel lucky. But if you are walking around with e.g. family history of pca or some other risk factor, you just monitor closely and don't sweat it. And, unlike most of us prostate Ca patients, the experts use measured Fedspeak regarding screening: \"mays\" and \"unclears\" as their concluding statements; even in 2018. The emotional conclusion of patients, if I may speak for everyone, is not measured USPTFspeak: but Get screened by PSA, for the 50-69 age group with normal life expectancy, period, end of story; despite the experts above 2018 measured waffle ----- but be ever mindful of the real numbers and what you are getting yourself into including, be very mindful, of our natural emotional inclination to drastically underestimate overtreatment in the face of the word cancer. It is one of the most scary words in our language. One example how human beings are very bad emotionally at judging risk is: The car versus plane paradigm. I know the facts: flying is actually the safest mode of transportation. In fact, the odds of a plane crash are one for every 1.2 million flights, with odds of dying one in 11 million. Your chances of dying in a car accident are one in 5,000; approximately 37k deaths per year. Yet, even knowing these facts, I have a fear of flying and do not have one qualm about getting into a car. To state it another way: I can not think of another reason why AS is not more accepted, or as accepted as in Europe or Australia except for this emotional issue. Am I missing something? I believe we should be aware of this emotional skewing of the facts ---- And really we should be asking our doctors; if you were in my risk boat, not weighing in my emotional leaning/shared decision making, what would you choose. Just food, hard numbers, for thought. And caution of how emotions play into risk analysis. I am curious what the poll results of forum brothers would be regarding screening with psa for 50-69 males with normal life expectancy 1. no screening - 2012 2. maybe - 2018; actually to be fair - dubbed smarter screening; parsing risk analysis 3. screen, one size fits all/across the board screening, period end of story.",

Per the numbers to screen to prevent 1 pcsm: the studies cited vary widely from no prevention at all to 1 for 270 screened; as opposed to 1 in 1000, I quoted from the task force evidence report; clearly the taskforce calculated some sort of average of all the studies in the literature, weighted by quality of the study etc. to arrive at 1 in 1000. Objections could be made to most of the hard numbers I listed, along these lines; but that was not the point of my post; and who am I too argue with the 212 page tome vetted by many experts; not some fringe group. Just look at the whos who of the vetters. I was focusing on stuff, not covered or skirted over by the tome: a. the psychology and penetrance/acceptance of active surveillance b. the development by Epstein of a non-metastasizing Gleason grade 3 CA which dovetailed perfectly into the concept of active surveillance; making prostate CA truly unique in this other way aside from all other unique features; c. political/sociological differences between U.S and the rest of the advanced scientific world.",

      "Content": "Djin: All of your points are well taken and I agree with them. Especially, and I quote you: the solution to overtreatment is simply to stop overtreatment with Active Surveillance, not to stop screening. But there were many problems to AS in 2012 including but not limited to, it predated Epstein's shrinking Gleason 3 to a better prognosis cohort that does not metastasize, among other subsequent refinements on the science side; and as pointed out by the taskforce, lack of buyin by patients and doctors for Active Surveillance on the consumer side. Barring the 10-15 year time period limitation, (btw, not Allmo's limitation, this is the taskforce/literature limitation) which is admittedly too short for prostate cancer; but come on, be realistic that is largely what the literature consists of; -- furthermore, you are going to have to wait a long time for prospective followup with the new screen parsing and Epstein regrading of 3 in 2014, way beyond the lifetime of most reading this, to get 20-25 year data; so that is a valid criticism of the data the taskforce used to inform its directives; but an unrealistic criticism: there will be no 20-25 yr old data for a long time - Let alone in 20-25 years, we are going to be in a new science fiction world of prostate cancer directed therapy at the molecular level which will cure cancer as opposed to the blind shotgun approach of for example RT. And last - of course positive DRE = higher stage >/= pT2 largely taking it out of AS; clinicalT2a exceptions exist for AS. otherwise all of your caveats and nuances are baked into the beauty/science of Active Surveillance as the solution to the 2012 guidance against screening with Psa - AS will be the subject of continued research and refinement and thus only get more perfect, marginally and AS will continue to have increasing acceptance by USA doctors, softened by \"shared decision making\", with greater acceptance by patients ---- Acceptance rates in US: from a low of 6.7% in the years from 1990 to 2009, to 40.4% in the period 2010 to 2013; but AS at 40% in 2013 still lags behind the frontrunners/leaders Europe and Australia - their acceptance rates are much higher. In part because, they have less patient advocacy, less shared decision making, emotional stuff to deal with. There doctors can just follow the hard facts including not doing standard of care - the latter a legal concept in the U.S. which handcuffs doctors, even the experts into doing what the herd does. Admittedly the herd is right in the vast majority of instances; but when a groundbreaking advance occurs such as ultrasensitive imaging especially psma based imaging; there is no clinical translational data to to know for sure for the foreseeable future: for consensus/standard of care directives to be made; and in Europe and Australia, patients more readily just trust their doctors. There are pros and cons to both systems. You should just be aware of the differences. Tangential thought: Europe, Asia, and Australia lead the USA in other prostate Ca mind tweak concepts, which run against longstanding conventional concepts, besides AS. This includes the mentioned above ultrasensitive imaging technologies; but also one of its major corollaries directed therapies, in general, and salvage surgery in particular; and active surveillance in the bcr phase of the disease for select patients who have low risk bcr: including low detectable but stable bcr and late to bcr, low psa velocity, low Grade group and stage patients. Both these future mind tweak concepts which have relevance in the bcr stage of disease: challenge us for a word for recurrent stage 4 ca that can be treated with non-systemic/directed therapy in combination with systemic therapy, and probably eventually with delayed and eventually without standard of care systemic therapy; for a select subset of patients; from indolent bcr to prostate bed only recurrence to pelvic and immediately extrapelvic lymph node recurrence to oligometastatic recurrent ca including oligometastases to bone. Basal cell carcinoma of the skin will not inform us; nor will ductal carcinoma in situ of the breast inform us; nor will papillary carcinoma of the thyroid inform us ---- all peculiar forms of low end cancer for different reasons which do not completely fit low volume, low psa, low molecular score, Gleason 3 prostate biopsy cancer or indolent bcr or prostate bed only recurrence. The bcr recurrent phase: another shock and awe that I myself am facing/heading for. I am at 0.026 -- with beyond psa anxiety. I better take Pom-T, exercise, lose weight, cholesterol and glucose lower, etc. etc. and pray. The only things in my control at this point. lol. This/these concepts are and will be mind tweaks/counterintuitive even to doctors. Doctor's are emotional beings, also, and were trained as a first, second, and third approximation -- the best treatment of cancer, except for prevention, is treat early, end of story. trained that in the U.S., the only treatment is standard of care, end of story, informed by our legal malpractice system; even if you know your European and Australian counterparts are pushing the facts/frontiers forward in front of you. And for stage 4 disease: treat systemically. end of story. No, I need to correct myself; there is a well accepted exception to the above in pca: stage 4 prostate bed only recurrence post RP: standard of care is salvage RT; except that at the low psa levels required for benefit, with our standard of care conventional CT and bone scan, we are blind as to where the recurrence really is, including whether or not it is really confined to the prostate bed --- the new ultrasensitive imaging technologies open the blinders, at least in the 0.2 to 10-20 range where conventional studies, bone and CT scan, could not. Furthermore we may really be curing nothing with salvage RT in low risk patients (uncancer/precancer and even benign tissue), but admittedly resetting the psa clock back to zero in the majority - Up to 70% for low risk patients, informed by MSK nomogram. And several current large retrospective studies coming out of Italy, some in conjunction with USA including Mayo clinic, showing that after substratifying by risk this lowest risk 70% cured by salvage RT really are not benefitted at all, except for setting the psa clock back to zero. Active surveillance was a hard sell even to doctors. Just as directed therapies for early recurrence which are coming are going to be hard sells; because it flies in the face of conventional oncologic theory. But prostate ca is different. And ultrasensitive imaging will reveal the natural pattern of spread of the disease in the 0.2 to 10-20 psa range which was up until now hidden. It will be shown to be much more stepwise than almost any cancer known except basal cell carcinoma and papillary carcinoma of the thyroid. ----- In summary, the guidance changed for 3 reasons, in my opinion: 1. Acceptance rate of active surveillance increased 2. AS science improved 3. Ahlering research that lack of screening resulted in actual theoretic harm: stage migration 4. cynically, political pressure - uproar from the masses. Not. USPTF were a scientific body despite the Federal mandate and thus title. But correct me, if I am wrong.",

Per the numbers to screen to prevent 1 pcsm: the studies cited vary widely from no prevention at all to 1 for 270 screened; as opposed to 1 in 1000, I quoted from the task force evidence report; clearly the taskforce calculated some sort of average of all the studies in the literature, weighted by quality of the study etc. to arrive at 1 in 1000. Objections could be made to most of the hard numbers I listed, along these lines; but that was not the point of my post; and who am I too argue with the 212 page tome vetted by many experts; not some fringe group. Just look at the whos who of the vetters. I was focusing on stuff, not covered or skirted over by the tome: a. the psychology and penetrance/acceptance of active surveillance b. the development by Epstein of a non-metastasizing Gleason grade 3 CA which dovetailed perfectly into the concept of active surveillance; making prostate CA truly unique in this other way aside from all other unique features; c. political/sociological differences between U.S and the rest of the advanced scientific world.",

      "Content": "Djin: All of your points are well taken and I agree with them. Especially, and I quote you: the solution to overtreatment is simply to stop overtreatment with Active Surveillance, not to stop screening. But there were many problems to AS in 2012 including but not limited to, it predated Epstein's shrinking Gleason 3 to a better prognosis cohort that does not metastasize, among other subsequent refinements on the science side; and as pointed out by the taskforce, lack of buyin by patients and doctors for Active Surveillance on the consumer side. Barring the 10-15 year time period limitation, (btw, not Allmo's limitation, this is the taskforce/literature limitation) which is admittedly too short for prostate cancer; but come on, be realistic that is largely what the literature consists of; -- furthermore, you are going to have to wait a long time for prospective followup with the new screen parsing and Epstein regrading of 3 in 2014, way beyond the lifetime of most reading this, to get 20-25 year data; so that is a valid criticism of the data the taskforce used to inform its directives; but an unrealistic criticism: there will be no 20-25 yr old data for a long time - Let alone in 20-25 years, we are going to be in a new science fiction world of prostate cancer directed therapy at the molecular level which will cure cancer as opposed to the blind shotgun approach of for example RT. And last - of course positive DRE = higher stage >/= pT2 largely taking it out of AS; clinicalT2a exceptions exist for AS. otherwise all of your caveats and nuances are baked into the beauty/science of Active Surveillance as the solution to the 2012 guidance against screening with Psa - AS will be the subject of continued research and refinement and thus only get more perfect, marginally and AS will continue to have increasing acceptance by USA doctors, softened by \"shared decision making\", with greater acceptance by patients ---- Acceptance rates in US: from a low of 6.7% in the years from 1990 to 2009, to 40.4% in the period 2010 to 2013; but AS at 40% in 2013 still lags behind the frontrunners/leaders Europe and Australia - their acceptance rates are much higher. In part because, they have less patient advocacy, less shared decision making, emotional stuff to deal with. There doctors can just follow the hard facts including not doing standard of care - the latter a legal concept in the U.S. which handcuffs doctors, even the experts into doing what the herd does. Admittedly the herd is right in the vast majority of instances; but when a groundbreaking advance occurs such as ultrasensitive imaging especially psma based imaging; there is no clinical translational data to to know for sure for the foreseeable future: for consensus/standard of care directives to be made; and in Europe and Australia, patients more readily just trust their doctors. There are pros and cons to both systems. You should just be aware of the differences. Tangential thought: Europe, Asia, and Australia lead the USA in other prostate Ca mind tweak concepts, which run against longstanding conventional concepts, besides AS. This includes the mentioned above ultrasensitive imaging technologies; but also one of its major corollaries directed therapies, in general, and salvage surgery in particular; and active surveillance in the bcr phase of the disease for select patients who have low risk bcr: including low detectable but stable bcr and late to bcr, low psa velocity, low Grade group and stage patients. Both these future mind tweak concepts which have relevance in the bcr stage of disease: challenge us for a word for recurrent stage 4 ca that can be treated with non-systemic/directed therapy in combination with systemic therapy, and probably eventually with delayed and eventually without standard of care systemic therapy; for a select subset of patients; from indolent bcr to prostate bed only recurrence to pelvic and immediately extrapelvic lymph node recurrence to oligometastatic recurrent ca including oligometastases to bone. Basal cell carcinoma of the skin will not inform us; nor will ductal carcinoma in situ of the breast inform us; nor will papillary carcinoma of the thyroid inform us ---- all peculiar forms of low end cancer for different reasons which do not completely fit low volume, low psa, low molecular score, Gleason 3 prostate biopsy cancer or indolent bcr or prostate bed only recurrence. The bcr recurrent phase: another shock and awe that I myself am facing/heading for. I am at 0.026 -- with beyond psa anxiety. I better take Pom-T, exercise, lose weight, cholesterol and glucose lower, etc. etc. and pray. The only things in my control at this point. lol. This/these concepts are and will be mind tweaks/counterintuitive even to doctors. Doctor's are emotional beings, also, and were trained as a first, second, and third approximation -- the best treatment of cancer, except for prevention, is treat early, end of story. trained that in the U.S., the only treatment is standard of care, end of story, informed by our legal malpractice system; even if you know your European and Australian counterparts are pushing the facts/frontiers forward in front of you. And for stage 4 disease: treat systemically. end of story. No, I need to correct myself; there is a well accepted exception to the above in pca: stage 4 prostate bed only recurrence post RP: standard of care is salvage RT; except that at the low psa levels required for benefit, with our standard of care conventional CT and bone scan, we are blind as to where the recurrence really is, including whether or not it is really confined to the prostate bed --- the new ultrasensitive imaging technologies open the blinders, at least in the 0.2 to 10-20 range where conventional studies, bone and CT scan, could not. Furthermore we may really be curing nothing with salvage RT in low risk patients (uncancer/precancer and even benign tissue), but admittedly resetting the psa clock back to zero in the majority - Up to 70% for low risk patients, informed by MSK nomogram. And several current large retrospective studies coming out of Italy, some in conjunction with USA including Mayo clinic, showing that after substratifying by risk this lowest risk 70% cured by salvage RT really are not benefitted at all, except for setting the psa clock back to zero. Active surveillance was a hard sell even to doctors. Just as directed therapies for early recurrence which are coming are going to be hard sells; because it flies in the face of conventional oncologic theory. But prostate ca is different. And ultrasensitive imaging will reveal the natural pattern of spread of the disease in the 0.2 to 10-20 psa range which was up until now hidden. It will be shown to be much more stepwise than almost any cancer known except basal cell carcinoma and papillary carcinoma of the thyroid. ----- In summary, the guidance changed for 3 reasons, in my opinion: 1. Acceptance rate of active surveillance increased 2. AS science improved 3. Ahlering research that lack of screening resulted in actual theoretic harm: stage migration 4. cynically, political pressure - uproar from the masses. Not. USPTF were a scientific body despite the Federal mandate and thus title. But correct me, if I am wrong.",

Because I am having a hard time putting it together: the discrepancy: between the experts consensus statements: don't screen now the British/Australian/International experts weighing in; and our collective belief: Screen. Cognitive dissonance. I think our immediate emotional reaction, collective belief, to a recommendation against psa screening is: poppycock to the British Medical Journal authors.

      "Content": "Originally Posted by po18guy Best not to get hung up on PSA - far too many variables. CA19-9 is somewhat the same, as is LDH and so many other measures. I mean, we have folks who stress over a .01 difference in testing! What is needed is TSA (no not that agency) - a tumor specific antigen. PSA stands alone. It is the only blood marker for screening cancer - period. And a triumph in medical history. Yet, another unique feature of prostate cancer. But geez it is not perfect. Can you believe it is not perfect. Well even the pap smear, the best screen for cancer is not perfect. Yes, Psa needs an incredibly detailed decision tree and probably more importantly near total buyin to Active surveillance to drive down overtreatment to a number which will be necessary, but not sufficient to change the expert guidance to: Door number 3: recommending screening on all 55-69 yr olds with normal life expectancy; period end of story.---- Btw: door #3, is the door, the emotional masses already believe is beyond prime time; and furthermore, believe should have been chosen back in 2012, let alone before. And as Djin, points out, Active Surveillance, requires a long commitment; but one that would peter out with age, no pun intended, for most patients but then it is near perfect. AsAdvocate would know the details like the back of his hand, sorry typo, handle. 9 years, really. When do you get off that conveyor belt? You must have a great constitution; Garrison Keillor style, your molecular cleanup must be incredible. Not us sendentary urban denizens. What are you drinking? I need some of that. Moveover Pom-T. Just curious FB Another - You taught me alot about denial. It took me a long time, because of attention denial, to realize what Asadvocate's handle meant. Just curious, how long it took you or for that matter other FB's - would be anecdotal data points on how prevalent attention denial is. Something I know that came into play for me. I went to my GP, attending to another medical condition. I am male: not so good at multi-tasking. ASA can you do a poll on that? How many Forum brothers know what your handle means? but directing the poll takers attention to your handle, in itself, would introduce attention bias. You would have to ask them if they realized before you asked the question and then trust their honesty; Otherwise, we would be confounded by dishonesty, another form of denial - And denial is the subject of our study. How do we control for that ASA - Geeze I think I need an aspirin, ASA. Remember: Gilda Radner, Ovarian ca, and CA-125. I even remember Gene Wilder on TV pushing CA-125 for screening, a media blitz; something OldTiredSailor, would want for psa. Wilder, in essence, imploring the public to rise up against the USPSTF and by implication the Federal government for keeping CA-125 a secret. A federal conspiracy. I mean, damn it, we could be preventing ovarian cancer. Women across the country swamped their gynecologists with demand for CA-125 test. Some tested positive. What ensued was an onslaught of unnecessary studies and operations with no benefit. You do not hear about CA-125 for screening anymore. For screening, CA-125 is in the dust heap of medical history. Forgotten. What is that adage about history? I forgot. Admittedly, CA-125 is great for monitoring, same story for CA19-9 for pancreatic cancer, and there are many others including LDH; but not for screening; psa stands alone.---- Even psma, prostate specific membrane antigen, will not replace Psa for serum/blood screening; despite it being the basis for a current imaging breakthru in the bcr stage of prostate cancer. But even for bcr imaging, many are pointing out its imperfections from low sensitivity to false negatives, but Dr. Hope knows, it is good enough for the job, breakthrus to come; Furthermore, psma will be the basis for therapeutic breakthroughs. ... Dr. Flavell, anecdoctal cure .... The first screening triumph in medical history is the pap smear for cervical cancer. You all want concrete, not abstract stuff. Wow, how bout 80k deaths per year plummeting to 15k. Thank you Dr. George Pap.. Now, how bout them apples. Good will hunting. Pap smear is so damn good, the best screen for cancer that mankind has ever known. And if you agree prevention is the best medicine, then for cancer, this is a cancer forum? the pap smear is the closest mankind has gotten to the holy grail barring McCoy's scanner. Gerard would appreciate. but mankind, unfortunately in this instance, has emotion, and mankind emotionally resets its expectations for pap; that now it is and has be to perfect so that when you drill down on those 15k that die of cervical cancer, more than half were never screened; But the other half, the ones that were screened with that, \"now emotionally reset perfect\" pap smear test: are a gold mine to attorneys; those 7k who were screened, had a pap smear which is \"supposed to prevent\" period end of story cervical cancer. Well, the pap smear is on a glass slide which has 6000 high per fields, and 100ks of cells and that glass slide is required by law to be retained, and is legally discoverable. Bingo, won the malpractice lottery. Because when you go back to that patients slide someone is going to find that needle in the haystack abnormal cell that some cytotech missed. B Bingo. Won the malpractice lottery. I agree with Gerard: Door number 2, kind of, but Door number 2 is not ready for prime time, because it is helmed (please note OTS) by the dumb (GP and urologist minions) and the dumber (we, uninformed patients). Neither group would pass the urology board subsection on psa screening. Lag time/adoption rate for new standard of care from the generals down to the ranks on the front line, coming into play; let alone the emotional bias, of nobody is going to die in my foxhole; let's do that Halsted and cure. Don't ask me, ask Dr. Bernard Fisher, he is still alive. That is the minions part of the equation. Now to the masses: Informed consent and shared decision re: risk analysis - throw in some emotion and lack of board certification. Cognitive dissonance: is the only way my brain can do it. Maybe, you are wired differently --- Lutheran, midwestern stoics to Stallone/rambos. In summary, the guidance in the U.S. changed for 3 reasons, in my opinion: 1. Acceptance rate of active surveillance increased 2. AS science improved 3. Ahlering research that lack of screening resulted in actual theoretic harm: stage migration Not, cynically, political pressure - cost on one side versus uproar from the masses on the other. USPTF were a scientific body despite the Federal mandate and thus title; and furthermore did not consider cost or for that matter emotion, of course the latter can never be divorced from the mind. Stated another way: Freudian: the superego can never divorce the id. Or anatomically: The supratentorial brain can never divorce the infratentorial brain. Though, admittedly cost and emotion are significant parts of the equation. Two parts that I tried to delve into in the thread I started; did I mention that before. https://www.cancerforums.net/threads...-Psa-screening But correct me, if I am wrong. When one hits a dead end in science -- there are additional possible clues to the solution. 1. History 2. Current analogous models 3. Have a hypothesis. And if you reach a dead end with your hypothesis. Try to prove the negative of your hypothesis is false. Pure mathematics 101. Go ask Einstein or Good Will Hunting. 1. History: Is there any other history of cancer that would inform us regarding this current controversy re: psa screening? This is a cancer forum, right? And one that prides itself on its research aspect. I am just trying to understand. I am sure there is much history research which would inform us that I am not aware of besides the history of pap smear and CA-125 that I listed. Jerry McGuire, help me. 2. Models Guess what; I think I found one in DCIS (Stage 0) breast cancer: http://www.chicagotribune.com/lifest...502-story.html Forum Brothers, let me know what you think, of this analogous, but not identical model. For me, I found it amazingly analogous, read the story; and I think you too will be amazed how analogous it is to Gleason 3 ca. And the article brings up, believe it or not, both emotion and semantics as major issues. Two subjects not covered in any of the \"evidence reports\" US or international. This really deserves a new thread in the prostate cancer forum; but I suppose a moderator might think it needs to go into the breast cancer forum. 3. Pure Mathematics: thought Sorry, don't have an audience with Weinberg and Epstein. Though, I am working on Epstein, and not the 15-30 minute route. Lastly, I agree with you po18guy 100% concerning: \"we have folks who stress over a .01 difference in testing\"",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by PCHearn Hi. I haven\u2019t been on here in about 14 months. I have some previous posts explaining how I got here, and my results at the Mayo Clinic. This post is just kind of a recap of my PSA history and where I am right now in my journey. Please see my signature below. My urologist had been doing my PSA tests in the lab in his office until the end of 2016. In Jan 2017, he started sending them out to another lab. In Jan 2017, he told me that my PSA was .2, and he gave me the exact same number in Jul 2017. Since he had always given me a 2-digit number, I assumed he meant .20, but I was wrong. The new test he was using only went out one place. So I didn\u2019t know whether it was .20, .25, or .29. It makes a big difference. I was furious. I immediately stopped seeing that doctor, and made an appointment at the Mayo Clinic. They do a different type of PSA test and in Jul 2017 they said my PSA was .17. I know you have to have the exact same test from the same lab three times in a row to determine a real pattern, but the good news was that my PSA was probably closer to .20 than .29. I started having my family doctor do my PSA tests \u2013 same test and same lab \u2013 every three months. It was the ultra-sensitive PSA test. In Oct 2017, my PSA was .215. OK, it was a little higher than I had hoped, but it was just the first ultra-sensitive test using this lab. In Jan 2018, it was .213. Interesting. I knew my PSA was not going down, but maybe it was just going to stay level. That would be great. In Apr 2018, it was .230. Crap. And in Jul 2018, it was .261. Time to get serious. I know that .2 is/was considered the magic number to determine if the prostate cancer has returned. Some folks use .03. But my PSA progression had been so slow, and it\u2019s been almost 12 years since my surgery. I was hoping that maybe, just maybe, it would continue to be very slow. I was in no hurry to have salvage radiation therapy. During the last year, I have met with four radiation oncologists, three local in Oklahoma City and one at the Mayo Clinic. I\u2019m finalizing plans to start SRT. Don't do it. Emphatic. Exclamation point. My shortest post to date. by 500 words. When I have time, I will cite, quote, and analyze the only 3 papers I am aware of to date: that delve into psa kinetics in the 0.03 to 0.2 range. Inviting all Forum brothers, to inform me of other research that I am not aware of. Better yet, ask your Mayo Clinic experts, what reference research articles exist informing on the psa kinetics in the 0.03 to 0.2 range. Eureka, PCHearn, you are the poster forum boy candidate for Ahlering's Copernican concept of Active surveillance in the bcr phase, post radical prostatectomy. Of any bcr patient, all must envy your stats. Let's take a poll of bcr patients, better yet those heading into the bcr waters of 0.03 to 0.2. Is there anyone out there, that would not to want to switch stats with FB PCHearn? Let's look at those PCHearn stats: Even Thomas Hearns would envy. 1. Gleason score 3+3: lowest grade group 1: because gleason 1 and 2 do not exist. Check. 2. Tumor volume: 5% but actually we don't know your prostate size; but at least percent wise as low as you can get. Check. 3. Stage 2: Actually, AJCC 2018 Bible has eliminated a, b, and c and believe it or not there is no pathologic pT1. So, again, lowest. Check. 4. + SM: Counterintuitive, but actually better, since we have a good prognostic explanation for the detectable psa. Check. And postop: the proof is in the pudding stats. 5. Time to bcr: 10.5 years: the pudding is precious. Check. Actually, you are the poster boy for having a bcr cutpoint of 0.4 not 0.2; so if you use 0.4 as your cutpoint you probably will not reach bcr for another 3 years.

Oh that's right your dad. 95 years old. Bless his heart, and what he must have passed on to you. Geez. I bet you your dad did not have one of those super duper robotic assisted nerve-sparing RP; that might leave a little extra benign tissue behind to confuse the masses and the minions, let alone the experts. Let alone all the recent research parsing bcr and even persistent psa patients for benefit from RT; and lack thereof, for certain large low risk subsets of patients --- and you would be at the low end of those cohorts showing no benefit whatsoever from salvage RT. At least, 6 articles I know of. None, even taking psa kinetics into account. Just the usual suspects: Grade and stage. Check out the Rosetta thread for a quick overall update: started by none other than DjinTonic https://www.cancerforums.net/threads...a-Stone-of-PCa Let's see. Grade, Stage, psa kinetics. Am I missing anything? Oh yeah. Molecular tests - not standard of care, but throw it in there, as well. Just for fun. Have your original material sent for Decipher testing. Your results will be low risk. guaranteed. Or else decipher is a bad test. lol My bad you will not be able to - pathology departments are only required by CLIA and CAP to keep material for 10 years. Good enough rule for all cancers with one exception prostate CA. Believe it or not: You had Gleason 3 tumor/uncancer on Sep. 2006 and in all the intervening years it did not acquire the molecular defects/transform to anything higher grade; despite having the risk factor: being male which confers the Virchow prevalence autopsy risk of 70% by age 70. That remnant Gleason 3 tumor left behind, probably at your positive margin; or even the benign tissue left behind at the urogenital diaphram/apical margin; both have a risk for transformation because you are male informed by autopsy studies. Even Angelie Jolie's double mastectomy for risk factor Brac+, seems to be underkill compared to your case. And I am actually serious. http://www.chicagotribune.com/lifest...502-story.html http://www.chicagotribune.com/lifest...502-story.html Stop that train.",

Your question about kicking the can could be interpreted a couple of ways. What did you mean? PC Hearn: If you have your dad's genes including all his tumor suppressor genes, etc. and you have lead as clean a life as he had: including exercise, no obesity, good glucose control, and all the heart healthy stuff; because your greatest risk not knowing your family history or particulars is heart disease and stroke. I predict you have a 52:48 chance of living to 95; in other words outliving your dad; if you do not do RT, but do active surveillance of your bcr. But just because you have bcr, bcr does not mean you will go on to have LN and/or bone metastases; and in fact most don't in general; but you are not most, you are incredibly low, low risk. And per the selection bias of prostate cancer forums, excluding the likes of ASadvocate and Chuck and other dedicated FB's, who are cured but stay on for altruistic reasons, I presume; -- but admittedly, because of their remnant benign tissue always have risk forever.

Incredible; with no change in your psa kinetics. Precious. In other words, your Gleason 3 uncancer; Stage 0 cancer, pre-cancer, risk factor: has acquired in all those years no permanent additional mutations to change the course; This really is de facto evidence that you do indeed have your dad's molecular cleanup genes. Do not throw Radiation therapy into your mix now. You can do active surveillance; and if and when your psa kinetics change; you can treat at that point; I suspect if your psa kinetics has not changed in 11.5 years; your kinetics probably will not change in another 11.5; except maybe you will have grown a new prostate, slightly off center towards the left posterior side. Endometriosis, nay splenosis, anyone. You have indolent bcr which is akin to Gleason 3 disease for which Active surveillance is perfectly safe; no statistical risk whatsoever. You can try to meld the active surveillance with ultrasensitive imaging which in your case will either be negative or prostate bed only. And negative absolutely means something, and something good. Just my opinion.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by PCHearn Hi. I haven\u2019t been on here in about 14 months. I have some previous posts explaining how I got here, and my results at the Mayo Clinic. This post is just kind of a recap of my PSA history and where I am right now in my journey. Please see my signature below. My urologist had been doing my PSA tests in the lab in his office until the end of 2016. In Jan 2017, he started sending them out to another lab. In Jan 2017, he told me that my PSA was .2, and he gave me the exact same number in Jul 2017. Since he had always given me a 2-digit number, I assumed he meant .20, but I was wrong. The new test he was using only went out one place. So I didn\u2019t know whether it was .20, .25, or .29. It makes a big difference. I was furious. I immediately stopped seeing that doctor, and made an appointment at the Mayo Clinic. They do a different type of PSA test and in Jul 2017 they said my PSA was .17. I know you have to have the exact same test from the same lab three times in a row to determine a real pattern, but the good news was that my PSA was probably closer to .20 than .29. I started having my family doctor do my PSA tests \u2013 same test and same lab \u2013 every three months. It was the ultra-sensitive PSA test. In Oct 2017, my PSA was .215. OK, it was a little higher than I had hoped, but it was just the first ultra-sensitive test using this lab. In Jan 2018, it was .213. Interesting. I knew my PSA was not going down, but maybe it was just going to stay level. That would be great. In Apr 2018, it was .230. Crap. And in Jul 2018, it was .261. Time to get serious. I know that .2 is/was considered the magic number to determine if the prostate cancer has returned. Some folks use .03. But my PSA progression had been so slow, and it\u2019s been almost 12 years since my surgery. I was hoping that maybe, just maybe, it would continue to be very slow. I was in no hurry to have salvage radiation therapy. During the last year, I have met with four radiation oncologists, three local in Oklahoma City and one at the Mayo Clinic. I\u2019m finalizing plans to start SRT. Don't do it. Emphatic. Exclamation point. My shortest post to date. by 500 words. When I have time, I will cite, quote, and analyze the only 3 papers I am aware of to date: that delve into psa kinetics in the 0.03 to 0.2 range. Inviting all Forum brothers, to inform me of other research that I am not aware of. Better yet, ask your Mayo Clinic experts, what reference research articles exist informing on the psa kinetics in the 0.03 to 0.2 range. Eureka, PCHearn, you are the poster forum boy candidate for Ahlering's Copernican concept of Active surveillance in the bcr phase, post radical prostatectomy. Of any bcr patient, all must envy your stats. Let's take a poll of bcr patients, better yet those heading into the bcr waters of 0.03 to 0.2. Is there anyone out there, that would not to want to switch stats with FB PCHearn? Let's look at those PCHearn stats: Even Thomas Hearns would envy. 1. Gleason score 3+3: lowest grade group 1: because gleason 1 and 2 do not exist. Check. 2. Tumor volume: 5% but actually we don't know your prostate size; but at least percent wise as low as you can get. Check. 3. Stage 2: Actually, AJCC 2018 Bible has eliminated a, b, and c and believe it or not there is no pathologic pT1. So, again, lowest. Check. 4. + SM: Counterintuitive, but actually better, since we have a good prognostic explanation for the detectable psa. Check. And postop: the proof is in the pudding stats. 5. Time to bcr: 10.5 years: the pudding is precious. Check. Actually, you are the poster boy for having a bcr cutpoint of 0.4 not 0.2; so if you use 0.4 as your cutpoint you probably will not reach bcr for another 3 years. And If I am still alive and we are both posting, I would say don't do it, barring a change in your psa kinetics reflecting additional molecular defects acquired in your 4 cc of benign tissue, still not a good prostate size. lol. Check. 6. Psa doubling time on log scale: Sorry, need a hewlett packard for that. But I assure you since it is very much related to time to bcr, also precious. Check.

Am I missing anything? Oh yeah. Molecular tests - not standard of care, but throw it in there, as well. Just for fun. Have your original material sent for Decipher testing. Your results will be low risk. guaranteed. Or else decipher is a bad test. lol My bad you will not be able to - pathology departments are only required by CLIA and CAP to keep material for 10 years. Good enough rule for all cancers with one exception prostate CA. Believe it or not: You had Gleason 3 tumor/uncancer on Sep. 2006 and in all the intervening years it did not acquire the molecular defects/transform to anything higher grade; despite having the risk factor: being male which confers the Virchow prevalence autopsy risk of 70% by age 70. That remnant Gleason 3 tumor left behind, probably at your positive margin; or even the benign tissue left behind at the urogenital diaphram/apical margin; both have a risk for transformation because you are male informed by autopsy studies. Even Angelie Jolie's double mastectomy for risk factor Brac+, seems to be underkill compared to your case.

Your question about kicking the can could be interpreted a couple of ways. What did you mean? PC Hearn: If you have your dad's genes including all his tumor suppressor genes, etc. and you have lead as clean a life as he had: including exercise, no obesity, good glucose control, and all the heart healthy stuff; because your greatest risk not knowing your family history or particulars is heart disease and stroke. I predict you have a 52:48 chance of living to 95; in other words outliving your dad; if you do not do RT, but do active surveillance of your bcr. But just because you have bcr, bcr does not mean you will go on to have LN and/or bone metastases; and in fact most don't in general; but you are not most, you are incredibly low, low risk. And per the selection bias of prostate cancer forums, excluding the likes of ASadvocate and Chuck and other dedicated FB's, who are cured but stay on for altruistic reasons, I presume; -- but admittedly, because of their remnant benign tissue always have risk forever. Just ask prophylactic bilateral mastectomy patients like Angelie Jolie; she still is at risk, i.e. never cured.

Incredible; with no change in your psa kinetics. Precious. In other words, your Gleason 3 uncancer; Stage 0 cancer, pre-cancer, risk factor: has acquired in all those years no permanent additional mutations to change the course; This really is de facto evidence that you do indeed have your dad's molecular cleanup genes. Do not throw Radiation therapy into your mix now. You can do active surveillance; and if and when your psa kinetics change; you can treat at that point; I suspect if your psa kinetics has not changed in 11.5 years; your kinetics probably will not change in another 11.5; except maybe you will have grown a new prostate, slightly off center towards the left posterior side. Endometriosis, nay splenosis, anyone. You have indolent bcr which is akin to Gleason 3 disease for which Active surveillance is perfectly safe; no statistical risk whatsoever. You can try to meld the active surveillance with ultrasensitive imaging which in your case will either be negative or prostate bed only. And negative absolutely means something, and something good. Just my opinion.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by PCHearn Hi. I haven\u2019t been on here in about 14 months. I have some previous posts explaining how I got here, and my results at the Mayo Clinic. This post is just kind of a recap of my PSA history and where I am right now in my journey. Please see my signature below. My urologist had been doing my PSA tests in the lab in his office until the end of 2016. In Jan 2017, he started sending them out to another lab. In Jan 2017, he told me that my PSA was .2, and he gave me the exact same number in Jul 2017. Since he had always given me a 2-digit number, I assumed he meant .20, but I was wrong. The new test he was using only went out one place. So I didn\u2019t know whether it was .20, .25, or .29. It makes a big difference. I was furious. I immediately stopped seeing that doctor, and made an appointment at the Mayo Clinic. They do a different type of PSA test and in Jul 2017 they said my PSA was .17. I know you have to have the exact same test from the same lab three times in a row to determine a real pattern, but the good news was that my PSA was probably closer to .20 than .29. I started having my family doctor do my PSA tests \u2013 same test and same lab \u2013 every three months. It was the ultra-sensitive PSA test. In Oct 2017, my PSA was .215. OK, it was a little higher than I had hoped, but it was just the first ultra-sensitive test using this lab. In Jan 2018, it was .213. Interesting. I knew my PSA was not going down, but maybe it was just going to stay level. That would be great. In Apr 2018, it was .230. Crap. And in Jul 2018, it was .261. Time to get serious. I know that .2 is/was considered the magic number to determine if the prostate cancer has returned. Some folks use .03. But my PSA progression had been so slow, and it\u2019s been almost 12 years since my surgery. I was hoping that maybe, just maybe, it would continue to be very slow. I was in no hurry to have salvage radiation therapy. During the last year, I have met with four radiation oncologists, three local in Oklahoma City and one at the Mayo Clinic. I\u2019m finalizing plans to start SRT. Don't do it. Emphatic. Exclamation point. My shortest post to date. by 500 words. When I have time, I will cite, quote, and analyze the only 3 papers I am aware of to date: that delve into psa kinetics in the 0.03 to 0.2 range. Inviting all Forum brothers, to inform me of other research that I am not aware of. Better yet, ask your Mayo Clinic experts, what reference research articles exist informing on the psa kinetics in the 0.03 to 0.2 range. Eureka, PCHearn, you are the poster forum boy candidate for Ahlering's Copernican concept of Active surveillance in the bcr phase, post radical prostatectomy. Of any bcr patient, all must envy your stats. Let's take a poll of bcr patients, better yet those heading into the bcr waters of 0.03 to 0.2. Is there anyone out there, that would not to want to switch stats with FB PCHearn? Let's look at those PCHearn stats: Even Thomas Hearns would envy. 1. Gleason score 3+3: lowest grade group 1: because gleason 1 and 2 do not exist. Check. 2. Tumor volume: 5% but actually we don't know your prostate size; but at least percent wise as low as you can get. Check. 3. Stage 2: Actually, AJCC 2018 Bible has eliminated a, b, and c and believe it or not there is no pathologic pT1. So, again, lowest. Check. 4. + SM: Counterintuitive, but actually better, since we have a good prognostic explanation for the detectable psa. Check. And postop: the proof is in the pudding stats. 5. Time to bcr: 10.5 years: the pudding is precious. Check. Actually, you are the poster boy for having a bcr cutpoint of 0.4 not 0.2; so if you use 0.4 as your cutpoint you probably will not reach bcr for another 3 years. And If I am still alive and we are both posting, I would say don't do it, barring a change in your psa kinetics reflecting additional molecular defects acquired in your 4 cc of benign tissue, still not a good prostate size. lol. Check. 6. Psa doubling time on log scale: Sorry, need a hewlett packard for that. But I assure you since it is very much related to time to bcr, also precious. Check. PCHearn: It looks like your oil and fluids all are checked. Good for another 25,000 miles. Heck. You don't need a new car. Actually, can you tell me your secret? Oh that's right your dad. 95 years old. Bless his heart, and what he must have passed on to you. Geez. I bet you your dad did not have one of those super duper robotic assisted nerve-sparing RP; that might leave a little extra benign tissue behind to confuse the masses and the minions, let alone the experts. Let alone all the recent research parsing bcr and even persistent psa patients for benefit from RT; and lack thereof, for certain large low risk subsets of patients --- and you would be at the low end of those cohorts showing no benefit whatsoever from salvage RT. At least, 6 articles I know of. None, even taking psa kinetics into account. Just the usual suspects: Grade and stage. Check out the Rosetta thread for a quick overall update: started by none other than DjinTonic https://www.cancerforums.net/threads...a-Stone-of-PCa Let's see. Grade, Stage, psa kinetics. Am I missing anything? Oh yeah. Molecular tests - not standard of care, but throw it in there, as well. Just for fun. Have your original material sent for Decipher testing. Your results will be low risk. guaranteed. Or else decipher is a bad test. lol My bad you will not be able to - pathology departments are only required by CLIA and CAP to keep material for 10 years.

      "Content": "Originally Posted by PCHearn Another - I was 58 when I had my surgery, and I'm 70 now. My dad lived to be 95, following the removal of his prostate. He remained in the Zero club until his death. Other than prostate cancer, I'm very healthy. Gosh, it would be great if I lived be 95 like my dad. Your question about kicking the can could be interpreted a couple of ways. What did you mean? PC Hearn: If you have your dad's genes including all his tumor suppressor genes, etc. and you have lead as clean a life as he had: including exercise, no obesity, good glucose control, and all the heart healthy stuff; because your greatest risk not knowing your family history or particulars is heart disease and stroke. I predict you have a 52:48 chance of living to 95; in other words outliving your dad; if you do not do RT, but do active surveillance of your bcr. But just because you have bcr, bcr does not mean you will go on to have LN and/or bone metastases; and in fact most don't in general; but you are not most, you are incredibly low, low risk. And per the selection bias of prostate cancer forums, excluding the likes of ASadvocate and Chuck and other dedicated FB's, who are cured but stay on for altruistic reasons, I presume; -- but admittedly, because of their remnant benign tissue always have risk forever. Just ask prophylactic bilateral mastectomy patients like Angelie Jolie; she still is at risk, i.e. never cured.

      "Content": "Originally Posted by PCHearn Hi. I haven\u2019t been on here in about 14 months. I have some previous posts explaining how I got here, and my results at the Mayo Clinic. This post is just kind of a recap of my PSA history and where I am right now in my journey. Please see my signature below. My urologist had been doing my PSA tests in the lab in his office until the end of 2016. In Jan 2017, he started sending them out to another lab. In Jan 2017, he told me that my PSA was .2, and he gave me the exact same number in Jul 2017. Since he had always given me a 2-digit number, I assumed he meant .20, but I was wrong. The new test he was using only went out one place. So I didn\u2019t know whether it was .20, .25, or .29. It makes a big difference. I was furious. I immediately stopped seeing that doctor, and made an appointment at the Mayo Clinic. They do a different type of PSA test and in Jul 2017 they said my PSA was .17. I know you have to have the exact same test from the same lab three times in a row to determine a real pattern, but the good news was that my PSA was probably closer to .20 than .29. I started having my family doctor do my PSA tests \u2013 same test and same lab \u2013 every three months. It was the ultra-sensitive PSA test. In Oct 2017, my PSA was .215. OK, it was a little higher than I had hoped, but it was just the first ultra-sensitive test using this lab. In Jan 2018, it was .213. Interesting. I knew my PSA was not going down, but maybe it was just going to stay level. That would be great. In Apr 2018, it was .230. Crap. And in Jul 2018, it was .261. Time to get serious. I know that .2 is/was considered the magic number to determine if the prostate cancer has returned. Some folks use .03. But my PSA progression had been so slow, and it\u2019s been almost 12 years since my surgery. I was hoping that maybe, just maybe, it would continue to be very slow. I was in no hurry to have salvage radiation therapy. During the last year, I have met with four radiation oncologists, three local in Oklahoma City and one at the Mayo Clinic. I\u2019m finalizing plans to start SRT. Don't do it. Emphatic. Exclamation point. My shortest post to date. by 500 words. When I have time, I will cite, quote, and analyze the only 3 papers I am aware of to date: that delve into psa kinetics in the 0.03 to 0.2 range. Inviting all Forum brothers, to inform me of other research that I am not aware of. Better yet, ask your Mayo Clinic experts, what reference research articles exist informing on the psa kinetics in the 0.03 to 0.2 range. Eureka, PCHearn, you are the poster forum boy candidate for Ahlering's Copernican concept of Active surveillance in the bcr phase, post radical prostatectomy. Of any bcr patient, all must envy your stats. Let's take a poll of bcr patients, better yet those heading into the bcr waters of 0.03 to 0.2. Is there anyone out there, that would not to want to switch stats with FB PCHearn? Let's look at those PCHearn stats: Even Thomas Hearns would envy. 1. Gleason score 3+3: lowest grade group 1: because gleason 1 and 2 do not exist. Check. 2. Tumor volume: 5% but actually we don't know your prostate size; but at least percent wise as low as you can get. Check. 3. Stage 2: Actually, AJCC 2018 Bible has eliminated a, b, and c and believe it or not there is no pathologic pT1. So, again, lowest. Check. 4. + SM: Counterintuitive, but actually better, since we have a good prognostic explanation for the detectable psa. Check. And postop: the proof is in the pudding stats. 5. Time to bcr: 10.5 years: the pudding is precious. Check. Actually, you are the poster boy for having a bcr cutpoint of 0.4 not 0.2; so if you use 0.4 as your cutpoint you probably will not reach bcr for another 3 years. And If I am still alive and we are both posting, I would say don't do it, barring a change in your psa kinetics reflecting additional molecular defects acquired in your 4 cc of benign tissue, still not a good prostate size. lol. Check. 6. Psa doubling time on log scale: Sorry, need a hewlett packard for that. But I assure you since it is very much related to time to bcr, also precious. Check. PCHearn: It looks like your oil and fluids all are checked. Good for another 25,000 miles. Heck. You don't need a new car. Actually, can you tell me your secret? Oh that's right your dad. 95 years old. Bless his heart, and what he must have passed on to you. Geez. I bet you your dad did not have one of those super duper robotic assisted nerve-sparing RP; that might leave a little extra benign tissue behind to confuse the masses and the minions, let alone the experts. Let alone all the recent research parsing bcr and even persistent psa patients for benefit from RT; and lack thereof, for certain large low risk subsets of patients --- and you would be at the low end of those cohorts showing no benefit whatsoever from salvage RT. At least, 6 articles I know of. None, even taking psa kinetics into account. Just the usual suspects: Grade and stage. Check out the Rosetta thread for a quick overall update: started by none other than DjinTonic https://www.cancerforums.net/threads...a-Stone-of-PCa Let's see. Grade, Stage, psa kinetics. Am I missing anything? Oh yeah. Molecular tests - not standard of care, but throw it in there, as well. Just for fun. Have your original material sent for Decipher testing. Your results will be low risk. guaranteed. Or else decipher is a bad test. lol My bad you will not be able to - pathology departments are only required by CLIA and CAP to keep material for 10 years. Good enough rule for all cancers with one exception prostate CA. Believe it or not: You had Gleason 3 tumor/uncancer on Sep. 2006 and in all the intervening years it did not acquire the molecular defects/transform to anything higher grade; despite having the risk factor: being male which confers the Virchow prevalence autopsy risk of 70% by age 70. That remnant Gleason 3 tumor left behind, probably at your positive margin; or even the benign tissue left behind at the urogenital diaphram/apical margin; both have a risk for transformation because you are male informed by autopsy studies. Even Angelie Jolie's double mastectomy for risk factor Brac+, seems to be underkill compared to your case. And I am actually serious. http://www.chicagotribune.com/lifest...502-story.html http://www.chicagotribune.com/lifest...502-story.html Stop that train.",

      "Content": "OldTiredSailor You did not find a random, obscure finding in the voluminous literature of prostate cancer, doomed to Davey Jones lockerroom. You found sunken treasure; an article by Epstein involving a database of 10k patients. The focal versus non-focal Extraprostatic extension research paper you reference, to repeat, is from J. Epstein. J. Epstein is a Professor of Pathology at Johns Hopkins. He is the titan of Gleason Grading and staging period. People on this forum have their favorite titan urologic surgeons whether they are from the Johns Hopkins, like Walsh and Partin; Mayo Clinic, Memorial Sloan Kettering, like Tewari, Thomas Ahlering at UCI (the one titan I have personally met), Carrol at UCSF, Stanford, Dana Farber, and other Meccas. But in Pathology, currently believe it or not, J. Epstein, is the titan period. I also took solace from his findings as I have focal EPE. CAPRA-S, developed at UCSF where I am a patient, is one of the leading formulas/nomograms for post-prostatectomy prognosis. My score is 3 which is intermediate risk. But if I equate focal EPE with no EPE, it is a 2 or low risk. And I quote: \" no difference in BCRFS for Gleason score ....3+4(you) and 4 + 3 = 7(me) ..... for F-EPE vs no EPE ...\" in SVI -, LN- pts. I gladly will delude myself; defering to Epstein on that. Note, this paper was published Jan. 2015. There is a bible of staging for cancers. It is called the AJCC (American Joint Committee on Cancer) staging manual. AJCC staging is required of hospitals to be accredited cancer care centers in the US. It is the staging system we all use in our signatures, as the starting point for discussing our cases. When Forum brothers lament: aren't there protocols or requirements on reporting various pathology data points; there is and it is the above AJCC staging manual. The latest lament post I read was about extranodal extension as a subvariable of lymph node positive patients: Why is it not a requirement? Short answer: It is not in the AJCC manual; so it is not a requirement. But that was a separate thread. and the current: 8th edition of the AJCC cancer staging manual was just recently issued; late 2017 and does not include this focal versus non-focal EPE stratification at all. Furthermore: the Epstein paper specifically states and I quote: \".....supporting the need to substratify pT3a prostate cancer in the American Joint Committee on Cancer staging system.\" And, I should add, this is far from the only paper that supports this finding, with none refuting it. Admittedly, the papers variously define what is meant by focal and non-focal. That is one of things Epstein does: he better defines something, in this case focal; the hypothesis - that it has no adverse effect --- then proves by translational research that his definition has better discrimination; than all the previous papers. I am telling all Forum Brothers about this; in part, so they get a realistic notion of how long it takes for some things, especially pathology minutiae, to become \"standard of care\" in the US. I guarantee you that if Epstein thinks substratification is needed and specifically states it in his research paper ---- remember the experts at the highest level, in part keep their hegemony; because they are not wrong or that would knock them off the god pedestal; by at most issuing measured Fedspeak bottom line statements; hence the USTFP guidance of screening with PSA waffle of \"maybe\"; but that is on another thread that I started. So this is a highly unusual statement, non-measured directive from Epstein; thats akin to Thomas Jefferson saying the constitution needs to be amended. And if it is coming from the god of prostate pathology ----it will become law. Because when Epstein (EF Hutton) speaks everyone listens; especially the expert pathologists on the AJCC committee who make the changes; they were students of his. Allen Greenspan to Bernanke and Yellen. But this delay of 4 years + another 3 years = 7years before the next 9th edition is published; is how long it takes from when a pathology imprimatur is announced and the bible is changed. Early in my journey, I got .01 without a less than sign at 3 months post op. I was in a complete panic that I was PSA persistent and my limited research indicated I needed immediate adjuvant RT and HT ---- how was I going to arrange all the appointments and get it to happen in any timely fashion. Panic... I got an appointment with UCSF Radiation Oncology on Oct. 2017; before the AJCC 8th edition was released. They talked me down from that cliff. I bring up the above UCSF consult because, believe it or not, I walked into that appointment with the above paper. True story. I am not making it up.---- For those that don't know, UCSF is also a prostate cancer mecca including their Rad Onc department. Their starting point for discussing my case was to sit me down in front of a computer and type in my pathology stats to both the MSK nomogram and the CAPRA-S nomogram for both prognosis in general and in reference to postop RT salvage. When I brought up that my pT3a, might really be a pT2. Their first, 2nd, and 3rd comment was did I want a 2nd opinion on my path report from the UCSF pathology department; because that is what my path report states. They were not understanding what I was saying until I showed them the above paper. They all wanted copies of the article: because they were not aware of it. Why would they, it is a pathology minutiae paper. The pathologist's data is what tees up for all the other fields where the golf ball goes next. Just like our signatures are the starting point for us to discuss our cases. A rad onc can only go with the path report which includes the pathologists translation of what the grade and stage is. In other words, they are given the grade and stage by pathologists. They do not go into the minutiae of how pathologists arrive at their conclusions; otherwise they would be pathologists. To translate the Epstein imprimatur: Both you and I are not pT3a, we are pT2. How would radiation oncologists know that, even at a mecca, unless they are reading the pathology literature? But even if they knew it, as a first approximation they have to go with the AJCC stage as it is defined today despite the lag of up to 7 years for some corrections to occur; if for no other reason, medical-legal. Oldtiredsailor, if you happen to go see an expert Rad Onc; I challenge you to walk in with the above Epstein article and ask them if they are aware that you are actually stage T2 and not stage T3a. If they would engage you in the intellectual exercise which of course they do not have time to do, my guess is that their 1st, 2nd, and 3rd response, would be dismiss it out of hand; and if you persisted then they would offer to get you a 2nd expert pathologist opinion, because you are in essence questioning the accuracy of the path report, and if you poll the FB that expert would be Epstein, so even Epstein god concept has filtered down to the rank and file in this forum; then in the unlikely event they actually truly try to intellectually engage you as a peer which you are not - their 4th, and 5th and final approximation would be to reach for the bible: the AJCC staging manual 8th edition and they would tell you, that you do not know what you are talking about because it is not in there. That the bible clearly states that extraprostatic extension = T3a. end of story. UCSF RadOnc strong recommendation to me was wait till my psa reaches 0.2; give us a call and we will do a psma scan. Btw: Psma scan is still in the investigational stage in the US, not readily available, and certainly not standard of care. Yet, they are so hot on it at UCSF, they recommended it to me off-label which is saying alot. But that is another story which I have gone into at length in other threads. After I presented them with the above paper, they said that would only bolster their recommendation further. Arrogant me, I told them to look for this new criterion in the upcoming 8th edition. Well, pie in my face; it is not in the 8th edition. They must be laughing at me now at UCSF. Hence, my anecdotal proof, that the lag from God/Epstein pronouncement till it makes into the bible/AJCC staging manual = standard of care for determining stage is, believe it or not, on the order of 7 years. And btw: there are articles parsing positive margins by location and millimeters of involvement with some having no adverse significance. They just need Epstein's stamp of approval to become law (change AJCC staging criteria) with a lag of 7 years. Djin, our resident research archivist, and others can direct you to the relevant articles.",

      "Content": "Djin, If you believe Ahlering, and no one does as of June 2017, when I sat down with him for believe it or not 3 hours, unheard of, and can you believe, the gall of me, I did not use him as my surgeon; but that is another huge story which I will not bore you with. if and when you become detectable which he defines as 0.4; he is still an old school holdout; maybe prescient holdout - he would follow your psa expectantly; just as the 2nd paper you listed advised; in essence active surveillance; monitoring specifically your psa velocity, doubling time; if it is <15 months or exponentially changes, you would need treatment period; believe it or not he has been following patients for years this way. He showed me his entire patient database and how the majority of his bcr and persistent patients have a relatively constant log slope rise; Also, he would order the new psma pet ultrasensitive imaging scan, his rosetta stone, not some way less meaningful rosetta nomogram. Even though his rosetta stone, the psma pet, is still in the investigational stage in the US, not readily available, and certainly not standard of care. He must be a maverick. I know Forum Brothers think that since the sensitivity of psma based pet imaging is low at 0.2; that it may not be worthwhile; especially since the \"new\" recommendation is to start salvage at 0.1. Come on, the sensitivity is unbelievable. Remember, the standard of care now is conventional CT and bone scan with a sensitivity of 10-20 or more; magnitudes higher. To repeat and emphasize. One criticism of the psma pet/ct is that it is not sensitive enough. That at psa of 0.2, the psma study is frequently negative. But studies are showing negative does not mean nothing. It actually means something significant and good. For example, off the top of my head, according to one study, at a psa of 0.2 the probability that your source is in the prostate bed only is overall 70%, but for those who were negative on psma scan at 0.2; 85% were prostate bed only on followup studies. In other words, if you have a negative psma scan at 0.2 psa; you are even more likely to have a prostate bed only source for the psa; and furthermore if you are the following 3: a. psa 0.2 b. lowest risk by conventional parameters, grade and stage, + lowest risk by decipher c. psma negative I theorize that the chance of prostate bed only recurrence approaches 100%, even with CTCs as your CTC levels and phenotype at this stage are not molecular biologically significant. Tell me why my theory is wrong. Furthermore, it is clear the psma scan, by taking the blinders off the 0.2 to 10-20 psa window;---- is revealing the progression for the vast majority of patients is more stepwise than any cancer known to man except for papillary carcinoma of the thyroid and basal cell and squamous cell carcinoma of skin. I mean even at the psa 10-20 range, the progression was lymph node, then bone, oligometastatic first, then very late distant visceral mets such as lung and liver; for most patients with low psa velocity. The oligometastatic stage is another future stage which has not been codified in the bible: The AJCC staging manual. Of course, if you have high psa velocity; especially those with psadt <3months, then prostate cancer is more unpredictable like most other cancers and more likely to be wide spread to more advanced sites. In the 0.2 to 10-20 range, for those with low psa velocity, it is first prostate bed, then pelvic lymph nodes including rectal (FB MichaelF), then immediately nearby extrapelvic lymph nodes, internal and external iliac lymph nodes, then low aortic lymph nodes. It is not going to your axilla or neck nodes for example. In the low percentage of cases with bone mets, they are usually oligometastatic at these levels - which have responded to directed stereotactic radiotherapy; admittedly maybe not durable now; but this opens the door for example for trials of directed RT to one or 2 bone mets, in combination with Radium 223, in combination with Ac 225-Psma who knows. Hodgkins use to be fatal; now almost all low stage Hodgkins are cured with combinations that have acronyms like ABVD. It took awhile to find the right combinations; None of this has been tested on this ultralow volume disease, represented by the phase of bcr between 0.2 and 10-20. Basic oncologic theory 101: Any therapy has the best chance of working with low volume disease. And basic molecular biology theory: Cancer has a greater chance of winning when there is a greater reservoir (tumor volume) of chance events to randomly create that one resistant clone with the right combination of molecular defects to produce the metastatic phenotype. Studies are showing that psma is correcting therapy in 50% of patients; stated more strongly 50% of the time patients are getting the wrong therapy by the conventional blind method of one size fits all. But of course, we will not know for sure, the full impact until 10 years from now. ---- Djin: But let's say you fear you may be the exception. Let's say it does not go stepwise, in your case: maybe it will hit an external iliac lymph node and not your pelvic bed. Well, if you don't pull the trigger on blind prostate bed only salvage RT, but instead get a salvage lymphadenectomy of that iliac chain informed by a +psma, you could set your psa clock back to zero and still have salvage RT in your gun for when and if you have a 2nd bcr after salvage external iliac lymphadenectomy. Admittedly, I am making it up. But the combinations are many and the studies are showing it is changing treatment in 50% of patients. Another factoid that Ahlering said to me that I have never seen in print. He told me nobody has ever died of prostate bed only recurrence. If you can find that Djin that will be another eureka moment for me. If any forum brothers know of anyone who has died of prostate bed recurrence, please let me know so I can tell Ahlering.",

In the low percentage of cases with bone mets, they are usually oligometastatic at these levels - which have responded to directed stereotactic radiotherapy; admittedly maybe not durable now; but this opens the door for example for trials of directed RT to one or 2 bone mets, in combination with Radium 223, in combination with Ac 225-Psma who knows. Hodgkins use to be fatal; now almost all low stage Hodgkins are cured with combinations that have acronyms like ABVD. It took awhile to find the right combinations; None of this has been tested on this ultralow volume disease, represented by the phase of bcr between 0.2 and 10-20. Basic oncologic theory 101: Any therapy has the best chance of working with low volume disease. And basic molecular biology theory: Cancer has a greater chance of winning when there is a greater reservoir (tumor volume) of chance events to randomly create that one resistant clone with the right combination of molecular defects to produce the metastatic phenotype. Studies are showing that psma is correcting therapy in 50% of patients; stated more strongly 50% of the time patients are getting the wrong therapy by the conventional blind method of one size fits all. But of course, we will not know for sure, the full impact until 10 years from now. ---- Djin: But let's say you fear you may be the exception. Let's say it does not go stepwise, in your case: maybe it will hit an external iliac lymph node and not your pelvic bed. Well, if you don't pull the trigger on blind prostate bed only salvage RT, but instead get a salvage lymphadenectomy of that iliac chain informed by a +psma, you could set your psa clock back to zero and still have salvage RT in your gun for when and if you have a 2nd bcr after salvage external iliac lymphadenectomy. Admittedly, I am making it up. But the combinations are many and the studies are showing it is changing treatment in 50% of patients. Another factoid that Ahlering said to me that I have never seen in print. He told me nobody has ever died of prostate bed only recurrence. If you can find that Djin that will be another eureka moment for me. If any forum brothers know of anyone who has died of prostate bed recurrence, please let me know so I can tell Ahlering.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by DjinTonic Thanks for your thoughtful and fact-fill reply, Allmo. Much food for thought. Having been in the roughly 15% of PCa cases that are high grade, when I see stats like 70% good/30% not good, I somehow instictively look at them from the subjective viewpoint, and think the they may as well be 50/50 because the \"bad\" bucket is just too big to ignore and I don't want to take the risk. That's also why I would always come down on the Yes side for folks undecided about a proposed biopsy. I want to understand what you mean. I am not sure if I understand---- If 30% not good refers to your chance of having a non-prostate bed source for your recurrence, if you recur, then if you do blind prostate bed RT, the current standard of care; you are in fact getting the wrong therapy by any oncologic theory I can think of. That unfortunate circumstance would be included in the stat that psma pet changes, better stated corrects, therapy decisions. A good, no great thing. Just ask FB MichaelF about his relative/friend or XCJ3 from Germany. Correct me if I am wrong. And if I may wax poetic, the rosetta stone for copernicus/ahlering, is psma; it will bring light to the blind.",

My Decipher test gave me 3.3% Of course the nomogram doesn't figure in genomics. The first-linked editorial mentions some caveats for this nomogram. Djin; I am glad you found this article coming out from the Italian group; this one in collaboration with Mayo Clinic. The standard of care for bcr or psa persistence post prostatectomy in the US is adjuvant or salvage RT +/- ADT. And on this forum, the belief is the earlier the better. In the article, psa persistence was defined as psa >0.1 at 6-8 weeks post op. CSM - cancer specific mortality was 20% at 10 years for the entire cohort of 500 patients which they described as one of the largest and longest followed cohort of persistent patients with complete grade and stage data including lymph node status; they needed the latter data to do their risk analysis. They stratified their patients into just 2 risk groups: by their risk of Cancer Specific Mortality a. their high risk group were those with a predicted CSM of >/= 30% b. their low risk group were those with CSM < 30% (with average of 10%). In other words cut point: CSM 30% They found that there was no benefit from postoperative radiation therapy for those in the low risk CSM cohort. I quote from their conclusion section: \"Conversely, in men with less aggressive disease (ie, organ confined disease and pathologic grade groups 1\u20133), PSA level did not impact cancer-specific survival. In these cases, PSA persistence might be a proxy of benign prostatic tissue left behind during RP, and the impact of competing causes of death would thereby be more pronounced. Further, these patients did not demonstrate a benefit from postoperative RT.\" Admittedly, all these studies are retrospective and thus flawed. But that is all we have to generate the large numbers of patients required over the long period of time, necessary since events such as PCM are so low. According to the above paper, given your predicted CSM of somewhere between 3.3%(decipher) and 13%(conventional grade and stage), you would be in their low risk group by a very safe margin; who showed no benefit whatsoever from RT; let alone early RT. Furthermore, they were studying psa persistent patients. You are not psa persistent - you are psa undetectable; making you even lower risk. This is not the only article; in fact there are several that are showing that if you substratify bcr or persistent patients by risk; some very lower risk cohorts show no benefit whatsoever from RT; let alone the current dilemma argued in this forum of whether to pull the trigger at 0.1 versus 0.2 for salvage RT. The researchers from Italy and Mayo Clinic further state: \"While subanalyses of prospective randomized trials have found a benefit to postoperative radiotherapy (RT) in men with PSA persistence [12,13], to date no study identified the optimal candidate for this approach in order to maximize oncologic benefit for those most likely to experience disease progression, while sparing the use of RT in those less likely to benefit from it.\" In other words, believe it or not, no study to date, substratified/parsed psa persistent patients to see if some subsets benefited more or less from post RP, Rad Therapy. Well, their study showed not just less, but no benefit at all for a significant subset of persistent patients; those with predicted pcsm of <30% at 10 years. I hope everyone realizes this completely flies in the face of standard of care. but that is what happens in medicine and all fields of science, Copernicus comes along.",

Nomogram study: Impact of Postoperative Radiotherapy in Men with Persistently Elevated Prostate-specific Antigen After Radical Prostatectomy for Prostate Cancer: A Long-term Survival Analysis [2017, Full Text] In your above cited Rosetta Stone article: I quote: \"The persistence of detectable PSA could be indeed related either to benign prostatic tissue left behind during surgery or to well differentiated tumour cells growing slowly, which may not necessarily require further treatment. This scenario could be theoretically similar to the diagnosis of an organ confined low-risk prostate cancer that nowadays may be managed expectantly.\" Expectantly is a synonym for Active Surveillance. This is exactly Dr. Ahlering's concept, which until now, I could not find in print. A Copernicus concept. Please correct me if I am wrong. I suppose I could be clueless, and everybody knows about this but me; but I can not find it in the Walsh Book, I have not seen it discussed in this forum and have not seen in Djin's research repository. But I could have missed it somewhere. Am I clueless? Please help me forum brothers. The mind tweak; counterintuitive concept of Active surveillance in the bcr stage; stated another way: How could anyone sit around and watch stage 4 cancer; because that is what stage any other site cancer is when it is recurrent with few exceptions like basal cell and squamous cell carcinoma of skin, Clint Eastwood would not sit around and watch, because how lucky does he feel? Ahlering must be insane or at least he must know nothing about cancer. Admittedly he requires low psa velocity, long time to bcr, prostate bed only recurrence. This is the same prostate cancer titan whose paper \"\"Unintended consequences of decreased PSA-based prostate cancer screening [2018]; was significant in the crusade against the 2012 US Preventative Task force recommendation against Psa screening; resulting in the 2018 new position paper. Please read the thread I started on this. And tell me what you think. --- https://www.cancerforums.net/threads...-Psa-screening And actually the Rosetta authors are making a stronger statement to include not just bcr patients; but a significant subset of persistent patients who heretofore were by definition considered high risk. Or as forum brothers, are wont to point out, the proof is in the pudding re: Psa in the postoperative setting: and PSA persistence in the postoperative setting = surgical cure failure period end of story. Throw all the adverse data points, nomograms for prediction out the window with the rear view mirror. If you are PSA persistent, you are Stage 4. Better get RT and RT fast. Where is my thinking wrong? Eureka, Thank you: Djin. For finally finding in print, what I have been piecing together painfully for the last year since I got the shock and awe diagnosis of cancer. Djin: Now, if you can find me research on Active Surveillance in the earliest stage 4 of prostate cancer which is called BCR; that will be a greater eureka moment for me. P.S. I believe on the semantic argument of what to call Gleason 3 cancer; the Rosetta authors have chosen \"tumor\". Am I incorrect, on inferring that, from the above quote. Furthermore, I suspect, the word tumor was carefully chosen by the authors. Am I wrong? And if I am wrong, then what do you Forum brothers think they mean by well differentiated tumor cells growing slowly. Geez, maybe I need a rosetta stone to interpret their rosetta stone. lol.",

He showed me his entire patient database and how the majority of his bcr and persistent patients have a relatively constant log slope rise; Also, he would order the new psma pet ultrasensitive imaging scan, his rosetta stone, not some way less meaningful rosetta nomogram. Even though his rosetta stone, the psma pet, is still in the investigational stage in the US, not readily available, and certainly not standard of care. He must be a maverick. I know Forum Brothers think that since the sensitivity of psma based pet imaging is low at 0.2; that it may not be worthwhile; especially since the \"new\" recommendation is to start salvage at 0.1. Come on, the sensitivity is unbelievable. Remember, the standard of care now is conventional CT and bone scan with a sensitivity of 10-20 or more; magnitudes higher. To repeat and emphasize. One criticism of the psma pet/ct is that it is not sensitive enough. That at psa of 0.2, the psma study is frequently negative. But studies are showing negative does not mean nothing. It actually means something significant and good. For example, off the top of my head, according to one study, at a psa of 0.2 the probability that your source is in the prostate bed only is overall 70%, but for those who were negative on psma scan at 0.2; 85% were prostate bed only on followup studies. In other words, if you have a negative psma scan at 0.2 psa; you are even more likely to have a prostate bed only source for the psa; and furthermore if you are the following 3: a. psa 0.2 b. lowest risk by conventional parameters, grade and stage, + lowest risk by decipher c. psma negative I theorize that the chance of prostate bed only recurrence approaches 100%, even with CTCs as your CTC levels and phenotype at this stage are not molecular biologically significant. Tell me why my theory is wrong. Furthermore, it is clear the psma scan, by taking the blinders off the 0.2 to 10-20 psa window;---- is revealing the progression for the vast majority of patients is more stepwise than any cancer known to man except for papillary carcinoma of the thyroid and basal cell and squamous cell carcinoma of skin. I mean even at the psa 10-20 range, the progression was lymph node, then bone, oligometastatic first, then very late distant visceral mets such as lung and liver; for most patients with low psa velocity. The oligometastatic stage is another future stage which has not been codified in the bible: The AJCC staging manual. Of course, if you have high psa velocity; especially those with psadt <3months, then prostate cancer is more unpredictable like most other cancers and more likely to be wide spread to more advanced sites. In the 0.2 to 10-20 range, for those with low psa velocity, it is first prostate bed, then pelvic lymph nodes including rectal (FB MichaelF), then immediately nearby extrapelvic lymph nodes, internal and external iliac lymph nodes, then low aortic lymph nodes. It is not going to your axilla or neck nodes for example. In the low percentage of cases with bone mets, they are usually oligometastatic at these levels - which have responded to directed stereotactic radiotherapy; admittedly maybe not durable now; but this opens the door for example for trials of directed RT to one or 2 bone mets, in combination with Radium 223, in combination with Ac 225-Psma who knows.

Even though his rosetta stone, the psma pet, is still in the investigational stage in the US, not readily available, and certainly not standard of care. He must be a maverick. I know Forum Brothers think that since the sensitivity of psma based pet imaging is low at 0.2; that it may not be worthwhile; especially since the \"new\" recommendation is to start salvage at 0.1. Come on, the sensitivity is unbelievable. Remember, the standard of care now is conventional CT and bone scan with a sensitivity of 10-20 or more; magnitudes higher. To repeat and emphasize. One criticism of the psma pet/ct is that it is not sensitive enough. That at psa of 0.2, the psma study is frequently negative. But studies are showing negative does not mean nothing. It actually means something significant and good. For example, off the top of my head, according to one study, at a psa of 0.2 the probability that your source is in the prostate bed only is overall 70%, but for those who were negative on psma scan at 0.2; 85% were prostate bed only on followup studies. In other words, if you have a negative psma scan at 0.2 psa; you are even more likely to have a prostate bed only source for the psa; and furthermore if you are the following 3: a. psa 0.2 b. lowest risk by conventional parameters, grade and stage, + lowest risk by decipher c. psma negative I theorize that the chance of prostate bed only recurrence approaches 100%, even with CTCs as your CTC levels and phenotype at this stage are not molecular biologically significant. Tell me why my theory is wrong. Furthermore, it is clear the psma scan, by taking the blinders off the 0.2 to 10-20 psa window;---- is revealing the progression for the vast majority of patients is more stepwise than any cancer known to man except for papillary carcinoma of the thyroid and basal cell and squamous cell carcinoma of skin. I mean even at the psa 10-20 range, the progression was lymph node, then bone, oligometastatic first, then very late distant visceral mets such as lung and liver; for most patients with low psa velocity. The oligometastatic stage is another future stage which has not been codified in the bible: The AJCC staging manual. Of course, if you have high psa velocity; especially those with psadt <3months, then prostate cancer is more unpredictable like most other cancers and more likely to be wide spread to more advanced sites. In the 0.2 to 10-20 range, for those with low psa velocity, it is first prostate bed, then pelvic lymph nodes including rectal (FB MichaelF), then immediately nearby extrapelvic lymph nodes, internal and external iliac lymph nodes, then low aortic lymph nodes. It is not going to your axilla or neck nodes for example. In the low percentage of cases with bone mets, they are usually oligometastatic at these levels - which have responded to directed stereotactic radiotherapy; admittedly maybe not durable now; but this opens the door for example for trials of directed RT to one or 2 bone mets, in combination with Radium 223, in combination with Ac 225-Psma who knows. Hodgkins use to be fatal; now almost all low stage Hodgkins are cured with combinations that have acronyms like ABVD. It took awhile to find the right combinations; None of this has been tested on this ultralow volume disease, represented by the phase of bcr between 0.2 and 10-20. Basic oncologic theory 101: Any therapy has the best chance of working with low volume disease. And basic molecular biology theory: Cancer has a greater chance of winning when there is a greater reservoir (tumor volume) of chance events to randomly create that one resistant clone with the right combination of molecular defects to produce the metastatic phenotype. Studies are showing that psma is correcting therapy in 50% of patients; stated more strongly 50% of the time patients are getting the wrong therapy by the conventional blind method of one size fits all. But of course, we will not know for sure, the full impact until 10 years from now. ---- Djin: But let's say you fear you may be the exception. Let's say it does not go stepwise, in your case: maybe it will hit an external iliac lymph node and not your pelvic bed. Well, if you don't pull the trigger on blind prostate bed only salvage RT, but instead get a salvage lymphadenectomy of that iliac chain informed by a +psma, you could set your psa clock back to zero and still have salvage RT in your gun for when and if you have a 2nd bcr after salvage external iliac lymphadenectomy. Admittedly, I am making it up. But the combinations are many and the studies are showing it is changing treatment in 50% of patients. Another factoid that Ahlering said to me that I have never seen in print. He told me nobody has ever died of prostate bed only recurrence. If you can find that Djin that will be another eureka moment for me. If any forum brothers know of anyone who has died of prostate bed recurrence, please let me know so I can tell Ahlering.",

I quote from their conclusion section: \"Conversely, in men with less aggressive disease (ie, organ confined disease and pathologic grade groups 1\u20133), PSA level did not impact cancer-specific survival.

The researchers from Italy and Mayo Clinic further state: \"While subanalyses of prospective randomized trials have found a benefit to postoperative radiotherapy (RT) in men with PSA persistence [12,13], to date no study identified the optimal candidate for this approach in order to maximize oncologic benefit for those most likely to experience disease progression, while sparing the use of RT in those less likely to benefit from it.\" In other words, believe it or not, no study to date, substratified/parsed psa persistent patients to see if some subsets benefited more or less from post RP, Rad Therapy. Well, their study showed not just less, but no benefit at all for a significant subset of persistent patients; those with predicted pcsm of <30% at 10 years.

Having been in the roughly 15% of PCa cases that are high grade, when I see stats like 70% good/30% not good, I somehow instictively look at them from the subjective viewpoint, and think the they may as well be 50/50 because the \"bad\" bucket is just too big to ignore and I don't want to take the risk. That's also why I would always come down on the Yes side for folks undecided about a proposed biopsy. I want to understand what you mean. I am not sure if I understand---- If 30% not good refers to your chance of having a non-prostate bed source for your recurrence, if you recur, then if you do blind prostate bed RT, the current standard of care; you are in fact getting the wrong therapy by any oncologic theory I can think of. That unfortunate circumstance would be included in the stat that psma pet changes, better stated corrects, therapy decisions. A good, no great thing. Just ask FB MichaelF about his relative/friend or XCJ3 from Germany. Correct me if I am wrong.

Nomogram study: Impact of Postoperative Radiotherapy in Men with Persistently Elevated Prostate-specific Antigen After Radical Prostatectomy for Prostate Cancer: A Long-term Survival Analysis [2017, Full Text] In your above cited Rosetta Stone article: I quote: \"The persistence of detectable PSA could be indeed related either to benign prostatic tissue left behind during surgery or to well differentiated tumour cells growing slowly, which may not necessarily require further treatment. This scenario could be theoretically similar to the diagnosis of an organ confined low-risk prostate cancer that nowadays may be managed expectantly.\" Expectantly is a synonym for Active Surveillance. This is exactly Dr. Ahlering's concept, which until now, I could not find in print. A Copernicus concept. Please correct me if I am wrong. I suppose I could be clueless, and everybody knows about this but me; but I can not find it in the Walsh Book, I have not seen it discussed in this forum and have not seen in Djin's research repository. But I could have missed it somewhere. Am I clueless? Please help me forum brothers. The mind tweak; counterintuitive concept of Active surveillance in the bcr stage; stated another way: How could anyone sit around and watch stage 4 cancer; because that is what stage any other site cancer is when it is recurrent with few exceptions like basal cell and squamous cell carcinoma of skin, Clint Eastwood would not sit around and watch, because how lucky does he feel? Ahlering must be insane or at least he must know nothing about cancer. Admittedly he requires low psa velocity, long time to bcr, prostate bed only recurrence. This is the same prostate cancer titan whose paper \"\"Unintended consequences of decreased PSA-based prostate cancer screening [2018]; was significant in the crusade against the 2012 US Preventative Task force recommendation against Psa screening; resulting in the 2018 new position paper. Please read the thread I started on this. And tell me what you think. --- https://www.cancerforums.net/threads...-Psa-screening And actually the Rosetta authors are making a stronger statement to include not just bcr patients; but a significant subset of persistent patients who heretofore were by definition considered high risk. Or as forum brothers, are wont to point out, the proof is in the pudding re: Psa in the postoperative setting: and PSA persistence in the postoperative setting = surgical cure failure period end of story. Throw all the adverse data points, nomograms for prediction out the window with the rear view mirror. If you are PSA persistent, you are Stage 4. Better get RT and RT fast. Where is my thinking wrong? Eureka, Thank you: Djin. For finally finding in print, what I have been piecing together painfully for the last year since I got the shock and awe diagnosis of cancer. Djin: Now, if you can find me research on Active Surveillance in the earliest stage 4 of prostate cancer which is called BCR; that will be a greater eureka moment for me. P.S. I believe on the semantic argument of what to call Gleason 3 cancer; the Rosetta authors have chosen \"tumor\". Am I incorrect, on inferring that, from the above quote. Furthermore, I suspect, the word tumor was carefully chosen by the authors. Am I wrong? And if I am wrong, then what do you Forum brothers think they mean by well differentiated tumor cells growing slowly. Geez, maybe I need a rosetta stone to interpret their rosetta stone. lol.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by DjinTonic \"(6) They invade local tissue and spread to distant sites (tissue invasion and metastasis)\" It may be more of a distinction without a difference whether you want to require a cancer to necessarily do both. I read this as a description of what cancer is capable of doing, invade and metastasize. Take basal cell carcinoma of the skin -- it can invade down to the bone, but metastasis is extremely rare. Also, I think the jury is still out whether G6 can itself progress to, say, G7, or whether higher-grade lesions arise directly from healthy cells. Keeping G6 within the umbrella makes it easier for doctors to explain why not all men with G6 are candidates for AS and as best treated. I think Epstein has made that point as well. Your points are all well taken. I was not stating that Gleason 3+3 is not cancer. And you are correct basal cell carcinoma rarely metastasizes; yet it is called correctly carcinoma. ----- But in the clinical realm, there is no issue of active surveillance for basal cell carcinoma; you cut it out - end of story ---- so there is no need for a semantic argument. Furthermore, basal cell carcinoma, as you pointed out, can locally invade and cause tremendous problems; so even clinically it is appropriate to call it what it is: cancer. But clinically prostate CA is different: Quote from Ahlering to me: No one has ever died from prostate bed recurrence only prostate cancer. People have died from locally invasive basal cell carcinoma.",

      "Content": "Consult 1 ------- \"IDLE\" Even though Epstein is the titan of Prostate cancer pathology; he is not the titan who defined what is or is not cancer. The definition on that, was delineated only in the year 2000, by Dr. Robert Weinberg of MIT; molecular biologist. A mentor of mine. Sorry, I had to toot my own horn. The Six Hallmarks of Cancer: Seminal Paper published in Cell 1) Cancer cells stimulate their own growth (self-sufficiency in growth signals); (2) They resist inhibitory signals that might otherwise stop their growth (insensitivity to anti-growth signals); (3) They resist their programmed cell death (evading apoptosis); (4) They can multiply indefinitely (limitless replicative potential) (5) They stimulate the growth of blood vessels to supply nutrients to tumors (sustained angiogenesis); (6) They invade local tissue and spread to distant sites (tissue invasion and metastasis). Epstein is correct Gleason 3, as he has recently defined it, in his seminal papers, fulfills all 6 criteria of cancer hallmarks except that it only fulfills part of criterion 6; it invades local tissue; but does not spread to distant sites---- this explains the biologic part of the semantic argument for: indolent lesion of epithelial origin (IDLE). But, the major part of the semantic argument for change in terminology of Gleason 6 vis a vis the word: cancer === is patient acceptance of active surveillance. The mantra, bible, constitution, that has been drilled into us, correctly for one size fits all for all cancers: is the earlier you treat cancer the better. This in combination with the fear of the cancer results in an immediate strong emotional bias to treat immediately, ask questions later; just ask Clint Eastwood - and believe it or not that unfortunately plays into doctor's emotional bias to do something: watchful waiting, active surveillance was a hard emotional sell even to doctors. In my opinion, the latter IDLE would never have caught on/been accepted; if for no other reason because it is awkward - not catchy like - uncancer or pre-cancer admittedly, neither of the prior terms fits Gleason 3 exactly either, - and completely unexplainable to a patient in a 30 minute office visit; let alone all else that has to occur. The best expert for the above problem: is not a molecular biologist/scientist, pathologist, urologic surgeon, urologic radiologic oncologist; but an English professor-lexicon expert. Even though, I completely agree that biologically Gleason 6 is cancer; I kind of disagree with Epstein on the lexicon aspect, in that it would be better for patient care if it is called something other than cancer, for those with all other criteria: low volume, low Psa/density, etc. ----- in that innumerable patient hours are probably wasted explaining active surveillance for something called cancer; a hard sell requiring alot of education. \"But I have cancer, why are we just watching it, I do not feel comfortable doing that, I respectfully disagree even though you are the doctor, and I am the patient and I know nothing about the disease. Geez, I think I need a 2nd opinion, because my doctor clearly does not know anything about cancer\" ----- I mean how many permutations of this conversation must be occuring everywhere.\" This is, in large part, why active surveillance is such a hard sell. So, an academic urologic pathologist proposes: \"Indolent lesion of epithelial origin\" and even though it absolutely is biologically correct; actually autistically thought that it had a chance of being accepted by the in the trenches community urologists. DR: HI patient - just wanted to inform you that you have indolent lesion of epithelial origin. What planet was he on?",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by DjinTonic \"(6) They invade local tissue and spread to distant sites (tissue invasion and metastasis)\" It may be more of a distinction without a difference whether you want to require a cancer to necessarily do both. I read this as a description of what cancer is capable of doing, invade and metastasize. Take basal cell carcinoma of the skin -- it can invade down to the bone, but metastasis is extremely rare. Also, I think the jury is still out whether G6 can itself progress to, say, G7, or whether higher-grade lesions arise directly from healthy cells. Keeping G6 within the umbrella makes it easier for doctors to explain why not all men with G6 are candidates for AS and as best treated. I think Epstein has made that point as well. Your points are all well taken. I was not stating that Gleason 3+3 is not cancer. And you are correct basal cell carcinoma rarely metastasizes; yet it is called correctly carcinoma. ----- But in the clinical realm, there is no issue of active surveillance for basal cell carcinoma; you cut it out - end of story ---- so there is no need for a semantic argument. Furthermore, basal cell carcinoma, as you pointed out, can locally invade and cause tremendous problems; so even clinically it is appropriate to call it what it is: cancer. But clinically prostate CA is different: Quote from Ahlering to me: No one has ever died from prostate bed recurrence only prostate cancer. People have died from locally invasive basal cell carcinoma.",

      "Content": "J. Epstein is a Professor of Pathology at Johns Hopkins. He is the titan of Gleason Grading period. People on this forum have their favorite titan urologic surgeons whether they are from the Johns Hopkins, like Walsh and Partin; Mayo Clinic, Memorial Sloan Kettering, like Tewari, Thomas Ahlering at UCI (the one titan I have personally met), Carrol at UCSF, Stanford, Dana Farber, and other Meccas. But in Pathology, currently believe it or not, J. Epstein, is the titan period. Epstein was able to revise the grading of prostate cancer to dovetail perfectly into the concept of active surveillance. He was trying to create on purpose with his revision in grading criteria in 2014 a Score 3+3 cancer that statistically does not metastasize; which he was unbelievably, serendipitously able to 99.99% do. It must have been an E=mc2 moment for him. Now, doctors can simply explain to patients that Gleason 3 = uncancer. Uncancer borrowed from 7up commercial, the uncola. Catchy phrase. No nuances, no parsing as a 1st, second, and 3rd approximation: of course until you get to tumor heterogenity, missed percentages, missed grading, decipher/molecular score, and biologic transformation, among others. I mean, in biology, you are never going to get to complete certainty; this is beyond what we are ever going to get regarding certainty in biology vis a vis at the light microscopic level/microns--- until we get to complete molecular/angstroms characterization of prostate CA which will probably take 30-100 years - i.e. science fiction territory. In effect, this is in itself, a breakthru in the story of prostate cancer treatment which is underappreciated. Because we patients are only interested in screening, prognosis and treatment, we assume the diagnosis including grading and staging is what it is. The what it is = Our signature in this forum, which is the starting point of discussing everyone's case. Stated another way - The mantra of this forum: Please fill out your signature and then we can advise. The 2012 screening taskforce was recommending, not screening with psa, except in select populations. From the time of the 2014 revision of grading, it took till 2018 for a consensus taskforce to publish a revision to the screening guidelines; a 4 year lag, that is the lag in consensus statements. Consensus statements like the NCCN guidelines and taskforce recommendations are in effect = standard of care. I and other forum brothers are casualties of that 2012 standard of care/consensus statement. And why when a breakthru like ultrasensitive imaging and its implication for the early biochemical recurrence stage of prostate cancer comes down the pike which takes the blinders off where the recurrences occur in the 0.2 to 10-20 PSA stage of the disease ---the stage of the disease, I am personally facing; there will be a lag in a consensus statement of years. Epstein's change in the grading criteria shrunk the Gleason 6 category into a better prognosis cohort and due to the seemingly paradoxical \"Will Rogers phenomena\", created a larger better prognosis Gleason 7 and 8 category. --- I say paradoxical, because the \"Will Rogers phenomena\" is completely counterintuitive. Look it up. It is a head spinner. It makes everyone have a better prognosis who was graded after 2014 despite the fact nothing has changed biologically. So, believe it or not, all the retrospective studies that you are reading including from the large patient databases that generate nomograms are more pessimistic in prognosis for those who were graded after 2014 because they are based on historical grading criteria, unless the paper specifically restates that the slides were regraded, a herculean task for prostate cancer researchers, since the cohort sizes have to be so large to prove statistical significance; furthermore by law labs are only required to retain slides for 10 years. So, the slides would not even exist to be reread for many especially in the late recurring cases. --- Furthermore, treatment is better now - Alot of hope out there, but also an even greater chance of overtreatment. This new, as of 2014 grading shift/migration, because of the Will Rogers effect, will result in greater overtreatment of the 3+4 category. This is in part why in the revised 2018 taskforce recommendation; select (low volume, low psa, low life expectancy) 3+4 patients can safely undergo active surveillance - Despite our first approximation axiom that Gleason 4 is biologically dangerous.",

      "Content": "Consult 1 ------- \"IDLE\" Even though Epstein is the titan of Prostate cancer pathology; he is not the titan who defined what is or is not cancer. The definition on that, was delineated only in the year 2000, by Dr. Robert Weinberg of MIT; molecular biologist. A mentor of mine. Sorry, I had to toot my own horn. The Six Hallmarks of Cancer: Seminal Paper published in Cell 1) Cancer cells stimulate their own growth (self-sufficiency in growth signals); (2) They resist inhibitory signals that might otherwise stop their growth (insensitivity to anti-growth signals); (3) They resist their programmed cell death (evading apoptosis); (4) They can multiply indefinitely (limitless replicative potential) (5) They stimulate the growth of blood vessels to supply nutrients to tumors (sustained angiogenesis); (6) They invade local tissue and spread to distant sites (tissue invasion and metastasis). Epstein is correct Gleason 3, as he has recently defined it, in his seminal papers, fulfills all 6 criteria of cancer hallmarks except that it only fulfills part of criterion 6; it invades local tissue; but does not spread to distant sites---- this explains the biologic part of the semantic argument for: indolent lesion of epithelial origin (IDLE). But, the major part of the semantic argument for change in terminology of Gleason 6 vis a vis the word: cancer === is patient acceptance of active surveillance. The mantra, bible, constitution, that has been drilled into us, correctly for one size fits all for all cancers: is the earlier you treat cancer the better. This in combination with the fear of the cancer results in an immediate strong emotional bias to treat immediately, ask questions later; just ask Clint Eastwood - and believe it or not that unfortunately plays into doctor's emotional bias to do something: watchful waiting, active surveillance was a hard emotional sell even to doctors. In my opinion, the latter IDLE would never have caught on/been accepted; if for no other reason because it is awkward - not catchy like - uncancer or pre-cancer admittedly, neither of the prior terms fits Gleason 3 exactly either, - and completely unexplainable to a patient in a 30 minute office visit; let alone all else that has to occur.

      "Content": "I watched the video; a 7 minute interview with Sigrid Carlsson, MD, professor of epidemiology at MSK. Now, we are getting somewhere. This an epidemiologic, statistical issue, not a pathology, urology, or radiology issue. I know the urologist is the lead singer, and even though the lead singer is capable of talking about all the intruments especially to non-musicians, like us patients and even the urologist minions; but it is refreshing to see the drummer do the interview about drumming. Just like I am sure she can talk about DREs and in fact she did mention DRE, but I guarantee you she does not do DREs, though we might want to believe so. Just take a gander, and let me know what you think. Her main message which she said no less than 10 times: is that Active surveillance is perfectly safe including for their 3+4, low volume cohort; the latter already pointed out by ASAdvocate. And they do not use molecular tests. Not stated but implied including Decipher. Our forum brothers better educate Memorial Sloan Kettering doctors about decipher; their adoption lags us. Get them on the phone, Chuck - got to get MSK up to speed re: decipher. She adds that their study cohort is one of the longest, spanning 17 years, median 4 years; and largest 3,000 patients with 224 low volume G3+4. They have no age criterion. Their protocol: Follow psa Confirmatory biopsy at 12 months; DRE q 6months; MRI q 18 months; biopsy q 2-3 years She did not go into much further detail: but there are obviously; many decision tree paths from these data points. I presume because she knew she may lose her audience with more details; and by the way, her main audience, are the urologist minions, not us. lose her audience to the overwhelming main message which she wanted to beat home, unfortunately in the usual understated doctoreze way, that AS is perfectly safe. She further states that their abstract will add to the body of literature confirming the safety of AS. In my opinion: her main message was to address what I call the emotional issue. - \"to allay the fears of both patients and doctors\", the urologist minions and to promote \"shared decision making which many do not engage in\"; which I translate to: she wants the urologist minions to more actively educate and promote AS; so that the US can catch up with Europe. She alluded to \"negotiating theory\" from which her colleagues have learned how to use words to make patients and their doctors feel more safe: I interpret this as the semantic issue. I wonder what she would think of calling her AS cohort: Stage 0 prostate cancer or precancer? informed by a similar challenge in breast cancer: DCIS (Stage 0) breast cancer: http://www.chicagotribune.com/lifest...502-story.html Forum Brothers, let me know what you think, of this analogous, admittedly not identical model. For me, I found it amazingly analogous, read the story; and I think you too will be amazed how analogous it is to Gleason 3 uncancer and according to Dr. Carlsson even 3+4 low volume cancer And the, above article, brings up both the emotional and semantic issue as major issues. Select quotes for those that don't want to open the link: Stage 0 breast cancer (DCIS) \"What exactly is it - a pre-cancer, cancer or more a risk factor?\" \"If we can get to the point where we say, 'This is not cancer, but a marker of risk,' maybe we can reduce surgery,\" said Deanna Attai, a UCLA breast surgeon. Sounds like a semantic question to me. What do you think? \"Most say the condition, while not cancer, needs aggressive treatment because 20 - 30 percent of cases will spread to surrounding tissue and become invasive cancer if left alone.\" Wow. This sounds worse to me than Gleason 3 or 3+4. What do you think? \"oncologists, worried about overtreatment, .. stepping up .... active surveillance ... launching COMET, the nation's first prospective, randomized clinical trial to test whether monitoring is safe. If the answer is yes ... could spare thousands the pain, trauma and cost of therapies.\" Well guess what: we know the answer for prostate cancer: AS is perfectly safe; so why aren't we sparing thousands of unnecessary treatment. What is that number: According to the NIH:NCI SEER data - pca incidence is 165k per year and the majority are Gleason 3+3 and 3+4; and with increasing screening that % will only get bigger - \"stage migration\". You do the math. The amount of overtreatment is staggering. But I do not think the average urologist, let alone patient can grasp the numbers and the risk analysis; the human brain just does not work that way. \"This is a trial whose time has come,\" said Otis Brawley, chief medical officer of the American Cancer Society. \"Many of us have felt for two decades that this study needed to be done, but we needed to get doctors and patients to the right point emotionally where it could go forward.\" Emotionally, not my word, Dr. Bradley's, CMO of the American Cancer Society. Dr. Bernard Fisher, who scientifically overturned the Halstead radical mastectomy in 1974, would tell you 2 decades is about right for post-Copernican adoption. \"The opening of the new trial parallels greater interest in surveillance for a variety of pre- and early-stage cancers. In recent years, the proportion of U.S. men with low-risk prostate cancers being monitored rather than removed has surged to more than 40 percent. Last fall, a study by MSK found that active surveillance may be a suitable approach for some thyroid cancer patients.\" I hope everyone has come to this conclusion: AS should not have 40% penetrance in the US. It should approach as much as possible 100%; barring non-compliant capable patients. What is the problem? In my opinion: a. Understated deliveries like the above interview. But that is the nature of academics, the delivery has to be Fedspeak-like. Solution: An all out public campaign blitz; like what is being done for e.g. Keytruda treatment for non-small cell lung cancer. I am sure you have seen the ads. b. semantic and emotional: the masses (patients) and the minions (rank and file urologists) have to get on board. Let me know what you think; especially where my thinking is wrong.",

      "Content": "See Thread (K) in the Subforum for studies on its use in recurrent PCa. I did come across the following case study; however, the above study may be an initial indication that this phenomenon is (hopefully) infrequent or rare: Prostate-Specific Membrane Antigen-Negative Metastases-A Potential Pitfall in Prostate-Specific Membrane Antigen PET https://europepmc.org/abstract/med/29659383[/QUOTE] Above quoted from Djin post: My take on it: Case report of one patient whose pulmonary mets were negative by PSMA. This report is just to add to the very beginning of the literature on PSMA. That this can happen ----- so that researchers are aware. The fact that a journal would accept for publication, one case report speaks to its rarity; so far. Just as when a drug is approved by FDA, and it is out in the field being used, like Fen-Fen for dieting; and down the line someone publishes a rare association with life threatining pumonary hypertension which though rare (100 cases out of the millions taking it) was enough to pull it off the market; despite it being the first diet pill that really worked and probably could have saved many peoples lives. What they really should have done is kept it on the market with huge caveats; so that only the highest risk obese, such as those destined for bariatric surgery, could potentially avoid that operation with its own risks and consequences including death rate of 0.3%. But no, they heavy handedly took it off the market. Sorry, for the digression; that personally pissed me off, I was losing weight on it --- back in 1995 I think. - Back to PSMA - Probably just like rarely prostate cancers are completely PSA negative: usually rare Gleason 10s or rare subtypes such small cell prostate cancer. And per PSMA in general; the radiology oncologists at UCSF are so hot, hot on this; that they recommended strongly that I do it \"off label\"; not standard of care, and not part of an investigational study ---- in the biochemical recurrence phase of the disease, post radical prostatectomy, which it looks like I am destined for unfortunately for me; but I would have to wait till 0.2 PSA; even though I am intermediate risk across the board, by conventional CAPRA-s score of 3 and fancy new molecular - decipher score. I also have consulted with Dr. Ahlering who is also beyond hot for it; because it opens the door for \"salvage surgery\" in the BCR phase; a concept that is not even done in the U.S.; but European centers do it and FB XJC3 from Germany is the poster boy for that. His story is amazing; if you want a great anecdotal story. Go to his thread on PSMA-Pet. Wonderful, beautiful, out of the box, not standard of care; but absolutely soundly based on oncologic theory; anecdotal story. Unfortunately for us prostate cancer patients, even though PSMA/and or other ultrasensitive imaging techniques are going to be a major step forward in prostate cancer treatment; it takes along time - years and many patients to prove something new is of real benefit as far as the real endpoints - insurance companies, national task forces are interested in - overall survival and prostate cancer specific mortality; in other words it will take along time for it to become standard of care with the insurance companies. Just like FB MichaelF states from another thread: MP 3T MRIs are slowly working their way into the reimbursable PCa diagnostic armamentarium. And Decipher test was not reimbursed by my insurance company; PSMA I suspect will be an out of pocket expense; if you can find a place to do it, not in study. I suspect that you can only get it done at the few places that do it; as part of an investigational study. I, for one, maybe there are others in my boat, the slow boat thru early Bcr waters, taking and trusting the strong recommendation from Ahlering and UCSF radiation oncologist, are not waiting for it to become standard of care. I guess that makes me a guinea pig; which means I will have to accept the downside of ''waiting\" till I hit 0.2, instead of jumping on it at 0.1, to pull the trigger for salvage. Rats, I thought I was taking advantage of the recent \"body of knowledge\" regarding lead time gain with ultra, ultra sensitive PSA's to the 3rd decimal point to jump on it fast for some significant oncologic advantage. Now, I have the competing major advance of PSMA my doctors believe trumps the former. And by the way; Ahlering was one of the titans that spearheaded the backlash against the taskforce that recommended against routine PSA screening; -Yes, that taskforce was right, in the aggregate, bean counterway, that PSA screening resulted in alot, alot of overtreatment and resultant cost without significant impact on mortality; but one downside is for example: there are Forum Brothers who are casualties of that failure to screen. In fact, Djin just put in his research forum, Ahlering's recent study: highlighting the consequences of that taskforce recommendation; a rise in the incidence of higher stage disease - a step backwards in the fight against prostate CA. ------ Needless to say, I am a huge fanboy of Ahlering. My apologizes for the somewhat lack of pertinence: since the article was concerning PSMA relevance in the staging phase of the disease; not the bcr phase of the disease; but that is unfortunately the stage I am heading for now. And the phase I can speak up about; and gentlemen let me tell you this is a major advance; I mean stated another way: One of the big holes in the salvage stage: Is where is the recurrence? No patient would know; because you have to start salvage RT before any conventional study could tell you where it is; especially at levels of 1.0; let alone 0.5; and now just recently the argument for 0.2 and even more recently for 0.1 over 0.2 for trigger point for salvation Rad Therapy.",

Please view and towards the end, Dr Flavell shows some near miraculous case studies that used \"targeted\" beta & alpha emitters. PSMA Imaging and Theranostics: Future Impact to Patient Management\u2013 Interview with Robert R. Flavell, MD, UCSF Thank you MichaelF for the research and link: To summarize the Dr. Flavell anecdotal case presentation: For high drama, Dr. Flavell presented a patient who in 12/2014 had a PSMA scan showing his bone riddled with metastases from skull to leg bones, in other words as positive a scan as possible with a PSA of 2,923. Then after Ac225-PSMA therapy, on 9/2015 had a completely negative scan and PSA <0.1 -----Geez, I wonder why they did not do an ultrasensitive PSA, at least to a 2nd digit. lol. I bet UCSF doctors were jumping in joy with utter disbelief at the scan results; let alone the patient. If that scan interval change - riddled with mets to negative - is not testament to a probable game changing breakthru, of course in the absence of long term controlled phase 3 studies; I do not what would be. Stated another way: this patient was at the furthest end of stage 4 disease and after treatment with Ac225-PSMA therapy, showed complete remission of his disease by both scan and psa. Even, if his response is not durable and his doubling time is as fast at 3-6 months; how many years will it take for him to reach 2,923 again, starting from <0.1. Probably, not in his lifetime --- But, you do the math. ---- Where are our statisticians on the forum. OneofMany are you there; we need your help in this math exercise.",

      "Content": "See Thread (K) in the Subforum for studies on its use in recurrent PCa. I did come across the following case study; however, the above study may be an initial indication that this phenomenon is (hopefully) infrequent or rare: Prostate-Specific Membrane Antigen-Negative Metastases-A Potential Pitfall in Prostate-Specific Membrane Antigen PET https://europepmc.org/abstract/med/29659383[/QUOTE] Above quoted from Djin post: My take on it: Case report of one patient whose pulmonary mets were negative by PSMA. This report is just to add to the very beginning of the literature on PSMA. That this can happen ----- so that researchers are aware. The fact that a journal would accept for publication, one case report speaks to its rarity; so far. Just as when a drug is approved by FDA, and it is out in the field being used, like Fen-Fen for dieting; and down the line someone publishes a rare association with life threatining pumonary hypertension which though rare (100 cases out of the millions taking it) was enough to pull it off the market; despite it being the first diet pill that really worked and probably could have saved many peoples lives. What they really should have done is kept it on the market with huge caveats; so that only the highest risk obese, such as those destined for bariatric surgery, could potentially avoid that operation with its own risks and consequences including death rate of 0.3%. But no, they heavy handedly took it off the market. Sorry, for the digression; that personally pissed me off, I was losing weight on it --- back in 1995 I think. - Back to PSMA - Probably just like rarely prostate cancers are completely PSA negative: usually rare Gleason 10s or rare subtypes such small cell prostate cancer. And per PSMA in general; the radiology oncologists at UCSF are so hot, hot on this; that they recommended strongly that I do it \"off label\"; not standard of care, and not part of an investigational study ---- in the biochemical recurrence phase of the disease, post radical prostatectomy, which it looks like I am destined for unfortunately for me; but I would have to wait till 0.2 PSA; even though I am intermediate risk across the board, by conventional CAPRA-s score of 3 and fancy new molecular - decipher score. I also have consulted with Dr. Ahlering who is also beyond hot for it; because it opens the door for \"salvage surgery\" in the BCR phase; a concept that is not even done in the U.S.; but European centers do it and FB XJC3 from Germany is the poster boy for that. His story is amazing; if you want a great anecdotal story. Go to his thread on PSMA-Pet. Wonderful, beautiful, out of the box, not standard of care; but absolutely soundly based on oncologic theory; anecdotal story. Unfortunately for us prostate cancer patients, even though PSMA/and or other ultrasensitive imaging techniques are going to be a major step forward in prostate cancer treatment; it takes along time - years and many patients to prove something new is of real benefit as far as the real endpoints - insurance companies, national task forces are interested in - overall survival and prostate cancer specific mortality; in other words it will take along time for it to become standard of care with the insurance companies. Just like FB MichaelF states from another thread: MP 3T MRIs are slowly working their way into the reimbursable PCa diagnostic armamentarium. And Decipher test was not reimbursed by my insurance company; PSMA I suspect will be an out of pocket expense; if you can find a place to do it, not in study. I suspect that you can only get it done at the few places that do it; as part of an investigational study. I, for one, maybe there are others in my boat, the slow boat thru early Bcr waters, taking and trusting the strong recommendation from Ahlering and UCSF radiation oncologist, are not waiting for it to become standard of care. I guess that makes me a guinea pig; which means I will have to accept the downside of ''waiting\" till I hit 0.2, instead of jumping on it at 0.1, to pull the trigger for salvage. Rats, I thought I was taking advantage of the recent \"body of knowledge\" regarding lead time gain with ultra, ultra sensitive PSA's to the 3rd decimal point to jump on it fast for some significant oncologic advantage. Now, I have the competing major advance of PSMA my doctors believe trumps the former. And by the way; Ahlering was one of the titans that spearheaded the backlash against the taskforce that recommended against routine PSA screening; -Yes, that taskforce was right, in the aggregate, bean counterway, that PSA screening resulted in alot, alot of overtreatment and resultant cost without significant impact on mortality; but one downside is for example: there are Forum Brothers who are casualties of that failure to screen. In fact, Djin just put in his research forum, Ahlering's recent study: highlighting the consequences of that taskforce recommendation; a rise in the incidence of higher stage disease - a step backwards in the fight against prostate CA. ------ Needless to say, I am a huge fanboy of Ahlering. My apologizes for the somewhat lack of pertinence: since the article was concerning PSMA relevance in the staging phase of the disease; not the bcr phase of the disease; but that is unfortunately the stage I am heading for now. And the phase I can speak up about; and gentlemen let me tell you this is a major advance; I mean stated another way: One of the big holes in the salvage stage: Is where is the recurrence? No patient would know; because you have to start salvage RT before any conventional study could tell you where it is; especially at levels of 1.0; let alone 0.5; and now just recently the argument for 0.2 and even more recently for 0.1 over 0.2 for trigger point for salvation Rad Therapy.",

Please view and towards the end, Dr Flavell shows some near miraculous case studies that used \"targeted\" beta & alpha emitters. PSMA Imaging and Theranostics: Future Impact to Patient Management\u2013 Interview with Robert R. Flavell, MD, UCSF Thank you MichaelF for the research and link: To summarize the Dr. Flavell anecdotal case presentation: For high drama, Dr. Flavell presented a patient who in 12/2014 had a PSMA scan showing his bone riddled with metastases from skull to leg bones, in other words as positive a scan as possible with a PSA of 2,923. Then after Ac225-PSMA therapy, on 9/2015 had a completely negative scan and PSA <0.1 -----Geez, I wonder why they did not do an ultrasensitive PSA, at least to a 2nd digit. lol. I bet UCSF doctors were jumping in joy with utter disbelief at the scan results; let alone the patient. If that scan interval change - riddled with mets to negative - is not testament to a probable game changing breakthru, of course in the absence of long term controlled phase 3 studies; I do not what would be. Stated another way: this patient was at the furthest end of stage 4 disease and after treatment with Ac225-PSMA therapy, showed complete remission of his disease by both scan and psa. Even, if his response is not durable and his doubling time is as fast at 3-6 months; how many years will it take for him to reach 2,923 again, starting from <0.1. Probably, not in his lifetime --- But, you do the math. ---- Where are our statisticians on the forum. OneofMany are you there; we need your help in this math exercise.",

      "Content": "All the replies are much appreciated. ------- Just Curious: Francij4 - What are your stats? I do not see your signature. Was wondering how applicable your expert MD's advice is to my case? I have not completely wrapped my head around the whether to pull the trigger at 0.1 or 0.2. Right now, I am leaning to putting it off till 0.2; but what do I know, I am just the patient. So, I think my plan is to revisit UCSF when I reach 0.1 to rediscuss my case vis a vis PSMA scan etc. and maybe get a 2nd opinion at UCLA another PSMA testing institution. In the meantime, I am praying for the, I suppose, unlikely chance that I get into the Michael F and Francij4 boat of low detectable but stable psa. Maybe, the 0.026 coincidence with Michael F's last reading is manna from heaven. lol Thank you to DjinTonic for the research links, in particular BCR, salvage RT, and PSMA scan.",

I am psychologically in Pratoman's boat of being \"cancered out\". I agree with comments that I really should only be looking at 2 significant digits for the \"3 consecutive rises\" definition of BCR and that I have plenty of time to pull the trigger on salvage RT; but things are not looking promising, especially if you believe in the 0.03 cutoff as probably indicating eventual BCR. 3 months ago, I consulted with UCSF radiation oncologist - ------ UCSF is hot on PSMA scan to detect site of recurrence ---- so I am in the RO pipeline and their plan for me, given all my data points-except for Decipher score which was pending at the time was to wait for when and if my PSA reaches 0.2 and then do PSMA scan - off label - without even being part of an investigational study I know the downside is that most recent studies are showing statistical benefit for starting salvage RT at values less than 0.2 Fortunately, I will have enough time to get a better idea of things including doubling time and possibly, however remote, have a leveling off what some papers refer to as persistently low, but stable psa as in Michael F's case. Just felt the need to give the 3 month psa monitoring/anxiety update. I continue to lurk in the background and appreciate the advice and solace this forum provides.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by Michael F Welcome back edwardo! Hoping that you had returned to tell us about a vanishing PSA. At this point, it appears that your PSA is rising. You are not currently in a crisis. The 3 questions that must be answered are: - Why is it rising? - Where is/are the \"pinpoint\" location/s of the PSA generator/s? - What curative treatment options remain? FYI: I have a relative who experienced a similar scenario: RALP followed by BR Next SRT followed by BR again. Next went to a \"Mecca\" CA Institute. When his PSA reached a level between 5.0 - 7.0, an MRI detected a (+) Lymph Node near his rectum. Surgery would have been risky due to prior radiation BUT in retrospect, it should have been attempted as the rest of the story is a total disaster. I relay this for the reason that you are in a much better position today with newer, far better scanning technologies such as: - 68Ga\u2010PSMA\u201011 PET/CT - F18-DCFPyL/PSMA Also, see DjinTonic's SubForum at the top of The Forum page for additional information on detection technologies. Here is a link to the section of interest: https://www.cancerforums.net/threads...80%93-Biopsies The newer technologies are not sensitive enough to locate sites of recurrence at your current PSA level. This gives you time to research the availability and feasibility of these scans. Reach out to Forum Brother (FB) garyi. Gary went to NIH and had one of these scans performed. Also, another FB found a clinical trial using one of these scans. You can search: https://clinicaltrials.gov/ By identifying the site of PSA generation, it may be possible to surgically excise it or focally ablate it in a single procedure vs treating systemically with ADT/Chemotherapy combinations. I too had my RALP in B-ham and came out of surgery with elevated risks for recurrence. Thus, I have to monitor my PSA closely (via ultrasensitive PSA). If recurrence begins to appear, I will wait until it can be pinpoint located by one of the newer PET/CT scans and opt to only treat locally. Lastly, since you are monitoring for possible recurrence, be sure that you are using The Same Lab and Same PSA Methodology Each Time!. If me (and I do), I would use LabCorp since they are based in B-ham. I would not use the in-house lab at UC-AL for post PCa treatment monitoring. Stay calm and do your research on the newer PET/CT imaging technologies that will pinpoint locate small foci of recurrent PCa. Good luck! Keep us updated on your findings. MF Michael F: I agree with your analysis and advice completely. However, I did want to point out that salvage surgery is not only not standard of care, it is virtually not done at all in the U.S.; including the most accepted variant of that in Europe, salvage lymphadenectomy. Even Ahlering, at UCI, who is beyond hot hot for how salvage surgery will dovetail into this newly developing ultrasensitive imaging technology, has only done a few, off-label and has not published on it. And even though, as lay people, we are currently witness to anecdotal cases of salvage surgery working including FB XJC3 from Germany-- working admittedly, with such short followup time, only at the minimum of setting the psa clock back to zero. Remember, it will take 10-15 years from now to prove the durability of psa responses to salvage surgery. For those FB brother's in my boat, do you want to wait that long for proof? But for those of us with bcr or heading to bcr like me, especially with low psa velocity or doubling time recurrence, setting the clock back to zero in itself is huge. The other huge theorectical advantage of salvage surgery, is that one still has salvage RT in the barrel for future use. I say theorectical because salvage surgery is not done in the U.S. You will get blank stares, even from the experts, let alone your local urologist or radiation oncologists in the U.S., concerning salvage surgery, because it is not standard of care ------ except for possibly salvage prostatecomy for patients who present with limited, low psa metastatic disease in the primary phase of treatment who might otherwise forgo local treatment altogether ----- not pertinent to this rising psa post RALP discussion. Please FB XJC3 if you are out there: let us know how yu are doing. For example, in Michael F's relative case: if you could roll the clock back, and find his rectal only positive lymph node, which was not de facto treated successfully by his salvage RT; even with hindsight at best they would offer directed RT, not salvage surgery here in U.S; maybe not even that because some Radiation oncologists would argue that directed therapy would be to great a risk to the rectum, i.e radiation proctitis, secondary cancer etc. Since your relative probably already had the near maximum dose to his pelvis --- Stated another way, radiation oncologists have strict guidelines of maximal doses allowable to specific tissue sites. And I am guessing since he already received RT to the area, they probably would have been unwilling to radiate that rectal only positive recurrence with the additional amount required to effect a cure. I suspect salvage surgery that sets the psa clock back to zero will have durable responses equivalent to salvage RT that sets the psa clock back to zero. The latter standard of care; the former not even done in U.S. If so, that will result in virtually same debate for the bcr stage as we have now regarding RT versus RALP for primary treatment. Likewise Ahlering is swimming upstream against conventional wisdom, on his new concept: active surveillance for the bcr stage of the disease for certain low risk, low psa velocity patients - the vast majority of whom have a constant low psa velocity recurrence which will never threaten their lives. He believes for the few who exponentially increase in psa velocity; that he can safely transition them to treatment. It may be hard to wrap your head around it. But this could result in virtually the same treatment arguments in this phase of the disease as when one is diagnosed with localized prostate cancer except that in the bcr phase of the disease you are starting with 0.1 psa = 1 cc of cancer roughly versus in the primary phase one could be starting with several or more cc of cancer; for those with localized disease. Several ccs of prostate cancer under active surveillance should have a greater chance of acquiring the molecular defects necessary to develop the metastatic capabilities=transform to non-indolent ca, or be missed by sampling error higher grade CA, than 1 cc of cancer, from a lead time and quantitive argument. The bcr phase patients who are \"low risk\" defined by Ahlering just by psa velocity alone, not published, by the forgoing argument should actually be better candidates for active surveillance than those in the primary phase of the disease, where it is not only standard of care, but being pushed because of the overtreatment issue. Talk about paradigm shift of thinking about prostate cancer in the bcr phase post radical prostatectomy. It is going to be a whole new world; but one we will not know the full implications of for another 10 years -- the timeline necessary for proof in prostate ca. The promise of this ultrasensitive imaging is being borne out by recent studies concerning altering, or should I more strongly say, correcting treatment plans: Your treatment plan may be corrected including stereotactic RT aimed at mono or oligorecurrent disease; extended RT fields; forgoing RT altogether in non-oligorecurrent disease, or boost RT to areas that are not maxed out by conventional RT dose, aiding in the decision on whether to add or not add HT to RT, etc. I suspect that even in the cases where the ultrasensitive imaging study reveals nothing: that that will be a significant finding also. But that would require another longwinded and even more abstruse discussion. Stated another way, the conventional wisdom/bible/standard of care for bcr after Ralp is RT+/-ADT period and after 2nd bcr post salvage RT = systemic rx. Even if you go to the academic centers, as a first approximation, unless you are in an investigational study, no one is going to recommend salvage surgery post ultrasensitive imaging study, because that is not standard of care --- with all its medical-legal implications. In summary, for edwardo : his standard of care treatment options are large not knowing all his particulars: including observation and all the known systemic therapies including ADT + combinations therein; but as yet do not include the ultrasensitive imaging informed corrected treatment decisions including potentially new directed therapies. As some naysayer may point out, there has been no proof that directed therapies in this recurrent phase of the disease work. But what they do not realize is that directed therapies have not been studied with low volume/0.1cc disease and will take hundreds of patients like XCJ3 in a prospective randomized study 10 years or more to prove. This ultrasensitive imaging futuristic stuff will open the door to directed therapies and more correct therapies. And should, in my opinion and Dr. Hope of UCSF's opinion, be fast tract because it will be standard of care and is a breakthru. But our system is not politically geared to do this - except for fast tracking treatment e.g. enzalutamide, for late stage disease;--- it is politically not geared for an expensive imaging study.",

      "Content": "Michael F, Thank you so much for the link to the incredibly thorough and lucid primer/mini-lecture from Dr. Flavell at UCSF on PSMA based imaging and therapeutics. Some of my take home messages: In the bcr stage of disease: 1. It changes, -better stated corrects- therapy in > 50% of patients. Stated more strongly: >50% of patients are conceivably getting the wrong therapy, of course by the retrospectoscope of this new technology 2. Metastasis directed therapy is showing increase in ADT free survival. 3. Clinical impact research is in its infancy; barring for example #2 finding. 4. There is a whole new world of PSMA based therapeutics. Concerning the latter - I love anecdotal stories. For high drama, he presented a patient who in 12/2014 had a PSMA scan showing his bone riddled with metastases from skull to leg bones, in other words as positive a scan as possible with a PSA of 2,923. Then after Ac225-PSMA therapy, on 9/2015 had a completely negative scan and PSA <0.1 -----Geez, I wonder why they did not do an ultrasensitive PSA, at least to a 2nd digit. lol. I bet UCSF doctors were jumping in joy with utter disbelief at the scan results; let alone the patient. If the latter, is not testament to a probable game changing breakthru, of course in the absence of long term controlled phase 3 studies; I do not what would be. Stated another way: this patient was at the furthest end of stage 4 disease and showed complete remission of his disease by both scan and psa. Even, if his response is not durable and his doubling time is as fast at 3-6 months; how many years will it take for him to reach 2,923 again, starting from <0.1. Probably, not in his lifetime --- You do the math. ---- Of course, Dr. Flavell delivered the lecture, in a relative monotoned measured doctoreze way, with all sorts of caveats including that there are no prospective studies to date - but pointing out since prostate cancer is so slow moving this will take awhile. But let me tell you, I have been seen at UCSF radiation oncology, and their delivery to me was not measured --- they are beyond hot on the implications of this technology. For those heading slowly into the bcr waters, like me, it takes the blinders off in the 0.2 to 4-10 psa range; so that you are no longer shooting in the dark at this disease. A game changer. Again, I apologize to edwardo ---- this is off topic per standard of care for you. Please moderators help me. ---- Can we divert the futuristic discussions re: Psma to a new thread. But to all, if you want an easy to understand quick primer on PSMA based technology and its implications for prostate cancer: check out link provided by Michael F. Thank you again, Michael.",

      "Content": "Michael F, Thank you so much for the link to the incredibly thorough and lucid primer/mini-lecture from Dr. Flavell at UCSF on PSMA based imaging and therapeutics. Some of my take home messages: In the bcr stage of disease: 1. It changes, -better stated corrects- therapy in > 50% of patients. Stated more strongly: >50% of patients are conceivably getting the wrong therapy, of course by the retrospectoscope of this new technology 2. Metastasis directed therapy is showing increase in ADT free survival. 3. Clinical impact research is in its infancy; barring for example #2 finding. 4. There is a whole new world of PSMA based therapeutics. Concerning the latter - I love anecdotal stories. For high drama, he presented a patient who in 12/2014 had a PSMA scan showing his bone riddled with metastases from skull to leg bones, in other words as positive a scan as possible with a PSA of 2,923. Then after Ac225-PSMA therapy, on 9/2015 had a completely negative scan and PSA <0.1 -----Geez, I wonder why they did not do an ultrasensitive PSA, at least to a 2nd digit. lol. I bet UCSF doctors were jumping in joy with utter disbelief at the scan results; let alone the patient. If the latter, is not testament to a probable game changing breakthru, of course in the absence of long term controlled phase 3 studies; I do not what would be. Stated another way: this patient was at the furthest end of stage 4 disease and showed complete remission of his disease by both scan and psa. Even, if his response is not durable and his doubling time is as fast at 3-6 months; how many years will it take for him to reach 2,923 again, starting from <0.1. Probably, not in his lifetime --- You do the math. ---- Of course, Dr. Flavell delivered the lecture, in a relative monotoned measured doctoreze way, with all sorts of caveats including that there are no prospective studies to date - but pointing out since prostate cancer is so slow moving this will take awhile. But let me tell you, I have been seen at UCSF radiation oncology, and their delivery to me was not measured --- they are beyond hot on the implications of this technology. For those heading slowly into the bcr waters, like me, it takes the blinders off in the 0.2 to 4-10 psa range; so that you are no longer shooting in the dark at this disease. A game changer. Again, I apologize to edwardo ---- this is off topic per standard of care for you. Please moderators help me. ---- Can we divert the futuristic discussions re: Psma to a new thread. But to all, if you want an easy to understand quick primer on PSMA based technology and its implications for prostate cancer: check out link provided by Michael F. Thank you again, Michael.",

Was wondering how applicable your expert MD's advice is to my case? I have not completely wrapped my head around the whether to pull the trigger at 0.1 or 0.2. Right now, I am leaning to putting it off till 0.2; but what do I know, I am just the patient. So, I think my plan is to revisit UCSF when I reach 0.1 to rediscuss my case vis a vis PSMA scan etc. and maybe get a 2nd opinion at UCLA another PSMA testing institution. In the meantime, I am praying for the, I suppose, unlikely chance that I get into the Michael F and Francij4 boat of low detectable but stable psa. Maybe, the 0.026 coincidence with Michael F's last reading is manna from heaven. lol Thank you to DjinTonic for the research links, in particular BCR, salvage RT, and PSMA scan.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by Michael F Welcome back edwardo! Hoping that you had returned to tell us about a vanishing PSA. At this point, it appears that your PSA is rising. You are not currently in a crisis. The 3 questions that must be answered are: - Why is it rising? - Where is/are the \"pinpoint\" location/s of the PSA generator/s? - What curative treatment options remain? FYI: I have a relative who experienced a similar scenario: RALP followed by BR Next SRT followed by BR again. Next went to a \"Mecca\" CA Institute. When his PSA reached a level between 5.0 - 7.0, an MRI detected a (+) Lymph Node near his rectum. Surgery would have been risky due to prior radiation BUT in retrospect, it should have been attempted as the rest of the story is a total disaster. I relay this for the reason that you are in a much better position today with newer, far better scanning technologies such as: - 68Ga\u2010PSMA\u201011 PET/CT - F18-DCFPyL/PSMA Also, see DjinTonic's SubForum at the top of The Forum page for additional information on detection technologies. Here is a link to the section of interest: https://www.cancerforums.net/threads...80%93-Biopsies The newer technologies are not sensitive enough to locate sites of recurrence at your current PSA level. This gives you time to research the availability and feasibility of these scans. Reach out to Forum Brother (FB) garyi. Gary went to NIH and had one of these scans performed. Also, another FB found a clinical trial using one of these scans. You can search: https://clinicaltrials.gov/ By identifying the site of PSA generation, it may be possible to surgically excise it or focally ablate it in a single procedure vs treating systemically with ADT/Chemotherapy combinations. I too had my RALP in B-ham and came out of surgery with elevated risks for recurrence. Thus, I have to monitor my PSA closely (via ultrasensitive PSA). If recurrence begins to appear, I will wait until it can be pinpoint located by one of the newer PET/CT scans and opt to only treat locally. Lastly, since you are monitoring for possible recurrence, be sure that you are using The Same Lab and Same PSA Methodology Each Time!. If me (and I do), I would use LabCorp since they are based in B-ham. I would not use the in-house lab at UC-AL for post PCa treatment monitoring. Stay calm and do your research on the newer PET/CT imaging technologies that will pinpoint locate small foci of recurrent PCa. Good luck! Keep us updated on your findings. MF Michael F: I agree with your analysis and advice completely. However, I did want to point out that salvage surgery is not only not standard of care, it is virtually not done at all in the U.S.; including the most accepted variant of that in Europe, salvage lymphadenectomy. Even Ahlering, at UCI, who is beyond hot hot for how salvage surgery will dovetail into this newly developing ultrasensitive imaging technology, has only done a few, off-label and has not published on it. And even though, as lay people, we are currently witness to anecdotal cases of salvage surgery working including FB XJC3 from Germany-- working admittedly, with such short followup time, only at the minimum of setting the psa clock back to zero. Remember, it will take 10-15 years from now to prove the durability of psa responses to salvage surgery. For those FB brother's in my boat, do you want to wait that long for proof? But for those of us with bcr or heading to bcr like me, especially with low psa velocity or doubling time recurrence, setting the clock back to zero in itself is huge. The other huge theorectical advantage of salvage surgery, is that one still has salvage RT in the barrel for future use. I say theorectical because salvage surgery is not done in the U.S. You will get blank stares, even from the experts, let alone your local urologist or radiation oncologists in the U.S., concerning salvage surgery, because it is not standard of care ------ except for possibly salvage prostatecomy for patients who present with limited, low psa metastatic disease in the primary phase of treatment who might otherwise forgo local treatment altogether ----- not pertinent to this rising psa post RALP discussion. Please FB XJC3 if you are out there: let us know how yu are doing. For example, in Michael F's relative case: if you could roll the clock back, and find his rectal only positive lymph node, which was not de facto treated successfully by his salvage RT; even with hindsight at best they would offer directed RT, not salvage surgery here in U.S; maybe not even that because some Radiation oncologists would argue that directed therapy would be to great a risk to the rectum, i.e radiation proctitis, secondary cancer etc. Since your relative probably already had the near maximum dose to his pelvis --- Stated another way, radiation oncologists have strict guidelines of maximal doses allowable to specific tissue sites. And I am guessing since he already received RT to the area, they probably would have been unwilling to radiate that rectal only positive recurrence with the additional amount required to effect a cure. I suspect salvage surgery that sets the psa clock back to zero will have durable responses equivalent to salvage RT that sets the psa clock back to zero. The latter standard of care; the former not even done in U.S. If so, that will result in virtually same debate for the bcr stage as we have now regarding RT versus RALP for primary treatment. Likewise Ahlering is swimming upstream against conventional wisdom, on his new concept: active surveillance for the bcr stage of the disease for certain low risk, low psa velocity patients - the vast majority of whom have a constant low psa velocity recurrence which will never threaten their lives. He believes for the few who exponentially increase in psa velocity; that he can safely transition them to treatment. It may be hard to wrap your head around it. But this could result in virtually the same treatment arguments in this phase of the disease as when one is diagnosed with localized prostate cancer except that in the bcr phase of the disease you are starting with 0.1 psa = 1 cc of cancer roughly versus in the primary phase one could be starting with several or more cc of cancer; for those with localized disease. Several ccs of prostate cancer under active surveillance should have a greater chance of acquiring the molecular defects necessary to develop the metastatic capabilities=transform to non-indolent ca, or be missed by sampling error higher grade CA, than 1 cc of cancer, from a lead time and quantitive argument. The bcr phase patients who are \"low risk\" defined by Ahlering just by psa velocity alone, not published, by the forgoing argument should actually be better candidates for active surveillance than those in the primary phase of the disease, where it is not only standard of care, but being pushed because of the overtreatment issue. Talk about paradigm shift of thinking about prostate cancer in the bcr phase post radical prostatectomy. It is going to be a whole new world; but one we will not know the full implications of for another 10 years -- the timeline necessary for proof in prostate ca. The promise of this ultrasensitive imaging is being borne out by recent studies concerning altering, or should I more strongly say, correcting treatment plans: Your treatment plan may be corrected including stereotactic RT aimed at mono or oligorecurrent disease; extended RT fields; forgoing RT altogether in non-oligorecurrent disease, or boost RT to areas that are not maxed out by conventional RT dose, aiding in the decision on whether to add or not add HT to RT, etc. I suspect that even in the cases where the ultrasensitive imaging study reveals nothing: that that will be a significant finding also. But that would require another longwinded and even more abstruse discussion. Stated another way, the conventional wisdom/bible/standard of care for bcr after Ralp is RT+/-ADT period and after 2nd bcr post salvage RT = systemic rx. Even if you go to the academic centers, as a first approximation, unless you are in an investigational study, no one is going to recommend salvage surgery post ultrasensitive imaging study, because that is not standard of care --- with all its medical-legal implications. In summary, for edwardo : his standard of care treatment options are large not knowing all his particulars: including observation and all the known systemic therapies including ADT + combinations therein; but as yet do not include the ultrasensitive imaging informed corrected treatment decisions including potentially new directed therapies. As some naysayer may point out, there has been no proof that directed therapies in this recurrent phase of the disease work. But what they do not realize is that directed therapies have not been studied with low volume/0.1cc disease and will take hundreds of patients like XCJ3 in a prospective randomized study 10 years or more to prove. This ultrasensitive imaging futuristic stuff will open the door to directed therapies and more correct therapies. And should, in my opinion and Dr. Hope of UCSF's opinion, be fast tract because it will be standard of care and is a breakthru. But our system is not politically geared to do this - except for fast tracking treatment e.g. enzalutamide, for late stage disease;--- it is politically not geared for an expensive imaging study.",

I agree with comments that I really should only be looking at 2 significant digits for the \"3 consecutive rises\" definition of BCR and that I have plenty of time to pull the trigger on salvage RT; but things are not looking promising, especially if you believe in the 0.03 cutoff as probably indicating eventual BCR. 3 months ago, I consulted with UCSF radiation oncologist - ------ UCSF is hot on PSMA scan to detect site of recurrence ---- so I am in the RO pipeline and their plan for me, given all my data points-except for Decipher score which was pending at the time was to wait for when and if my PSA reaches 0.2 and then do PSMA scan - off label - without even being part of an investigational study I know the downside is that most recent studies are showing statistical benefit for starting salvage RT at values less than 0.2 Fortunately, I will have enough time to get a better idea of things including doubling time and possibly, however remote, have a leveling off what some papers refer to as persistently low, but stable psa as in Michael F's case. Just felt the need to give the 3 month psa monitoring/anxiety update. I continue to lurk in the background and appreciate the advice and solace this forum provides.",

Michael F, as you know, has been riding a stable uPSA for 77 months. Certainly, he has a benign source of PSA or at least one that is not multiplying at all === which means, at a minimum it is behaving in a benign fashion; whatever you call it. Furthermore, benign prostatic tissue is frequently left behind at the apex as there is no distinct capsule there and prostatic tissue blends into the urogenital diaphragm/musculature. Urethral stump length is an important determinant of successful surgery vis a vis continence and the longer the length the better the continence outcomes; but the more likely benign or for that matter malignant prostate tissue is left behind. I suspect patients that have a stable low psa; probably are less likely to hang around prostate cancer forums; and thus their prevalence would appear much smaller than it is. I personally have two friends who have been riding a low PSA for decades. They certainly have a benign source whether it is prostatic urethral apical tissue, Cowpers glands, periurethral glands, or elsewhere.",

      "Content": "Djin; \"I come back to my uro's opinion: to not stop my PSA testing after X years, because he sees BCR and recurrent disease after 20, 25 years. When I asked if this is caused by the formation of new tumors from healthy cells, or just the very long, slow growth of leftover microtumors, he said we don't know.\" Concerning your above query, I agree with you, that there are two possibilities: If it takes 20-25 years to reach a detectable PSA, then for most of those early years the prostate tissue was probably not dividing at all or alternately the doubling time was incredibly slow >>2years; in other words, the tissue was either a. benign tissue which many years later acquired the molecular defects necessary to turn it into CA or b. was incredibly indolent CA early on; the a. example being much more likely in my opinion-- see breast cancer example below: In either case, once the bcr is detected; the Psa velocity should be slow -- However, in the much less likely scenario of a fast/aggressive Psa velocity; one would conjecture that in the a. example - the benign tissue acquired a larger set of molecular defects transforming it into an agressive CA b. the indolent Ca acquired a smaller set of molecular defects transforming it from indolent to aggressive CA in this latter much less likely scenario of a high psa velocity bcr, the likelihood of b is increased as there are fewer molecular defects required. This concept has been well studied in breast cancer: For example: A woman can have a breast cancer in her 40s which has aggressive enough characteristics that if she does not have a recurrence in 5 or 10 years after a total mastectomy without additional treatment, she is considered cured; btw: for many cancers if one has no recurrence after 5 years without adjuvant treatment one is considered cured unlike prostate ca. yet despite having a total mastectomy which presumably removes all breast tissue (hence the word - total) can develop, 30 years later, a new breast primary in the same chest wall. The conventional dogma backed up by alot of research which I will not bore you with: is that this represents microscopic residual benign breast tissue left behind after a \"total\" mastectomy which after 30 years developed/transformed into cancer. Bottom line: In my opinion, if you have bcr after 20-25 years, it is most likely from benign prostate tissue left behind at the time of prostatectomy which has transformed albeit as long ago as 10 years before bcr -------- informed by the conventional dogma concerning breast cancer.

      "Content": "ASAadvocate: I could not link to your article. I would love to read it. Despite having not read the article; I still have a comment: The very first cancers treated successfully with drugs were childhood leukemias; frequently incredibly aggressive-very high doubling times- with prognosis of months to even weeks or days. Because of their incredibly fast doubling times they showed miraculous responses to the first chemotherapies aimed at blocking DNA replication. The cancers vanished; but only to invariably recur. Instead of saying well that therapy did not work. Next - Let's move on. They tried that chemotherapy with multiple other combinations of drugs until they got cures and the era of \"combination chemotherapy\" began. ------ PSMA will open the door to innumerable trials of targeted therapies in combination with the other current systemic therapies. As the number of systemic therapies increase; the number of combinations with directed therapy exponentially increase. Targeted therapies aimed at systemic disease, have the best hope, at earliest stage of stage 4 disease, when the tumor burden is low; i.e. with one or only a few spots; the latter referred to as oligometastatic disease. PSMA takes off the blinders of this earliest stage of stage 4: bcr in the 0.2 to 4-10 range. A huge blind window in this earliest aspect of stage 4.

This concept has been well studied in breast cancer: For example: A woman can have a breast cancer in her 40s which has aggressive enough characteristics that if she does not have a recurrence in 5 or 10 years after a total mastectomy without additional treatment, she is considered cured; btw: for many cancers if one has no recurrence after 5 years without adjuvant treatment one is considered cured unlike prostate ca. yet despite having a total mastectomy which presumably removes all breast tissue (hence the word - total) can develop, 30 years later, a new breast primary in the same chest wall. The conventional dogma backed up by alot of research which I will not bore you with: is that this represents microscopic residual benign breast tissue left behind after a \"total\" mastectomy which after 30 years developed/transformed into cancer. Bottom line: In my opinion, if you have bcr after 20-25 years, it is most likely from benign prostate tissue left behind at the time of prostatectomy which has transformed albeit as long ago as 10 years before bcr -------- informed by the conventional dogma concerning breast cancer.

      "Content": "Originally Posted by Sma Thank you both for your helpful information The standard of care to rule out stage 4 (metastatic disease); to qualify for curative local therapy, is CT of abdomen/pelvis and bone scan. And most institutions, preop will require a chest x-ray. PSMA-PET and other scans are in the research/trial stage and, as you have stated, appear much more sensitive and thus show great promise; and I suspect for certain situations (to be worked out by research) will become standard of care. ------ If your husband's CT and/or bone scan is positive, your husband might be advised to get systemic therapy such as hormone or chemotherapy; and forgo local therapy. Because it is in the investigational stage, the sensitivity and specificity of these tests have yet to be worked out; but even if they are much better which they appear to be, - what to do with the results will need to be worked out. Let's say your husband were negative on the conventional tests; but positive on the more sensitive investigational scan; would you forgo local curative therapy ---- I would not - of course factoring in my particulars - age, Gleeson score, etc. These newer scans appear to even show greater promise in the biochemical recurrence phase of treatment. ---- I am personally hoping that I will not have to cross that bridge.

      "Content": "Originally Posted by Semiramide I will contemplate and thoroughly research all issues over the next several years in order to arrive at an informed decision as to which option, Door #1 or Door #2, might be best. Meanwhile Mr Allmo, I have diagnosed your above hypothetical \"unnamed condition\" as unequivocally related to DEMENTIA This shared decision making poll actually requires no research at all. In fact, research would bias the poll results in many ways ..... and shared decision making includes a 15-30 minute patient-doctor sharing; with clutched questions in hand, not much time to research ... vs. this forum. And what would you be researching, I purposely did not name the conditon: Maybe I had in mind, DCIS breast cancer = Stage 0 breast cancer; as a model to inform us about Gleason 3 pca. http://www.chicagotribune.com/lifest...502-story.html Though, I agree with you completely that an informed decision is a farce: by the sheer number of years required: informed by how many years it takes to make a urologist: The making of a Urologist. like the book The Making of a Surgeon or better yet House of God; both books I highly recommend. The farce is a form of cognitive dissonance, that I have called consulting Jim Carrey and Jeff Daniels or the masses and the minions. Shared decision making's parent informed consent had a noble beginning but has devolved to a legal piece of paper that has to be signed, but is never read, and certainly not understood. Sign this piece of paper. There are two patient models concerning shared decision making: 1. The U.S. patient: informed and entitled with malpractice attorney in hand. with patient advocacy, patient rights and privacy, advanced directives, informed consent, shared decision making, tumor registries and tumor boards, and patient forums; but polls for the masses - the vote: the ultimate entitlement - we still don't have. Wish we had the latter for psa screening recommendation, I think so does FB FrankB. Patient advocacy had its awakening with the Tuskegee experiment - 1932 to 1972; but only gained real traction in psychiatry in the 50s concerning frontal lobotomies. It is actually entirely woven into the zietgeist of psychiatry. Because of all patients, particularly psychotic patients, who are of not right mind; they are the ultimate patient who needs an advocate except for the comatose and the delirious. But the Real traction in this country usually requires celebrity involvement. Psychiatry keeps too low a profile publicly. Concerning frontal lobotomy: That celebrity was Rosemary Kennedy, the sister of John F. and Robert. My personal patient advocacy hero is Michael Milken. http://archive.fortune.com/magazines...2713/index.htm https://www.streetwisereports.com/ar...te-cancer.html I admit, you are correct, that I have the dementia of thinking that I might be able to, by whatever minimal facsimile, sans the cash, ....... I agree: demented. FB FrankB, Houston newscaster, notwithstanding. By the way Semiramide, who are your heroes? You learn alot about a person by who their heroes are. 2. The rest of the developed world patient: unentitled and trusting lags the US in this concept for better or worse; and puts faith in the doctors hand. Which historically was the only model for centuries; because medicine was considered an art, a judgement not to be questioned. Furthermore, our parents, better yet our grandparents were unentitled and trusting: think June and Ward Cleaver from Leave it to Beaver. Think Civil War, WW1 and WW2 veterans; now those are a trusting and unentitled bunch. If you are a patient in group 1: To participate in shared decision making, you would have to do research; and you would soon realize, I think, at least for me, how complicated it is. Because, as you know, a little bit of knowledge is dangerous. You may even join a forum including one that has a partial research focus. and that is what I thought I had done; but admittedly you, Semiramide, are making me think I am wrong on that as well. My logic was the following: ala Jim Valvano's 3 cadence espy's speech for cancer research: that I only have 3 things and 3 things only. I think, Semiramide, you would really like his speech. It has a beautiful cadence and simplicity to it. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HuoVM9nm42E My logic was the following: that I have 3 things and 3 things only 1. My doctors advice = 15-30 minutes of it on average 2. My own research = with accompanying misinterpretations 3. The sounding board of this august forum: I mean who wants to talk prostate cancer in depth, for more than 15-30 minutes or for that matter, at all. Certainly, none of my friends. Nor would I want to subject them to it. Alternately, if you are in group 2: you don't have to do any research and you keep it real simple and just follow your doctor's recommendation: there are tremendous advantages to the Europe model: including you get to be at the forefront of medicine armed with big brother databases; without all the safeguards, it is cheaper to deliver care, no second opinions needed there; and you altruistically get to be guinea pigs for the USA patients. Unfortunately, you eventually follow the US lead and then there are no longer 2 models. Globalization, afterall. I suspect you are in group 2. An honorable group. I am just not in it. But it would be presumptuous of me to pigeon hole you. Since you, by joining this forum, have demonstrated some mixed features. Though, Epstein has brought the 5 scale down to 3; putting prostate Ca in line finally with almost all other solid cancers, he would not know what to do with this 2 scale model. I would have to leave that to the psychiatrists. Thank you for your forum psychiatric diagnosis. I think you hit it straight on; except for one DSM-5 requirement; no matter what polarity you see in a person's behavior including speech; admittedly only text for your assessment of me; there is a functionality litmus test -- though, I am manic, and probably fulfill most of the DSM-5 criteria; I actually have a job and a wife and two beautiful children who are 10 and 12; so I am functional, at least according to the psychiatric bible; DSM-5. Any psychiatrists that are Forum brothers: please inform us. In summary, semiramide: if you will allow me to quote you: \"research ... years....informed decision...DEMENTIA\" I agree completely with you. Cognitive dissonance.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by Sma Thank you both for your helpful information The standard of care to rule out stage 4 (metastatic disease); to qualify for curative local therapy, is CT of abdomen/pelvis and bone scan. And most institutions, preop will require a chest x-ray. PSMA-PET and other scans are in the research/trial stage and, as you have stated, appear much more sensitive and thus show great promise; and I suspect for certain situations (to be worked out by research) will become standard of care. ------ If your husband's CT and/or bone scan is positive, your husband might be advised to get systemic therapy such as hormone or chemotherapy; and forgo local therapy. Because it is in the investigational stage, the sensitivity and specificity of these tests have yet to be worked out; but even if they are much better which they appear to be, - what to do with the results will need to be worked out. Let's say your husband were negative on the conventional tests; but positive on the more sensitive investigational scan; would you forgo local curative therapy ---- I would not - of course factoring in my particulars - age, Gleeson score, etc. These newer scans appear to even show greater promise in the biochemical recurrence phase of treatment. ---- I am personally hoping that I will not have to cross that bridge. Forum members please correct me, if I am wrong.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by Semiramide I will contemplate and thoroughly research all issues over the next several years in order to arrive at an informed decision as to which option, Door #1 or Door #2, might be best. Meanwhile Mr Allmo, I have diagnosed your above hypothetical \"unnamed condition\" as unequivocally related to DEMENTIA This shared decision making poll actually requires no research at all. In fact, research would bias the poll results in many ways ..... and shared decision making includes a 15-30 minute patient-doctor sharing; with clutched questions in hand, not much time to research ... vs. this forum. And what would you be researching, I purposely did not name the conditon: Maybe I had in mind, DCIS breast cancer = Stage 0 breast cancer; as a model to inform us about Gleason 3 pca. http://www.chicagotribune.com/lifest...502-story.html Though, I agree with you completely that an informed decision is a farce: by the sheer number of years required: informed by how many years it takes to make a urologist: The making of a Urologist. like the book The Making of a Surgeon or better yet House of God; both books I highly recommend. The farce is a form of cognitive dissonance, that I have called consulting Jim Carrey and Jeff Daniels or the masses and the minions. Shared decision making's parent informed consent had a noble beginning but has devolved to a legal piece of paper that has to be signed, but is never read, and certainly not understood. Sign this piece of paper. There are two patient models concerning shared decision making: 1. The U.S. patient: informed and entitled with malpractice attorney in hand. with patient advocacy, patient rights and privacy, advanced directives, informed consent, shared decision making, tumor registries and tumor boards, and patient forums; but polls for the masses - the vote: the ultimate entitlement - we still don't have. Wish we had the latter for psa screening recommendation, I think so does FB FrankB. Patient advocacy had its awakening with the Tuskegee experiment - 1932 to 1972; but only gained real traction in psychiatry in the 50s concerning frontal lobotomies. It is actually entirely woven into the zietgeist of psychiatry. Because of all patients, particularly psychotic patients, who are of not right mind; they are the ultimate patient who needs an advocate except for the comatose and the delirious. But the Real traction in this country usually requires celebrity involvement. Psychiatry keeps too low a profile publicly. Concerning frontal lobotomy: That celebrity was Rosemary Kennedy, the sister of John F. and Robert. My personal patient advocacy hero is Michael Milken. http://archive.fortune.com/magazines...2713/index.htm https://www.streetwisereports.com/ar...te-cancer.html I admit, you are correct, that I have the dementia of thinking that I might be able to, by whatever minimal facsimile, sans the cash, ....... I agree: demented. FB FrankB, Houston newscaster, notwithstanding. By the way Semiramide, who are your heroes? You learn alot about a person by who their heroes are. 2. The rest of the developed world patient: unentitled and trusting lags the US in this concept for better or worse; and puts faith in the doctors hand. Which historically was the only model for centuries; because medicine was considered an art, a judgement not to be questioned. Furthermore, our parents, better yet our grandparents were unentitled and trusting: think June and Ward Cleaver from Leave it to Beaver. Think Civil War, WW1 and WW2 veterans; now those are a trusting and unentitled bunch. If you are a patient in group 1: To participate in shared decision making, you would have to do research; and you would soon realize, I think, at least for me, how complicated it is. Because, as you know, a little bit of knowledge is dangerous. You may even join a forum including one that has a partial research focus. and that is what I thought I had done; but admittedly you, Semiramide, are making me think I am wrong on that as well. My logic was the following: ala Jim Valvano's 3 cadence espy's speech for cancer research: that I only have 3 things and 3 things only. I think, Semiramide, you would really like his speech. It has a beautiful cadence and simplicity to it. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HuoVM9nm42E My logic was the following: that I have 3 things and 3 things only 1. My doctors advice = 15-30 minutes of it on average 2. My own research = with accompanying misinterpretations 3. The sounding board of this august forum: I mean who wants to talk prostate cancer in depth, for more than 15-30 minutes or for that matter, at all. Certainly, none of my friends. Nor would I want to subject them to it. Alternately, if you are in group 2: you don't have to do any research and you keep it real simple and just follow your doctor's recommendation: there are tremendous advantages to the Europe model: including you get to be at the forefront of medicine armed with big brother databases; without all the safeguards, it is cheaper to deliver care, no second opinions needed there; and you altruistically get to be guinea pigs for the USA patients. Unfortunately, you eventually follow the US lead and then there are no longer 2 models. Globalization, afterall. I suspect you are in group 2. An honorable group. I am just not in it. But it would be presumptuous of me to pigeon hole you. Since you, by joining this forum, have demonstrated some mixed features. Though, Epstein has brought the 5 scale down to 3; putting prostate Ca in line finally with almost all other solid cancers, he would not know what to do with this 2 scale model. I would have to leave that to the psychiatrists. Thank you for your forum psychiatric diagnosis. I think you hit it straight on; except for one DSM-5 requirement; no matter what polarity you see in a person's behavior including speech; admittedly only text for your assessment of me; there is a functionality litmus test -- though, I am manic, and probably fulfill most of the DSM-5 criteria; I actually have a job and a wife and two beautiful children who are 10 and 12; so I am functional, at least according to the psychiatric bible; DSM-5. Any psychiatrists that are Forum brothers: please inform us. In summary, semiramide: if you will allow me to quote you: \"research ... years....informed decision...DEMENTIA\" I agree completely with you. Cognitive dissonance.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by Semiramide I will contemplate and thoroughly research all issues over the next several years in order to arrive at an informed decision as to which option, Door #1 or Door #2, might be best. Meanwhile Mr Allmo, I have diagnosed your above hypothetical \"unnamed condition\" as unequivocally related to DEMENTIA This shared decision making poll actually requires no research at all. In fact, research would bias the poll results in many ways ..... and shared decision making includes a 15-30 minute patient-doctor sharing; with clutched questions in hand, not much time to research ... vs. this forum. And what would you be researching, I purposely did not name the conditon: Maybe I had in mind, DCIS breast cancer = Stage 0 breast cancer; as a model to inform us about Gleason 3 pca. http://www.chicagotribune.com/lifest...502-story.html Though, I agree with you completely that an informed decision is a farce: by the sheer number of years required: informed by how many years it takes to make a urologist: The making of a Urologist. like the book The Making of a Surgeon or better yet House of God; both books I highly recommend. The farce is a form of cognitive dissonance, that I have called consulting Jim Carrey and Jeff Daniels or the masses and the minions. Shared decision making's parent informed consent had a noble beginning but has devolved to a legal piece of paper that has to be signed, but is never read, and certainly not understood. Sign this piece of paper. There are two patient models concerning shared decision making: 1. The U.S. patient: informed and entitled with malpractice attorney in hand. with patient advocacy, patient rights and privacy, advanced directives, informed consent, shared decision making, tumor registries and tumor boards, and patient forums; but polls for the masses - the vote: the ultimate entitlement - we still don't have. Wish we had the latter for psa screening recommendation, I think so does FB FrankB. Patient advocacy had its awakening with the Tuskegee experiment - 1932 to 1972; but only gained real traction in psychiatry in the 50s concerning frontal lobotomies. It is actually entirely woven into the zietgeist of psychiatry. Because of all patients, particularly psychotic patients, who are of not right mind; they are the ultimate patient who needs an advocate except for the comatose and the delirious. But the Real traction in this country usually requires celebrity involvement. Psychiatry keeps too low a profile publicly. Concerning frontal lobotomy: That celebrity was Rosemary Kennedy, the sister of John F. and Robert. My personal patient advocacy hero is Michael Milken. http://archive.fortune.com/magazines...2713/index.htm https://www.streetwisereports.com/ar...te-cancer.html I admit, you are correct, that I have the dementia of thinking that I might be able to, by whatever minimal facsimile, sans the cash, ....... I agree: demented. FB FrankB, Houston newscaster, notwithstanding. By the way Semiramide, who are your heroes? You learn alot about a person by who their heroes are. 2. The rest of the developed world patient: unentitled and trusting lags the US in this concept for better or worse; and puts faith in the doctors hand. Which historically was the only model for centuries; because medicine was considered an art, a judgement not to be questioned. Furthermore, our parents, better yet our grandparents were unentitled and trusting: think June and Ward Cleaver from Leave it to Beaver. Think Civil War, WW1 and WW2 veterans; now those are a trusting and unentitled bunch. If you are a patient in group 1: To participate in shared decision making, you would have to do research; and you would soon realize, I think, at least for me, how complicated it is. Because, as you know, a little bit of knowledge is dangerous. You may even join a forum including one that has a partial research focus. and that is what I thought I had done; but admittedly you, Semiramide, are making me think I am wrong on that as well. My logic was the following: ala Jim Valvano's 3 cadence espy's speech for cancer research: that I only have 3 things and 3 things only. I think, Semiramide, you would really like his speech. It has a beautiful cadence and simplicity to it. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HuoVM9nm42E My logic was the following: that I have 3 things and 3 things only 1. My doctors advice = 15-30 minutes of it on average 2. My own research = with accompanying misinterpretations 3. The sounding board of this august forum: I mean who wants to talk prostate cancer in depth, for more than 15-30 minutes or for that matter, at all. Certainly, none of my friends. Nor would I want to subject them to it. Alternately, if you are in group 2: you don't have to do any research and you keep it real simple and just follow your doctor's recommendation: there are tremendous advantages to the Europe model: including you get to be at the forefront of medicine armed with big brother databases; without all the safeguards, it is cheaper to deliver care, no second opinions needed there; and you altruistically get to be guinea pigs for the USA patients. Unfortunately, you eventually follow the US lead and then there are no longer 2 models. Globalization, afterall. I suspect you are in group 2. An honorable group. I am just not in it. But it would be presumptuous of me to pigeon hole you. Since you, by joining this forum, have demonstrated some mixed features. Though, Epstein has brought the 5 scale down to 3; putting prostate Ca in line finally with almost all other solid cancers, he would not know what to do with this 2 scale model. I would have to leave that to the psychiatrists. Thank you for your forum psychiatric diagnosis. I think you hit it straight on; except for one DSM-5 requirement; no matter what polarity you see in a person's behavior including speech; admittedly only text for your assessment of me; there is a functionality litmus test -- though, I am manic, and probably fulfill most of the DSM-5 criteria; I actually have a job and a wife and two beautiful children who are 10 and 12; so I am functional, at least according to the psychiatric bible; DSM-5. Any psychiatrists that are Forum brothers: please inform us. In summary, semiramide: if you will allow me to quote you: \"research ... years....informed decision...DEMENTIA\" I agree completely with you. Cognitive dissonance.",

      "Content": "I was interested in taking a poll of Forum brothers concerning decision making. In the spirit of a scientist, in the design of this poll study, I am selecting an extreme hypothetical patient cohort, to keep things simple. This patient cohort has an unnamed condition which has the following characteristics: 1. It causes no symptoms and will not as far as we know for 15 plus years 2. There is massive clinical translational research that shows that actively watching this condition is perfectly safe. 3. The condition is defined on the microscopic level and proven on this level to be clinically benign. 4. There is an immediate treatment for this condition which has significant side effects with no statistically proven benefit. 5. This condition is related to another condition with tremendous emotional overlay; high prevalence; can be clinically significant; for which there is treatment. 6. This related condition can be treated with cure rate of 99.5% 7. This related condition can be detected early enough to safely transition to treatment. If you had the above condition would you choose door number 1 or door number 2: Door number 1: Actively watch Door number 2. Immediate treatment. Please give this some thought without dismissing it out of hand.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by mom2two Not enough information for me to make a decision on door #1 or #2. Even with what you've listed, for me it would depend on the specific details of the condition and what part of the body it's affecting. Let's say it is your breast and the treatment is mastectomy? Or papillary carcinoma of the thyroid and the treatment is total thyroidectomy with followup radioactive Iodine? the 2 models closest to prostate cancer. There are actually not many additional cancers amenable to active surveillance; maybe small lymphocytic lymphoma and myeloma which being liquid cancers are not like solid cancers, at all; That is one of the psychological points: that our automatic emotional response to cancer is to treat and treat fast, ask questions later; because that is the truth for almost all cancer; and there are thousands of cancers. The malpractice attorneys know this well; one of their best cards is: Delay in diagnosis: If it were operational in prostate cancer; everyone of us who has intermediate or high risk prostate cancer, would probably have a case. And that is the mantra we are taught: treat and treat fast, ask questions later; and believe like a religion and why, in part, active surveillance is such a psychological hard sell; even apparently for a hypothetical perfect scenario as I listed above. What other information do you need to know? btw it is hypothetical. I will honestly try to answer any question about the condition. Geez: I hope you realize mom2two: this hypothetical cohort has nothing to do with your husband's case. And yes, your husband needs treatment. He would have never been an Active surveillance candidate. Also, I was never a candidate for Active Surveillance. I am just going through this exercise to try to understand this incredibly unique cancer called prostate cancer. Not because, it has anything to do with my particular case. I am just thinking about prostate cancer, beyond my case; to try to understand it: Trying to do Jim Valvano's 3 things that make a full day: \"To me, there are three things we all should do every day. We should do this every day of our lives. Number one is laugh. You should laugh every day. Number two is think. You should spend some time in thought. And number three is, you should have your emotions moved to tears, could be happiness or joy. But think about it. If you laugh, you think, and you cry, that's a full day. That's a heck of a day. You do that seven days a week, you're going to have something special.\"",
