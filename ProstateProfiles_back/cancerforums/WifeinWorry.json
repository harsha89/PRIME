      "Content": "Wow, today took a big turn! Dr says the cancer is doing a major move on his bones! Platelets dropped drastically, they are at 32 now from 213 a month ago. Blood counts are out of wack. LDH is spiked at 561. So a blood transfusion is in the making and if the platelets don't improve, he said there's not much else they can do. They took him off the trial cuz he's not where he needs to be in order for it to work. Overwhelming at this point. I had a feeling it may had attached his bones, but then I thought maybe the drugs were putting a number on his platelets, but not this bad. Not looking good",

      "Content": "Well, #3 injection today.... reality is palliative.... I know he hopes for a cure, but doctors say otherwise, its terminal. Every time he goes in and talks about \"when\" Im cured or \"when\" this is over and I can do this\" he gets disappointed and depressed every time when they say its killing you, its terminal. So its hard for him to \"get it\" sometimes. Is it fair to say he puts himself in dreamland to ease the pain of reality? We haven't experienced this before so, cant imagine his brain is in such emotional turmoil I guess you can call it. I see what it does to him. I suggested attending a group but he refuses, he said \"God is what I need\".... no problem with that So he had his PSA and Testosterone levels done... we are up to 12.04 on his PSA from 10.1 from 1 wk 1/2 ago. Oncologist suggested putting him on Zytiga/Prednisone in conjunction with Lupron to keep his number down, and the radiologist oncologist suggests it will not help his numbers....ok soooo, what such different opinions??",

Does not mean all others are gone, i.e. lymphatic system etc. Can chemo be that accurate on destroying bones mets and boom, nothing on bone scan?

Initially his calcium and alkaline phosphates were increased, not over the limits, but were increased. So Im thinking now that chemo is over, this is something to watch and the PSA levels as far as monitoring cancer spreading to the bones. He does have bone mets in the pelvis, I think one in the spine and now believes has reached his thigh, but the bone scan will tell the tale at the end of August. He complains about pain in one leg, could be muscle/ligament as one had mentioned. Would the chemo he just had be effective enough to kill off the cancer in the bones? Or does this require a different med and avenue to suppress?",

      "Content": "Ok, guys, wondering how this works....Went to Urologist this week, husband told him about a trial he was interested in and Dr said no, you need to try Xofigo now. So Im thinking he wants him to try another drug before you try trials. Makes sense the drugs that are already approved before you try trials, right? Well, bone lesions have increased and his PSA increased the last 3-4 months. Oncologist stopped his biclutamide about a month ago, meanwhile waiting for this trial to kick in, wasting precious time of course, Urologist says no go, time for Xofigo, don't wait for trial. So Im needing any success stories out there with this Radium 233? Isnt this just totally for pain? Or does this actually kill cancer cells? Ive heard both...Im a lil confused on this one. Im thinking if this is just for bone pain, then I come to the conclusion that we are just waiting for dooms day. The oncologist says he can still do the trial while doing Xofigo, just sounds like too much chemical in his poor body. Im thinking the chemicals are going to kill him more than the cancer itself.

So the conventional came out negative as I stated above in my other threads, now today doctor said well the conventionals are 50-60% inaccurate, so lets do a F18 Sodium it should do better on showing anything. Ugggg! So his happy happy, went to sappy sappy",

      "Content": "Scratch, his PSA is creeping back up (still below 4) and although the conventional scan was negative (which was compared to a year ago), I guess they are concerned about the gradual increase and also he has pain throughout his pelvic region including his back. His numbers are maxed as far as the gleason he was all 10's and its metasticized in pelvic, seminal, lymphatic....and its possible that the pelvic bones are showing signs but it didn't show up. So they recommended the sodium fluoride scan to make sure there is not signs in the bones. If it does they wanted to try the Radium treatments, once a month for 6 mos. I would say that if this scan is all negative, the other recommended imaging will be challenged. Im sure the economical credentialing exists...Im concerned about all the chemicals they feed their patients could end up killing them more than the disease itself.",

I see a lot of white bright spots...images are too small for us to really see a whole bunch (wrong type of software I suppose) until the report comes in Im really curious on how we should look at this...any comments on this one?",

      "Content": "I think this progressively came about over time but he was diagnosed in 2012 with an enlarged prostate and I believe there were symptoms before and just didn't realize what was going on until the prostate got large enough to cause problems, and then a year later cancer became very aggressive and promoted to metastasized prostate, i.e lymph nodes, bones, pelvic region....started out with hormone therapy injections for about 9 months then combined with chemo as of today, 4 out of 6 sessions so far. So its been three years since initial diagnosis.....we will see how long it will take with these injections before it decides it doesn't like it anymore. Chemo has been tough on him, but overall he's a trooper! It will be interesting to see what happens after the chemo stops and its back to just injections again. Last January his PSA was at around 175, and after we started the chemo with the injections, today its down to 3.19, and his blood work looks good.",

Radiation a year ago last August for 8 weeks, 5 days a week. PSA brought down to .04. Took Flomax and continue hormone treatment/injections to suppress. He ran out of prescription and thought he was done with treatment. Week ago last Sunday took him to the ER for abdominal pain, thought he was constipated, they took labs and found out his PSA was 157 again. So that changed everything. Cancer is still there but had spread to his lymph nodes and bones so basically its covered his whole pelvic area/abdomen and lumbar and thoracic, and of course now its in his blood stream. So Monday he starts his hormonal/injection treatments (Casodex/Firmagon) again and he cant stop now. Unfortunate lesson to learn that these treatments cant be stopped. Urologist said this is a rare very aggressive cancer and if the hormonal therapy does not work, chemo would be next but the prognosis is gloom at this point. Let me know if you guys concur with what they are telling me. I know the prognosis is different for everyone, but the more they say how aggressive this is the more I believe this will not be long I asked him what his Gleason/grade/score was he says \"M\" metastasis. What are the odds of this aggressive metastatic prostate cancer being from Chernobyl 20 years later?",

      "Content": "I think this progressively came about over time but he was diagnosed in 2012 with an enlarged prostate and I believe there were symptoms before and just didn't realize what was going on until the prostate got large enough to cause problems, and then a year later cancer became very aggressive and promoted to metastasized prostate, i.e lymph nodes, bones, pelvic region....started out with hormone therapy injections for about 9 months then combined with chemo as of today, 4 out of 6 sessions so far. So its been three years since initial diagnosis.....we will see how long it will take with these injections before it decides it doesn't like it anymore. Chemo has been tough on him, but overall he's a trooper! It will be interesting to see what happens after the chemo stops and its back to just injections again. Last January his PSA was at around 175, and after we started the chemo with the injections, today its down to 3.19, and his blood work looks good.",

He's been on Morphine, Dilaudid, and Xanax twice a day, seems to work well. Zofran to keep his stomach calm with heartburn med. Still eliminating mucous/blood and some stool not much. His nutrition is made up of broth, some fruit, juices, water, occasional egg, soft foods if he can keep it down. Enjoys his new adjustable bed. Our dog of 5 1/2 yrs sometimes has this weird look like \"whats going on\". But he's very therapeutic! He does still get around, slow, but he does. The biggest challenge right now is lifting his legs up onto the bed. I do have a question? Is hospice suppose to be doing labs if they are managing his pain or no? They are starting him on a diuretic this week to help with swelling and ascites fluid buildup.",

      "Content": "My husband had hormone/injection therapy a year ago. They took a biopsy of the prostate and all came out 9s and 10s. Also metastasized to the seminal vesicles at the time. Radiation a year ago last August for 8 weeks, 5 days a week. PSA brought down to .04. Took Flomax and continue hormone treatment/injections to suppress. He ran out of prescription and thought he was done with treatment. Week ago last Sunday took him to the ER for abdominal pain, thought he was constipated, they took labs and found out his PSA was 157 again. So that changed everything. Cancer is still there but had spread to his lymph nodes and bones so basically its covered his whole pelvic area/abdomen and lumbar and thoracic, and of course now its in his blood stream. So Monday he starts his hormonal/injection treatments (Casodex/Firmagon) again and he cant stop now. Unfortunate lesson to learn that these treatments cant be stopped. Urologist said this is a rare very aggressive cancer and if the hormonal therapy does not work, chemo would be next but the prognosis is gloom at this point. Let me know if you guys concur with what they are telling me. I know the prognosis is different for everyone, but the more they say how aggressive this is the more I believe this will not be long I asked him what his Gleason/grade/score was he says \"M\" metastasis. What are the odds of this aggressive metastatic prostate cancer being from Chernobyl 20 years later?",
