      "Content": "For the first three weeks I was using 3-4 diapers and about 10-12 pads a day. For the next three weeks I was using less each week until I began using 2 pads a day. I still wear 2 pads a day. I could start wearing shields because I leak less than an ounce a day, but I don't feel confident wearing them. When I began using 2-3 pads a day, I began weighing my pads as someone on this forum had mentioned doing. Weighing the pads gives me an idea about when I'm leaking more and what may activities may be causing me to leak more. It's also been pointed out by others on this forum that continence progress is not linear-its up/down-this has been true for me. I believe in doing kegels an giving my body-the whole area around the prostate- time to heal. Regaining continence takes time.",

      "Content": "For the first three weeks I was using 3-4 diapers and about 10-12 pads a day. For the next three weeks I was using less each week until I began using 2 pads a day. I still wear 2 pads a day. I could start wearing shields because I leak less than an ounce a day, but I don't feel confident wearing them. When I began using 2-3 pads a day, I began weighing my pads as someone on this forum had mentioned doing. Weighing the pads gives me an idea about when I'm leaking more and what may activities may be causing me to leak more. It's also been pointed out by others on this forum that continence progress is not linear-its up/down-this has been true for me. I believe in doing kegels an giving my body-the whole area around the prostate- time to heal. Regaining continence takes time.",

Your progress will improve quite a bit when the catheter is removed. Gas will pass when your body is ready-same for bowel movements. Take stool softeners till your bowels return to normal.

      "Content": "I had two 3 month PSA checks following the 6 week post op PSA check then put on 6 month cycle. In regards your night time/ bed leaking, review all of your food/drink intake. I had one in bed leakage that I woke up with and one occasion where I just made it to the toilet. I had been eating hot things/spices/sauces which I think caused an irritation. I've also noticed that some soaps bring about an urgency to urinate. I also had an occasional irritation from the pad itself. Just recently, the last month or so, I've started to retain more fluid in my bladder-from 1 cup to 2+cups. I've noticed less dripping since. Time is a big factor with this problem-I'm 1 yr 4 months from operation and still noticing some improvements.",

Stayed in that range until May/June/July when I started walking 3-5 miles daily and joining a weight loss group. Now, after walking almost daily for 4-5 months, and after losing 60#'s, except for violent sneezes, and some bending, I am continent. I wish I would have lost weight before my operation. If you have time-get started now. Include the weight loss with your kegels and other core exercises. Another reason to lose the weight-the size of your penis is shortened by the fat on your gut and possibly by the surgery. Now that my gut is gone, my penis size is back to pre op normal-flaccid not erect. At least I can stand and urinate now that the size has returned.",

Usually wear briefs with no pads/no shields during day with undetectable or very slight dampness. Leak about 4 grams in pad weight during sleep. Lost 90 lbs. of fat, and walk 4 miles a day which helped recovery. My ED is NF as in No Function. That's ok because cancer is gone-hopefully never to return. I think if I had been in better shape before the operation, maybe I would be fully continent-but, who knows. No regrets about the operation.",

      "Content": "Thanks Michael F. I began walking regularly shortly after RP. Because of other issues, I could only walk 10 mins a few days a week. But in a few months I was walking 3-4 miles every day-working up to 5-6 a day before the temps dropped. My walking speed went from 20+ min miles to 14 min miles with occasional under 14 min. I also joined Weight Watchers. Those are the two factors that helped me-movement and accountability. Blood pressure before >150/>95, after 5%/10% weight drop BP <120/<70. Resting pulse rate before >80, after <60. Knees, back, overall body functions better. Standing, walking, balance all greatly improved. Of course this required and still requires a lot of work on my part. But the effort has definitely paid off so far.",

No probs getting up, showering, cooking, etc. It's good therapy anyways-get up out of the chair-stand a bit-move around-walk in house or outside. Just be careful of the lifting restriction given by the doctor. I recommend having a full box or two of wipes for personal cleaning. I highly recommend using a leak proof plastic carrying bag to hold the large catheter bag. My big cath bag developed a leak at night while I was in bed and fortunately the urine was kept in the leak proof bag. Best wishes for a successful outcome. The hospital gave me two large catheter bags, and two small ones. I was glad to have extras because of the one big bag leaking.",

If you haven't already done so, I would call the office to ask why the need for this length of time.",

      "Content": "You're still in the healing process. Took me several weeks to go from 3-4 depends and 10-12 pads a day to one or two pads a day. I found the name brand products worked better in absorbing. Sometimes I would stuff a few paper towels in the diaper to absorb when I knew I would be leaking heavily such as when getting into bed or when exercising. Look for simple changes-from pouring out as soon as you get up to starting to retain a little by the time you get to the toilet. Progress is not linear. I reviewed each week and was able to notice changes better than focusing on each day. Keep doing the kegels as advised by your dr. Do as much walking as you can. Try some core exercises. If you need to lose weight-try to cut back on junk food.",

Look for simple changes-from pouring out as soon as you get up to starting to retain a little by the time you get to the toilet. Progress is not linear. I reviewed each week and was able to notice changes better than focusing on each day. Keep doing the kegels as advised by your dr. Do as much walking as you can. Try some core exercises.

I took Cipro the day before, the day of, and the day after the biopsy, and I took a fleet enema the morning of the biopsy. The biopsy was uncomfortable but not painful. An anesthetic is applied when the probe is inserted. I compare the feeling of each needle biopsy with that of a rubber band snapping on your wrist. 12 \"rubber band snaps\" and 15 minutes later, it was over.

I took Cipro the day before, the day of, and the day after the biopsy, and I took a fleet enema the morning of the biopsy. The biopsy was uncomfortable but not painful. An anesthetic is applied when the probe is inserted. I compare the feeling of each needle biopsy with that of a rubber band snapping on your wrist. 12 \"rubber band snaps\" and 15 minutes later, it was over. I had blood in my urine for three urinations following, and blood in semen for a few weeks. I drove myself to the office and back home.

I took Cipro the day before, the day of, and the day after the biopsy, and I took a fleet enema the morning of the biopsy. The biopsy was uncomfortable but not painful. An anesthetic is applied when the probe is inserted. I compare the feeling of each needle biopsy with that of a rubber band snapping on your wrist. 12 \"rubber band snaps\" and 15 minutes later, it was over. I had blood in my urine for three urinations following, and blood in semen for a few weeks. I drove myself to the office and back home. Let your doctor know if you need something to settle your nerves. Best of luck to you.",

I was up walking shortly after being moved to my room, then sat up and took two longer walks before going to bed.I was up and walking the next day, and sat up till I left in the afternoon. The surgery was uneventful. I had some abdominal soreness, but nothing major. I felt the soreness when I got up from a chair or bed, but was not bad. The incisions seemed to heal quickly. The week of the catheter is not fun, but it is bearable. Once you reach the third day home the next days go quickly. If you haven't already stocked up on some supplies, you might want to get several packs of handy wipes, and paper towels, and small disposal bags. Have an assortment of diapers on hand and bed pads for your bed and where you sit-there may be some dripping from the catheter I was glad to have a large supply to help with keeping me and the catheter clean. My nurse gave me two small urine collection bags and two large collection bags. That was a big help. I had no problems with the removal of the catheter. The radiologist pulled it after he confirmed everything was healing ok. Because I wasn't on narcotics, I was able to drive the fifth day home. I drove the clinic to have cystogram and cath removed.",

      "Content": "For the first couple weeks, until I started to regain some control, I wore diapers. I also wore a guard inside the diaper because the diaper held the guard tighter to my body, and I could easily remove a guard and add a new one when needed. My preference was for name brand products. I wore the standard pull-ups and the adjustable type with side tabs. When I had some control I switched using pads almost exclusively. It took me about 3-4 weeks before I felt comfortable wearing pads exclusively. I also bought briefs (regular underwear not diapers) one and two sizes smaller so that the pad wouldn't slide around too much. I could wear shields because I'm not leaking a lot-under an ounce a 24 hr day-but I don't feel confident wearing them.",

      "Content": "PSA 11/28/2016 was 0.01! Still incontinent, but making some progress every week. For first week after catheter, I wasn't able to hold any urine no matter what position. Around second or third week I started to hold some urine while sitting and/or lying down, and was able to get to toilet before all had drained out. Fourth and fifth week I started being able to get up from sitting/lying down, walk to the toilet and initiate urination on the the toilet-not all the time, but at least half the time. I don't retain a lot-about 150 ml max. I was draining completely while standing/walking, but within the past week, I've been able to do a little amount of activity and then urinate. Just the past few days, I started to get the normal sensation I had gotten in the past of the need to urinate-not an \"urgent\" sensation, but a normal one. I can get through the night with 1-3 pads-and they are not fully used. Pad useage has gone from 14 to 6-10 a 24 hour period.",

      "Content": "Thanks MK1965. Thanks for the response. I've learned that regaining continence is not a linear type of recovery, but rather an up-down, and back and forth type of process. This recovery process can take months. I am also perplexed by the recovery rates of those older than me. I'm trying to accept each day as it is and review my progress on a weekly basis. I've found a small change has occurred almost every week. I keep a written diary of what went on and when I reviewed the progress I made, I wasn't able to attribute it to anything I did-it just happened. I know what you mean about wearing pads, and the almost constant wet feeling. I do believe that kegels help. My urologist nurse practioner, advises doing from 3 sets of 10 @ 10 secs each rep to 5 sets of 10 @ 10 secs. She also recommends doing them in different positions-standing, sitting, one foot on a step, etc. But, I see there is a difference of opinion in how to approach kegels-see the sticky article on kegels and specifically the Mayo Clinic method. I suppose it just goes back to each persons body recovers at a different rate. One thing I did that may have helped me, I started kegels about a month before my surgery. Best wishes for your revocery.",

      "Content": "My PSA is still zero 19 weeks after my surgery, the second post surgery reading, I've made good progress with incontinence. I'm using 2 pads a day down from 10-12 along with a couple of diapers a day following cath removal. I've been weighing the pads and run about 20-30 grams added weight for a 24 hour time period-this is about an ounce a day. During sleep I put out about 10 grams of added weight which is a couple of teaspoons. I'm also able to stand unclothed over newspaper and brush my teeth for a few minutes with no dripping. I feel confident that I'll be close to fully continent on or before my next 3 month PSA. I have varied my kegel routine from the 150 reps a day advised by my PA and my Doctor to the Mayo Clinic Kegel instructiuons of 6 times @ 10 reps before going to bed.",

I noticed more retention changes when I started walking regularly. I believe in my case walking and losing weight were the biggest factors in my improvement. Walking-losing weight if needed-doing core exercises can't hurt-can only help in some way. Definitely cut out caffeine for a while at least. I started caffeinated tea after about 6 months and coffee about 10 months later. I don't drink as much as before, but I seem to be able to tolerate a few cups a day. No alcohol to date though.",
