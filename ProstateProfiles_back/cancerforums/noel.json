    "Content": "Hello I am new to this forum so perhaps someone can direct me to a thread if my question is already answered. My father has had high PSA levels for the past few years as a result of enlarged prostate. He has been taking medication and now they have detected that the medicine is no longer controlling the prostate growth so they have increased dosage. In addition, they have detected a possible malignancy and so have suggested radiation therapy. I would like to know how effective radiation therapy is? - the doctors have suggested not to remove his prostate given that he is 78 years now. What specific information should I provide in this thread that will help folks point me in the right direction or advise me?",
