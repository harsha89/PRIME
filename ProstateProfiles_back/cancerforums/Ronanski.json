    "Content": "Hey...just got seeds implanted 2 weeks ago for mild/moderate case of prostate cancer. Starting external beam next week. I have the usual side effects, and am starting flomax, but the biggest problem is lower back pain when I start to urinate, it feels like I am seizing up very intensely, and though it abates after urinating, it is now generally always sore.
