      "Content": "Thanks Bob for your note. I don't have the Gleason and T score handy but the PSA at the time was 15. The time from the biopsy to surgery was quite short, less than two weeks. I've just recently switched primary doctors but my previous primary had a standing policy of specifying a PSA at least once or twice a year for all of his prostate cancer survivors. The reason he did so was that his dad died of prostate cancer but after 20 years of having his prostate removed. However, I am quite concerned, though. This news comes after a long string of 0 PSA scores. And, this is not something that will be resolved by taking pill. I sure that it's going to be bad. The NPR I've been working with called with some concern in her voice. Never a good sign. I hope I can get some clarity here on this site, though. I could use it whether good or bad. Thanks again, Mike",

      "Content": "Great username. I wish I could have a hardon but those days are long gone. To your question: My previous primary physician who had been going to since 2004 when I moved to New Orleans has a Quest blood tech in his office. I had a PSA drawn at that office twice a year since my operation in 2006. He regularly orders that test since his dad had a reoccurrance of prostate cancer 20 years after having his, the dad's, prostate removed. All that time the blood was drawn there but went to a central Quest lab. This blood test, and others needed by other doctors, was drawn at another Quest collection office and, more than likely, sent to the same central lab. Thanks for your concern. I appreciate it...Mike",

      "Content": "I just found out today that after 7 full years after my prostate cancer surgery and the same number of years will a PSA of normal for the removal of the prostate that my PSA is now measuring 8.4. Anyone have experience with this situation and what does it mean? Thanks, Mike",
