      "Content": "Thanks for the story and the advice, Fairwind. It actually helps with my leaning away from surgery. Paranoia strikes deep when it comes to invasive surgery. Even after the relatively easy needle biopsy I feared being a one-percenter (which I am definitely not in other areas) who winds up with systemic infection. I'd rather not put myself in that position again. If this illness were far less aggressive I would obviously bite the bullet and get rid of the offending organ. I'm just a little perturbed that the urologist played down all treatment options other than surgery, but I suppose that's just bias on display.",

      "Content": "Hello, all: I'm new here, but have been reading for awhile. Very informative and it's greatly appreciated. To some numbers: Age: 66 PSA mid-June: 9.9 PSA mid-July (following antibiotics): 11 Biopsy August 20 Results given September 10... Right Base G7 (3+4) in one of 5 cores, 1%; Left Base G9 (4+5) in two of 3 cores, 40%; Right Mid G7 (3+4) in one of 5 cores, 1%; Left Mid G9 (5+4) in one of 4, 15%; Right Apex \u2014 no tumor identified; Left Apex G8 (5+3) in one of 2, 15%. From all information I have been able to gather (including the excellent sources on this forum), it appears that an aggressive cancer is afoot and that surgery might not offer an acceptable outcome - although the urologist recommended surgery (predictably). EDIT: I wanted to add that leaping right into surgery seems counter-intuitive without first making at least some effort to determine if the malignancy has spread beyond the operable area - especially given the numbers cited. I'm seeing an oncologist next week for a second opinion. In the meantime, I'm leaning towards brachytherapy. Any advice, given these numbers? Many thanks. (By the way, almost three months from first PSA to diagnosis. I'm a tad miffed. Things move at a snail's pace in the HMO world)",

      "Content": "JohnT and Fairwind: Many thanks for the responses. I'm happy to get a real-world perspective on my situation and extremely grateful for the replies. JohnT: Yes, it would appear that including IMRT and hormone treatment would be the best line of defense. That is my leaning as I approach the oncologist appointment. Fairwind: I'm not offended by anything you write. Including surgery in the equation seems reasonable, but (to me) only inasmuch as it reduces bulk \u2014 and this has, apparently, proven to have little effect on outcomes in advanced and aggressive cancer subsequently treated with other methods. The Walsh book appears on virtually every \"victim's\" reading list. I'll pick up a copy this afternoon. Again, many thanks for the responses. Normally I'm not a \"joiner,\" but when something like this happens it's comforting to have all you good people to share your experiences and advice.",
