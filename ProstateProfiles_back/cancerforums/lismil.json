      "Content": "My husband was recently diagnosed with prostate cancer. He's 65, PSA 8.9, Gleason 7 (4+3). His biopsy was just a few weeks ago ... 12 core, 9 with, 3 without. He has a bone scan and blood work scheduled for June 30, and an MRI scheduled for July 6. His urologist said he would be completely shocked if the cancer had spread to the bone, and we are crossing our fingers. An appointment has been made to talk with a radiation oncologist after the tests, and before his next urologist visit. My question is this: I asked the urologist who would we have do the surgery, and he said HE would. Is this normal? He's a urologist, but not an oncologist. Shouldn't we look into a urologic oncologist? My husband thinks his doctor will be okay to do it. I don't. I just recently had uterine cancer, and my gynecologist sent me to a gynecologic oncologist for a hysterectomy, then I went to a radiation oncologist for follow-up brachytherapy. I think it is very odd he's not sending my husband to an oncologist, and think we should look into finding one. We live near Pittsburgh, PA and have so many good cancer hospitals. What say you?",

      "Content": "Thank you all for the input. I am gathering that it doesn't matter as much whether he has a urologic oncologist do the surgery as much as it matters the experience of the surgeon? At this point, I am not even sure what type of surgery he performs. When at the office he didn't say Davinci and I didn't think to ask. All he said was 6 small incisions, one larger to remove the prostate, but that doesn't scream robotic. Sorry, this is all new to me. Is Davinci the preferred method? The timing of all this is so bizarre. I just had MY surgery in February and finished up the radiation in May, now this. Hopefully we can just chalk 2017 up as a bad year and move on. Thanks for the help guys!",

      "Content": "Hello All. I'd inquired about my husbands PSA and surgery last June (2017). He'd been going to a urologist, PSA was 8.9, had a Gleason of 7 (4+3). His biopsy showed 12 core, 9 with, 3 without. After reading on this forum and many other websites, we both decided he would be better off going to a surgeon that used the DaVinci method. We picked an excellent surgeon. The prostate was removed with absolutely no problem on Sept 13, 2017 (edited, was wrong year) and he has had very minor bladder problems, actually, no incontinence since they took out the catheter, (but he says when he has to go, get out of the way!) During surgery they removed 13 lymph nodes for biopsy. Two came back positive. My concern is his aftercare, or lack of. He went back in 2 weeks to have the catheter removed, then 6 weeks after that for a PSA, which came back as exactly 0.1! I saw the test results on his medical records online, but had to call the doctors office multiple times to get anyone to talk about what he should do next, and then it was only the secretary/nurse. They never scheduled another appointment because they said everything was dependent on the PSA results. I've read that <0.1 is negligible. and >0.1 is a concern. But nobody says what EXACTLY 0.1 is. The secretary/nurse did tell him to go back exactly 4 weeks after the original for another PSA. So he went back on December 13, and it was exactly the same 0.1. ... Still no word from the doctor. Is 0.1 negligible or a concern? The doctor had said if it rises too high they would do hormone therapy (but that was before we had the 0.1 reading), and that radiation would only be hit or miss. Hubby is talking about going back to the original urologist if he will take him back. Hopefully, no sour grapes since he went with another surgeon.",
