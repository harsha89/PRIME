      "Content": "Seventy yr. old guy with history of stage 1 rectal cancer 3 yrs ago. Cancer did not penetrate to the prostate. So, every 5 months I see my cancer doc and he does a digital exam, including palpating the prostate. Last time, I sugessted we do a PSA, my first one. The number that came back was 570 (no decimal point error here), suggesting bad things had already happened. We repeated the test - same outcome. We then did pelvic, abdominal and chest scans. They were identical to the ones done 3 years ago to see, at that time, if my rectal tumor had spread. Exceptions were - no rectal tumor was there, of course, the prostate was 'slightly' enlarged. So, no cancer in the CT scans. My doc hooked me up with a colleague/friend who is a urologist. We did a bone scan. No hot spots or cancer found anywhere. (I reviewed this guy, and he comes highly recommeded). The scans were done at Hoag in SoCal, which is world-class. Urologist admitted he has never seen or heard of anything like this in his practice, and is stumped. Next step - a prostate biopsy scheduled 6 days from now. Anyone heard of this scenario? I'll keep you posted ... Thanks",

      "Content": "He is a world class surgeon who does robotic cancer surgery, and he saved my life. It's my fault I never had PSA tests. I never even saw a doctor my entire life until I had the rectal bleeding 3 years ago, which I thought was hemorroids. I've never even cought a cold. I do see him every 5 months and he does a digital exam. He did say I'm slightly enlarged, but no bumps or abnormalaties. I'm calm now because I know it hasn't spread. Trust me, when I saw that PSA number, I began to plan for the afterlife.",

      "Content": "Of course you are right. Can you imagine living for 67 years without an injury or ever feeling bad or ever getting sick? And that is on top of smoking for 50+ years and drinking for about 40 years. (I quit both, finally, after the cancer). I've always done a lot of exercise and continue to do so. I'm not anti-doctor, however, I always felt I would die young, as my parents and several relatives all died young due to addiction. My cancer doc told me I healed and got better twice as fast as patients 20 years younger. I guess I've got something going on that's good. Thanks for the replies and advice.",

      "Content": "Yeah, I'm very healthy, however, side effects are my main concern. Low dose brachy gives me the best odds on minimal side effects. I don't want to wear Depends the rest of my life. Plus, I don't want to have 9 weeks interrupted every day to go wait who knows how long and then get roasted. SBRT sounds great - only a few days. But the side effects can be horrific. I will take action, but I'm waiting for my next visit in 10 weeks to see if the Lupron/Casodex mix gets the PSA heading down again.",

Not trying to be stubborn, but regardless of all the stats associated, my only interest is keeping this thing from spreading, which has not happened during the first 26 months. What I'm trying to find out is, if my PSA rises a bunch, am I at risk? Since it was at 570 and I had no spreading, where in the world am I when the PSA is in the mid twenties? I'm looking for someone in a similar situation.",

      "Content": "Greetings - I'm a 72 year old diagnosed as \"Mildly aggressive\" 26 months ago. Scans (Bone, CT and PET) showed it had not spread. PSA at that time was 570. Yes - five hundred-seventy. I'm not terribly responsible - that was my first PSA. Any way, we started Lupron (3 month dose). That got me down to a PSA of mid twenties for about 14 months, then the PSA started to spike. We then started Casodex, (no more Lupron) which got me down to a low of .5 PSA. So, after a year of Casodex, my last PSA has now shot up to 27. Doc said let's keep on Casodex and do combined therapy using Lupron again, which we started 2 weeks ago. This was an interim move to hopefully stop the spike in PSA. What no one seems to know is where the heck am I with this? Is a PSA of 500+ deadly for me or not, or is a PSA of mid twenties deadly or not? I cannot have the prostate removed due to a prior surgery having left scar tissue. (rectal cancer 6 years ago- which I came thru with flying colors - minimal nerve damage, no chemo or radiation, no pouch. My colon cancer doc told me I heal twice as fast as guys 20 years my junior, which was nice to hear). Also, radiation would be tough due to the scar tissue. I do not want to wear a diaper the rest of my life. I had hot flashes for a while, then they went away. The only other discernible side effect is a slight case of gyno. I'm curious - I've been on the meds for 26 or so months - has the gyno peaked out? It sneaked up on me - I don't even know when the onset was. How soon does it start? Help on any part of this mess would be appreciated. Thanks \"Lucky\" Lenny",

      "Content": "Funny you should mention that - I actually read up on low dose brachy yesterday afternoon. Looks like a good option. My doc is a urologist as well as a surgeon, who comes highly recommended. He did not tell me that my cancer is extremely aggressive. There must be other data associated that caused him to opine as he did. Lastly - I'm dirt poor. The colon cancer almost bankrupted me. I can't travel like you mentioned, but thanks anyway. I feel great, have no pain or feelings that I have cancer, and I'm upright - That's all I can ask for.",

      "Content": "A few things in response - My urologist is not a hack. He comes highly recommended from my colorectal surgeon. (I had a stage 1 rectal tumor 3 years ago). I also reviewed the urologist, and he is steller. In practice for almost 20 years, as well. A \"raging infection\" was his only possible explanation, but he immediately said I would be having all kinds of symptoms were that the case, and I have no symptoms. For the naysayers about the biopsy, what am I supposed to do? He took 10 samples from all around. Let's get the results back and see what's up. I also stated ultrasound showed a localized mass on the right side. So, something has been discovered. By the way, during the rectal cancer surgery, (from which I luckily ended up being completely normal, so to speak), my doc removed all kinds of lymph nodes to prevent subsequent spreading, should that cancer return. Some of those nodes are an avenue for prostate cancer to spread. Thanks for all the replies.",
