Canines\u2019 Cancer-Sniffing Snouts Showing 90%-Plus Accuracy] Taverna\u2019s finding comes at a time when use of standard PSA testing for prostate cancer is being challenged as not accurate enough, with false positives leading to unnecessary treatment. In 2012, the Preventive Services Task Force, which reports on medical issues to the U.S. Congress, recommended that healthy men shouldn\u2019t be screened for prostate cancer using PSA tests after research showed that false positive rates of men tested may be as high as 80 percent. Volatile Compounds When dogs sniff for cancer, they are detecting the chemicals emitted by a tumor. These chemicals are referred to as volatile organic compounds, or VOCs.

Prostate Cancer Urine Detection Through Highly-Trained Dogs' Olfactory System] Gianluigi Taverna Milan, Italy Lorenzo Tidu Grosseto, Italy Fabio Grizzi, Guido Giusti, Mauro Seveso, Alessio Benetti, Rodolfo Hurle, Silvia Zandegiacomo, Luisa Pasini, Alberto Mandressi, Pierpaolo Graziotti Milan, Italy DOI: Digital Object Identifier link available via google Abstract Full Text Article Outline Introduction and Objectives Methods Results Conclusions Introduction and Objectives The analysis of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in urines is a promising approach to cancer detection. Here, we establish the level of accuracy at which a rigorously trained canine olfactory system can recognize specific prostate cancer-VOCs in urine samples, thus reducing unnecessary prostate biopsies, and pinpointing patients at high-risk for prostate cancer. Methods A total of 677 subjects were investigated. All the subjects included in the study were placed in one of two main Groups: Prostate Cancer Group (n = 320) and Control Group (n = 357). Prostate Cancer Group includes patients with PC ranging from those at very-low risk to metastatic PC. Control Group includes a large and heterogeneous cohort of healthy subjects or patients affected by non-neoplastic diseases or non-prostatic tumors. Each patient's clinical status and therapeutic regiment was known. We took into consideration all predictive values currently used in the clinical practice for prostate cancer management. Two dogs and a full-time, highly specialized, multidisciplinary team was dedicated. We have standardized a \u201cwork training\u201d procedure and eliminated any possible olfactory interference. Each test was carried out blindfold. Results The dogs achieved the following performances: Dog 1: sensitivity 100%, specificity 97.8%, accuracy 98.9%. Dog 2: sensitivity 98.6%, specificity 95.9%; accuracy 97.3%. When considered together, Dogs 1 + 2, we found an accuracy of 98.1% with a sensitivity of 99.2% and a specificity of 97.1%. Whether excluded the female control sub-groups we found that Dog 1 achieved a sensitivity of 100% and a specificity of 97.9%, while Dog 2 a sensitivity of 98.6% and a specificity of 94.5%. When evaluating the wrongly detected cases no differences were found between epidemiological, clinical or histopathological characteristics. Conclusions The present study first demonstrates that a trained canine olfactory system detects specific PC-VOCs in urine samples from a large number of patients with PC at different stages and risks versus a heterogeneous control group, which is unthinkable in current clinical urological practice. Thanks to the early intuition, we have definitely turned what used to seem a myth into a real clinical opportunity. _ _ _ _ _ see also report in Reuters Health by Bridgett Novak [google...
