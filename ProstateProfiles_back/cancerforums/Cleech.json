      "Content": "Just posted this in new members...thought it might be more appropriate in here. Cool Wish I knew now what I didn't know then. Hello fellow students of the prostate. Well at least for me, since February I have been reading so much regarding the prostate, and cancer of. I have enjoyed my few hours here reading your posts. I came here one time before this all sunk in, but didn't get the depth of understanding you have at that point. I was like...what does all that 3+3, % biopsies stuff they are talking bout. Well now I have a better understanding. I went from wow, I have cancer, to let me find out about this stuff, to how can I fight it...all in a few short months. I had a psa of 4.5, 2xs over 6 months, and was referred to a urol, who immediately did the dre, which told him I needed a biopsy which told him I need surgery. He suggested davinci since he was skilled in that technique. I was ambivalent at first, but that turned to concern. He suggested I should wait no more than a month. Fortunately, I am at least 50 pounds overweight, and he mentioned that this would work against my recovery but not an issue. I found my out!! If I lose weight, I increase my odds or successful surgery, recovery and less side effects. Sign me up. It bought me a month. That is when I started reading. Dr. Walsh, Dr. Clapp, online resources, forums like this. Anything I could get my hands on. This led me to a second opinion, which lab results found the same, Gleason 3+3, but the dre was normal, and I got my psa down to 4. How encouraging, except the surgeon recommended at my age 56, cut it out, by either means, open or davinci. Back to the weight...more time, I have lost 40 and have kept it off since june, but an shooting for another 20-30 which would put me at the 200lbs mark at 5'10\". I am ok with that. I go in this Friday for another psa test, the proof is in the pudding. I have decided no surgery while psa is low and I am losing weight. Changed diet, increased exercise, and feeling pretty good. And after a week vacation in the carribean last month, Iam not even worrying so much anymore. Thatn is my story. Thanks for reading to the end.",
