      "Content": "Hi. I recently completed proton treatment at Procure in Warrenville, Illinois. I am a Gleason 6. I agree with lancepeace that a Gleason 7 is a medium grade, not an aggressive grade. There are many Gleason 7's at Procure, and they are all confident in their choice of Proton therapy over surgery or traditional radiation. Many travel from other states 2+ hours each way every day. And many stay for the entire nine week treatment in a hotel at a discounted rate. You are right to pray for your father's health and that the bone scan is clean. It most likely is, which means his cancer is contained in the capsule. He may require a hormone shot if his PSA is highly elevated which slows the cancer down. The therapy at Procure is identical to Loma Linda so I would recommend making an appointment with one of the onocologists that specialize in prostate cancer, i.e. Dr Chang. The website is www.procure.com. Stop worrying about all the stuff you are reading....if the bone scan is clear go with Proton therapy and all will be well.",
