      "Content": "Long-time creeper, first time poster. Thanks for sharing everyone, it's been really helpful this past year. I was diagnosed this January (3+3=6 gleason, T1C, PSA in March 2.3) and just had my LP via the robot by Dr. Zagaja at University Of Chicago three weeks ago. The final pathology report said it was all clear (I still need to get the stats in writing) with the cancer confined to the prostate (7% volume - seems really low, no?). The catheter was removed two weeks ago and I'm down from 8 pads to about 5-6 per day with no leakage at night (although I get up every two hours to pee). My question is what has been your experience with Kegals? The information sheet that I received from the hospital mentioned that I should be doing about 100 to 150 a day, a set of 20, with a hold count of 10. But the advice from the nurse was to \"not do too many or you'll tire out the muscle\" but she didn't give me a number. In the Walsh book there is completely different advice (\"stop the pee by squeezing your buttocks but don't try this while NOT peeing\". Zagaja says the opposite!). Completely conflicting advice here. Any suggestions? thanks, Mike, 42 years old",

I did them for months before the operation and I'm pretty sure I've located the correct muscle (that Walsh advice sounds dated!). I'll check out the thread that you mentioned. thanks for the tip!",
