      "Content": "Get you a small bucket to put your catheter bag into. You can put it by your bed/chair and it's much easier to do you walking holding a bucket. I thought the suggestion was crazy but, believe me, it's a few $ wisely spent. And you can use the bucket to wash your car when you get well. I used Depend Disposable Protective Underwear (Extra Absorbent) for about a week, then I went to Depend Guards (Maximum Protection) for about 2 weeks then used Depend Shields (Light). After about 2 1/2 months I am totally continent. The only time I have a problem is if I lift something that I shouldn't. Then only a few drops, nothing serious. I have some underwear and pads & shield that I'm not using. Might be able to save you a few $$$. Take care brother...and good luck. There is light at the other side. <Dennie>",

      "Content": "Hello again to all my friends. Last week I went for my 3-Month post-surgery PSA blood work. Asked doctor to request the Ultrasensative PSA test. I got the results on Tuesday and I'm a little concerned with the #'s but not sure if I should be. That's why I came here to ask your opinion. I go to see my urologist next Thursday so I'll get the word from him...but...waiting is driving me NUTS. The report reads: ULTRASENSITIVE PSA 0.260 (<4.000 NG/ML) Now...is this a good report or ??? I know I want a number that says <.000 but what is this saying? Does it say that the PSA was detectable or that it was too low to read? BTW...recovery has been great. Incontinence is 0% and feeling great!!! My full blood work was perfect..Dr. said to keep doing what I'm doing. He was not concerned with the PSA results...but.... Again, opinions are welcome.

      "Content": "Good Luck Brother. Yesterday was 3 weeks post surgery for me. I had RALP and it was a breeze. I've had relatively little pain (first couple of days and remedied by Tylenol.) The catheter was no big deal. I kept the big bag then entire time (other than when I went to have it removed). Get a bucket, put a plastic bag in it and put the bag in the bucket. Easy to walk with it and a breeze at night when sleeping. My pathology report came in the day I had the catheter removed (no pain when it was removed, just this WEIRD feeling) and it was excellent. No evidence of spreading, 10% of the prostate had the tumor. With a Gleason 8 I was worried but not just looking forward to my first meeting (post surgery) with my surgeon next Wednesday, then planning for the future. Good luck my brother for your surgery and your recovery. Will be thinking of you sending good thoughts and prayers. Regards from the Republic of Texas, Dennie",
