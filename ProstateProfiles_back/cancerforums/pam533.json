      "Content": "Hi. My Dad was just diagnosed with aggressive prostate cancer. His Gleason score was a 7 and it is all in one prostate. The second one is fine. He goes in for his bone scan next Monday. He is talking to someone who had proton therapy at Loma Linda and had a good experience with it. He wanted me to do some research on it for him, so I was wondering if anyone out there has had this or considered doing it? We are praying and hoping that the bone scan is clean. I am beside myself with worry as he is my only surviving parent, so it is hard for me to read some of this information.",

      "Content": "Okay, some more info...my Dad is 75, I believe his core number was 6. He has had a high PSA number for about three years and I just emailed him to find out his exact number. But, we live in Seattle and apparently the Seattle Cancer Care Alliance does the proton therapy now. Does anyone know if the proton therapy is better at a particular place. I know Loma Linda University was the first hospital to do this type fo therapy. Is it the same everywhere. Has anyone had this in Seattle and can recommend a good doctor? Thanks!",

      "Content": "Okay, thank you everyone. I called him and asked him if he was (3+4) or (4+3) and he didn't even know what that meant. He says he remembers his doctor saying something about that, but he didn't write it down and doesn't remember. He has a doctor appointment on Monday, so I told him to ask about that. What exactly do those numbers stand for? We are both in the dark as to that. I should have gone on to his appointment with him, but he wanted to do it alone. You guys are all very knowledgeable about this stuff. Any Seattle Cancer Care Alliance doctor referrals out there, too?",
