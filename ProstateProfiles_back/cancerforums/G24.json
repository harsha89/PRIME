It saves you from ADT while you are oligometastatic. As I said, last year I had all the visible recurrences radiated with Cyberknife and after one year following that have at least five new mets now. I knew I would get new ones but I did not expect that many. I will see if they will radiate these again. Keep my fingers crossed. I will probably add ADT this time. The RO said, the visible recurrences would be controlled without ADT. Yes, the visible ones were controlled but new ones appeared. And these can appear in areas difficult to radiate. G24",

      "Content": "Tim, I agree with your surgeon, if you have a Gleason 9 you have a high risk of recurrence. On the other hand, if 24 lymph nodes are clear, you may not recur. As long as your testosterone is low and you did not get resistant to ADT, your PSA stays low. If you interrupt the ADT e.g. now, after about a year the testosterone will recover and your PSA value will probably rise. But you can live with that, a PSA value will not kill you. I understand that you are having ADT now. Since you are high risk, it is correct to combine the radiation with ADT. Here is a trial that shows how long high risk patients will live if they had two years of ADT after surgery. Most of them well over ten years. G24",
