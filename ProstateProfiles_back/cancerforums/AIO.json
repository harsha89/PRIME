      "Content": "Hi guys. I have been trolling here for about two weeks now and have really learned so much from all of you, even the newbies. This is truly a great site and I have gotten answers to many questions and have raised about as many more. Today I just received my new book &quot;Guide to Surviving Prostate Cancer&quot; (Third Edition) by Patrick Walsh...... Thanks for the recommendation guys he is so smart. I would next like to find a good book for the diet of someone who has or had prostrate cancer. As you can see, I had Prostate cancer. It was detected with just a normal check-up with the PSA test. The DRE was described as normal by three different doctors two of which were Urologist. Upon the DRE the prostrate was described as very small with no abnormalities. I do have a couple of questions I would like to put forth. 1.) My operating Urologist says he has performed over 1500 RPs with around 500 being done with the da Vinci robot within the last 5 years. Is there a way to confirm the number of RARP's that a doctor claims to have performer? 2.) From looking at my signature and reading my stats on this, how does the individuals of the group feel about Adjuvant vs. Salvage treatment? Ah hemmm, should it be needed... Thanks for all the info guys... PS: Sorry this looks so messy and hard to read but I selected the WYSIWYG editor but all my line breaks were removed when I submitted the post.",

I can not tell from your post if you know that I already have had surgery.... I have my stats of everything posted in my signature but it doesn't show. I will paste it below but I think it will come out as just one huge paragraph because all line breaks are removed for me also. Please have a look if you can make sense of it if the white space and line breaks are removed. ========================== Age 50 3/19/2012 Initial PSA 7.8 4/4/2012 Second PSA 9.01 (different doctor(Urologist) & lab) 5/31/2012 Biopsy 12 cores - 3 cores 3+3, 1 core 4+5=9 acinar adenocarcinoma Abdominal CT Scan (no contrast) Negative No Bone Scan 7/2/2012 da Vinci radical prostatectomy nerve sparing Surgery with bi lateral pelvic lymph node resection (15 removed). 2 hrs 7/3/2012 Discharged from hospital. 7/9/2012 catheter removed & Path results given: Prostate: 29 grams 3.7 x 3.5 x 3 cm Main tumor Gleason Score changed to 5+4=9 involving right lobe (different lab than biopsy) with multifocal tertiary grade 3 adenocarcinoma involving both right & left lobes Extraprostatic extension present Percent of prostrate involved: 20% Tumor size 1.2 cm All 15 lymph nodes NEGATIVE Resection Margins FREE of involvement Seminal Vesicles NEGATIVE and grossly unremarkable The overlying capsular appears intact. The anterior lobes appear symmetrical LVSI: Not Identified pTNM stage: pT3a pN0 Adjuvant Treatment not advised. Current advice is to wait & watch PSA to remain at or below 0.2 First Morning Erection occurred at 11 days Sex 15 days post-surgery, no drugs (great experience) Continence pretty good but still some occasional leaking. There is some pain (restricted feeling) when standing and urinating, is this normal? ========================== Originally Posted by johnT A good book on diet is &quot;Beating Prostate Cancer; Diet and Hormone Therapy&quot; by Dr Charles Snuffy Myers. I'm a little confused by your post. Why would you want to have surgery when the possibility of either salvage or adjuvant radiation is very high. You are piling the effects of two treatments. If you believe that either salvage or adjuvant radiation is in your future the you must consider the fact that if salvage radiation would be curative then primary radiation alone will also be curative without the surgery. The only benefit of the surgery would be to get a post pathology and that is certaintly not worth the price for the information obtained. For aggressive PC, which I assume you have, a combination treatment with at least 1 year of hormone therapy has the best results. External radiation or combination seeds/IMRT are all effective on these types of cancers. Surgery is only effective when there is a high probability that the cancer is contained wholly in the prostate. If this cannot be confirmed than any of the radiation options would be a much better choice. You need some 2nd and 3rd opinions, hopefuly from a medical oncologist specializing in prostate cancer in adddition to your surgical opinion.",
