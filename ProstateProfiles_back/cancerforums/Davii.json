      "Content": "G'day all Well it's that time again. <.008. I'm at the point now that my urologist has set my next test our to 6 months. I know that it could always come back but if it had already set up a distant met, it would show up in the ultra sensitive psa early. Continency...Been great. Don't have a problem except for a bit of urgency early. Very worried about every drip and stain. Decieded to have grey underwear only! Probably left a few marks before but I'm a bit more worried now! ED... Hard to handle at first as I fidnt react to the same. Wiff of perfume, peek of inner leg XXX. Didn't happen. Now it's coming back. Slowly but it's morning erections! Able to do the biz without the Viagra. Too early to tell but I'm hopeful of some more progress. Meanwhile I'm still here over the first shock and ready to see where life leads me Thanks all Wishing all the best",

      "Content": "G'day all Well it's that time again. <.008. I'm at the point now that my urologist has set my next test our to 6 months. I know that it could always come back but if it had already set up a distant met, it would show up in the ultra sensitive psa early. Continency...Been great. Don't have a problem except for a bit of urgency early. Very worried about every drip and stain. Decieded to have grey underwear only! Probably left a few marks before but I'm a bit more worried now! ED... Hard to handle at first as I fidnt react to the same. Wiff of perfume, peek of inner leg XXX. Didn't happen. Now it's coming back. Slowly but it's morning erections! Able to do the biz without the Viagra. Too early to tell but I'm hopeful of some more progress. Meanwhile I'm still here over the first shock and ready to see where life leads me Thanks all Wishing all the best",

      "Content": "G'day I'm in Aust so I know the stats here. Yes we are are a small population just 25 million of us. Biggest cancer killer of men.... lung cancer... 5,000 a year... 5 year survival rate 17 per cent. Next biggest cancer killer of men..prostate cancer... 3,400 a year... 5 year survival rate 95 per cent. Note the survival rate! What's the difference? A detection method yes PSA for prostate cancer! There is none for lung cancer so that 5 year survival rate is pretty dismal as it's only when the symptoms are noticed that it gets diagnosed. To late... Great prostate cancer survival rate is 95 per cent! But the devil is in the detail! That 5 per cent is 3400 men a year, 8 per day, by the time you get to 5 years that's 17000 men... died. I'm a Gleason 9 and I'm still here.... thanks to a regular PSA. Go back to the good old days and get a regular DRE? Yes like hearding cats... It's not perfect but at least we have PSA testing. It's more important for me now with no prostate. Any raise means cancers back and the fight goes on davii",
