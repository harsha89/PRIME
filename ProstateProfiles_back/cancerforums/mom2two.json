      "Content": "Originally Posted by LimeRose98 My father had surgery and radiation therapy in 2014 for 2 cancerous tumours in the prostrate. He had the prostrate removed. His levels went down to undetectable after a few months. They remained that way until his test in April this year, where they had risen to 0.017. He had another test in June and it had doubled to 0.03. Now, he had another oncology appointment today (October 10th) and they have risen to 0.3. That is 10 times what they were 3 months ago. He is feeling physically well, other than severe pain in the hip that he has had since last year. After scans, he has been on the waiting list for a hip replacement at the end of the year. Now, they're concerned this wasn't caused by the damaged hip joint and that the cancer has metasized to the bones. I don't understand this, given that the symptoms presented before his PSA started to rise again and given an orthopaedic surgeon has determined he needs the replacement. We won't know about this until he has a scan in a fortnight. Has anyone else been through something similar to this? Why have the levels gone up so suddenly in the last 3 months and what are the chances that it has metasized with a reading of 0.3? Why hasn't he experienced any new symptoms? (In fact, he has got a lot better lately). I want to be realistic about the possibilities. What sort of treatment could there be and what would be the chances of it working? Thank you so much in advance. I think the odds are good that the two are unrelated. It does sound like a recurrence that needs to be investigated and treated with SRT and perhaps hormones. Is he also seeing his oncologist/surgeon/RO? I'm guessing they will want to do a scan to look and see that the recurrence is local and not distant. I do understand your concern....your mind will go to all sorts of possibilities.... Good luck and keep us updated.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by newporter Welcome back! I highlighted those areas of your concerns. Let me give you my non professional opinion: 1. Don't worry too much about PNI, many studies concluded that those found by post op pathology report that are within the prostate did not increase the chances of recurrence. 2. The finding on EPE, and surgical margins etc. seemed conflicting but that is very good news. Apparently, there were EPE of soft tissues involvements, but his surgeon made a wide cut and took out all of the cancer tissues and that was why all the final inked margins were deemed negative. 3. There were no lymph nodes, seminal vesicles or other areas where cancer invaded. 4. That is why first PSA was undetectable, the surgeon did a good job. Overall a very good pathology report. Let's hope he will continue to have undetectable PSA. If you are not comfortable, get a second opinion from an oncologist about whether it still makes sense to do any adjuvant treatments. Best wishes. Thank you for breaking it down for me...I guess the most worrisome to me was the ECE and that it was \"extensive and well established\". I am happy about the negative margins especially if you think that means they got out all the cancer...I was a bit confused about how the ECE and negative margins correlated...dad seems very happy and his recovery has been very good. Dr. gave him the go-ahead to slowly go back to the gym and do the treadmill...he walks everyday anyhow....next step will be in Feb when he does his next PSA test...",

      "Content": "Brief reminder: dad had radical prostatectomy on Sept 30th. He got his PSA tested on the 19th of Nov, and yesterday we met with the Dr to get those results and his pathology report. I'll try to summarize the report: first of all his PSA was undetectable, which is great! Let's hope it stays that way. As for the pathology report: -left pelvic lymph node was negative for malignancy -gleason went from 4+4=8 from biopsy to 4+3=7 on path report (good news again), though most of the primary pattern was a 4. zones involved by tumour: peripheral zone distribution of tumor: unifocal, unilateral, left apex, posterior (largest dimension approx. 1.1cm) -surgical margins all are negative for malignancy (apical, bladder neck and peripheral) -perineural invasion is present (not so good) -vascualr/lymphatic invation not identified (good news) -seminal vesicles not involved by tumor (good news) -extraprostatic soft tissue-tumor shows established extra-porstatic extension, left posterior aspect (pT3a) (this is where I really start to worry) -bladder neck final margin, query median lobe: prostate tissue that is negative for malignancy prostate size: 32.9 g (5.1cm x4.8cmx3.7cm) histologic type: adenocarcinoma (acinar) proportion of prostate involved by tumor: 5% -anterior predominante tumor: no -extraprostatic extension : present nonfocal (established extensicve) -seminal vesicle invasion: not identified -margins: margins uninvolved by invasive carcinoma -lymph-vascular invasion: no identifed perineural invasion: present Primary tumor: pT3a: extraprostatic extension or microscopic invaskon of bladder neck Regional lymp nodes (pN): pN0 (number of regional lymph nodes examined-1) Distant metastis (pM): not applicable additional pathologic findings: high-grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia (PIN), inflammation. Acute and chronic nodular prostatic hyperplasia (pathologic staging is based on AJCC/UICC TNM 7th edition GROSS DESCRIPTION: tumor grossly identified: white irregular, left apex to mid posterior prostate perihpehral; approximate size: 1.1cm x0.8cm x 0.6cm; gross extent of local invasion: confiend to the prostate; no tissue is stored frozen I know some of the info is duplicated as that is how it is in the pathology report. ( I had to ask for a copy, but the dr did give it to me....) Overall I suppose I feel good, but the ECE worries me as does the fact that from the biopsy there was no perineural invasion present and while waiting all this time for sugery it was now prsesent...I am happy the Gleason went from 8 to 7, though most of it was still a 4 rather than a 3. I'm looking for member who have so much more experience with all this than me to tell me what they think and offer any suggestions...dr. said no treatment necessary now they will carefully monitor PSA. thanks and sorry for the long post!....also please let me know what important details to add to the signature for future posts.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by HighlanderCFH Yes, it was basically a good report. The only thing I would say is that they'll probably keep a close check on his PSA due to the perineural invasion. It is possible to have a recurrence, when perineural invasion is identified, even with clear margins. This is because with PI, cancer cells group themselves in the space around the tiny nerves inside the prostate near the surface. Sometimes they can ride these nerves outside the prostate and to other areas. This is one way that recurrence can happen even with clear surgical margins. Fortunately, there is no guarantee that this will happen. It is merely a \"possibility\" that they will want to keep a close check on. Wishing him the very best! Chuck I must say I'm feeling much better about it today having had time to digest the information and do some reading..I think yesterday was a very emotionally charged day...seeing him happy and back to doing his usual things is the best indication he's ok right now!",

He is referring him to a radiation oncologist. He says we need to be cautious and that the radiation oncologist will decide if now or if more waiting before salvage radiation. Not what I wanted to hear, but I was expecting it... I will make sure to take the day off and go with dad. Will wait to see what the radiation oncologist says, but my personal opinion is to just do it and get it done, sooner rather than later.... I would rally appreciated hearing from those of you who have had salvage radiation and are doing well. What is the experience like? Discomfort/pain? Side-effects? I want to be as prepared as possible. This forum has been a life-saver....and helped me be prepared at each step.... thanks in advance!",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by LimeRose98 My father had surgery and radiation therapy in 2014 for 2 cancerous tumours in the prostrate. He had the prostrate removed. His levels went down to undetectable after a few months. They remained that way until his test in April this year, where they had risen to 0.017. He had another test in June and it had doubled to 0.03. Now, he had another oncology appointment today (October 10th) and they have risen to 0.3. That is 10 times what they were 3 months ago. He is feeling physically well, other than severe pain in the hip that he has had since last year. After scans, he has been on the waiting list for a hip replacement at the end of the year. Now, they're concerned this wasn't caused by the damaged hip joint and that the cancer has metasized to the bones. I don't understand this, given that the symptoms presented before his PSA started to rise again and given an orthopaedic surgeon has determined he needs the replacement. We won't know about this until he has a scan in a fortnight. Has anyone else been through something similar to this? Why have the levels gone up so suddenly in the last 3 months and what are the chances that it has metasized with a reading of 0.3? Why hasn't he experienced any new symptoms? (In fact, he has got a lot better lately). I want to be realistic about the possibilities. What sort of treatment could there be and what would be the chances of it working? Thank you so much in advance. I think the odds are good that the two are unrelated. It does sound like a recurrence that needs to be investigated and treated with SRT and perhaps hormones. Is he also seeing his oncologist/surgeon/RO? I'm guessing they will want to do a scan to look and see that the recurrence is local and not distant. I do understand your concern....your mind will go to all sorts of possibilities.... Good luck and keep us updated.",

      "Content": "Brief reminder: dad had radical prostatectomy on Sept 30th. He got his PSA tested on the 19th of Nov, and yesterday we met with the Dr to get those results and his pathology report. I'll try to summarize the report: first of all his PSA was undetectable, which is great! Let's hope it stays that way. As for the pathology report: -left pelvic lymph node was negative for malignancy -gleason went from 4+4=8 from biopsy to 4+3=7 on path report (good news again), though most of the primary pattern was a 4. zones involved by tumour: peripheral zone distribution of tumor: unifocal, unilateral, left apex, posterior (largest dimension approx. 1.1cm) -surgical margins all are negative for malignancy (apical, bladder neck and peripheral) -perineural invasion is present (not so good) -vascualr/lymphatic invation not identified (good news) -seminal vesicles not involved by tumor (good news) -extraprostatic soft tissue-tumor shows established extra-porstatic extension, left posterior aspect (pT3a) (this is where I really start to worry) -bladder neck final margin, query median lobe: prostate tissue that is negative for malignancy prostate size: 32.9 g (5.1cm x4.8cmx3.7cm) histologic type: adenocarcinoma (acinar) proportion of prostate involved by tumor: 5% -anterior predominante tumor: no -extraprostatic extension : present nonfocal (established extensicve) -seminal vesicle invasion: not identified -margins: margins uninvolved by invasive carcinoma -lymph-vascular invasion: no identifed perineural invasion: present Primary tumor: pT3a: extraprostatic extension or microscopic invaskon of bladder neck Regional lymp nodes (pN): pN0 (number of regional lymph nodes examined-1) Distant metastis (pM): not applicable additional pathologic findings: high-grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia (PIN), inflammation. Acute and chronic nodular prostatic hyperplasia (pathologic staging is based on AJCC/UICC TNM 7th edition GROSS DESCRIPTION: tumor grossly identified: white irregular, left apex to mid posterior prostate perihpehral; approximate size: 1.1cm x0.8cm x 0.6cm; gross extent of local invasion: confiend to the prostate; no tissue is stored frozen I know some of the info is duplicated as that is how it is in the pathology report. ( I had to ask for a copy, but the dr did give it to me....) Overall I suppose I feel good, but the ECE worries me as does the fact that from the biopsy there was no perineural invasion present and while waiting all this time for sugery it was now prsesent...I am happy the Gleason went from 8 to 7, though most of it was still a 4 rather than a 3. I'm looking for member who have so much more experience with all this than me to tell me what they think and offer any suggestions...dr. said no treatment necessary now they will carefully monitor PSA. thanks and sorry for the long post!....also please let me know what important details to add to the signature for future posts.",

      "Content": "I decided to start a new thread. I posted last week about dad's rising PSA (from not detectable to 0.015 to 0.027 and last week to 0.040). We saw the surgeon today. He is referring him to a radiation oncologist. He says we need to be cautious and that the radiation oncologist will decide if now or if more waiting before salvage radiation. Not what I wanted to hear, but I was expecting it... I will make sure to take the day off and go with dad. Will wait to see what the radiation oncologist says, but my personal opinion is to just do it and get it done, sooner rather than later.... I would rally appreciated hearing from those of you who have had salvage radiation and are doing well. What is the experience like? Discomfort/pain? Side-effects? I want to be as prepared as possible. This forum has been a life-saver....and helped me be prepared at each step.... thanks in advance!",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by newporter Welcome back! I highlighted those areas of your concerns. Let me give you my non professional opinion: 1. Don't worry too much about PNI, many studies concluded that those found by post op pathology report that are within the prostate did not increase the chances of recurrence. 2. The finding on EPE, and surgical margins etc. seemed conflicting but that is very good news. Apparently, there were EPE of soft tissues involvements, but his surgeon made a wide cut and took out all of the cancer tissues and that was why all the final inked margins were deemed negative. 3. There were no lymph nodes, seminal vesicles or other areas where cancer invaded. 4. That is why first PSA was undetectable, the surgeon did a good job. Overall a very good pathology report. Let's hope he will continue to have undetectable PSA. If you are not comfortable, get a second opinion from an oncologist about whether it still makes sense to do any adjuvant treatments. Best wishes. Thank you for breaking it down for me...I guess the most worrisome to me was the ECE and that it was \"extensive and well established\". I am happy about the negative margins especially if you think that means they got out all the cancer...I was a bit confused about how the ECE and negative margins correlated...dad seems very happy and his recovery has been very good. Dr. gave him the go-ahead to slowly go back to the gym and do the treadmill...he walks everyday anyhow....next step will be in Feb when he does his next PSA test...",

      "Content": "Brief reminder: dad had radical prostatectomy on Sept 30th. He got his PSA tested on the 19th of Nov, and yesterday we met with the Dr to get those results and his pathology report. I'll try to summarize the report: first of all his PSA was undetectable, which is great! Let's hope it stays that way. As for the pathology report: -left pelvic lymph node was negative for malignancy -gleason went from 4+4=8 from biopsy to 4+3=7 on path report (good news again), though most of the primary pattern was a 4. zones involved by tumour: peripheral zone distribution of tumor: unifocal, unilateral, left apex, posterior (largest dimension approx. 1.1cm) -surgical margins all are negative for malignancy (apical, bladder neck and peripheral) -perineural invasion is present (not so good) -vascualr/lymphatic invation not identified (good news) -seminal vesicles not involved by tumor (good news) -extraprostatic soft tissue-tumor shows established extra-porstatic extension, left posterior aspect (pT3a) (this is where I really start to worry) -bladder neck final margin, query median lobe: prostate tissue that is negative for malignancy prostate size: 32.9 g (5.1cm x4.8cmx3.7cm) histologic type: adenocarcinoma (acinar) proportion of prostate involved by tumor: 5% -anterior predominante tumor: no -extraprostatic extension : present nonfocal (established extensicve) -seminal vesicle invasion: not identified -margins: margins uninvolved by invasive carcinoma -lymph-vascular invasion: no identifed perineural invasion: present Primary tumor: pT3a: extraprostatic extension or microscopic invaskon of bladder neck Regional lymp nodes (pN): pN0 (number of regional lymph nodes examined-1) Distant metastis (pM): not applicable additional pathologic findings: high-grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia (PIN), inflammation. Acute and chronic nodular prostatic hyperplasia (pathologic staging is based on AJCC/UICC TNM 7th edition GROSS DESCRIPTION: tumor grossly identified: white irregular, left apex to mid posterior prostate perihpehral; approximate size: 1.1cm x0.8cm x 0.6cm; gross extent of local invasion: confiend to the prostate; no tissue is stored frozen I know some of the info is duplicated as that is how it is in the pathology report. ( I had to ask for a copy, but the dr did give it to me....) Overall I suppose I feel good, but the ECE worries me as does the fact that from the biopsy there was no perineural invasion present and while waiting all this time for sugery it was now prsesent...I am happy the Gleason went from 8 to 7, though most of it was still a 4 rather than a 3. I'm looking for member who have so much more experience with all this than me to tell me what they think and offer any suggestions...dr. said no treatment necessary now they will carefully monitor PSA. thanks and sorry for the long post!....also please let me know what important details to add to the signature for future posts.",

The first is the lowest value you can detect, the second is the lowest value you can accurately measure. So if your sample measures less than what you can detect you need to have the less than sign to indicate it's below the assay's detection limit. A result without the less than sign means you are detecting a measurement (although it may be less than your LOQ). If the lab has really dropped the less than sign, they are asking for trouble....imho",

But if it's \"success\" you seek, keep in mind that the scheduling of his surgery has already met a plateau of success. Not every patient is as lucky to progress toward a potential \"cure\", specifically if the cancer has metastasized. You have read their posts on this site. Some must be satisfied with modalities designed only to extend life. In that way, your Dad is already a winner. Best of luck. Jim You are so right Jim, and I count that blessing everyday.....I realize there are others who must deal with worse circumstances...I really meant no disrespect..... We are off to the hospital in the next 30min, I will post again after the surgery.",

Now we keep our fingers crossed that nothing shows up and that surgery goes as scheduled next week on the 30th. Here at home we've all been sick with a cold (me, hubby and kids) so he and mom moved in with my brother for a few days. We're doing all we can to keep him from catching anything, wiping all door handles etc....but the four of us were sick at the same time he was here...an extra stressor that none of us need...I'm terrified he'll come down with a cold/fever and have his surgery delayed as I'm not sure how that works and how long the delay would be.... other than that all seems to be on track.....",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by PDV Hello all. I haven't been on this forum for awhile. My brother Ed and I have both had surgery to remove our prostates. His was in early 2011. Mine in 2016. His PSA never went to the zero club, although it was close. It stayed at .03 for years but last year started to creep up. It hit 0.7 two weeks ago. The doctor said the Big C was back somewhere. They did an MRI hoping it would be a small spot near the prostate area that they could zap but didn't see one. A bone scan didn't reveal anything. Now the docs say he needs salvage radiation. We both thought we were done with this. We even won a golf tournament together two years ago, and we both had knee replacements last year. After seven years this is a shock. Can anyone who has had salvage radiation give him any advice? How tired did you get? Any other side effects? Did it work? Thanks. My dad is currently undergoing SRT. He started at a PSA of 0.044 after 3 consecutive increases. At this low rate, no hormone therapy will be done after he's done. He has 6 sessions of 33 left, so he is almost done! In terms of side effects, the dr. told him all that most men tolerate it very well but listed the possible side effects, like increased urination, bowel changes, bleeding, fatigue I think these were the main ones. He has been extremely lucky (knock on wood for the last 6) and has had virtually no side effects except some increased urination. His RO told him that about 1/3 of men fall into this \"lucky\" group. I'm sure others will give their experiences too. Best of luck to him!",

You will need another two readings with the ultrasensitive test to see if the number is stable, fluctuating up and down, or steadily increasing in which case a trend can be established. My dad has started salvage radiation at 0.044 using the ultrasensitive test, but he has an increasing trend ( 0, 0.015, 0.027, 0.04, 0.044) and decided to do radiation early rather than later even at this very low level. Hope this info helps. In any case, rest assured that that is still a very, very low number.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by Michael F Hi m2t! The last 4 consecutive PSA values suggest a rising trend. Question: Were each of these PSA tests analyzed at the same lab using the same PSA Methodology each time? You can determine this by obtaining copies of each original lab report. If \"No\" then you can not compare these results to each other If \"Yes\" then you need to have a conversation with his URO Surgeon and request a referral to a URO Radiation Oncologist (RO) who is highly experienced in treating recurrent PC. Now is the time to meet with the RO as he/she may recommend Salvage Radiation sooner than later. While 0.040 ng/ml is both an extremely minuscule quantity and clinically undetectable, some RO's recommend starting SR at 0.03 for better outcomes. Don't panic but do get an early meeting & opinion from a qualified RO to make the assessment and best recommendations. Ask the RO: - \"At what point will you consider my father to have recurrent PCa?\" - \"How will you determine the exact location(s) of the recurrent PCa prior to starting SR?\" Hoping his next PSA is less than his most recent. Remain strong & optimistic! Good luck! MF Yes all the results are from the same lab using the same test. I will be going to his appointment with him and hope to ask all those questions without scaring him....",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by Michael F Here is the reply to your earlier post: Hi \"M22!\" Don't be in the least bit concerned. In fact, the 0.03 PSA value needs to be thrown into the trash bin. Here are some points to be considered: - Keep in mind that any level < 0.05 ng/ml is considered \"Undetectable.\" - Post prostatectomy, if there are consecutive detectable rises in PSA, then it is pretty much diagnostic of prostate adenocarcinoma = \"Recurrence of Prostate Cancer\" - Your Dad is having his PSA monitored using Ultrasensitive PSA Assay which can detect very small amounts and changes (hopefully not increases) in PSA. Reason = Once the entire prostate is removed, PSA should \"vanish\" to a level < 0.01 ng/ml - There are several different Ultrasensitive PSA Assays (PSA lab test). They will not give identical results - It is essential that the same PSA test is run at the same lab in order to compare results So your Dad can ignore the: \"new lab in another country....reading is 0.03\" value. FYI: Here is the verbatim recommendation from the American Urological Association: \"Serum PSA should decrease and remain at Undetectable levels after radical prostatectomy... Values obtained with different assay methods or kits cannot be used interchangeably. Results cannot be interpreted as absolute evidence of the presence or absence of malignant disease.\" After he returns home, be sure he maintains his MD's recommendation for frequency of having his PSA tested. And be sure he does it at the same lab using the same test. May his PSA forever remain < 0.01 ng/ml ! Good luck! OH that's great, thank you! I'm glad I got this reply back, reading it makes me feel good",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by Michael F Hi m2t! There is no need for panic or anxiety or even concern. However, there is a need to keep an eye on his uPSA status. Let's start with your statement: \"his GP included a PSA test with all his other bloodwork (same lab) and it came back at 0.027.\" More specifically, let's address: (same lab): A couple of questions/items: - What was his March 2016 uPSA result (assuming that he was being tested at least every 6 months)? - Does this imply that both his GP & URO MD use the exact same lab? (Often times this is the case where MD offices are attached to the hospital and they send their patients to the hospital lab to get their bloods drawn) - Are you 100% certain that the exact same uPSA Methodology was used for each of last 2 uPSAs? If different uPSA Methodologies were used, you can not compare these 2 results. - The only way to be 100% certain is to request copies of the original lab report for each uPSA test and keep them in your records. These lab reports will list the exact uPSA testing method used. (In fact, I am heading to my Urologist's office at noon today to pick up a copy of the uPSA lab report that was drawn on Monday. The lab (LabCorp) faxes a copy back to my Urologist and they make a photocopy for me.) Re: 'I don't know if we should just wait for September and see how that one is or if I should try to contact his surgeon and tell him this result?\" In reverse order: - No need to contact the URO Surgeon for 2 reasons: 1) These uPSA values have no clinical meaning & 2) The Uro surgeon is not going to suggest any action steps at this time - If me, I would monitor this a bit more frequently (uPSA every 3rd or 4th month to determine if there is clinical rise) Why?: The Path Report states: \"ECE: established, extensive, left posterior aspect (pT3a)\" This finding places him in an elevated risk for recurrence category. The general \"Rule of Thumb\" for identifying Biochemical Recurrence (BR) using uPSA following RP is: 3 consecutive and clinically relevant increases. IF he has been monitored using the exact same uPSA methodologie each time, he now has 2 consecutive rises. Before jumping too far ahead to conclusions, a simpler way to analyze this is to round off and drop the 3rd decimal point. Thus: - Sep 2015 = ≤ 0.01 - Mar 2016 = ? - Sep 2016 = 0.02 - Mar 2017 = 0.03 - Ju__2017 = ? If all have been measured by the same uPSA method, there is a rising trend. IMO, if the next uPSA \"rounds\" to ≥ 0.04, then an MD must make the judgement call. The good news is this will have detected BR as early a possible. The even better news will be if the next uPSA rounds to ≤ 0.03. Hoping for this result! Stay calm and optimistic! Good luck MF Thanks for taking the time to reply. Yes, both surgeon and GP use the same lab and the test is the exact same, we have the lab report for both stating the test used and it is the same. He called his urologist today and has an appointment later this afternoon to show him the results. We won't be contacting the surgeon unless the urologist suggests it....so hard to not worry when it's one of your one even when your head knows the numbers are not that bad....yet....",

He went from undetectable to 0.015, then 0.027, 0.040 and 0.044 Long discussion with the oncologist. He said that this is still very, very, low as is your PSA. But the important thing to look at is the trend. If it is just due to variations in the uPSA test, then it should bounce up and down. If it is only steadily rising, then chances of a BCR are higher. He went on to explain that there are two schools of thought as such low numbers. Some drs wait and watch until the value is 0.2 before starting radiation. Others, like him believe that the earlier you start salvage radiation, the better, before the cancer load can be given a chance to increase. In our case the other consideration was around age. At 74 my dad is in otherwise good health and so able to withstand radiation right now, nobody can predict how he will be in 1 or 2 years and whether at that point he can still have radiation or not. So in his case he decided to go ahead now and do the radiation. Also at this low level, his oncologist is not suggesting hormone therapy and is confident that he will become undetectable again. The other important thing we discussed and would apply even more to your case is that after so long being undetectable, the odds the any cells producing PSA are in the local area of the prostate bed and not distant are high. All positive points in my opinion. Hope this helps a little!",

RO said that it is still very low, but given his history of ECE and the rising trend and his otherwise overall good health, radiation was a suggestion, though waiting was reasonable with these numbers. Quoted 0.2 as the official number for BCR. However in his opinion and he has multiple research papers written, if you're going to do SRT, he thinks the earlier the better before load can increase. With dad's low numbers no hormone treatment was recommended and he is confident that PSA will go back to undetectable.....so 33 sessions coming starting later this month. A lot of info to take in and a lot of reading to bring home, but he was very, very kind and knowledgeable. Procedure at this hospital requires empty rectum and full bladder.... Deep breaths for this next stage and prayers requested that it goes well with minimal side effects....33 sessions will take 6.5 weeks....",

Assuming he continues a member of the zero club what kind of testing schedule can we expect? I am of course going to ask the dr. this when we go in for the results...",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by Jim215 Your patience is beyond saintly. If a doctor told me that he would not call with negative results, only if something showed up, it would drive me crazy, not knowing if everything is OK or whether he didn't get around to reading the results yet. He works for you. You get to tell him what results you want. And that you want those results as soon as they become available. If you can stand the wait until September 15th, it's not up to me to say anything -- bite my tongue. BUT, if I wanted those results, I would be calling his office twice a day (morning and afternoon) to learn if they had arrived yet. Best of luck to your Dad and you. Jim Well I think the medical system works different here in Canada, guess the Dr. doesn't really work for \"me\" sigh...I don't know what it is specifically today or if I'm just worn out but today it's beyond worry almost panic....I did try to call the office today but got voicemail saying the office is closed for holidays until Sep 3rd (Sep 1 is a civic holiday and so it's a long weekend)...so I wait some more....I think what's bugging me most is the \"if\" God forbid the bone scan is not clean the the dr will refuse to do surgery....I'm of the opinion that you still want to get in there and take out the \"bulk of the volcano\" and then deal with the rest......this is all so confusing...and hard to deal with for everyone in this kind of situation but especially for me since I suffer from GAD (generalized anxiety disorder)...thanks for listening...it really does help me rationalize my thoughts. In addition I read the posts and learn a lot and am inspired by the courage I find here from other going through the same thing.",

If it has declined a considerable amount then you can expect that trend downward to continue.... If it has not declined, then you may need to have SRT or HRT or both.

      "Content": "Originally Posted by cog6 Well, 9 months and another PSA rise. PSA now at .12. Only good news is the low doubling time. On next to a radiation oncologist for the next step. If you have been down this road or a similar road, chime in with your thoughts. Thanks I've been down a similar road with my dad (if you look back at my latest posts). His PSA slowly rose as well, and he did 35 sessions of SRT and then his PSA slowly decreased back to undetectable! You have good reason to believe yours will also. As for the SRT itself, he'd be a better person to explain what he went through, but from our talks the hardest part for him was to hold his bladder, so much so that he would go early to the hospital so that he'd drink it there and sit and not move in order to be able to hold it. Other than that he was very, very lucky and suffered virtually no other side effects. He had no burning and no bowel issues. Your clear margins and lymph nodes coupled to the slow increase points to some cells left behind locally rather than anything distant with a very good chance of being successfully targeted by SRT. As for Chick's question regarding the possibility of benign prostate tissue being left behind, we asked the RO the same question with my dad and the answer was that in that case you'd expect a more or less constant value and not only an increasing number which points to a recurrence. Hope this helps? Feel free to ask more questions until you're comfortable and feeling confident that you can get this!",

First of all there is a lot in your favor from the pathology report so no need to panic. The amount of cores (2) and the lower percentage of involvement could be that you caught it early enough to be treatable with really good results. The Gleason Grade of an 4+4=8 suggests that you have a little time, a second opinion is never a bad call. Per the pathology a tumor of 7mm outside the rectal wall, is that correct? Just relax and wait until all of the tests are in. Most likely another CT scan, a bone scan and I did not see a PSA. I cant comment on the surgery side of things as surgery was never an option for me. Radiation and Hormone Therapy is the path I'm on. I have 6 of 45 IMRT left to go. However, there a lot of people on the site that can give you opinions and advice you can trust, I know this because they give me the support and questions you need to be asking the Dr. I hope it all goes smoothly and turns out well!!!

      "Content": "So after SRT my dad's PSA slowly started to go back down and yesterday we were at <0.008! We are so happy! For his case, it seems that starting SRT at a very low PSA after having established an upwards trend was the right thing to do! So he finished 35 of SRT in early December of last year and his PSA went from 0.044 to 0.025 to 0.009 to <0.008! For those who are interested in the discussion on the value of the ultra-sensitive PSA test and when SRT should be started, for us his upwards trend was established with the following resutls (each six months apart): 0.015, 0.027, 0.044 and his Dr. recommended SRT sooner rather than later although he was given the option to wait and watch... each person's case and details are unique so this may not be the right course for everyone, but for us it seems to have been the right choice!",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by cog6 Well, 9 months and another PSA rise. PSA now at .12. Only good news is the low doubling time. On next to a radiation oncologist for the next step. If you have been down this road or a similar road, chime in with your thoughts. Thanks I've been down a similar road with my dad (if you look back at my latest posts). His PSA slowly rose as well, and he did 35 sessions of SRT and then his PSA slowly decreased back to undetectable! You have good reason to believe yours will also. As for the SRT itself, he'd be a better person to explain what he went through, but from our talks the hardest part for him was to hold his bladder, so much so that he would go early to the hospital so that he'd drink it there and sit and not move in order to be able to hold it. Other than that he was very, very lucky and suffered virtually no other side effects. He had no burning and no bowel issues. Your clear margins and lymph nodes coupled to the slow increase points to some cells left behind locally rather than anything distant with a very good chance of being successfully targeted by SRT. As for Chick's question regarding the possibility of benign prostate tissue being left behind, we asked the RO the same question with my dad and the answer was that in that case you'd expect a more or less constant value and not only an increasing number which points to a recurrence. Hope this helps? Feel free to ask more questions until you're comfortable and feeling confident that you can get this!",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by lancepeace I am not clear about ECE: established, extensive, etc. What did the urologist say about ECE? What is the patients age? The PSA was good which is encouraging. Yes ECE was established, urologist says all the margins were negative, however \"negative\" is based on the number of samples they tested and doesn't mean that there wasn't a positive somewhere around the margin that wasn't tested. That's basically what he said. Yes PSA is great and let's hope it stays that way, however in his particular case even when he had his prostate and cancer his PSA was not high so it was a rare case where the PSA values did not indicate he had cancer. We are all feeling better today, I think yesterday the feelings just surfaced again because there was new conversation on the topic.... thanks everyone",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by Allmo Hi all, Relatively new to the site and have been lurking in the shadows. Want to thank those who support the site. It has offered me much education and solace. Just got my 9 month postop/RALP uPSA and decipher results back. The trend, unfortunately for me, has been consecutively up. 06/17 RALP at City of Hope 09/17 .010 3 month 10/17 .007 4 11/17 .010 5 12/17 .015 6 month 03/18 .019 9 month Though, admittedly they are not at the published 3 month intervals; so at least one of the results should not count toward the 3 consecutive rule. I am still holding out hope that the rise is some combination of a small amount of benign tissue, wound healing from the operation (even stitches are still popping out), normal analytic variation in the test at such low levels, ed rehabilitation, recent flu, etc. Already (prior to the decipher result and latest psa) had a consult with UCSF radiation oncologists who recommended against adjuvant RT; despite adverse postop finding of EPE which is an indication for it, considering all my other data points including capra-s (developed at UCSF) score of 3. Allen 3 consecutive rises is the definition for a biochemical recurrence....having said that the numbers are all still extremely low...have a talk with your dr and see what he suggests, but it may not be a bad idea to also talk to a radiation oncologist and get that ball rolling should you need to do salvage radiation in the future. In my dad's case his rises from undetectable were to 0.015, 0.027, 0.040 and then 0.044. Following his salvage radiation treatments his readings thus far have been 0.024 and the last one was 0.009! This tells us that indeed his low readings were real and that the radiation hit the right spot and the numbers are going back down. Of course the other side of the situation is had he not done radiation would his numbers have continued to increase and how long until a clinical significance? His dr said he could choose to wait and watch. In his case he decided to hit it earlier rather than later and get it off his mind. It was the right decision for him, but may not be for everyone....hope this helps! Please try not to panic and talk to your dr before making the decision that is right for you.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by newporter For some reason I could not respond to your post over there, so let me answer it here: I want to emphasize this is just a layperson's interpretation and I maybe all wrong. Starting with the most important, This trumps the negative margins. I assumed the one positive node is the first sentinel node. I assumed the surgeon stopped at three since the following two were clean otherwise many more nodes would have been removed. The cancer already spread. IDC, NOS is the most common form of breast cancer (like adenocarcinoma in prostate cancer), survival rate is very high. However, the micropapillary component is a more aggressive feature so is not as good. Also, the lymphovascular involvement means the cancer is growing inside the lymphatic vessels so the risk of spread outside is high (e.g. to the lymph nodes). They are also very close to the margins meaning microscopic cancer cells could be outside. All in all I think she needs additional treatments like chemo and possibly radiation to the breast and surrounding area, and if her genetic make up is correct, she could take tamoxifen to further reduce her risk of recurrence. Don't panic, folks I know who had similar pathology went through the multiple treatments and are doing very well after many years. Good luck. Absolutely she will need more treatment. We knew before the lumpectomy that she'd need at least radiation. The positive lymph node got her sent to a medical oncologist as well to see if she needs chemo and/or hormone treatment. So I understant about the lymph nodes. But I'm concerned about the margins (and of course will ask the dr when we see her). the are uninvolved, that is clear in the section under margins along with the distance from the closest margin in mm (7mm being the closest). What is really scaring and confusing me is the Note as described in the breast cancer forum. I'm wanting to believe that the bold-printed \"uninvolved margins for invasive carcinoma\" trumph the note in non-bold text, right?",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by Allmo Hi all, Relatively new to the site and have been lurking in the shadows. Want to thank those who support the site. It has offered me much education and solace. Just got my 9 month postop/RALP uPSA and decipher results back. The trend, unfortunately for me, has been consecutively up. 06/17 RALP at City of Hope 09/17 .010 3 month 10/17 .007 4 11/17 .010 5 12/17 .015 6 month 03/18 .019 9 month Though, admittedly they are not at the published 3 month intervals; so at least one of the results should not count toward the 3 consecutive rule. I am still holding out hope that the rise is some combination of a small amount of benign tissue, wound healing from the operation (even stitches are still popping out), normal analytic variation in the test at such low levels, ed rehabilitation, recent flu, etc. Already (prior to the decipher result and latest psa) had a consult with UCSF radiation oncologists who recommended against adjuvant RT; despite adverse postop finding of EPE which is an indication for it, considering all my other data points including capra-s (developed at UCSF) score of 3. Allen 3 consecutive rises is the definition for a biochemical recurrence....having said that the numbers are all still extremely low...have a talk with your dr and see what he suggests, but it may not be a bad idea to also talk to a radiation oncologist and get that ball rolling should you need to do salvage radiation in the future. In my dad's case his rises from undetectable were to 0.015, 0.027, 0.040 and then 0.044. Following his salvage radiation treatments his readings thus far have been 0.024 and the last one was 0.009!

      "Content": "Originally Posted by Mimi711 That's great news! I don't know if this is standard but when you go home, make sure you have the following (some or most of which will be provided by the hospital): --prescriptions (if you haven't filled them already) These would include pain pills, stool softeners and anti-spasm pills for bladder spasms. Can't remember name but DH really needed those. --tube of Lidocaine ointment; --gloves; --some kind of container to hold the cath bag. Very impt in case there are leaks; --extra gauze pads, etc., in case you need to change the dressing on the JP drain; Note: if your Dad goes home wearing the smaller leg bag, make sure you have the cap that was on the bag originally. That way when you switch to the larger bag, you'll have the cap so you can keep the leg bag tubing clean. (This probably makes no sense to you right now but will when you are getting the discharge instructions.) Good luck! Thanks for all the valuable info...some of those things we knew about, others we didn't so I'll make sure he has everything he needs. He is being discharged today. Yesterday when we visited less than 24hrs after surgery, he was up and walking in the halls, eating well and able to go to the bathroom! He's in excellent spirits and the nurse said they are very pleased with his progress! I think I'll need to hold him back from over-doing it!",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by fishinguy Mom2two, you're post has me really thinking this morning after reading it. Should I assume in the signature line the ECE is the same as \"EPE*- extra prostatic extension\", is that the reason for SRT after surgery with a PSA of 0.44? Margins all looked good. The reason I ask is two fold, one I still get confused with the PSA after surgery. I under stand zero is the goal, but I read <.1 is non-detectable and for all accounts zero. Or should is it <.01 non-detectable? It seems so many times I read about post-surgery PSA and they contradict another thread, or maybe typos once in a while confuse me with the decimal point. Is it fare to think those low numbers have different meanings based on the actual pathology report? Is a reading of .04 good for some, but not so good for others? As you see, at 3 months I was <.04 that's why this hits home. Thank you. Hello, Yes, ECE is extra-capsular extension, same as EPE. The reason for him to start SRT at a PSA of 0.044 was that he had an established trend of an increasing PSA, so it was a matter of time before it rose even higher, and although 0.1 is still used as a threshold, with the ultra-sensitive PSA test (some drs believe, including his) if a rising trend of at least 3 consecutive rises is established, then recurrence is occurring. Again some drs (not all) believe that it is best then to start SRT the earlier the better. Others believe in waiting until the 0.1 or 0.2 threshold before starting SRT. His particular RO gave him both choices, saying it was not wrong if he wanted to wait. When asked how he would advise a brother in the same situation, he said he'd treat earlier rather than later, so that is what my dad did.",

I can only add my personal experience. Prior to having my surgery, a full body bone scan was mandated. It was explained to me that if the cancer showed up elsewhere (metastasized), then surgery would not be an option. My understanding was that if I was not a surgical candidate, the doctors were certainly not \"giving up\" but they were conceding that a \"cure\" was not possible at that point. Then, the focus would shift from a curative pathway to a methodology to extend life. As you've probably read, there are many, many ways (radiation, hormone therapy, etc.) to accomplish that goal. But let's not put the cart before the horse (that cliché should show my age) and hope for the best results with the bone scan. Best of luck to you and your Dad. Jim",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by HighlanderCFH Hi, One of the first destinations for PC that has broken through the capsule is the seminal vesicles. So if the pathology report shows them to be clear, that would be a big plus. Was his discomfort from the catheter removal or the staples? As long as the bladder neck was not involved with PC and the surgeon is top notch, the incontinence will become a thing of the past. Eventually it will clear up. Sometimes it takes only a few days, for others it can be a year or longer before total recovery. But, it is extremely likely that his incontinence will disappear at some point. Good luck with the pathology report! Chuck Both, the catheter he said was much longer than he expected and he could feel it coming out (not pain per say). The staples hurt a bit...they had been in for 14 days which surprised the nurse, so while the incision itself was ok, each side of the incision was a bit red where the staples were stuck in the skin (nurse called a dr. to take a look and he said it was a reaction to the staples). they drew a border on his skin and if the redness doesn't subside or grows beyond the border they drew he is to see a dr. We are also to monitor his temperature.",

      "Content": "Can you please explain how the bone scan is done? We were told he'd get an injection then have to wait three hours before having the scan. Also given that the CT scan was negative, wouldn't that also show bone metastisi? thanks for all you help! Originally Posted by Jim215 Hi Mom2two: Chuck pretty much answered your question in full. I can only add my personal experience. Prior to having my surgery, a full body bone scan was mandated. It was explained to me that if the cancer showed up elsewhere (metastasized), then surgery would not be an option. My understanding was that if I was not a surgical candidate, the doctors were certainly not \"giving up\" but they were conceding that a \"cure\" was not possible at that point. Then, the focus would shift from a curative pathway to a methodology to extend life. As you've probably read, there are many, many ways (radiation, hormone therapy, etc.) to accomplish that goal. But let's not put the cart before the horse (that cliché should show my age) and hope for the best results with the bone scan. Best of luck to you and your Dad. Jim",
