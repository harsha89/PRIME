      "Content": "Originally Posted by ASAdvocate Panway, What a great first post! You really have shown years of discipline, and have the good results as your reward. I also include the blueberries, pumpkin seeds, almond milk, and other items in my diet, but still eat many of the \"bad\" foods you now avoid. Just one question...you mention that you avoid chocolate. I always eat a half bar of high cocoa (75% or more) chocolate every day, thinking that it is good as an anti-oxidant. Of course, I also like the taste. Why do you not recommend chocolate? Please keep us informed of your progress in staying healthy. Milk chocolate is high in fat contents. Dark Chocolate, which I was eating handful every day made my PSA jump .5 percent. I dropped eating dark chocolate immediately. The following year my PSA was back to 5.7. Dark chocolate is still high in fat contents, just not as bad as milk chocolate. During the holidays I do break down and have a few pieces of Dark Chocolate. Best of Luck. Patrick",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by HighlanderCFH Good luck Patrick, and welcome to the forum. Did the doctor tell you the exact size of your prostate? Larger prostates, with BPH, do have higher than normal PSA numbers. But, as my urologists all cautioned me, it could also be hiding the presence of a tumor. They urged me to have biopsies and I refused. Found out a couple years later that I DID have prostate cancer along with the BPH. So I'm glad that you have been having biopsies just to play it safe and also to give you peace of mind. Please continue getting those biopsies & keep tracking your PSA readings. Good luck -- here's hoping you never need to join our PC club. Chuck Hi. The urologist never told me the exact size of the prostate, only that it was very large. The biopsy were base, mid and apex left and right side. Thanks for the reply. Patrick",

      "Content": "My PSA was 5.1 in 2004. In 2007 psa was 8.7 and now have had three biopsies. All negative. The Urologist puts me on avodart. Fast forward to 2010 PSA is 10.8 and still on adovart which appears to be NOT working. Urologist says avodart does not work on all men. I get an MRI on the prostate. The radiologist says he has never seen a larger prostate. My wife takes out cancer insurance. MRI is negative again. I begin to research health of the prostate. I change my diet completely. NO soft drinks, milk, cheese, junk foods, red meat, white flour, (white bread, pancakes, cookies, cakes) NO chocolate etc. Below are the positive things I have done to change my PSA Green tea/white tea(Decaf) show much promise in small studies. High in antioxidants. I begin to drink green tea about four to five cups per day. Tea bags only, not bottled green tea. I take green tea bags to restaurants. I ask if the restaurant carries green tea, if not I ask for hot water and make my own. I begin to have blueberries every day, high in antioxidants. Shelled and unsalted Pumpkin seeds and shelled sunflowers seeds every day for a snack. Always on the kitchen counter to grab a handful. Pumpkin seeds are full of Magnesium, zinc and vitamin E. Which the prostate needs to be healthy. I begin to drink Tomato juice every day.(Tomatoes are a popular food as well as a superior source of lycopene, a phytonutrient, or more specifically a carotenoid, one of a group of yellow, orange, and red pigments found in plants. Lycopene is a potent antioxidant that has proven itself in study after study to have properties that enhance prostate health). By drinking tomato juice, I stopped drinking Orange juice, which does NOT have major impact on the prostate. Also more antioxidants. Almond milk(unsweeten) for breakfast, wheat bread for toast. Apples three days a week. Spinach only for salads(oil and vinegar for dressing), several times a week. Lettuce is all water and is useless. Vitamin D 2000 I/U daily to help prevent cancer. Studies have shown that some people with cancer have low vitamin D. In 2011, PSA is 5.7. I am on cloud nine. Urologist says Adovart is working. I questioned him on that statement and he does not want to hear my story. I no longer go to him. I have changed urologist. Fast Forward again to 2014 and PSA is 5.88. I begin to drink more white tea decaf(hard to find and rare) than green tea. I begin to make fruit smoothies every day in the blender made up of the following: spinach, blueberries, strawberries, bananas, almond milk and plain non fat yogurt and ice cubes. A very good morning drink for my wife and I. Walk every day at least 5000 steps and workout. In 2015 PSA is 4.9. I scream in the doctor's office. He says careful, careful. I must keep up the good diet. It worked for me. Best of Luck and God Bless. Patrick",
