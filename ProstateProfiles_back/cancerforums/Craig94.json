      "Content": "Well, I'm home now. Everything went well...the doctor said I was a little \"oozy\" during the surgery. The first thing I remember in recovery is my arms and legs shaking uncontrollably. I ended up spending two nights in the hospital due to the swelling and pain. I had two bouts with nausea, one more serious than the other, but I powered through with some phenergan and support from my wonderful wife. It's been three days post surgery and I'm still having some gurgling in the gut area...mainly when I'm lying down. When I get on the toilet the gas pains decide to disappear for the most part. It it normal to have a little blood leak out of the cath tube where it inserts into the penis while you're on the toilet and slightly bearing down? Right now I'm using a walker. Have any of you guys used one post-op? I'm hoping to wean off it in the next couple of days, but it makes a great hanger for the urine bag. I'm feeling a little better each day and am looking forward to next Tuesday when I'm scheduled to get the cath out. Thanks again for the thoughts and prayers.",

My PSA was 4.1 and the urologist put me on Cipro for a month. After a month I went back to the doctor and the PSA level had dropped to 3.5, but the urologist suggested that I get a biopsy, which I did and found out I had PC on May 14. Several weeks later I went to get a second opinion and was told, unfortunately, that it was Gleason 7. I had studied quite a bit between the initial diagnosis and my second opinion and decided that RP was the way for me to go. I spoke to my second opinion urologist earlier this week and he agreed that this would probably be my best option. He will be doing RALP on me. Anyway, I'm scheduled for surgery on August 18 and obviously a little apprehensive about the whole ordeal. I've never had major surgery before and am just hoping that everything turns out well. Just wanted to pop in, say \"hi\" and join the club.",
