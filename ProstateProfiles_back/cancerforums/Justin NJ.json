      "Content": "Background: - When I was 40, my primary care Dr added PSA to my annual blood test panel due to my father's high PSA reading. My father, has not been diagnosed with prostate cancer however has been under the care of a urologist for BPH. - PSA came back at 4.2 and I was referred to a urologist. - Test was repeated 6 weeks later and came back 4.1, and told to come back in a year. - Over the course of the next 4 years my PSA slowly climbed into the 5's and 6's. - Age 44 my PSA reached 7.2 and my urologist recommended a biopsy which was a stand 12 core and returned no findings of cancer. - I was now upgraded to a PSA every 6 months within a year, my PSA jumped to 9.1 at age 45. - At this point, an MRI was ordered and showed liaisons which was followed up by an MRI guided 18 core biopsy. - This time, 1 of the 18 cores was graded 3+3 and I was referred to a urology oncologist surgeon at New Jersey Cancer Institute (Rutgers / Robert Wood Johnson - Both my urologist and oncologist recommended active monitoring. - I was a bit concerned about not being more active in removing the cancer and learned about partial ablation and decided a 2nd opinion was needed. - I met with a urologist at Memorial Sloan Kettering, who requested my biopsy slides be re-read by his pathologist team who re-graded the cancer as a 3+4 and also regraded 3 cores as High Risk Lesions: Atypical small acinar proliferation (ASAP) - My MRI was also reviewed and found multiple liaisons, and along with the 3 additional hot-spots and the high psa, the Dr. at Sloan recommended RP via robotic assist. So, here is where my dilemma resides - two different opinions based on two different pathology reports on the same set of core samples. I am really hard pressed at this point to make a decision about moving forward with a RP, if it's really not needed, or at least not yet. I did bring MSK's results back to my urologist and his recommendation is to perform another MRI and compare it to last year's to see if there is any change. I am scheduled for the MRI in 5 weeks from now. Any suggestions / recommendations would be greatly appreciated!!!! Tx Justin",

      "Content": "Background: - When I was 40, my primary care Dr added PSA to my annual blood test panel due to my father's high PSA reading. My father, has not been diagnosed with prostate cancer however has been under the care of a urologist for BPH. - PSA came back at 4.2 and I was referred to a urologist. - Test was repeated 6 weeks later and came back 4.1, and told to come back in a year. - Over the course of the next 4 years my PSA slowly climbed into the 5's and 6's. - Age 44 my PSA reached 7.2 and my urologist recommended a biopsy which was a stand 12 core and returned no findings of cancer. - I was now upgraded to a PSA every 6 months within a year, my PSA jumped to 9.1 at age 45. - At this point, an MRI was ordered and showed liaisons which was followed up by an MRI guided 18 core biopsy. - This time, 1 of the 18 cores was graded 3+3 and I was referred to a urology oncologist surgeon at New Jersey Cancer Institute (Rutgers / Robert Wood Johnson - Both my urologist and oncologist recommended active monitoring. - I was a bit concerned about not being more active in removing the cancer and learned about partial ablation and decided a 2nd opinion was needed. - I met with a urologist at Memorial Sloan Kettering, who requested my biopsy slides be re-read by his pathologist team who re-graded the cancer as a 3+4 and also regraded 3 cores as High Risk Lesions: Atypical small acinar proliferation (ASAP) - My MRI was also reviewed and found multiple liaisons, and along with the 3 additional hot-spots and the high psa, the Dr. at Sloan recommended RP via robotic assist. So, here is where my dilemma resides - two different opinions based on two different pathology reports on the same set of core samples. I am really hard pressed at this point to make a decision about moving forward with a RP, if it's really not needed, or at least not yet. I did bring MSK's results back to my urologist and his recommendation is to perform another MRI and compare it to last year's to see if there is any change. I am scheduled for the MRI in 5 weeks from now. Any suggestions / recommendations would be greatly appreciated!!!! Tx Justin",

      "Content": "Thanks all for the replies. I'll put some more info to see if that helps answer some of the questions that folks had in their posts. All the Dr's I have visited, and a discussion with a friend of mine who is a radiation oncologist all say that radiation is absolutely not a treatment option for someone my age. My dilemma is following the recommendation of oncologist #1 (active monitoring due to pathology report of 3+3) or oncologist #2 (RP robotic assist surgery due to a pathology report of 3+4) Both pathology reports were based on the same biopsy slides. I did have concern about Chuck's statement asking why my Urologist waiting so long before a biopsy - and maybe I wasn't clear in my write-up. My first biopsy was done as soon as my PSA reading went over 7.0. When it was in the 5's the Doctor was thinking it might be BPH due to family history. Originally Posted by HighlanderCFH Personally, I'm wondering why the urologist waited through YEARS of rising PSA numbers before suggesting the biopsy. The PSA high norm for a man in his 40s is only 2.5 -- and you were 3x that amount. Anyway, - hope this helps clear up where I am.... My last PSA was down to 7.75, however I am on Finasteride for 1.5 months at the point when that test was taken, which will reduce PSA. The medicine is being taken to help with the urinary effects (urgency / night time bathroom runs). However, total Free PSA was at 16%, and my understanding is it shouldn't be under 25%. Here are the details from the Pathology report from MSK. There are also other hot-spots tagged with High Risk Lesions: Atypical small acinar proliferation (ASAP) Prostate, ROI; biopsy (US17-001612, Q, 4/21/2017, 1 H&E and 3 IMMUNOS): Adenocarcinoma: Prostatic Adenocarcinoma Prostate Cancer Grading: Primary Gleason grade: 3 Secondary Gleason grade: 4 Total Gleason score: 7 Grade Group: 2 Tumor Quantifications: The total number of cores identified is 3 The total number of cores with carcinoma is 1 The percentage of tissue with carcinoma is 10% The linear amount of tissue with carcinoma is 3 mm The percentage of Gleason grade 4 and/or 5 is 5 %",

      "Content": "Hi all, So leading up to and now after my RP a few weeks ago, I have been asking a lot of friends if they had their PSA tested. I had a test early (about age 40) due to my dad's high PSA, and even before I had any symptoms. As my PSA increased, I did have some onset of symptoms, but am still lucky to have had early detection. So, getting back to people i've talked to, two people I know never had their psa tested (one just over, one just under age 50) and both have a family history of PC (parent and grandparent). Both are now taking action to get tested!!! So now that my awareness has been elevated, I continue to see awareness campaigns for other cancers, with the greatest being breast cancer, which by the way in rare cases can affect men. Ironically on my way to work there are 3 big billboard signs related to cancer, one is generic for a local cancer hospital, the 2nd was generic breast cancer and the 3rd was another local hospital's campaign for women's health and breast cancer. I am not trying to push down any other awareness campaign however I have yet to see many prostate cancer awareness campaigns - so how do we get the word out their to go get a simple PSA test? Has anyone started any awareness campaigns? Any ideas on what we can do to promote awareness?",

      "Content": "Michael, Thanks for the response. I am in 100% agreement with you that donating to an organization who's overhead is 90% is a bad idea. Every organization is going to have overhead, and I think it's great if PCF can push 82% of their funds to PCa research, it is also the awareness that needs to be made much more public through awareness campaigns. It does look like PCF does get involved in awareness, maybe just not in my line of sight. It's is good to hear that 10 people you know went to get tested and had negative test results. Besides the 2 people I mentioned in my original post, there could be many more and I hope there is. A few days before my surgery, I put a 'go get tested' post on Facebook and it got seen by many (maybe hundreds) as it got shared a bunch of times also.",
