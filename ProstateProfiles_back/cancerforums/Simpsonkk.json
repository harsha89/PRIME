      "Content": "Prostate Cancer and Zoladex. I am 10 days into my first 3 month pellet injection of Zoladex. I was briefed on the side effects by my medical professionals and I have read plenty but I still have some questions. For example I getting frequent shivering attacks - is this normal/unusual or what? I have had a permanent light headache for the last week and I am generally weak and lethargic. Is this normal or unusual? How long will these and any other side effects last - will I have them at this intensity for as long as I have Zoladex (currently for 3 years)? In May I am due to start 7 and a half weeks of radiotherapy. What are the effects of this treatment? Fellow sufferers or medical professionals - I would be grateful for you thoughts.",
