      "Content": "Originally Posted by HighlanderCFH Hi there -- and welcome to the forum. I'm sorry to hear of your husband's diagnosis. Wishing you the best during Thursday's appointment. As has been noted, getting a second opinion on the biopsy slides is a very good idea. If he has \"intermediate\" risk, it would mean his Gleason score is 7. Higher risk cases would mean Gleason scores of 8, 9 or 10. You will want to ask the doctor if his Gleason 7 is a 3+4 or a 4+3 because there can be a difference. \"Low\" risk prostate cancer is anything Gleason 6 (3+3) or lower. If a Gleason score of 7 is a 3+4, it means that the lower Gleason grade of 3 (the first number listed) is the dominant type of cancer cell found in that particular biopsy core. The second number, 4, represents the minority of Gleason grade cells in that core. Thus, a Gleason 3+4 often behaves more like the low risk Gleason 3+3, so you'll want to know if that is the the type he has. Even a 4+3, however, can be cured if it is still confined to the prostate. This leads to another question -- the doctor should also discuss the staging of the disease, as predicted by the biopsy report. If it is stage 1 or 2, it is still confined to the prostate and hence easier to cure. If the urologist recommends surgery, that would mean that he does expect it to be curable. If you consider surgery, make sure that the urologist has performed at least 300-400 open or robotic operations. That is critical because there is a long learning curve to achieve complete competence. You would also want to consult with a highly experienced radiation oncologist to find out the good and bad of radiation as a primary treatment. I would also recommend, as we do with newly diagnosed couples, that you both read the 3rd edition of Dr. Pat Walsh's \"Guide to Surviving Prostate Cancer.\" Hang in there and see what the doctor says on Thursday. In the meantime, others here will be offering their experiences, thoughts & advice. Take care, Chuck Thanks for the info--I've jotted down all the questions you raised. My husband's urologist is Dr. Alex Philpott, who is part of the Urology Center in Colorado. Website says they've performed over 3,000 robotic surgeries since 2006. I suspect he's over the 300 mark, but we'll ask. I ordered the book & will post details on Thursday. Appreciate the good advice & support.",

      "Content": "My husband (63) just learned today that his biopsy is positive for prostate cancer with an \"intermediate risk.\" His PSA was 9 and two nodules (one of each side) were discovered during a DRE. He is otherwise healthy, no chronic issues, non-smoker, plays tennis 3 times a week and has no family history of this type of cancer. We are both stunned and the diagnosis is just sinking in. My husband has an appointment with his urologist on Thursday to get more details and discuss options and I'd like to be prepared with questions. In doing a little research and talking to friends whose husbands went through it, getting a 2nd opinion is paramount, I'm told. Memorial Sloan Kettering is recommended. Do you all agree? What questions should we ask the urologist? Should we also see an oncologist right now? Thanks in advance for your help.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by HighlanderCFH Hi there -- and welcome to the forum. I'm sorry to hear of your husband's diagnosis. Wishing you the best during Thursday's appointment. As has been noted, getting a second opinion on the biopsy slides is a very good idea. If he has \"intermediate\" risk, it would mean his Gleason score is 7. Higher risk cases would mean Gleason scores of 8, 9 or 10. You will want to ask the doctor if his Gleason 7 is a 3+4 or a 4+3 because there can be a difference. \"Low\" risk prostate cancer is anything Gleason 6 (3+3) or lower. If a Gleason score of 7 is a 3+4, it means that the lower Gleason grade of 3 (the first number listed) is the dominant type of cancer cell found in that particular biopsy core. The second number, 4, represents the minority of Gleason grade cells in that core. Thus, a Gleason 3+4 often behaves more like the low risk Gleason 3+3, so you'll want to know if that is the the type he has. Even a 4+3, however, can be cured if it is still confined to the prostate. This leads to another question -- the doctor should also discuss the staging of the disease, as predicted by the biopsy report. If it is stage 1 or 2, it is still confined to the prostate and hence easier to cure. If the urologist recommends surgery, that would mean that he does expect it to be curable. If you consider surgery, make sure that the urologist has performed at least 300-400 open or robotic operations. That is critical because there is a long learning curve to achieve complete competence. You would also want to consult with a highly experienced radiation oncologist to find out the good and bad of radiation as a primary treatment. I would also recommend, as we do with newly diagnosed couples, that you both read the 3rd edition of Dr. Pat Walsh's \"Guide to Surviving Prostate Cancer.\" Hang in there and see what the doctor says on Thursday. In the meantime, others here will be offering their experiences, thoughts & advice. Take care, Chuck Thanks for the info--I've jotted down all the questions you raised. My husband's urologist is Dr. Alex Philpott, who is part of the Urology Center in Colorado. Website says they've performed over 3,000 robotic surgeries since 2006. I suspect he's over the 300 mark, but we'll ask. I ordered the book & will post details on Thursday. Appreciate the good advice & support.",

If it is stage 1 or 2, it is still confined to the prostate and hence easier to cure. If the urologist recommends surgery, that would mean that he does expect it to be curable. If you consider surgery, make sure that the urologist has performed at least 300-400 open or robotic operations. That is critical because there is a long learning curve to achieve complete competence. You would also want to consult with a highly experienced radiation oncologist to find out the good and bad of radiation as a primary treatment. I would also recommend, as we do with newly diagnosed couples, that you both read the 3rd edition of Dr. Pat Walsh's \"Guide to Surviving Prostate Cancer.\" Hang in there and see what the doctor says on Thursday. In the meantime, others here will be offering their experiences, thoughts & advice. Take care, Chuck Thanks for the info--I've jotted down all the questions you raised. My husband's urologist is Dr. Alex Philpott, who is part of the Urology Center in Colorado. Website says they've performed over 3,000 robotic surgeries since 2006. I suspect he's over the 300 mark, but we'll ask. I ordered the book & will post details on Thursday. Appreciate the good advice & support.",

      "Content": "The doctor's visit went well--he was very thorough and walked us through all the treatment options, including the ones that aren't appropriate for my husband's situation. He answered every question thoroughly and even gave us a copy of Dr. Walsh's book. His recommendation is robotic surgery and said my husband could wait until after the holidays to have it done. I have a few numbers that I hope will be useful in getting input from the group: PSA: 9 Biopsy: positive; two nodules, one on each side Gleason: 7 (3+4) Grade: T2C 11 out of 12 cores positive No evidence of perineural invasion or extraprostatic extension. ETA: added info Here's the breakdown of cores: (L) Positive 6 (3+3) <5% (K) Positive 6(3+3) 25% (J) Positive 6(3+3) 40% (I) Benign (H) Positive 6(3+3) 10% (G) Positive 6 (3+3) 95% (C) Positive 7 (3+4) 45% (B) Positive 7 (3+4) 95% (A) Positive 6 (3+3) 95% (F) Positive 6 (3+3) 10% (E) Positive 7 (3+4) 85% (D) Positive 7 (3+4) 90% Thanks in advance for your help.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by Mikla I'm sorry to hear that you and your husband have joined our club, but you are in good hands with the folks here. I think before most folks can really provide helpful insight, we need a little more information on the biobsy (e.g., # of positive cores and Gleason score on those cores). Also his PSA history would be helpful. Getting a second opinion on the biopsy will probably be helpful and usually recommended by most folks here. You can read up on Staging here. This is a decent link with info and questions. Others will chime in with their thoughts. Good luck! Thank you for the links, which I'll check out. I will post the biopsy details after seeing the doctor on Thursday. As for his PSA progression, the last time he had a blood workup was in 2010 and the PSA was in the normal range. In 9/14 it was 9 and on re-test it was 8.9.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by HighlanderCFH Hi there -- and welcome to the forum. I'm sorry to hear of your husband's diagnosis. Wishing you the best during Thursday's appointment. As has been noted, getting a second opinion on the biopsy slides is a very good idea. If he has \"intermediate\" risk, it would mean his Gleason score is 7. Higher risk cases would mean Gleason scores of 8, 9 or 10. You will want to ask the doctor if his Gleason 7 is a 3+4 or a 4+3 because there can be a difference. \"Low\" risk prostate cancer is anything Gleason 6 (3+3) or lower. If a Gleason score of 7 is a 3+4, it means that the lower Gleason grade of 3 (the first number listed) is the dominant type of cancer cell found in that particular biopsy core. The second number, 4, represents the minority of Gleason grade cells in that core. Thus, a Gleason 3+4 often behaves more like the low risk Gleason 3+3, so you'll want to know if that is the the type he has. Even a 4+3, however, can be cured if it is still confined to the prostate. This leads to another question -- the doctor should also discuss the staging of the disease, as predicted by the biopsy report.
