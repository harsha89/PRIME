My catheter was removed at 10 days and I was totally incontinent the first week although I did stay dry at night. After the first week post catheter removal, I slowly started regaining bladder control and at this time I have 90% control. I have to tighten up when standing from a sitting position, when sneezing, etc. or I will leak slightly. I usually walk 1-2 miles per day which seems to help. I usually drink 1 soda, 1 cup decaf coffee, 2 cups decaf green tea and several glasses of water every day. During weeks 3 & 4 I need to visit the bathroom frequently now I have better bladder control and need to go less often. Hang in there MarkG it will get better!",

      "Content": "3 weeks ago, when I was 3 months post-op I had a similar experience. I was feeling very good and doing so well with continence that I stopped doing Kegels. Over a 3 day period I mowed my 8 acre lawn, cut down several dead trees and made a huge brush pile. A couple of days later I started having groin pain, pain around my navel and stated leaking at a rapid rate. I rested for the next week and started doing Kegels again. It took me 2 weeks to get back to no pain and only very occasional leaks.",

      "Content": "My surgeon trained at the Vattikuti Institute and uses the double layer Rocco. At 6 weeks post op the stitching started disintegrating and coming out in the urine in very small specs. Initially this worried me however after a call to the doc and his explanation I understood. It took about 4 weeks for all of the double layer stitching to decay and come out. His explanation for using this stitch was it is the most \"fluid tight\". At 66 years of age, I've had very good success in regaining my continence. At 3 months post op my only problem is an occasional very small leak. If the stitching contributed to my regaining continence more quickly, thats great.",
