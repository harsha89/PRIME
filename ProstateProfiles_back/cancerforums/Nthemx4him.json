    "Content": "Hello, Everyone, My husband was diagnosed with prostate cancer in February of this year. He has undergone hormone therapy and is now in his third week of radiation therapy. I read all the information I can, but he also listens to many other \"experienced\" friends. He has started to complain about fatigue and pain around the tailbone. I would love any information on being more supportive and finding more ways of dealing with this than drugs. We have only been married 6 years and I'd like to keep him around way, way longer.",
