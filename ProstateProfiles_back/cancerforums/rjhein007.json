Biopsy showed Gleason 3+3=6 Right Base PTI=5% Adenocarcinoma in specimen 9. Highest gleason is 6 involving 1 of 2 cores 5% pernieural invasion not present. Lesion about 4cm. 72 year old male. Seeing if treatment is rec. or Active surv. and thoughts on the two treatment options in New England area above. RI resident. I have heard potential issues with Very large size prostate about 3 times the size of the normal prostate. second biopsy year and half later shows Right base at 3+3=6 PTI now 10 percent NOW this new info below: Right Lateral Base 3+3=6 PTI 10 percent right lateral mid 3+3=6 PTI 2 PERCENT Adenocarcinoma in specimens 9,13,14. Highest gleason still remaining a 6 and highest PTI is still 10 Second biopsy year and half year later showing two more quartels of the prostate testing positive Have potential issues with Proton as it goes in and out of rectum and machines gen a lot of neutrons and could be carcinogenic? Anyone with experience with either treatments? or recommendations ?",
