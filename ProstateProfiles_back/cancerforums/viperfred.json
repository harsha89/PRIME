      "Content": "Originally Posted by RW744 I would greatly appreciate hearing about your experience with CyberKnife vs robotic surgery. I would like to go with CyberKnife but can't find much information about its long term curative rate, side effects and toxicity. I am 67, have a PSA of 5.58, clear bone and CT scans, an MRI showing four \"suspected tumors\" ranging from .4 to 1.3 cm with two of them in broad capsular contact but with no bulging, Gleason scores of three 6's and one 7 (3+4) and my father had pc. Have any of you used CyberKnife? Or is robotic surgery the way to go? If I do that procedure, my surgeon is one of the very best. What is your evaluation of CyberKnife? Thanks for sharing any of your experience or advice? The Cyberknife is the best treatment option for locxalized prostate cancer in my opinion. I was treated in May 2008 with the cyberknife and have Zero side effects and my PSA is 0.3 ng/ml. (before treatment it was 5.0 ng/ml). There are many woh are criticial of the Cyberknife. However look at the published peer reviewed studies now with five year published data. There is no recovery time, on surgical risk, no other treatment has a higher cure rate and no other treatment offers a better quality of life. The Cyberknife treatment is 4 or 5 sessions depending on the protocol. It is a form of external beam radiation. The radiation energy is photons, the dose per session is extreme hypo fractionation similiar to the dose from HDR Brachytherapy. This is a proven therapy, approved by the FDA in 2001. What makes the Cyberknife exceptional is delivery of radiation beams from three planes (x,y,z), gold fiducial targets are placed in the prostate for real time (target volume, prostate, is located before the beam is delivered) tracking. These two features allow sub mm accuracy of delivery of prescribed dose to the target volume. No ohter treatment can delivery the same accuracy. Read the published literature for each option and make an informed choice. Good Luck",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by newporter viperfred, Thank you for sharing your experience here. We need more sharing of experiences, good or bad so new members can benefit from our journeys. I am very happy for you that your treatment is very successful and I agree today's radiation treatment is \"not your father's radiation treatment\". RW744, Reading your biopsy and diagnostic reports again, I see your cancer seemed to be pushing the edge (capsule), I would consult your doctor to see if that could be a risk factor for Cyberknife. A very precise beam is both good and bad. If the cancer is pushing the edge, there may be potential misses or damaging adjacent tissues (if the doctor is too aggressive with the beam coverage). Again, just a layperson's opinion which may or may not be correct. RWt44 is correct to ask doctors any and all questions that your have. Ask the Cyberknife RO questions about the CK and ask the surgeon surgical questions. CK Radiation is delivered by hundreds of beams from x,y, and z planes. The intersection of the beams create the dose volume. The shape of the prescribed dose plan is controlled by the doctor. Margins are defined to protect critical structures while delivering a high dose to the target tissue. When looking at the options it is really helpful to understand each treatment technology and consider the technology limitations (cancers cells can not be seen during any procedure), risk for each, benefits, including cure rates and quality of life.

      "Content": "Originally Posted by Fairwind CyberKnife, a form of external beam radiation, has not been used very much on prostate cancer so there are few if any studies that can provide information about how effective it is...If hype could cure cancer, then Cyber-Knife would be the sure winner...You see this form of treatment promoted on highway billboards and radio spots during sports broadcasts..Dr. Gerald Chodak's book, \"Winning the battle.......\" gives unbiased, up to date treatment options along with all the statistical details.. Hi Fairwind, Suggest you read the published Five Year studies by Dr. C.R. King, and another one by A. Katz. All Radio therapy has improved dramatically in the last 10 (and continues to improve) years because of improved imaging that defines the target, improvement in dose planning, improvements in hardware for better beam shape and delivery accuracy. Surgery was the gold standard before 2000, but today modern radiotherapy offers the best quality of life and highest chance for cure. There are many hundreds of studies for treatment of prostate cancer with radiation. Fred",
