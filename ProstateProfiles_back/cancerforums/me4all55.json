      "Content": "Originally Posted by lancepeace I am sorry to hear about the diagnosis. What country does he live in? We probably could tell more if you had the scan results. If he had advanced cancer, maybe a urinary catheter would provide some relief. Good luck to you both. We are from india. PSA is 14.98 , Serum Chromogranin A Test : Negative , PET CT Scan : Shows a Lesion in the Peripheral Region of the Prostate 8cm * 7cm also there a Lesion near the lymph node 3cm. Is it Very painful to Use Urinary catheter? How long can he use it. Do he need a surgery for that?",

      "Content": "This is my second post. My dad has been diagnosed with neuroendocrine carsinoma of the prostate. Do scans, blood test, wait for the report. this is what happening since last 2 months. No Treatment at all. My dad is not been able to sleep at least for an hour. Whenever he sleeps, he feels like going to Toilet. May be some of you might have also going through these problems. Doctors are only concerned about shrinking the tumor and no one is bothered about the trouble the patient is facing every day. I kindly request all to suggest your ideas to overcome this problem.",
