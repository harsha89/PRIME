Nutrition plays such a big role in prevention and treatment, trying to get my hubby to change too, but we are not there yet I am celebrating my birthday, and I have looked everywhere to get an idea of what kind of alcohol is the safest in my situation. I'm not a big drinker, but I have always toasted my birthday so I'm going with red wine I think Sometimes cancer patients need a stiff drink too!",
