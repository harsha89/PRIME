      "Content": "Thank you all for all your advice;I truly appreciate your kindness in taking the time to help me muddle through these tough choices. - Part of my reason for wanting to wait at least another year is due to my search for employment. My employment insurance is just about up and it may affect both my job search and potential to be hired if I am subject to physical and emotional side-effects of an radical prostatectomy. Ottawa is a government town and I've applied for several government jobs and am currently in a pool for 2 of them. Even though health care is covered in Canada, a government job would offer insurance for medications, good coverage for any time I was laid up, an atmosphere that is tolerant of health concerns and additional life-insurance for my family. - My second reason to give it more time is that I've heard that most prostate cancers with a Gleason score of 6 or lower are relatively slow growing and that many people receive more aggressive treatment than is necessary. I also question the potential for human error. Now my pathology report has been confirmed by 2 doctors so the chances of an outright misdiagnosis of cancer cells is probably extremely low. However, there must be a margin between Gleason 2 and Gleason 3 that is open for interpretation. In those cases, I would think that the tendency would be to take what is considered to be the \"safe route\" and go with the higher score. Perhaps I am grasping at straws, and I do maintain a certain degree of skepticism of \"miracle cures\" but my thinking is there would be very little to lose by trying a program similar to what Dean Ornish recommends. {link deleted per Forum Policy} - Admittedly this one may also fall into the \"grasping straws\" category, but every year improvements seem to be made in treatments. Suppose my cancer and PSA is stable after a year and I give it a couple more years. Who knows what advances may be made in such things as robotic surgery over that time? -And my final and probably most import reason for giving it at least another year, is just to have one more year \"intact\".

      "Content": "Hi, About 2 weeks ago I was diagnosed with prostate cancer. Age: 52 Gleason: 6 from 2 samples out of 12 both at 30% Last PSA: 7.4 I've spoken to my family doctor and he seems to feel that watchful waiting may be an option. I haven't even heard from my urologist. I phoned the office to get a copy of the pathology report. The receptionist told me that I can fax in any questions. Now, as of this week, he's on vacation and my next appointment isn't until mid-August. I would have appreciated at least getting a phone call. The extremely strong opinions regarding the various treatment options causes me a certain amount of frustration. It seems that each option is connected with it's own unique potentially frightening scenario. I'm going through a range of emotions. I also lost my job earlier this year (due to an industry-wide slowdown) and this feels like another way that I'm failing my family. On a realistic level I realize that is not fair to myself, but my wife and I have worked hard all our lives with the goal of a comfortable retirement and now I feel that this situation may be unfair to her. By the way, she has been very supportive. Anyway, before I get too boring, I'll get to the point. Other than the negative psychological aspects of this condition, I feel remarkably healthy and have a good quality of life. I'm strongly leaning toward the \"watchful waiting\" option for at least a year. I'm afraid that my urologist will push for surgery but I don't want to be rushed or pressured into anything. I've already started on a plant-based diet with the inclusion of omega-3 rich fish. Eating lots of soy products, tomato juice and adding some beneficial supplements. I plan to ask the urologist if Avodart may be appropriate in my case. One of the most annoying things is that this diagnosis is like a nasty dark cloud following me everywhere. It's the last thing on my mind before going to sleep, the first thing on my mind when I wake up and it invades all of my thoughts. The only thing that seems to distract me is to get into a natural environment by kayaking or biking or getting together with friends or family. Any advice regarding treatment options and dealing with the psychological factors would be appreciated.",

      "Content": "Thanks again for the advice, all of which I consider useful and sensible. I'll toss out a few more questions as maybe some on this forum have the answers. - Is there nothing to the Ornish study (listed in the link in my previous post) which has been published in some recognized medical publications and claims that folks with Gleason< 6 and PSA < 10 can stabilize or even reverse prostate cancer? Has anyone, who met the prerequisites, tried this plan and found it failed? Is the study flawed or even worse, a hoax? I'm not asking these questions rhetorically. - Why is it that radical prostatectomy has to be so radical? For example, since the prostate and therefore the cancer is removed why do men have to also take testosterone suppressing hormones or even castration? It just seems that one jumps from \"watchful waiting\", where very little intervention is done, into the other extreme of the treatment spectrum. - Has anyone heard of or looked into High Intensity Focused Ultrasound (HIFU). {link deleted} - I'm dealing with depression. Part of the problem is that I was laid off earlier this year due to a work shortage and my profession is rapidly becoming obsolete due to outsourcing and advances in technology. I have a very specific skill set that does not easily transfer to other fields and I sense that there is a certain reluctance to hire (especially if training is involved) someone in their 50s. Of course, this makes things a little tight financially but we've managed our finances over the years and can get by on my wife's salary. However, the problem is that this leaves me too much time to \"think\". I'm considering volunteering with a hospice. I figure that this will allow me to interact with other volunteers, focus on something other than myself, make positive use of this experience by allowing me to better relate to what some of the clients are experiencing and improve my self-worth by doing something important and worthwhile. Has anyone done something similar? Is this a wise course of action or might an environment such as this have the reverse effect of what I'm intending? - Any other advice for depression? My family doctor has recommended a physiologist and I'll look into that. I will also pass on what I have found that helps: getting into nature (woods, water) by either cycling, hiking or kayaking, exercise (once I motivate myself, which is harder when depressed), walking and listening to positive motivational speakers (eg. Brian Tracy, Zig Ziglar) on my mp3 player, and socializing with friends and family.",
