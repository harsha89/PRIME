As I understand it, long term Hormone Therapy increases the possibility of bone fractures and dementia? The removal of my prostate Nov 2015 also damaged nerves to the extent that an erection is just not happening plus I am about to turn 70 so not a big deal to me. The list of side effects associated with Hormone Therapy is a long one and is a big deal to me. I assumed that a medical castration would eliminate the negative side affects. Cancer is already after my bones and the hormone therapy is after them too. My thought was to reduce the total side affect load by eliminating the negative side affects of Hormone Therapy. I discussed the option with my Medical Oncologist, His reply \"Hormone Therapy\" or \"Surgical Castration\", side effects for both are identical due to the testosterone reduction. I cannot find any information to confirm the Med. Oncologist statement. Any help would be appreciated. Thanks in Advance Petzelhead",

Note: As part of the preparation for the Nov 2015 prostate removal surgery, Lexington Medical Center did a full body MRI and a Bone Scan, both of these tests did not show any indication that the cancer had spread beyond the prostrate.
