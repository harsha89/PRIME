      "Content": "Originally Posted by HighlanderCFH Welcome aboard diceman, Based on your post-op staging and your pre-op PSA, you stand a great chance of having been completely cured. We'll all be waiting for that first post-op PSA. Good luck! Chuck Hi all, Last week had the 12 week follow up at MSK with surgeon on 8/31 and had PSA tested. PSA was 0.05 and was relieved. Doc said to come back in 6 months to continue testing for awhile. Seems both \"libido\" and \"continence' about 70%-80%. Still get sore with a little rectal discomfort when sitting too long or being bounced around in the car. All told, I was blessed to find this cancerous nodule incidentally from hip MRI.",
