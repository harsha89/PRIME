      "Content": "Hi, I posted earlier about a variable PSA, 4Kscore of 12% for aggressive prostate cancer. Now I'm asking about the MRI fusion biopsy. My urologist called me last night with the 4KScore result, said she \"felt\" something and thought I should go ahead and biopsy. I'm 68, last biopsy was nine years ago -- negative. I asked her about some sort of targeted biopsy and she hemmed and hawed and said a regular biopsy would be sufficient. I set about getting an appointment at another hospital that I knew did the MRI fusion. However, in the course of my research, I see that the hospital I'm going to is announcing they do the MRI fusion biopsy ! Obviously I wasn't at my best getting the news from my urologist at home, hoping it would be over, but I really don't know why she's not talking about the fusion biopsy. She said something about insurance maybe not paying -- I have medicare and a good blue cross policy, but I wouldn't think that should be the doctor's concern. So, does anyone know the downside to an MRI fusion biopsy, or why a doctor wouldn't want it ? I'm going to try to just get an appointment with her to discuss this. I really like her, but I am curious as to not wanting MRI fusion biopsy. If she gives me good reasons, that's fine, but as I said, I wasn't at my best getting the bad news in the evening. Thanks,",

      "Content": "Hi, I'm 68 years old. Have had PSA issues for years, rising as high as 9.5 and dropping. Had biopsy in 2005 negative. Last PSA was 4.5, free PSA 30%, so I thought I'd have an easy visit. in-out (ha). Urologist felt \"something\" in DRE, so she scheduled the 4Kscore test. She just called me and said it was 12%, indicating a 1 in 8 risk of aggressive PC. So I have another biopsy coming up. Naturally, I'm nervous, and the idea of aggressive PC has me concerned. In the back of my mind I had thought I'd look at radiation or something less drastic than surgery. I'm wondering if that's still an option with aggressive PC. And forgive me, I guess I'm nervous, I should probably wait till I get the biopsy results. So thanks for listening. Ed",

      "Content": "Highlander and Michael, Thanks for your comments. Just as an FYI, the 4Kscore is supposed to be the newest, most reliable test. Good idea to invest in the company. A score of 12% means I have roughly a 12% chance of having an aggressive PC. Studies indicate its pretty accurate. If it had been under 7%, urologist would have said no biopsy. She wasn't big on a targeted biopsy I'll see what I can find out. But thanks, both of you, for your answers. I'll be scheduling the biopsy tomorrow. Ed",

      "Content": "Ron G. , Thanks. I'm doing a bit more research and I see that a local, excellent hospital offers a guided biopsy. I've asked for an appointment with them to discuss. I like my doctor, but its my health. The local hospital is famous but I've avoided them because we've had some limited experience with the place and their attitude toward patients was awful. One time we asked to see my wife's records and they said, \"Dr. will decide if you can see them.\" Yeah, my answer was more pleasant than I'd have liked since we did like the doctor. But they might have changed since then. Don't know if I made it clear, but the 4KScore is the hottest test going, now, supposedly highly predictive. If the score had been 7% or under, my urologist would have not suggested a biopsy. At 12% it indicates a 12% chance of aggressive prostate cancer. Not awful odds, but based on my age and health, good justification for a biopsy. Thanks again, Ed",
