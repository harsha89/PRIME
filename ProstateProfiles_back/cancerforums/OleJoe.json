      "Content": "My PSA had risen from .4 to 10 over the last 3 years. I'm 70 years old with a strong family history of PC, my father had it and had radical surgery years ago as did his brother, my brother had it and had the Divici 3 years ago. I had a 12 core biopsy Monday and I'm waiting to see what the results will be. I'm expecting the worst but praying for the best. When I asked my Urologist if they did the seed implant therapy, he said that was old school and he no longer did it. When I asked what he did, he said beam radiation. I ask if that was Proton therapy? He said no and went into a long story of how Proton therapy was a gimmick. When I ask about Robotic therapy, he said it was only high grade radical therapy. My brother's surgery went well and continues to be ok but his surgeon has retired. I left the urologists office with an understanding that Proton therapy was a poster child for beam radiation therapy and robotic therapy was the poster child for radical surgery. And these guys wonder why we have such a time trying to decide on which therapy we wish to proceed with? A friend gave me the book \" You Can Beat Prostate Cancer And you can do it without surgery\". While reading the book I found this site listed as a resource and I have certainly used it to research what I know but it's what I don't know that I need to know that concerns me. This is a great site!",
