He is not compliant with PSA testing and bases his behavior on what he sites as very unlikely to progress based on the science. I have included a link which actually is supportive of Active Surveillance. However the first two bullet points have significant relevance to your situation. If your pathology is accurate it would place you in an extremely uncommon position. One possibility could be that you are one of the very rare people that have biological grade progression, Gleason 3 cells giving rise to Gleason 4 or 5 progeny. As noted in the attached document this can occur overtime but is very uncommon. Did you have a second opinion on your pathology? I did not have an official second opinion (4+3-7) but it would be a consideration given the situation that you find yourself in. Good Luck, Very interesting, please keep updating http://prostatecancerinfolink.net/20...lated-factors/",
