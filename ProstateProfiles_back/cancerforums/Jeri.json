He had 1 year of active surveillance - 2nd biopsy this spring (2015) shows of 13 samples taken 3 were Gleason of 3 +3 =6 and 1 is 3+4 = 7. Bone scan - good, no lymphovascular invasion and no extraprostatic extension BUT has Perineural invasion identified. Now he will be going for prostatectomy in October or November and then radiation following. I'm guessing this Perineural invasion is not a good thing. I have alot of questions when we see the dr. on Sept 28. Scared to death now",

      "Content": "so my husbands surgery went well on October 27 . Pathology report says more cancer than initially thought but it was confined. First PSA test today was 0.04. That's good, right? What number should we start worrying about if it gets higher. I could ask Dr. these questions but that's not for a week - Thank you - Jeri from Vancouver (ps - still lots of uncontrollable bladder - he's very frustrated about that - especially now thats hes going back to work Feb 9)",
