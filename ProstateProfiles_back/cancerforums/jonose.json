    "Content": "Psa has been rising over past decade. I'm 55 and have had 2 biopsies, both negative. My psa went from 8.9 to 14 in last 6 months. Urologist put me on Proscar (Finasteride) for next 6 months and scheduled another psa in feb/2013. Wants to see if psa decreases. Is this the best choice? or should I seek out a third biopsy?",
