      "Content": "Originally Posted by trb6814 Thanks gentlemen. Doc is suggesting repeat biopsy (20 core) in December (one year). I think I'll get a second free PSA test now before agreeing to the second biopsy, since I've only had one and the results weren't good. I'd like to know if that was an aberration or continues to be problematic as the repeated tests (PSA, PCA3) are going in the right direction. Just received my latest PSA, 3.28, down from 3.4 in June. I remain hesitant to get the 20 core biopsy, when my PSA is in retreat. I plan on a free PSA and PCA3 beginning of November. If both of those numbers are stable I will really be hesitant. Anyone still feel strongly that I need the biopsy or will need if the next tests are good? I'm feeling like I might be a case study for the whole over under treatment debate.",

      "Content": "I'm 55 years old and had PSA rise from 2.9 to 4.0 to 4.7 over two year period. referred to urologist and had Free PSA = 8 and PCA3 = 10. Mixed results, so had 12core biopsy last November. Results were 11 cores clean and 1 core less than 1% suspicious cells. On active surveliance since, quarterly doc visits first in March. March PSA -2.9, PCA3 - 18, so far so good. Just had June check-in PSA 3.4 (had sex the day before, whoops). Haven't gotten PCA3 results yet. All DRE's to date normal but prostate is slightly enlarged. Doc wants to do repeat 20 core biopsy in November (1 year). Says I should be treated as if I have PCa. I wonder given the decent tests results and if follow-up results are good in September, if a November repeat biopsy is necessary or an overly agressive treatment? My grandfather did die of untreated PCa at 73, no other family history and good longevity overall, although father died young of other causes. Clearly if any of the tests elevate then of course, but what if they remain positive? Anyone have any advice or experienced anything similar? Thanks",
