      "Content": "Hi guys, I am 67 years old in the UK. Being treated at the Freeman hospital in Newcastle Upon Tyne. My PSA history October 2012 was 13.2 rising from a figure of 4, 6 months earlier. Biopsy confirmed my cancer. Robotic surgery March 13 post PSA of 0.05 only stable for 3 months then a steady increase over 12 months to 0.1. I understand that a doubling of PSA following prostatectomy indicates a worsening outlook?",

      "Content": "Hi, my medical history is :- Robotic prostatectomy in March 2013, pathology demonstrating Gleason 3+4, stage pT2+ NX MX prostate cancer with incomplete local excision and a tumour volumn of 3.14cc. No lymph node or seminal vessel involvement. Post operative PSA fell to 0.05ug/l although increased to 0.1ug/l on surveillance when checked in February 2014. Salvage radio therapy to the prostate bed 66Gy delivered in 33 fractions over 6 and a half week period, completed May 2014. PSA surveillance July, Sept, December 2014. June, September 2015 all readings 0.04. January 2016 0.07. Hope this helps, much appreciated.",

      "Content": "Thankyou MF. In the UK unless you have private medical insurance (I do not) you are reliant on our National health service and as such you have less personal imput into your treatment plan than you guys in the US. I have mentioned clinical trials to my urologist and apparently there is nothing appropriate for my situation at the moment. I will certainly push to be referred back to my oncologist if there is an upward trend to my PSA. All the best",

Do I need to wait for three successive rises (as my dr suggests) or be looking to be more proactive. My Gleason was 3+4 with a T2c. Positive margins but no seminal or lymph node involvement.
