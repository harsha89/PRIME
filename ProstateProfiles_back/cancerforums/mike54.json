      "Content": "I went to see my urologist today for a consult about the biopsy results cancer is on the right side 4 sample cores positive 3+3+6, the other 8 samples are negitive urologist said this is very low risk so now I'm deciding radiation or active surveillance. My urologist sent the samples to oncotypedx then we'll have another consult about those results. http://www.oncotypedx.com/ It's just more waiting but it's not the wondering how bad is it it's just gathering more information to go with the best treatment thanks for the support and place to get information",

      "Content": "I have an consult visit coming with my urologist concerning my biopsy results, He did confirm I have cancer in the early stage and we'll go over numbers and treatment options Tuesday. I have been reading different books and reading a lot on the forum and a couple other web sites but still have a few questions 1) do I need a 2 opinion? How do I bring up a 2nd opinion? 2) Where do go for a 2nd opinion? 3) I'm in the Chicago area there is a couple cancer centers close by Cancer center of America, The Kellogg cancer center, Robert H Lurie comprehensive cancer center (not really interested in this because its downtown Chicago) and I'm sure there are more. Has anyone been to any of these or others? any other questions I need to ask? Thanks for any help.",
