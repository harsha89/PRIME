      "Content": "Hi - I'm new to the reluctant brotherhood. I've read a lot of posts, and find them very helpful. I'm 59, and was diagnosed in January w/ Gleason 7, 3+4. 5 out of 12 cores are positive, with one of them (Gleason 6 core showing 70% cancer.) I had a 2nd pathology report prepared at Weill Cornell in NYC, and it showed that of the 2 cores that included Gleason 4, that only 5% was Gleason 4. One core was 50% cancer, and the other was 30%. My PSA went from 2.01 in 2014 to 4.7 in April 2017, and 5.1 in December 2017. However, I take Finasteride (which not only stopped hair loss, it actually helped me to regrow my hair a bit), and that lowers PSA. I've been told that it's probably double, which would put it at around 10. I saw a surgeon at Weill Cornell - Dr. Jim Hu. He's done over 4k laparoscopic robotic prostatectomies. My wife and I liked him. Then, I saw a radiologist at NYU Langone. He was forthright, and said that surgery was my best option because if cancer returns, I can do radiation later. My GP then referred me to Dr. Ash Tewari at Mt. Sinai. I saw him this week, and have been leaning toward having him do the surgery until I saw a few negative reviews from the recent past. I know it's a big decision, and I'm not sure of the exact way to choose someone. I've read most of Dr. Walsh's book, and it helped a lot. We have good insurance, and I'm a subway ride away from some of the top surgeons and facilities. That said, how many do I visit? How do I know which is the right one? Thank you for your thoughts.",

Comforting on one hand, but at the same time - this sure ain't run of the mill to me!! Guys - I had no idea that anyone other than the surgeon may be doing all or part of the surgery!
