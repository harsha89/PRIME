I appreciate the helpful tips, especially regarding diet, as Dave is having his first radiation treatment today. We have been thinking about how we will have to make some changes...he loves to eat and I love to cook. He will definitely miss the fruits and vegetables. And maybe having to cut out nuts, which is his favorite nibble food. I have read a lot of conflicting diet stuff...like bananas ok, bananas not ok, but one consistent suggestion was smaller frequent meals. Is your husband a coffee drinker? Or alcohol?

      "Content": "Hi there OTS, we also share your frustration. That ticking inside feels like a big time bomb to you, but merely a little stopwatch to others. Unfortunately those others are the ones who you are relying on to push the start button. So sorry for all the delays and runarounds, and no I don't think you are being impatient or have unreasonable expectations. Glad you can vent here. We're finding that waiting for each phase...the first visit, the 2nd PSA test, scheduling the biopsy, waiting for the biopsy, waiting for the call with results, waiting for follow up appoint to discuss options, and now waiting for someone to call back to start the scheduling for surgery process. Waiting really sucks. Hope you get on an expedient and positive track!",

      "Content": "Busby, sorry you are having this discomfort. Seven weeks does seem like quite a while. But we are recalling that Dave also had lingering perineal pain, and we even posted here about it, at his 2-1/2 week post RALP. It seems like some guys don't have too much soreness, and for those that do, it seems to ease up sooner than what Dave experienced. We got him a cheapo inflatable donut cushion which was a big relief, while it lasted, about 2 weeks. At that point, the pain was sort of easing up a bit, so he just thought he'd tough it out a little longer. After another week without the cushion, he was still very uncomfortable, so we splurged and ordered a very nice cushion, which was wonderful. He was finally able to sit not only on the couch, but also hard benches and chairs. It was probably around 8 weeks when he was able to go \"solo\". We had mentioned this pain to his doctor, who said it wasn't one of the more common issues, but it does happen...no real explanation though. Dave was also one of the minority who continued to have pain after the catheter came out. Most guys say \"what a relief\" but Dave had quite some hurt in the penis for several more weeks. His Uro was very big on communicating ANYthing that bothered Dave, and we took him up on that. It was reassuring to hear back from him, and also to hear from other PC brothers about their experiences. Good luck, Busby...hope you get some relief soon. Barb",

      "Content": "One thing Dave and I have learned, is that any and all feelings have a place in our journey...be they light or dark. We have all experienced loss in one way or another. Watching a spouse suffer and lose a cancer struggle, or experiencing our own cancer struggle we lose something too, our hopes what we thought our future might be. Grief is felt in different ways, processed in different ways. There is the anger, the denial, the bargaining, the acceptance. And then HOPE again and some joy. Some of us get there faster than others. Some take a step or two and then maybe falter. I really like this group. The practical information is so valuable. The camaraderie and support are comforting. It hurts me sometimes to read of the struggles, but it also inspires me. I appreciate this particular post very much. Made me realize we all are facing some scary stuff...some might be brave facing sobering stats and some might be frightened facing less. Would I ever compare my late husband's bravery facing stage 4 lung cancer to how Dave is feeling facing his own prostate cancer struggles? Never. Never would I tell him not to feel scared or depressed...those are HIS feelings and I respect that. And especially would I not tell him that his cancer isn't as severe as someone else's. I appreciate how everyone here is comfortable sharing their opinions. Sometimes responses can be terse, sometimes I see tough love. But I want to believe it's all compassionate. What I hope to do is show Dave what Dennis has written. If there are dark parts, that is reality not to ignore but to accept, and makes embracing the light ever more wonderful. Guess I had to let loose some steam! Anxiety has been abundant for us, but today we did get some great news: Bone Scan is normal, nothing there!",

      "Content": "That is awesome, so happy for you! Sounds like your being in great shape ahead of the surgery paved the way for a good recovery. Dave is also an avid cyclist, and just about 3 weeks behind you. I sure hope he can return to his passion soon too...but for now he can barely sit comfortably on a donut cushion. He is not to good with patience. But your spirited success will inspire him! Good job and wishing you continued recovery progress. Barb",

      "Content": "Hello, we are new members and appreciate being able to read these very informative posts, as we begin on this cancer journey. We have our followup appointment with the urologist on 7/25/18 to discuss the options after the cancer diagnosis from Dave's recent biopsy. Dave had not seen a doctor for quite a few years, so finally had a physical in May. Elevated PSA of 10.7 was referred to urologist. Uro's DRE said prostate felt normal, so ordered a second PSA with free%. This PSA came back at 16.4. Uro scheduled biopsy, which came back with 4 of 12 cores positive. Uro said his was in Grade Group 3, and \"100% curable\". He said Dave is a good candidate for surgery, but also wants him to talk with a RadOnc and gave us a referral. That appt. is for 8/6/18. We just received the path report today, and noticed that one of the samples, a G7(4+3) mentioned \"perineural invasion present\". Quick bit of research shows some upsetting information, such as \"nerve sparing NOT recommended\", higher rate for mets, recommendation for surgery PLUS radiation, or radiation PLUS HT. Uro did not mention this on the initial diagnosis phone call, but I imagine he will address this at the appointment. Any thoughts or suggestions on what we should be thinking about or what to ask, will be appreciated. Trying to get our heads around everything, certainly a whirlwind. It's frightening to hear the C word. We've only just been together for 4 years, having lost our spouses both to cancer ten+ years ago. Thank you so much, Barb",

If you haven't already, get a copy of the 4th ed. of Walsh's book (see the Sticky Post on books for details). If you are given a choice between surgery and radiation treatment it means that the best option for some is not the best for others, i.e., there is no \"right\" answer that fits everyone-- just a right answer for you. Most guys have a finding of PNI (perineural invasion) in the path report that looks at a whole prostate removed at surgery, and its importance is usually downplayed. A finding of PNI in the biopsy is a subject of debate. Here is one recent paper Should reporting of peri-neural invasion and extra prostatic extension be mandatory in prostate cancer biopsies? correlation with outcome in biopsy cases treated conservatively [2018, Full Text] https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5945501/ The Abstract concludes: However another paper concludes otherwise: Perineural Invasion and Risk of Lethal Prostate Cancer [2017] http://cebp.aacrjournals.org/content...65.EPI-16-0237 Some papers say PNI is a prognosticator of positive margins at surgery; others say there is no correlation.

See what other Forum brothers have to say, keep your appointments, and let us know as you get more information. The surgeon might tell you something like he can probably spare the nerve bundle on the right, but he's not sure about the left and will have to make a decision at the time of surgery, if that is your treatment option. Or he might tell you something else A highly experienced surgeon is important for any RP; it goes without saying it is more important in difficult cases. See what the RO has to say, and ask about likely ED outcomes. (Erections are still possible if only one nerve bundle is spared in surgery). Remember, we're not doctors, but we will support you 100%.

I imagine each of you has experienced pretty much the same kind of emotions that Dave is feeling, so your reassurances are really helpful. It's helping me too. Before his biopsy I came here and read a bunch of threads so we felt very prepared, and not too anxious. I hope I can report on a good appointment Wednesday, when Dave gets an idea of what's next.

      "Content": "Dave's RALP on 9/17 went pretty well. He was first surgery of the day, 7:30am, so there wasn't a whole lot of anxiety-filled time waiting...at least for him. I was so antsy until I got the call at 11:30am that they were closing him up, and Dr would be out soon. I had witnessed many families in the waiting area being visited by their surgeon and heard many \" he did great\" reports. So when I got the call that Dr wanted to see me in the private consult room I was terrified. 30 nervous minutes later, Dr reassured me that all went well, except for a lot of unexpected scar tissue and adhesions around the bowel area. Since he has never had abdominal surgery we finally decided it must be from a few diverticulitis flares. This slowed the surgery down a bit. He said he was able to spare nerves on right, but left side not, due to more involvement. He said urethra was nice and long & tight so he felt that was good sign for better continence. Recovery has been excellent. Dave started walking within just a few hours, no nausea, no spasms, minimal pain. Eating, pooping, moving pretty much like normal. Catheter is mild annoyance, but he has graciously allowed me to empty the bag, clean the tube, and apply bacitryn to the tip. So all was going along pretty good. Dr. called this morning with path report info. Good news: lymph nodes and margins negative. Bad news Gleason upgraded from 7(4+3) to 9. He said we will discuss more at appointment next week when catheter is removed. He is scheduling a bone scan, and then decide next steps. It hit us hard, realizing what we thought was an intermediate threat, to one more advanced. That's all we can get our heads around right now, will know more soon I guess. We will try to keep focusing on the good news, at least we have that. This afternoon we played our music...first time he has held his guitar since Sunday...it was good to see him find comfort and pleasure. Grateful for that, and a reminder that no matter what, we can and should remember to find those kind of moments...always there.",

I imagine each of you has experienced pretty much the same kind of emotions that Dave is feeling, so your reassurances are really helpful. It's helping me too. Before his biopsy I came here and read a bunch of threads so we felt very prepared, and not too anxious. I hope I can report on a good appointment Wednesday, when Dave gets an idea of what's next.

      "Content": "Dave's RALP on 9/17 went pretty well. He was first surgery of the day, 7:30am, so there wasn't a whole lot of anxiety-filled time waiting...at least for him. I was so antsy until I got the call at 11:30am that they were closing him up, and Dr would be out soon. I had witnessed many families in the waiting area being visited by their surgeon and heard many \" he did great\" reports. So when I got the call that Dr wanted to see me in the private consult room I was terrified. 30 nervous minutes later, Dr reassured me that all went well, except for a lot of unexpected scar tissue and adhesions around the bowel area. Since he has never had abdominal surgery we finally decided it must be from a few diverticulitis flares. This slowed the surgery down a bit. He said he was able to spare nerves on right, but left side not, due to more involvement. He said urethra was nice and long & tight so he felt that was good sign for better continence. Recovery has been excellent. Dave started walking within just a few hours, no nausea, no spasms, minimal pain. Eating, pooping, moving pretty much like normal. Catheter is mild annoyance, but he has graciously allowed me to empty the bag, clean the tube, and apply bacitryn to the tip. So all was going along pretty good. Dr. called this morning with path report info. Good news: lymph nodes and margins negative. Bad news Gleason upgraded from 7(4+3) to 9. He said we will discuss more at appointment next week when catheter is removed. He is scheduling a bone scan, and then decide next steps. It hit us hard, realizing what we thought was an intermediate threat, to one more advanced. That's all we can get our heads around right now, will know more soon I guess. We will try to keep focusing on the good news, at least we have that. This afternoon we played our music...first time he has held his guitar since Sunday...it was good to see him find comfort and pleasure. Grateful for that, and a reminder that no matter what, we can and should remember to find those kind of moments...always there.",

      "Content": "Dave had surgery on a Mon morning, so had smaller-than-usual meals on Saturday and Sunday, but it was just his normal kind of food..I believe on Sunday night we just had clam chowder and some toast. That first night in the hospital they gave him broth and popsicles, next morning scrambled eggs, grits, toast juice. Came home that day, and he was very hungry, so had some homemade beef vegetable soup, which he ate several more occasions, as well as some other soups. For a week or so supper usually was easy-to-digest meals like Swedish turkey meatballs/gravy, mashed potatoes, Mac&cheese, baked fish or chicken. For veggies he had cooked carrots or squash, small salad, but stayed away from stuff like broccoli since he was having gas issues. Breakfast was eggs and whole grain toast, melon. He drank LOTS of water, herbal tea, decaf coffee. Regular stool softener pills! He was several days before he had 1st bm, and was pretty uncomfortable, but then had no issues. And back to regular diet very soon after that. His Uro surgeon just said take it easy, like no spicy bean burritos. Just whatever he felt up to eating. Good luck to you!",

      "Content": "Debby, I'm so sorry about your husband's situation. It can be such a frightening time for you both. But it can also be a very special time, a time that you find a closeness and bonding like never before. I feel I can say this to you, as I lost my first husband to lung cancer, so we traveled a journey similar to yours. There were sad moments, there were also so many beautiful moments, that we experienced together. Not everyone gets the precious gift of time (of knowing time together is limited), so we were able to do meaningful things, to say meaningful things, to just appreciate the meaning. I hope you will have that too. I feel I can also suggest to you to please consider contacting Hospice. My wonderful new husband Dave and I are Hospice Volunteer musicians. Dave & I both lost our spouses to cancer, but because they were Hospice patients, we knew they were being cared for with compassion and quality palliative skills. As Hospice volunteers, we see how the doctors, nurses, and our fellow volunteers are able to help patients and families. Support is offered in so many ways...most important is comfort for the patient, with medication and medical equipment like hospital bed, oxygen, etc. But also guidance with making arrangements, finding caregiver help, assistance with chores, respite care, a gentle shoulder to cry on. Dave and I are honored to be able to play music which, helps soothe and brings back nice memories. I wish we could play you guys some music, as I see you are in the same generation as us, and probably would like some of our tunes. Maybe you can dig up some old albums from the 60's and 70's and have a little flashback party. That's something that us hospice volunteers are good at, helping folks share memories and good times. I hope you might be able to contact your local Hospice and see what they are able to offer you. Hospice eligibility requires your doctor to determine a life expectancy of usually less than six months. Unfortunately it seems many families wait too long, so that the wonderful benefits of hospice are for only a few days. That was the mistake I made, as he only lived for 5 days after hospice started. Dave's wife was on hospice for several months, and he says that her time on hospice was so meaningful. Dave has recently been diagnosed with PCa, so as a wife, I can understand your fear and confusion. Some how we find the ability to be strong. In my case, the love was and is, so powerful. Hope you can focus on that same kind of love, it will give you the strength you will need. Take good care of you.",

      "Content": "Hi Keith, glad to hear you are having a good recovery from RP. Your stats have some similarities to Dave's. He had RP in September 2018, and then started ART in Feb 2019. Today he completed his 24th of 33 rads. So far, so good. After his first post-rp psa (undetectable) in Jan, his urologist still recommended a meet with a RadOnc, to discuss adjuvant radiation or possible salvage radiation down the road. We met with the RO and went over the pros and cons of acting now with a preemptive strike/potential cure or wait and hope and be ready to strike if necessary. Dave's high psa prior to RP, high upgraded gleason, high decipher and EPE were all factors which led him to decide to treat now. Added bonus, by starting ART now his RO does not recommend ADT. Like any treatment choice, it was personal, agonizing, and a gamble. But once the decision was made, Dave started feeling hopeful again. Keith, we wish you continued good healing, undetectable psa, and clear choices for your future health. And also we wish to thank you for your service. I hope the VA is treating you with the utmost care and respect. My first husband passed away from Agent Orange related cancers...there were a lot extra resources that were available, but we had to really search. Barb",

I hope the VA is treating you with the utmost care and respect. My first husband passed away from Agent Orange related cancers...there were a lot extra resources that were available, but we had to really search. Barb",

      "Content": "Dave had his last adjuvant radiation treatment today...completed 33 sessions. He did amazingly well, with the only issue being occasional fatigue the last 3 weeks. It was mostly mild, except for a few times when he simply overdid it with exercise. Follow up with RO in 3 weeks, and will find out then what the PSA test schedule will be. Best wishes to those of you going thru or facing possible ART/salvage RT, hang in there, that light at the end of the tunnel will get bright before you know it. Few tips that worked for Dave: 9am appt time worked best for him as it gave him plenty of time to have empty colon and full bladder. Full bladder was uncomfortable, but we found that NO caffeine helped, as well as wearing pants with loose waistband. Earlier and smaller suppers with easier to digest stuff, light on veggies and fiber. He got sent home just one day because of non-empty colon, so he made sure that didn't happen again. He also said it was helpful having me go each time so he didn't have to stress about driving and parking. Now on to the next old-person issue: skin cancer on his forehead. But tonight we celebrate! He is craving Mexican and is looking forward to some bean burritos and margaritas.",

      "Content": "We think Dave is on a fairly decent recovery schedule from RALP on 9/17/18, at least from what we've read and heard about others' recoveries. The only thing that doesn't seem to be showing any improvement, is soreness in the perineum area. There is no discoloring or swelling, and equipment looks normal. But he says it's pretty sore, to the point he can't even sit on a pillow. He does appreciate having the recliner brought in, but can't sit upright in it. After about a week, I said I was going to get him a donut cushion, but Mr. Frugal said he was sure he'd be past that soon. Today, it's still at the same level of soreness/discomfort as it was initially, so now he's open to the idea of getting a donut. But I'm wondering if this lingering soreness is still to be expected for a good while after RALP? Thanks for sharing experience and advice.",

      "Content": "Debby, I'm so sorry about your husband's situation. It can be such a frightening time for you both. But it can also be a very special time, a time that you find a closeness and bonding like never before. I feel I can say this to you, as I lost my first husband to lung cancer, so we traveled a journey similar to yours. There were sad moments, there were also so many beautiful moments, that we experienced together. Not everyone gets the precious gift of time (of knowing time together is limited), so we were able to do meaningful things, to say meaningful things, to just appreciate the meaning. I hope you will have that too. I feel I can also suggest to you to please consider contacting Hospice. My wonderful new husband Dave and I are Hospice Volunteer musicians. Dave & I both lost our spouses to cancer, but because they were Hospice patients, we knew they were being cared for with compassion and quality palliative skills. As Hospice volunteers, we see how the doctors, nurses, and our fellow volunteers are able to help patients and families. Support is offered in so many ways...most important is comfort for the patient, with medication and medical equipment like hospital bed, oxygen, etc. But also guidance with making arrangements, finding caregiver help, assistance with chores, respite care, a gentle shoulder to cry on. Dave and I are honored to be able to play music which, helps soothe and brings back nice memories. I wish we could play you guys some music, as I see you are in the same generation as us, and probably would like some of our tunes. Maybe you can dig up some old albums from the 60's and 70's and have a little flashback party. That's something that us hospice volunteers are good at, helping folks share memories and good times. I hope you might be able to contact your local Hospice and see what they are able to offer you. Hospice eligibility requires your doctor to determine a life expectancy of usually less than six months. Unfortunately it seems many families wait too long, so that the wonderful benefits of hospice are for only a few days. That was the mistake I made, as he only lived for 5 days after hospice started. Dave's wife was on hospice for several months, and he says that her time on hospice was so meaningful. Dave has recently been diagnosed with PCa, so as a wife, I can understand your fear and confusion. Some how we find the ability to be strong. In my case, the love was and is, so powerful. Hope you can focus on that same kind of love, it will give you the strength you will need. Take good care of you.",

      "Content": "Dave's recovery from 9/17/18 RALP has gone pretty well, overall...with now only minor stress incontinence, but 100% ED. We are still hoping for improvements. He had his first PSA at 3 mos. resulting in \"undetectable\" <1. Urologist was pleased with that, but still referred him to RadOnc, whom we met with yesterday. Uro & RadOnc are recommending adjuvant radiation, due to the high Gleason (4+5)9, extraprostic extension, and genetic indications. We had figured radiation would be in his future at some point, so this treatment plan was not totally unexpected. We just had hoped it might be a bit further down the road. However, we are both in agreement not to mess around waiting, so will get started on this next phase of journey. RO has an MRI scheduled, as well as another PSA. Those findings will indicate if HT might also be needed. While Dave is not thrilled about the radiation, the HT fills him with dread. Question for you guys: we were told that where ever Dave is as far as incontinence and ED, that progress will be \"frozen\" with the introduction of radiation. What we read seems to confirm this, but we would appreciate hearing if others perhaps had some more positive results to report? Dave's ok if he's fated to wearing a little pad forever, but he was really hoping he might eventually see some ED improvement. Thanks so much, we appreciate being able to read and share in everyone's experiences. Barb",

They didn't sound too encouraging, is about all we remember. Although the RO spent a good bit of time with us, it seemed like there was so much he wanted to go over, and it was a lot to take in.

      "Content": "Hi DM. Dave's profile is very similar to yours...he's a bit older than you (68.) He had RALP last Sept. with first two followup PSA undetectable. However, based on his path, decipher and high psa going in, his Uro wanted him to meet with a RadOnc to discuss adjuvant radiation. After reviewing statistics Dave opted to keep hitting hard. RadOnc did not see need to include ADT at this time. So on 2/18/19 Dave had his first of 33 radiation treatments. He goes every morning Mon-Fri. We are fortunate to live close to the cancer center. I drive him and stay with him, which he appreciates, as it takes away a bit of stress. Starting off was simple enough he said. They did a \"simulation\" appt a week prior to his first actual zap. That took several hours and involved CT scans and proper positioning. They had him drink a quantity of water to see how much was needed to get his bladder at the proper fullness. And explained that he would need to have a full bladder and empty colon for each treatment. (This helps to move those organs away from the target zap area) It took Dave some trial and error to get the fluid/bladder timing down right. They do a scan before every zap to make sure he is appropriately full and empty. One time his colon wasn't empty so they sent him home. (Will make up that session at the end) and one time bladder not full enough so they gave him 15-20 minutes to drink more water. He has found if he stays very hydrated throughout the night that it's easier getting the bladder full in the morning. Also, we are having an earlier lighter supper to help with the morning bm. We changed his diet some, eliminating gassy foods like beans & broccoli, whole grains, nuts, fresh fruit/vegetables. First 3 weeks or so he had no real issues or complaints. Last week he started feeling a bit of fatigue, and some urinary urgency. This week both have gotten more noticeable. Today on the way to appt he couldn't hold it and had to stop to do a partial relief. And also today he has laid down twice. So I think he will probably have this till the end, and then another few weeks after, according to the RadOnc. RO also said to expect diarrhea, but fortunately nothing yet. He has had a couple days of the blues, which was hard, but he worked thru it. Trying to stay upbeat and productive isn't so easy when you're pooped. He's finding new ways to stay busy and entertained. Hope some of this might help you. We appreciated being able to read about other guy's experiences, knowing what to expect. Good luck with your decision, and whatever treatment course you might choose. Barb",

However, based on his path, decipher and high psa going in, his Uro wanted him to meet with a RadOnc to discuss adjuvant radiation. After reviewing statistics Dave opted to keep hitting hard. RadOnc did not see need to include ADT at this time. So on 2/18/19 Dave had his first of 33 radiation treatments. He goes every morning Mon-Fri. We are fortunate to live close to the cancer center. I drive him and stay with him, which he appreciates, as it takes away a bit of stress. Starting off was simple enough he said. They did a \"simulation\" appt a week prior to his first actual zap. That took several hours and involved CT scans and proper positioning. They had him drink a quantity of water to see how much was needed to get his bladder at the proper fullness. And explained that he would need to have a full bladder and empty colon for each treatment. (This helps to move those organs away from the target zap area) It took Dave some trial and error to get the fluid/bladder timing down right. They do a scan before every zap to make sure he is appropriately full and empty. One time his colon wasn't empty so they sent him home. (Will make up that session at the end) and one time bladder not full enough so they gave him 15-20 minutes to drink more water. He has found if he stays very hydrated throughout the night that it's easier getting the bladder full in the morning. Also, we are having an earlier lighter supper to help with the morning bm. We changed his diet some, eliminating gassy foods like beans & broccoli, whole grains, nuts, fresh fruit/vegetables. First 3 weeks or so he had no real issues or complaints. Last week he started feeling a bit of fatigue, and some urinary urgency. This week both have gotten more noticeable. Today on the way to appt he couldn't hold it and had to stop to do a partial relief. And also today he has laid down twice. So I think he will probably have this till the end, and then another few weeks after, according to the RadOnc. RO also said to expect diarrhea, but fortunately nothing yet. He has had a couple days of the blues, which was hard, but he worked thru it. Trying to stay upbeat and productive isn't so easy when you're pooped. He's finding new ways to stay busy and entertained. Hope some of this might help you. We appreciated being able to read about other guy's experiences, knowing what to expect. Good luck with your decision, and whatever treatment course you might choose. Barb",
