      "Content": "Thank you all for your insight and it has eased my mind quite a bit. I have done a great deal of reading on this subject since the matter first arose. As in everything else in life there are a great deal of different opinions and differing research. Even though my doctor surprised me by appearing to be 20 or more years younger than me, I do indeed trust him. He came highly recommended and I did research his background. I think I may have overstepped my side by questioning his motives for wanting to see me for another visit in order to release my results. I can certainly see the benefits of having him with me face to face especially if on the outside chance that the results come back positive. I want to thank all of you for your support and input. It surely has helped put my fears at ease. I will be back for more help as I need it and will certainly keep you posted on my results. Again, thank you.",

      "Content": "I am 53 years old. I had a PSA reading of 1.03 last year. About 2 months ago I had another blood test done during a routine physical and I had a PSA reading of 2.97 or almost triple of my earlier one. My doctor urged me to see a Urologist because of the significant increase in such a short period of time. Taking my doctor's advice I went to a Urologist who scheduled another blood test about a month later and my PSA reading came back lower than the resent one at 1.95 but still almost double my original one. My Urologist told me I had two options. He said I could wait 6 months and have another blood test done and review the scores of that one and decide on a treatment plan then or I could take the pro-active approach and have the biopsy done now. After careful consideration with my doctor and considering the risks of doing a biopsy and waiting the 6 months in a state of mind were I would always be wondering, I decided to do the biopsy now. I had it done on Sept. 12th. My Urologist told me that visibly my prostate looked healthy but enlarged which I was already aware of (the enlarged part). He also made it perfectly clear that although he may have the biopsy results back in 7 to 10 days I could not call him or the office in order to get the results and I would have to wait until the next time that I saw him in order to get the results. My next appointment is not until Sept 27 so I have to wait another 6 days before I get any type of answer. Is this standard with this type of thing? I suffer from bi-polar disorder and am very easily depressed. With this, I easily find myself thinking of the worst case scenarios when I find myself waiting for different test results. Do I have a right to call him and ask for my results earlier over the phone? Is this visit to his office just another way of the doctors practice to raise the cost associated with my testing and treatment? I am very scared and lonely. I shared this information with my wife and only my wife. She is very supportive but I don't think she necessarily realizes what a toll this is taking on me. Are my past PSA readings indicative of a positive outcome on the biopsy? Please any support or answers that you can give would be greatly appreciated. Thank you.",
