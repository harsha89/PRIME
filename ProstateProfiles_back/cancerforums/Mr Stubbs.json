    "Content": "BigWhisky, I had my prostate removed in mid Sept 2012 (61 yrs) via robotic surgery. The catheter ( a necessary but really hateful contraption) was removed after about 10 days and I had very similar pain to yours for about two months... during which the pain was constant but the severity seemed to get worse at night. I tried the topical lidocaine ointment on the tip of my penis... it didn't help. My surgeon and urologist were sympathetic but both assured me the pain was fairly common and would get better with time. They said the pain might possibly be \"radiated via nerves\" to the penis tip from the urethra/bladder sutures healing. I was skeptical and quite exhausted from the pain by then. At about the 10 week point the pain began to lessen SLOWLY but enough that I could feel the improvement. The only things that helped, I think, was trying to concentrate on some activity that temporarily gave my pain-obsessed mind a break and walking several miles a day to stay physically active. The pain to the penis tip is now completely gone. Good luck to you.",
