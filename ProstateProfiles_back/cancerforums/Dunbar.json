      "Content": "Originally Posted by Delawarean Has anyone had this test where a probe Is inserted in the rectum and a balloon inflated? Is it painful or difficult and is it necessary? Hi Delawarean I had the probe and to honest with you it wasn't the mode enjoyable 60 min of my life. It didn't hurt but was definitely uncomfortable until they adjusted it - this was about 10 min into the scan. It shouldn't hurt, so if it does you will have to tell them immediately. Afterwards there was no discomfort, or perhaps I was just happy it was over They provided me with a headset so was singing along to some great tunes to kill time. So nothing to be scared about, just go in and get it over and done with! Let me know if you need further information. Thanks Dunbar",

Since its a procedure done under full anestecia there is absolutely no pain or discomfort associated with the procedure. As its was done as an out patient I was home a few hours after arriving at the hospital. After the procedure there was no pain at all only slight discomfort for a couple of days - probable 1.5 out of 10 at the most. There was a bit of blood in my semen but nothing in my urin.

Da'Vinci on June 12 with no issues, first X-ray 7 days later showed a leak, second X-ray 3 days later showed same leak, third X-ray 16 days after surgery showed the same but smaller leak. Now my hopefully final X-ray is in 14 days which is exactly 1 month after surgery. I believe the leak is due to spasms on the night after my surgery and intense spasms two days before my third X-ray. Never had pain like the second round of spasms and I'm now on Ditropan 5 mg/3 per day to prevent further spasms. Incredibly frustrating with this delay, but I guess it could be much worse. Dunbar",

      "Content": "Hi all This is the advice I received from my dietitian regarding cancer foods - hope this will help someone. Dunbar Here is information about vitamins and diet: Immunity System You might want to consider taking the following supplements and foods that are high in the following to help boast immunity: \u0095 Vitamin C, sources include citrus fruits, potatoes, green peppers, strawberries and pineapple. Vitamin E, - seeds, vegetable oils and grains. Beta Carotene (orange vegetables), Bioflavenoids, Zinc - mushrooms, oysters, liver, lean beef, pork, turkey, lamb, lentils, pumpkin and sesame seeds, garbanzo beans and yogurt Garlic Selenium Omega-3 fatty acids. This was taken from a website about having an \u0091Anti cancer Diet\u0094: \u0095 Breakfast: Add fruit and a few seeds or nuts to your whole grain breakfast cereal (such as oatmeal). \u0095 Lunch: Eat a big salad filled with your favorite beans and peas or other combo of veggies. Always order lettuce and tomato (plus any other veggies you can) on your sandwiches. Order whole grain bread for your sandwiches. Have a side of veggies like cut up carrots, sauerkraut, or a piece of fruit. \u0095 Snacks: Fresh fruit and vegetables. Grab an apple or banana on your way out the door. Raw veggies such as carrots, celery, cucumbers, jicama, peppers, etc. are great with a low-fat dip such as hummus. Keep trail mix made with nuts, seeds, and a little dried fruit on hand. \u0095 Dinner: Add fresh veggies to your favorite pasta sauce or rice dish. Top a baked potato with broccoli and yogurt, sautéed veggies, or with salsa. Replace creamy pasta sauces, with sautéed vegetables or tomato sauce made with healthy olive oil. \u0095 Dessert: Choose fruit instead of a richer dessert. Or a single square of dark chocolate. Our meals are full of fibre and are \u0091whole\u0092 foods Cancer prevention diet tip #1: Focus on plant-based foods Why plant-based foods are cancer-fighting powerhouses It comes down to this: Plants have less fat, more fiber, and more cancer-fighting nutrients. These three elements work together to support your immune system and help your body fight off cancer. The best diet for preventing or fighting cancer is a predominantly plant-based diet that includes a variety of vegetables, fruits, and whole grains. A plant-based diet means eating mostly foods that come from plants: vegetables, fruits, nuts, grains, and beans. The less processed these foods are\u0097the less they\u0092ve been cooked, peeled, mixed with other ingredients, stripped of their nutrients, or otherwise altered from the way they came out of the ground\u0097the better. There are many ways to add plant-based foods to your diet. A nice visual reminder is to aim for a plate of food that is filled at least two-thirds with whole grains, vegetables, beans, or fruit. Dairy products, fish, and meat should take up no more than a third of the plate. Keep in mind that you don\u0092t need to go completely vegetarian. Instead, focus on adding \u0093whole\u0094 foods, which are foods close to their original form. Just as important, try to minimize or reduce the amount of processed foods you eat. Eat an apple instead of drinking a glass of apple juice, for example. Or enjoy a bowl of oatmeal with raisins instead of an oatmeal raisin cookie. Buy organic or local produce, if possible. Eat Fit Food buy local, seasonal produce and organic when we can. Some pesticides found in commercially-grown produce are also suspected carcinogens. Organic foods are free of these pesticides, and locally grown produce is less likely to have been treated with chemicals to prevent spoilage. Cancer prevention diet tip #2: Bulk up on fiber Another benefit of eating plant-based foods is that it will also increase your fiber intake. Fiber, also called roughage or bulk, is the part of plants (grains, fruits, and vegetables) that your body can\u0092t digest. Fiber plays a key role in keeping your digestive system clean and healthy. It helps keep food moving through your digestive tract, and it also moves cancer-causing compounds out before they can create harm. Fiber is found in fruits, vegetables, and whole grains. In general, the more natural and unprocessed the food, the higher it is in fiber. There is no fiber in meat, dairy, sugar, or \u0093white\u0094 foods like white bread, white rice, and pastries. Simple ways to add more fiber to your diet: \u0095 Use brown rice instead of white rice \u0095 Substitute whole-grain bread for white bread \u0095 Choose a bran muffin over a croissant or pastry \u0095 Snack on popcorn instead of potato chips \u0095 Eat fresh fruit such as a pear, a banana, or an apple (with the skin) \u0095 Have a baked potato, including the skin, instead of mashed potatoes \u0095 Enjoy fresh carrots, celery, or bell peppers with a hummus or salsa, instead of chips and a sour cream dip \u0095 Use beans instead of ground meat in chili, casseroles, tacos, and even burgers (bean burgers can taste great) High-fiber, cancer-fighting foods Whole grains whole-wheat pasta, raisin bran, barley, oatmeal, oat bran muffins, popcorn, brown rice, whole-grain or whole-wheat bread Fruit raspberries, apples, pears, strawberries, bananas, blackberries, blueberries, mango, apricots, citrus fruits, dried fruit, prunes, raisins Legumes lentils, black beans, split peas, lima beans, baked beans, kidney beans, pinto, chick peas, navy beans, black-eyed peas Vegetables broccoli, spinach, dark green leafy vegetables, peas, artichokes, corn, carrots, tomatoes, Brussels sprouts, potatoes Cancer prevention diet tip #3: Cut down on meat Research shows that vegetarians are about fifty percent less likely to develop cancer than those who eat meat. So what\u0092s the link between meat and cancer risk? First, meat lacks fiber and other nutrients that have been shown to have cancer-protective properties. What it does have in abundance, however, is fat\u0097often very high levels of saturated fat. High-fat diets have been linked to higher rates of cancer. And saturated fat is particularly dangerous. Finally, depending on how it is prepared, meat can develop carcinogenic compounds. Making better meat and protein choices You don\u0092t need to cut out meat completely and become a vegetarian. But most people consume far more meat than is healthy. You can cut down your cancer risk substantially by reducing the amount of animal-based products you eat and by choosing healthier meats. \u0095 Keep meat to a minimum. Try to keep the total amount of meat in your diet to no more than fifteen percent of your total calories. Ten percent is even better. \u0095 Eat red meat only occasionally. Red meat is high in saturated fat, so eat it sparingly. \u0095 Reduce the portion size of meat in each meal. The portion should be able to fit in the palm of your hand. \u0095 Use meat as a flavoring or a side, not the entrée. You can use a little bit of meat to add flavor or texture to your food, rather than using it as the main element. \u0095 Add beans and other plant-based protein sources to your meals. \u0095 Choose leaner meats, such as fish, chicken, or turkey. If possible, buy organic. \u0095 Avoid processed meats such as hotdogs, sausage, deli meats, and salami. Cancer prevention diet tip #4: Choose your fats wisely A major benefit of cutting down on the amount of meat you eat is that you will automatically cut out a lot of unhealthy fat. Eating a diet high in fat increases your risk for many types of cancer. But cutting out fat entirely isn\u0092t the answer, either. In fact, some types of fat may actually protect against cancer. The trick is to choose your fats wisely and eat them in moderation. \u0095 Fats that increase cancer risk \u0096 The two most damaging fats are saturated fats and trans fats. Saturated fats are found mainly in animal products such as red meat, whole milk dairy products, and eggs. Trans fats, also called partially hydrogenated oils, are created by adding hydrogen to liquid vegetable oils to make them more solid and less likely to spoil\u0097which is very good for food manufacturers, and very bad for you. \u0095 Fats that decrease cancer risk \u0096 The best fats are unsaturated fats, which come from plant sources and are liquid at room temperature. Primary sources include olive oil, canola oil, nuts, and avocados. Also focus on omega-3 fatty acids, which fight inflammation and support brain and heart health. Good sources include salmon, tuna, and flaxseeds. The Top Anti-Cancer Foods Anti-cancer vegetables: \u0095 broccoli \u0095 brussel sprouts \u0095 cabbage \u0095 carrots \u0095 cauliflower \u0095 eggplant \u0095 green beans \u0095 kale \u0095 onions (red) \u0095 peppers \u0095 radishes \u0095 soy \u0095 squash \u0095 sweet potatoes \u0095 tomatoes \u0095 yams Anti-cancer fruits: \u0095 apricots \u0095 blueberries \u0095 grapefruit \u0095 grapes \u0095 lemons \u0095 mangoes \u0095 oranges \u0095 papayas \u0095 peaches \u0095 persimmons \u0095 strawberries, organic \u0095 tangerines",

      "Content": "Hi all Got the dreaded diagnosis last night - and is now wondering what I do next. The specialist told me I'm very lucky to have detected it very early and due to my age I'm very likely to be completely cured. So although I'm upset about the diagnosis, i am very grateful having received a much better news than so many others have... I am however very confused about what would be the best treatment for me, and speaking to the doc last night didn't really help that much. He is in favour of Da'Vinci removal of the prostate and not so much seeds. Other treatments got rejected, however being a bit skeptical I can't help to think its because he only perform those two methods. Also I have a feeling he is leaning towards Da'Vinci because it probably is a better income for him than seeds (please tell me if I'm being paranoid)! I do have confidence in him as he seems very knowledgeable and also in the hospital, which is one of the leading in Australia, so the treatment I select will most likely be done with him... In my limited research seeds seems to me a much \"easier\" treatment, however he is skeptical due to my age and possibly long term complications. I am fit and otherwise in excellent health - not sure if that's got any influence on the outcome of either treatment. Btw I have already ordered the Dr Walsh book about prostate cancer. Can someone please help me with their opinion about which treatment I should lean towards and also if here are any specific questions I need to ask my doc when we meet again on Wednesday. I really appreciate any help, feedback and guidance. Dunbar",

      "Content": "Hi all Got the dreaded diagnosis last night - and is now wondering what I do next. The specialist told me I'm very lucky to have detected it very early and due to my age I'm very likely to be completely cured. So although I'm upset about the diagnosis, i am very grateful having received a much better news than so many others have... I am however very confused about what would be the best treatment for me, and speaking to the doc last night didn't really help that much. He is in favour of Da'Vinci removal of the prostate and not so much seeds. Other treatments got rejected, however being a bit skeptical I can't help to think its because he only perform those two methods. Also I have a feeling he is leaning towards Da'Vinci because it probably is a better income for him than seeds (please tell me if I'm being paranoid)! I do have confidence in him as he seems very knowledgeable and also in the hospital, which is one of the leading in Australia, so the treatment I select will most likely be done with him... In my limited research seeds seems to me a much \"easier\" treatment, however he is skeptical due to my age and possibly long term complications. I am fit and otherwise in excellent health - not sure if that's got any influence on the outcome of either treatment. Btw I have already ordered the Dr Walsh book about prostate cancer. Can someone please help me with their opinion about which treatment I should lean towards and also if here are any specific questions I need to ask my doc when we meet again on Wednesday. I really appreciate any help, feedback and guidance. Dunbar",

      "Content": "Hi scratch I'm definitely not a PC expert, but during my research for treatment I was also seriously considering Brachy due to the \"easy\" recovery. My initial biopsy was a Gleason 7 (3+4) T2b. I did however elect to have the Da'Vinci as I wanted it out to find the exact extend of the cancer. The patholgy report showed my prostate had indeed broken through the prostate and it was upgraded to a T3a - negative margins. I am not sure what the outcome would have been with Brachy and if they would have been able to stop the PC from escaping further, but with the relative \"ease\" of surgery and recovery I am very happy I choose what I did... Results are excellent in whatever treatment you choose and I wish you well in selecting whats right for you. It is a very difficult decision but as Fairwind writes \"staying alive would be my first priority\" is exactly right for me too. All the best Dunbar",
