Based on my biopsy report (Partin tables) the RO\u2019s feel I have a very good chance I will need radiation following surgery at some point. They feel I should go with the radiation and if there is a reoccurrence there are cryotherapy and Hormone treatments. The surgeons want to remove it and if there is a reoccurrence I can have radiation treatments. If the cancer has moved beyond the prostate bed then neither treatment will be successful. I was pretty sure I would have the surgery but I made the mistake of talking to a RO, it gave me a lot more to think about.

Trying to remember if you gave us your stats. Can you tell us your biopsy report, along with past & current PSAs, etc? This is my first post on any forum. The only PSA I am aware of was 12/15/12 it was 4.2, thats when the doctor refered me to the Urologist. After the DRE the Doc scheduled the biopsy. Was given the results 2/13 had the scan 2/14.
