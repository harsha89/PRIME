    "Content": "Had my prostate removed in 2002. Now have Stage 4 prostate cancer which has spread to my lumph nodes. Presently taking Hormone injections every 6 months. My last PSA was a 2.6, having risen from a 0.5. Doctor took me off of the small cancer pill I took along with the Hormone treatments. I have forgotten the name of the pill, but it was a \"Bi---------\" something. He stated that taking the Hormone shots and the pill sometimes worked against each other. After taking me off this pill, he scheduled me for another PSA test 2 months later, along with also checking my Testostone level. In taking me off this pill, he stated my PSA reading may now go down. He stated that chemotherapy was now a thing of the past due to the new medications on the market, although they are very expensive. Being retired from the Navy, I believe my Tricare will cover the costs. Anyone have experiences with this sudden rise in PSA while on Hormone treatment?",
