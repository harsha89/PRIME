      "Content": "Originally Posted by OldTiredSailor I have an appointment next Wednesday with a local urologist who is the senior partner in a large SW Florida practice. He wants to talk with my wife and I and review my PSA and family history as well as our attitudes and concerns. He will then recommend next steps. The practice website and patient testimonials indicate the use of pretty new technology and techniques. One of their more interesting diagnostic tools, from my perceptive, is the 4KScore blood analysis. I did a lot of professional work developing similar predictive scoring, based on historical measures, in a far different field. I have spent a lot of time studying the various validation studies for OPKO and 4KScore and think I have a good understanding of the advantages and potential problems. I have verified that Medicare will not pay the $400 cost of a 4KScore blood analysis. My other local option is to have a 3T Multiparametric MR Imaging & 3D Prostate Mapping procedure done by a different practice, which tells me is 100% covered by Medicare and my Florida Blue supplemental insurance. I am having trouble understanding the advantage of having the 4KScore , which only yields the probability of an aggressive cancer when the 3TMP MRI will actually show lesions and lumps and can subsequently be used for biopsy guidance in a fused situation. I like the idea of starting with another simple blood test but wonder what information I actually gain from that blood test. Does anyone have any 4KScore experience that can explain the 4KScore advantage over starting with a sophisticated MRI? The way my urologist put it to me, the 4KScore is another set of data to determine if a biopsy can be avoided or if in fact a wise idea to proceed. I did not pursue the 4KScore. An mpMRI is a procedure that was used after my biopsy in my case to help see if I was a candidate for active surveillance which I was at that point in time. It is also becoming popular prior to a biopsy as a way to see if a biopsy can be avoided. For the record, the mpMRI doesn't diagnose cancer only the biopsy does.",

      "Content": "While I'm new to this board, I'm not new to health boards in general. I am on several heart boards, as I had a robotic mitral valve repair due to prolapse back in 2009. Even on those boards, which do a great service, get pretty heated especially when discussing which surgery technique should be used. Opinions on which is best whether open sternotomy, minimally invasive either with several (2\") incisions or robotic with five (1/2\") incisions. Then discussions that \"my surgeon's\" technique is better because with open sternotomy, he can see better. Yes, but it's messier and your hospital recovery is a lot longer. Then opinions that mitral valve surgery isn't as important/cool/newsworthy as the more common aortic valve which is kind of a bigger problem. But surgery is surgery. My robotic mv repair still involved stopping my heart and hooking me up to the heart pump machine for about 90 minutes. I asked my surgeon, does this machine have a backup battery. He smirked at me and said we got it covered and it doesn't happen. Boards are a good thing.",

I didn't get one done but it probably wouldn't have mattered in my case. Hopefully, someone will come along more versed than me with some better answers.",

I'm not sure if that was discussed. I recall in my case before finally getting a biopsy talking about getting a 4k score test done which measures a few more components. I didn't get one done but it probably wouldn't have mattered in my case. Hopefully, someone will come along more versed than me with some better answers.",

Then, later MRI's downgraded the 4 to a 3. This new result downgraded the original 4 to a 2 , and did not see the other two lesions.

Volume, PSA velocity, and density all factor in. My G6 was high volume with increasing velocity and upgraded to G3+4 after removal. One thing I've been learning is the risk of hanging everything on one good factor, such as your G6. Your PSA is bouncing around a lot. Are you messing with it? Just askin'. I'd say your age is a factor as well and you are heading for treatment. The risk increases the longer you wait, imo. If treatment is inevitable why wait? You're doing a good job staying on top of this. Thanks. Yes I'm working on getting a second from JH. There is no understanding of my PSA movement. Always total monk mode 7 days before.

My understanding is that while AS \"programs\" sort of follow the same guidelines, my whole mindset was I want to make sure I'm being watched closely and following AUA guidelines. Their philosophy and metrics seem consistent with accepted guidelines. What they are looking for is PSA <10, negative DRE, GS 6, involvement < 50% in any core nothing earth shattering. Not sure if 4 positive cores is a problem since its still under 34%. MRI last year and this year. They do take Pi-Rads 4 and 5 serious. Didn't get that concerned with Pi-Rad 3.

As far as Genomics, they seem to feel that it's helpful as extra data and may make the patient sleep better at night, but it won't influence their decision.

      "Content": "Originally Posted by Michael F Hi ej61! Educational Question: Is your Emory AS protocol a general guideline or is it a definitive protocol that your URO MD specifically tailors to you as a patient? i.e. Are there specific metrics that if/when reached, AS is cancelled and treatment commences? If there are specific metrics, please share. e.g. - PSA - PIRADS - Genomic Test Results You are doing a great job of staying on top of your status. At some point, intervention will likely be required. Hoping that newer \"biologic\" treatments will be available when that metric is reached. MF Thanks for the encouragement. My regular Uro had introduced me to my Uro surgeon and RO team last year just to get another perspective. Total team approach. After last year's results, the surgeon who is the Chairman of the Dept of Urology at Emory School of Medicine thought I looked good for a study program and had in his mind, a planned out 2-3 year AS. Both Uro's were pretty strong on me taking the AS route \"for now\" last year. My understanding is that while AS \"programs\" sort of follow the same guidelines, my whole mindset was I want to make sure I'm being watched closely and following AUA guidelines. Their philosophy and metrics seem consistent with accepted guidelines. What they are looking for is PSA <10, negative DRE, GS 6, involvement < 50% in any core nothing earth shattering. Not sure if 4 positive cores is a problem since its still under 34%. MRI last year and this year. They do take Pi-Rads 4 and 5 serious. Didn't get that concerned with Pi-Rad 3. I suspect testing frequency may change as time goes on. As far as Genomics, they seem to feel that it's helpful as extra data and may make the patient sleep better at night, but it won't influence their decision. Given the fact that I have problems with fever spikes after biopsy's, I'm hoping that something can be tailored for me.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by Another A second opinion on the samples from Epstein's lab at Hopkins may be a good idea to confirm no G4, again. Volume, PSA velocity, and density all factor in. My G6 was high volume with increasing velocity and upgraded to G3+4 after removal. One thing I've been learning is the risk of hanging everything on one good factor, such as your G6. Your PSA is bouncing around a lot. Are you messing with it? Just askin'. I'd say your age is a factor as well and you are heading for treatment. The risk increases the longer you wait, imo. If treatment is inevitable why wait? You're doing a good job staying on top of this. Thanks. Yes I'm working on getting a second from JH. There is no understanding of my PSA movement. Always total monk mode 7 days before. I'm thinking about intervention a little more than last year to be honest. I'm due for an mpMRI in July. Maybe do that first. I'll be having more detailed conversation with my doctors for sure.",

      "Content": "After my confirmatory biopsy in April 2018, my subsequent PSA in late June was 12.76 and PSA last week was 9.88. I did develop a 102 fever and a case of SIRS after the biopsy even with heavy pre-medication. I have an ID Doctor who I consult with who did a blood culture which turned out negative. I have an ID doctor because I have a history of endocarditis. I had a followup with my urology surgeon Dr. Sanda at Emory as well as the Rad Onc yesterday. He is interested in the PSA rise obviously and is thinking some kind of prostatitis is involved. He went on to explain that there are 3 basic types of prostatitis, some with symptoms, some without symptoms, and some that is a combination of something you only see at the microscopic level. My nurse wife understood it so I'm good with that. He says my PSA is \"dynamic\" and he does see that in patients. Basically, while he doesn't think I'm out of the woods, he noted the 25% decrease from June to August. The plan is for me to recheck my PSA in Oct/Nov and then one in December, (outside of the 3-6 month interval to make us feel better.) Basically if it goes down, it would be good. If the PSA goes back up, which would put it at 10+, all bets are off and then treatment will be talked about. Also, my MRI scheduled for next April will be moved closer to January. Both he and the Rad Onc are pretty booked up through the end of the year. Having this extra data in the next quarter is going to tell alot. Dr. Sanda even said if it was him with this data history, it would be what he'd do. Ok I'll take that under advisement. To be continued...",
