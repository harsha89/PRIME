      "Content": "Hey all... I am new to the forum, 8 days post-op, and thought I would share my experience, so far... (It's a little lengthy, my apologies) Age: 47 Diagnosed with PCa on Sept. 4, 2014 PSA 3.3 PSAf 13.1 Biopsy positive 1 of 12 cores, 4% total tissue involvement Gleason 7 (3+4) Robotic Prostatectomy 1/5/15 Post operative Pathology: T2C 5% of tissue cancerous Confined to gland, no margins involved Lymph nodes and Vas Def showed no cancer Gleason changed to 7 with a (4+3), instead of (3+4) As with most of us, when I received the initial news of the \"C word\" I was devastated. I immediately went into a depressive \"Why Me?\" state and felt that life as I knew it was over. I became so withdrawn and angry, that I almost completely pushed my family away from me within weeks. The immediate recommendation was surgery. Surgery, to me, seemed like a fate worse than the cancer itself. Because even if the cancer was removed and surgery went perfectly, I would still not be the man I was going in. The thought of incontinence and erectile dysfunction left me thinking \"Well, looks like I am dying of Prostate Cancer then.\" I, then, found a friend of mine had Proton therapy for his Prostate Cancer and was very happy with the experience. No side effects at all. No PSA issues after 6 months. I did the research and decided that Proton was the way to go. However, I still had an appointment with the surgeon because I told myself I would listen to everything, regardless. My insurance company turned down Proton therapy stating there is no definitive proof that it is more effective than \"traditional\" radiation and could not justify the cost. I was ready for a fight and felt I could get them to cover this with a little motivation. Then came the appointment with my surgeon... The surgeon changed my entire perspective and I wound up scheduling surgery after weighing things a few days later. My psyche still needed convincing though. I firmly believe that the medical community is missing the psychological aspect of this disease, and without addressing the mind, the body will not respond. \"Free your mind, and your ass follow.\" Literally.... I went to my Psychologist/Therapist for a three week crash course treatment to get my head right for what was to come. Thank god, or whomever, it was my key to surviving regardless of what cancer has in store for me. By my surgery date, I was ready, determined, and knew this was not going to end my sex life and leave me in diapers. I had my surgery 8 days ago. Post op pathology reports sate the my Gleason was still a 7, changed to (4+3), the tumor was con confined to the Prostate with out margin involvement. All adjacent tissues clear. The pain of the catheter was far worse than the surgery itself. (Bladder spasms) I had the catheter removed 5 days post-op. I was able to control my bladder immediately after removal except for some bleeding and occasional dripping. There is still the constant urge to urinate, but that is improving daily. I have woken up the last 2 mornings with a decent 60% erection. The first was without Viagra, which I stared yesterday. Obviously, I still have a long way to go. But there is hope, and that is all I have been looking for since my diagnosis. Sorry this was so wordy...thanks for reading this and I hope this can bring some hope to others recovering from surgery or preparing for it.",

      "Content": "MODS.... (ref: CLOSED thread on the most \"advanced\" cancer treatment) Just some info about Proton Therapy I learned while making my decision. I hope this is ok... As of 9/1/14, UHC stopped covering Proton Therapy for Prostate cancer stating that there is not enough evidence that Proton Therapy is more effective than \"conventional\" radiation therapy. I know this because I initially had decided on Proton therapy and was turned down for coverage by UHC. (I submitted for pre-approval on 9/4/14...3 days after the new policy took effect.) I was ready to fight to obtain coverage until I did a little more research. For younger PCA patients, Proton Therapy, or any radiation therapy, is strongly discouraged (for confined cancers) by many physicians. (I am 47.) They sight the secondary conditions arising from radiation exposure, especially 15 years or more after treatment. In older patients, it is considered more viable due to life expectancy and other co-morbid conditions versus succumbing to a disorder caused by radiation exposure. To me, the allure of Proton Therapy was the lack of immediate side effects. However, I did not want to be looking over my shoulder for the rest of my life waiting on the next PSA test results. While that apprehension will ALWAYS exist for PCa patients, I chose RALP due to, what I considered, a more definitive long-term approach. As my surgeon put it, \"Put in a good fight for three months and get on with your life.\" I am four weeks post-op and am so happy with my decision. I am blessed with already having full continence control and full sexual function. I was concerned about the \"dry orgasms\" but I must say, it feels the same, if not better. (That and no clean up...lol!) So, all of my concerns have been put to rest, just waiting on that 6 week PSA report so I can \"get on with my life.\" A very close friend of mine chose Protons and was able to get it covered by UHC prior to their policy change. Part of me is envious that he had such a smooth road, comparatively, but I am happy for him and he could not be happier with HIS choice. Ultimately, it comes down to that...the patient's choice. There is no ONE catch all cure for any disease process, many factors are calculated before a regimen is chosen. All of us owe it to ourselves to make an INFORMED decision based on our unique cases.
