      "Content": "Well, I finished up my HDR Monotherapy treatment last week (4/12) at UCSF under Dr. Hsu and, all in all, it wasn't bad. The actual implant was a piece of cake and the subsequent three treatments (fractions) all went without a hitch ... none lasting longer than 20 minutes. Each fraction delivered 10.5 Gy to the prostate for a total of 31.5 Gy over the course of the three fractions. The hardest part of the whole process was the not being able to move much while the implant was in place, given my already existant back problems. However, given that the whole thing only lasted a total of 36 hours, I can't complain. A small price to pay in the hopes of ridding myself of this crappy disease. Thus far, the side effects have amounted to some soreness (due to the 36 hour catheder) and some burning during urination (due to both the catheder and the radiation. The latter is supposed to subside in a couple of weeks and the catheder soreness is almost gone as I write this. I returned to work 4 days after the last fraction and, thus far, have experienced only a minimal amount of tiredness. Of course it is still very early in this particular journey so I won't know just how effective the treatment was for some time. For those contemplating HDR monotherapy, I will try to add to this \"blog\" as time goes by.",
