      "Content": "Hello, Just saying hi to you folks. Looking for other's experience for the stage 4 ride. I was diagnosed October of 2013. Biopsy showed G8, 12/12 cores positive, all at least 50% involved a few 90-100% Post surgical review of my prostate was: G9 4+5, positive everything except bladder neck. Have had a DaVinci Rp, 27 months of Lupron and 34 radiation treatments to the prostate bed and pelvic lymph nodes. I was in the zero club until April 2017, PSA has gone from <0.1 to 0.18, 0.18, 0.30",

      "Content": "Well, because it's relatively early the plan is one more PSA test to nail down doubling rate. Then scans, CT, bone, and possibly PET. One way or another they will put me back on HT. Chemo is out since it's not refractory yet. If it can be seen then probably radiation.",
