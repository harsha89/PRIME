He´s doctor told that next is radiation and hormone. Yesterday was first radiation and today first hormone. I really dont know why and my dad listening he´s doctor. When I read your storyes, then I understand that this is rush...but here its different. Maybe they dont make salvage radiation? Maybe here is only adjuvant radiation? It seems like in your country they make this decision when Gleason is 9. But my dad´s was 7. But anyway..its started yesterday. How long this hormone last for you who has done this? So this 2 years is possible?",

      "Content": "Hello! My dad got his psa today. It was 0.03. So far it has been 0.003 🤔Last year September he had last hormone shot (2 years). He did this last psa in different lab. Labortant told, its a very good result...but still....now its 0.03 not 0.003 🤔 Is this undetectable or not? Dad told he wait 1 month and end of July he makes another PSA test in same lab, where before. Not this new lab. Doctor told that after hormone treatment PSA may rise and this is ok. Is this some PSA bounce? Does somebody has some experience after hormone treatment? how much your PSA rise? Is this rise OK or should be worry? I am worry anyway... Sry my english",

Dont rush. And again AS. Last year...in August again biopsy...no cancer. PSA was 2,5. First time this was something about 10. I think that they just didn't catch this cancer this time and my uncle think same. Now next biopsy is soon. In January. But this is very strange. What do you think? I dont know Gleason, but i think it was G6, otherwise they wouldnt make AS. He is 62.",

So we dont know, what this pathology results show. What reason could be? If he had lymph node, then doctor could tell him, that some lymphs are not ok or something quikcly.... but he told only that this is too long scientific story, and he dont have time to explain. Call me next week. What reason can be? First PSA we dont have yet. Its only 1 month after surgery....but tomorrow he already have to go to make PSA. As much as I have read, its different in your country. You make first PSA after 2-3 month. And radiation IF the PSA is rising...right? Not immediately after surgery? Friday I called my family doctor. She couldnt see the results yet. But she told, that sometimes they make radiation after surgery, if they have any doubt, that some microscopical cells can be outside the prostate. Dad is doing really good right now. In the night he dont pee every hour now...maybe 2-3 hours and then. But WHY radiation??? Maybe tomorrow we get answer, but its drives me crazy",

I hope that tomorrow our family doctor can see the pathology results and can explain something more. And I hope this answer is good.

      "Content": "Thank you for your support and your wishes! Its very good to read your positive stories and it makes feel better! I am not sure about the doctor where my dad is going. I dont know almost anything about him. I know only that the doctor is 61 years old, so he must have some experience if I look hes age, but I am not sure. Also I know that doctor is urologist and surgeon. But he is not oncologist. We have a small country, so I dont know how good health care we have. I cant look another surgeon, because my dad has made decision to go surgery monday. This is the fastest way. Our urolog told that the surgeon is very good. So we have to trust him. I have some questions: 1. When you recovering from your surgery, who was waching you next? Your urologist or some oncologist? And what time after surgery you visit your doctor? How long you had to be hospital after surgery in your country? 2. Did you get some irradiation after surgery? Or doctor made only surgery? Who decide this? 3. How quick they made new PSA test after surgery? Immediately? 4. What mean perineural invasion? Is this bad? May be the tumor can be advanced? They took 8 cores biopsy. 4 left and 4 right side. 3 shows some cancer. 1 right core has G 3+3=6 and perineural invasion symptoms and there is longer text, focus 0,8; 1,4 and 2mm. Something is positive colour? Second core has some little doctor text what I cant translate. There no G score appointed and third core has focus 0,8mm and G 3+3=6 Others are OK. Now I have to make some work so nice day!",

Cut stomach or somehow different? I dont know. HighlanderCFH: Is it possible that my father G is really different than 3+3=6? Beacause the biopsy result was that one core has some perineural invasion. And after that sentence was G 3+3=6. Maybe really its more than 3+3=6? Or how there can be perineural invasion? And actually this word was a little bit different...it wasnt invasion, but \"the infiltration\". But its so good I find this place. I already can eat and I dont worry so much anymore, because I know that everything goes well",

This is my dad...not just some next \"thing\" Before surgery someone told that this surgeon is good surgeon, but he dont speak a lot. I hope that this was true and he is GOOD surgeon. I hope that tomorrow our family doctor can see the pathology results and can explain something more. And I hope this answer is good. When family doctor can see the patology results, then I can put this here. If I be able to translate this. We dont have oncologist appointment yet. Its very different in your country.",

      "Content": "Hello! Last week dad had to call doctor to get his pathology results. Doctor told ONLY that we have to make radiation also. But WHY he didnt explain, because he was busy!!! So we dont know, what this pathology results show. What reason could be? If he had lymph node, then doctor could tell him, that some lymphs are not ok or something quikcly.... but he told only that this is too long scientific story, and he dont have time to explain. Call me next week. What reason can be? First PSA we dont have yet. Its only 1 month after surgery....but tomorrow he already have to go to make PSA. As much as I have read, its different in your country. You make first PSA after 2-3 month. And radiation IF the PSA is rising...right? Not immediately after surgery? Friday I called my family doctor. She couldnt see the results yet. But she told, that sometimes they make radiation after surgery, if they have any doubt, that some microscopical cells can be outside the prostate. Dad is doing really good right now. In the night he dont pee every hour now...maybe 2-3 hours and then. But WHY radiation??? Maybe tomorrow we get answer, but its drives me crazy",

      "Content": "Thank you for your support and your wishes! Its very good to read your positive stories and it makes feel better! I am not sure about the doctor where my dad is going. I dont know almost anything about him. I know only that the doctor is 61 years old, so he must have some experience if I look hes age, but I am not sure. Also I know that doctor is urologist and surgeon. But he is not oncologist. We have a small country, so I dont know how good health care we have. I cant look another surgeon, because my dad has made decision to go surgery monday. This is the fastest way. Our urolog told that the surgeon is very good. So we have to trust him. I have some questions: 1. When you recovering from your surgery, who was waching you next? Your urologist or some oncologist? And what time after surgery you visit your doctor? How long you had to be hospital after surgery in your country? 2. Did you get some irradiation after surgery? Or doctor made only surgery? Who decide this? 3. How quick they made new PSA test after surgery? Immediately? 4. What mean perineural invasion? Is this bad? May be the tumor can be advanced? They took 8 cores biopsy. 4 left and 4 right side. 3 shows some cancer. 1 right core has G 3+3=6 and perineural invasion symptoms and there is longer text, focus 0,8; 1,4 and 2mm. Something is positive colour? Second core has some little doctor text what I cant translate. There no G score appointed and third core has focus 0,8mm and G 3+3=6 Others are OK. Now I have to make some work so nice day!",

      "Content": "Hello! First sorry about my English. I am estonian and my English is bad But I hope you understand. I am here beacause my father. He is 62. He has been doctors 6 years. They made PSA every year. This summer it was already 4,75. Doctor gave him some antibiotics and PSA was 4,4. Then doctor asked to do biopsy. Week ago he got he`s biopsy results and it was shock all family. They took 8 pieces (or core?) biopsy. 3 was positive. Now I don\u0092t know how to translate this text, but 2 pieces have a Gleason score 3+3=6; 1 of them have a perineural infiltration identification (That\u0092s bad? Or what?) In the end is writing that cancer is 9%. Is it T2c or something else\u0085I don\u0092t know\u0085here is no information. Is cancer go more than prostate\u0085lymph or bone\u0085its so hard to wait the ansver. They didn\u0092t do any bone scan. I think its turn out in the surgery. Doctor is very positive and told that dad has a good chance. Next Monday he has prostate surgery. We are so worry, but same time we hope that everything is has to go good. Its so good that I found this site. My English is not good, but something I understand and 2 days I have been reading your stories here Good luck for all!",
