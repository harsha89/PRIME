      "Content": "I just started a clinical trial at the National Cancer Institute (NIH) after I was diagnosed with PCa a couple of months ago at the age of 47. After speaking with a radiation oncologist and medical oncologist to discuss my biopsy, and then a urologist at NIH today to discuss my recent 3T MRI, I've decided to move forward with robotic prostatectomy. Does anyone have any thoughts on having my procedure done by Dr. Peter Pinto at NIH? Or any other recommended surgeons in this area? I prefer to stay in the DC metro area as I figure there should be some good options around here (NIH, Johns Hopkins, Georgetown MedStar, etc.). Any recommendations or advice would be greatly appreciated.",

      "Content": "Hi All, Hope everyone had a great Thanksgiving! So I posted my experience the other day regarding my first week post-RALP. Now that I've had my catheter removed for a few days, I was hoping some of you could answer some questions I have. I've now had my catheter out for 3 days. One thing that I've noticed is that when I urinate, it doesn't feel like it fully drains. In other words, when I'm done, nothing more comes out but I still feel like I have some urine left. Is this normal? Also, is it normal to have to urinate several times in a night? Last night from 11 pm to 7 am (when I went to bed and when I woke up), I had to urinate 5 times...literally about every 90 minutes. And when I did have to go, it felt pretty urgent each time. I pointed out to my wife that I didn't even drink much water yesterday (or any alcohol). Now I'll admit...the first 2 nights without my catheter, I was in a pretty celebratory mood so I had some beverages both nights. For each of those nights, I only had to get up once in the middle of the night (since I was likely dehydrated). Anyway, any experiences/advice would be greatly appreciated!",

      "Content": "Hi everyone, This is my first post as I was just told I have prostate cancer about 10 days ago. I'm 47 and my PSA was at 6.3 back in April, and then 6.1 about 1 month or so later. I got a biopsy and my urologist said 2 cores came up positive, both at 3 +3 = 6, with one at 10% and the other at 50%. I'm meeting with a radiation oncologist in 2 days. All of this is pretty overwhelming for me as I knew absolutely nothing about prostate cancer until probably a month ago after I got my 2nd high PSA score. I'm learning more and more everyday but have a few beginner's questions. Aside from trying to figure out a treatment plan, is there anything else I should be doing? For example: - Should I try to get a 2nd opinion on my biopsy results? If so, do I use my urologist and have him have another lab review it? Or do I see another urologist and provide my records to him? - Should I look into genomic testing? Or an MRI to try and give me more info? If so, do I set these up through my urologist? I know one size doesn't fit all, but based on my age and numbers, is there any solution that makes the most sense compared to the others? At this point I don't think I'm inclined to do AA b/c I know at some point (due to my age) I'll probably have to get it treated, so I think I'd rather do it sooner rather than wait for it to grow/spread before doing it. I just read the Proton Beam Therapy book by Robert Marckini and just ordered the Dr. Patrick Walsh book and the Prostate Cancer book by Emilia Ripoll. Any other tips or advice would be greatly appreciated!",

      "Content": "Hi everyone, This is my first post as I was just told I have prostate cancer about 10 days ago. I'm 47 and my PSA was at 6.3 back in April, and then 6.1 about 1 month or so later. I got a biopsy and my urologist said 2 cores came up positive, both at 3 +3 = 6, with one at 10% and the other at 50%. I'm meeting with a radiation oncologist in 2 days. All of this is pretty overwhelming for me as I knew absolutely nothing about prostate cancer until probably a month ago after I got my 2nd high PSA score. I'm learning more and more everyday but have a few beginner's questions. Aside from trying to figure out a treatment plan, is there anything else I should be doing? For example: - Should I try to get a 2nd opinion on my biopsy results? If so, do I use my urologist and have him have another lab review it? Or do I see another urologist and provide my records to him? - Should I look into genomic testing? Or an MRI to try and give me more info? If so, do I set these up through my urologist? I know one size doesn't fit all, but based on my age and numbers, is there any solution that makes the most sense compared to the others?

      "Content": "Hi All, For those who are interested, I just thought I'd share my experience after having robotic prostatectomy last week on Monday (Nov. 12) morning. Day of Surgery (Monday, Nov. 12) My procedure was scheduled for 7:30 am Monday at INOVA Fairfax Hospital with Dr. Simon Chung and took about 2.5 hours. I checked in at 6:30 am and my last memory was laying in the bed in the waiting area with my wife with the IV attached to me and some nurses and the anesthesiologist popping by. Next thing you know, I wake up around 10 am and am in the recovery area waiting for my room. When I woke up, they asked me about my pain from 0 - 10 and I told them it was 9+ at the time. I told them it felt like I had to pee very badly and that my bladder was literally about to explode...it was pretty painful. My wife said my left leg continued to visibly shake. They said I likely had a bladder spasm and immediately gave me Fentanyl and something else in my IV which greatly assisted with the pain. They carted me to my room and I ended up sleeping most of the day. After waking up in the late afternoon, I still had a lot of discomfort in my lower abdomen area, but it wasn't \"painful\" and was manageable at least. From that point they kept me on a steady dose of Ditropan (to help w/ the bladder pain) and Toradol (for general pain). My stomach/abs were really sore and the catheter was scary looking and a nuisance, but not painful. Again, for me the worst part was the lower abdomen bloating. At a couple different points in the evening I did some laps around the hospital floor just so I could get up and walk around a bit. I went to bed around 10 pm and after laying around for about a 20 minutes, I passed my first bit of gas. What a relief that was! While it didn't lessen the feeling of pressure at that point, this told me I was on my way to getting rid of that bloated gaseous feeling. Though I didn't sleep all that well in the hospital that evening, I counted around 8 - 10 occurrences of passing gas. By the next morning, the discomfort in my lower abs had substantially decreased. I told the nurse I didn't think I needed the Ditropan or the Toradol any longer. Day After Surgery I did not eat anything on the day of my surgery. I ate breakfast the following day (about 24 hours after my surgery) and had a couple of scrambled eggs with a slice of toast. I ended up regretting doing that b/c I felt worse afterward and it upset my stomach a little bit. I was sent home around 1 pm the following day. When I was discharged, they gave me a prescription of Ditropan and Percocet. However, I was feeling well enough at this point that I thought I would probably only need Advil. One other thing my doctor gave me was Lovenox. I hadn't seen others mention this but it's to prevent blood clots and is a daily shot that I'm supposed to self-administer for 10 days post-surgery (though I'm too much of a wimp so I have my wife give it to me). My plan for the day was to try and be active and take a long walk around the neighborhood that afternoon, but that didn't happen. When I got home it seemed like the general soreness from my surgery was really kicking in and I was obsessing over the catheter. Again, the catheter didn't really hurt, but I was \"worried\" about it because it looks disturbing and it would sometimes feel sensitive/irritated. So I came home and crashed for about 2 hours. After waking up and going downstairs, I just felt really tired, very sore, and a bit depressed...almost as if I had regressed from how I felt the previous evening in the hospital when I was doing laps. I also had some anxiety about the catheter. I ate a little fruit and toast and watched tv in bed for several hours and did very little walking around the house before going to bed that evening. 2 Days After Surgery I had an excellent night's sleep my first night home. I do not have a recliner so I slept in my bed, but my bed if fairly high off the ground so that really helped. As others have mentioned, I only used the large pouch and kept it in a bucket next to my bed. I ended up sleeping for over 10 hours and the catheter didn't bother me at all during my sleep. In fact, it was nice to not have to wake up to pee in the middle of the night! I noticed that my appetite started coming back a little more by now. I had 1 egg and toast for breakfast along with some grapes. As the day went along, I found myself grazing quite a bit (piece of bread, banana, crackers, grapes, vegetable soup, etc.). This is what my doc recommended as opposed to eating big meals. I was also trying to drink lots of water b/c I noticed my urine was looking darker lately than it had the previous day. At around 4pm, my stomach started feeling upset so I stood up to see if I had to pass any gas. It was weird b/c I couldn't pass gas, but it felt like I had to have a bowel movement. So I went to the toilet and sat down and lo and behold, I had my first bowel movement. It was only a little bit and it was mostly diarrhea, but it felt good to get that out. The weird part was that I didn't see any urine go down my tube although a little bit was excreted (a bit red and slimy) around my catheter. By late afternoon, I noticed that I was definitely feeling better overall. My general soreness was slightly better; I was getting used to the catheter a bit more; and I was just feeling better and moving better overall. My wife made made mashed potatoes and baked salmon for dinner and it was delicious. Even though my appetite was coming back, I made sure to keep it a pretty small portion so I wouldn't take the chance of upsetting my stomach. I watched tv downstairs with my wife like we normally do when I'm healthy, and I had another excellent night's sleep. 3 Days After Surgery I live in the Washington DC area and it had been very cold since I had my procedure done. I felt good enough to try and walk around the neighborhood but it was snowing and sleeting all day (school was even cancelled), so it was another day in the house. That said, I was feeling pretty good. Yes, I was still very sore but it was getting better. The catheter is an inconvenience and more of a psychological issue I think. I had 2 eggs with toast and avocado for breakfast, so my appetite was growing. At about 3 pm that day I had my 2nd bowel movement, and this time it was not diarrhea and everything went smoothly with no pain. 4 Days After Surgery Finally made it out of the house today. Went to Wegmans and Costco with my wife. I noticed that after walking around for 30 minutes or so, I was starting to feel the pain in my abdomen and told my wife I was just about done for now. Nothing serious, but I felt like I should sit. Had another bowel movement and this one was a little harder, but no pain/stress from pushing. Today was also the first day I took a shower. I left the shower door cracked open with my bag on the outside while I showered. Just used my hands and soap...no cloth or loofah. After I was done I gently patted my stomach area when I dried off. The long, hot shower felt great. 5 Days After Surgery Pretty uneventful day. I stayed in all day due to the cold weather and having some appointments in our home (I sold 2 items on Craigslist and people came over to my house to pick them up; I also had Cox come service our phone/internet connection). So while I didn't go outside, I was moving within the house quite a bit to where I felt I needed to take breaks. Continue feeling better and eating a bit more. Sleep is still really good each night. 6 Days After Surgery Took my 2nd trip out of the house and went to a furniture store with my family. After walking around a bit, I noticed I was feeling a little pain in the abdomen so I sat in the store here and there. Had my parents over for dinner and ordered Thai food. The dinner was by far the most I've eaten since my surgery...pretty much like I used to eat prior to surgery. 1 Week After Surgery Stayed inside all day but moved around pretty easily. Had another bowel movement and this one was probably the largest and biggest (sorry for the details) since my surgery. It required some real pushing, but again, not a problem. Just very minor strain on the abs. I also took my 2nd shower and it was great. My appetite is basically back to normal. 8 Days After Surgery Had my catheter removed today. I will not say it was painless. It wasn't painful per se, but it was pretty unpleasant if you ask me. I'll just say it caused me some discomfort. The nurse took it out slowly but I had to look away. Fortunately, it was over pretty quickly. Once it came out....Hallelujah! It truly is a wonderful, liberating feeling to get that thing out. My pathology report came back as 3+4 (instead of the 3+3 of my biopsy). However, lymph nodes and margins were clean. Doc said he spared my nerves so he expects a nice recovery. I put the Depends on for the first time and went home. I'm just waiting for the first time I have to urinate to see how it goes. I've passed gas a few times since I've been home and can feel the leaks. Hopefully the continence and sexual function will work out...I guess I'll just find out over time. So for anyone who's read this far, in sum, so far I'm glad I had the procedure done and in the big scheme of things, the pain/discomfort is fairly minor and short-lived compared to the peace of mind it has brought me. Feel free to ask me any questions and I'll try to answer them the best I can.",

      "Content": "Thanks to everyone for the advice! Couple of quick questions... If I send my slides to Dr. Epstein, does insurance usually pick up the price for any of that or is it just a flat $250 out of pocket regardless of insurance? Also, is it worth getting genomic testing? If so, do I go about that through my urologist or is that something I do on my own and just pay out of pocket? Even though my scores are \"good,\" my wife has been worried sick and is making me see my primary care doctor tomorrow to set up my possible first colonoscopy as well (just to make sure nothing's going on in there since we \"stumbled\" into my prostate cancer through my routine physical).",

      "Content": "Hi All, Hope everyone had a great Thanksgiving! So I posted my experience the other day regarding my first week post-RALP. Now that I've had my catheter removed for a few days, I was hoping some of you could answer some questions I have. I've now had my catheter out for 3 days. One thing that I've noticed is that when I urinate, it doesn't feel like it fully drains. In other words, when I'm done, nothing more comes out but I still feel like I have some urine left. Is this normal? Also, is it normal to have to urinate several times in a night? Last night from 11 pm to 7 am (when I went to bed and when I woke up), I had to urinate 5 times...literally about every 90 minutes. And when I did have to go, it felt pretty urgent each time. I pointed out to my wife that I didn't even drink much water yesterday (or any alcohol). Now I'll admit...the first 2 nights without my catheter, I was in a pretty celebratory mood so I had some beverages both nights. For each of those nights, I only had to get up once in the middle of the night (since I was likely dehydrated). Anyway, any experiences/advice would be greatly appreciated!",

      "Content": "Thanks Jake! I initially looked at getting my procedure done at NIH with Dr. Peter Pinto. I also looked into Hopkins. In the end, I chose Dr. Chung b/c he came highly recommended by a couple of other doctors I met with (and he was in my insurance network and located close to my home). When I met Dr. Chung, he told me he had done well over 800 of these surgeries covering the past 15 years, so I decided this would probably work for me and I wouldn't need to travel far for my procedure. When I went in for my surgery, one of the nurses told me I was in good hands as Dr. Chung is the guy who teaches the newer doctors how to do RALPs, so that made me feel good. He is really down to earth and has excellent bedside manner. I would definitely recommend him to others who live in this area.",
