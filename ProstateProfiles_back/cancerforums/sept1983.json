Told me not to worry, that everything will be fine. He did mention to me that if chemo is something recommended, that he will not go through it because, he was told by others, that chemo is not good and makes the immune system worse. He'd rather go get treatment elsewhere using natural remedies. I need to do research on that. I'm not sure how I feel about his decision. Would you guys have any information on that? Is that true? I will get answers to questions asked about Gleason and positive core count on Tuesday. I don't have that information. The Dr called my dad and told him the test results about it coming back positive for PC. I'm not sure if she went over all that with home over the phone. But I'll find out and come acknowledge with answers. In the meantime, I will be ordering the recommended book online and start reading it as soon as I get it. Again, thank you for replying.",

      "Content": "Hello, My name is Sandra. My dad is 66 years old and he found out this past Thursday that his biopsy exam was detected with cancer. A few weekends ago he went to the er because he had abdominal pain. His urine test came out positive with a uti. He was on antibiotics. That same week, about 2 weeks ago, he received a letter from his Dr saying that his PSA levels was really high. I believe it was at 25. He made an appointment for last week to get the biopsy and here we are now. My dad is a strong person, rarely gets a cold or sick. Is in pretty great health for his age, really active, grandfather to my two kids and my dad. When he broke the news to me, I was in complete shock. I was sure everything would be ok. And I have faith he'll overcome this, we all will. I'm so sad and I'm trying so hard to be strong for him and my mom. My dad is sad and hurt, but otherwise he's in great spirit. He has an appointment this Tuesday, I'm not sure what it's for. I believe for a bone marrow exam? I'm so glad I found this forum because I want to know more about this. Get better educated for him, my family and I. I hold all of you in my thoughts and prayers and hope you all will overcome whatever it may be. Any input as to what he will be going through will be greatly appreciated. I will be taking time off of work so I could go with him to his appointments. I want to be there for him every step of the way. Thank you for your time.",

I will definitely come back with more information regarding his prognosis tomorrow after his appointment. I've been a mess, but I'm trying very hard to remain calm and strong for him and my mom. I think the worse, but I will change that. He's here with us and we will get through this. Again, I'm so glad I came across this forum. You all are so wonderful. Have a blessed day. Sandra",
