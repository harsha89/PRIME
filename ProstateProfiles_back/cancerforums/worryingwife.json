I have been reading on here for a few weeks, and I am so thankful for all of you sharing your experiences. It has greatly helped me which in turn helps me help him PSA rose quickly from 3 to 6 in 6 months and then to 12 in 1 - 2 months. He had 4/12 cores positive - all on the left. one was 3+3=6 for 5% of biopsy length one was 3+4=7 for 80% of biopsy length one was G3+4=7 for 50% of biopsy length one was 3+4=7 for 80% of biopsy length Left perineural invasion present It also said P63 Immunostain is confirmed and Cytokeratin 5 is found in various proportions. I know we will need to wait for the biopsy now that he had the surgery, but I wanted to say hi and thank you for all the reading we did on here before! Doctor said he can get the cath out in a week, and that he can go home tomorrow if he is feeling ok.",
