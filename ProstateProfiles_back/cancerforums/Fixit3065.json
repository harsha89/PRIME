    "Content": "I am new to this forum but I have been following it a little bit. I had nerve sparing robotic surgery on my prostate on June 17th and go back for my first blood test tomorrow. I never thought I would be in this position but I find myself wanting to talk about how I am progressing with others in the same boat. I do not feel sorry for myself but I do want my functions back. I am doing well as far as incontinence. I quit using pads two weeks ago but still have to be careful when I stand up or sneeze. Lack of sexual function is still a big problem and don't know when or if I will regain the ability to get an erection.",
