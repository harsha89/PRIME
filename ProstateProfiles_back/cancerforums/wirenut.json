Only 2 out of the 12 samples taken showed cancer. Only 20% of those 2 samples had cancer cells. Robotic Radical Prostatectomy - October 2013. Dr said surgery went \"text book perfect\". Cancer was fully contained in the prostate, did not spread to any other organs, etc. Nerve sparing good all the way around. Catheter out at 2 weeks.

Still have incontinence issues. Mostly dry at night. Using Jock Strap & male guards, maybe 2 or 3 in 24 hour period.",
