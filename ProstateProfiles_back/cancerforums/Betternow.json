    "Content": "Good afternoon everyone and Hello from a first time poster. Im posting on behalf of an uncle of mine who recently decided to undergo a HIFU treatment. Since he is very close to my father I became involved along the way. Well after all the research my Uncle decided to undergo HIFU as his method of treatment. I can only go off his description of everything, but according to him he has been very happy with his outcome. He's feeling very enthusiastic at this point and wants to get the word out. Being that he isn't the most tech savvy I told him I would help him posting what he felt was important with the online community. He basically wants me to post the following\u0085 He describes himself as going from a 2/10 pre HIFU to a 7/10 post HIFU. He knows its not the most common procedure but wants to get his experience out there. So if anyone is interested and wants some more details on his experience please just ask away. Just ask and I will post his response. Please feel free to ask whatever detailed info you feel is necessary. Thanks",
