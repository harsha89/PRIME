      "Content": "My 51 year old healthy husband just had his first PSA drawn out of the recommendation of a friend who was recently diagnosed with PCa. The result came back a whopping 60. DRE and UA both normal. Another PSA will be drawn next week and a bx is scheduled on 2/5. Not even sure what to think. Is this for sure cancer? With levels this high does that mean that if it is CA that it has been growing awhile or is it just very aggressive? Any advice, comments or suggestions would be very appreciated!!",

      "Content": "Hello again, I first want to say thank you to everyone for your kind words and responses. As I first wrote, my husband's first PSA result was 60. Monday he had a second PSA draw and it had dropped to 7. The urologist feels we will cancel the bx for now and do another draw in 3 weeks to make sure it is heading towards the normal range. I can't tell you how relieved we currently feel, still not out of the woods but definitely 7 will be easier to treat than 60. Again thank you so very much for making a terrifying situation a little easier to deal with.",
