      "Content": "I guess I've joined the club. Almost 4 years ago I had a TURP and the path from the material taken out showed Gleason 6 in less than .05% Since then, my PSA was never above 1.0 Decided to have a look see at my prostate and last week had a T3 MRI at MD Anderson. It showed a 1 cm lesion near the neck of my bladder. It also shows a constriction there which now I see could account for my urinary problems. So...low PSA and a big lesion in what is left of my prostate. Will go in for a biopsy of the lesion in a couple of weeks. Up to a month or so ago, nothing was felt by DRE. Wouldn't you think that such a large lesion - almost half an inch - would have been felt by then? If not and it's a recent growth it could be worrisome. If path still shows Gleason 6 and it's that close to the peripheral zone, I might consider taking the darm thing out while it's still safely in the capsule. Don't know. Any comments on my condition?",
