    "Content": "My dad has been suffering from prostate cancer for about 13 years now the cancer has also spread to his bones. Within the last 45 days he has lost about 35 pounds and I'm worried sick about him. My dad has always been very independent. A mans man so to speck. So to see this sudden change is breaking my heart. The doctor said that his psa levels are 2000+ . It seems like he is getting weaker by the day. He barely eats. So I give him boost plus to drink. But I don't know what else to do. Should I be worried?",
