Casodex was stopped. Has anyone been in a similar situation and the withdrawal of Casodex helped lower the PSA? How bad are the side effects with radiation? I would sure appreciate any thoughts or comments on the position I'm in. And if anyone has been \"here\" and can give insights as to what to expect. Thanks so much.",

If the psa rise is partly due to Cassodex, I might consider staying off Lupron for six months. But would like to know if this drug recovers it's effectiveness after an interruption. Any experience out there ?",
