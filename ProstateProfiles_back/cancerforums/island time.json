    "Content": "This is my first post so Hello Everyone! Being diagnosed 6 weeks ago so I've read Dr Walsh's book and I have been lurking here as well as talking to others locally who have had this disease. I'm meeting with a surgeon today and a radiation oncologist next week. I have my questions prepaired for the surgeon. Currently leaning towards surgery but still not 100 % sure of what to do. I am wondering how you guys came to your decisions as to who it was that you ultimately decided on to be your Doctor and hospitals for treatment?? The surgeon I'm seeing today is my area's rock star robotics guy (E. TN). I don't think he does many open surgeries anymore. If I could just \"push a button\" I think I'd go to John's Hopkins. But that's not so simple. Dr Walsh says the surgeon is all important. So..i guess my bottom line question is if one could go to JH...why wouldn't they? It's a one shot deal. Am I over reacting if I go there and if I don't am I taking the easy road out? I don't know. Any and all replies are much appreciated. Thanks David",
