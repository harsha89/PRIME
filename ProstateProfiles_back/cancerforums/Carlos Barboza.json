Was using Caverject, first time 1 ml at doc office, then 0,5 ml at home with discomfort, then 0,3 ml [30 units], still hurting. Move to Trimix, 0,10 ml [10 un] with almost 4 hs up, then to 0,06 ml [6 un] 3 1/2 hs up having to take some pills [tylenol synus, alegra, pseudoephedrine] luckly went down. Now thinking of going to 0,03 [3 un]. I wonder if anyone had a same problem?!",
