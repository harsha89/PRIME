      "Content": "Originally Posted by heatdoctor Thanks for the replies. Interestingly enough, I left out one bit of info. which could be the explanation for my increased PSA AND in line with the hypothesis of NON-BACTERIAL PROSTATITIS. For a period of about 2 weeks and right about the time that my blood was taken for the PSA test, I occasionally had the \"immediate\" urge to urinate. I had never experienced urges like that before. These urges disappeared after 2 weeks. I did tell the urologist about this. He offered to treat with antibiotics but I refused since I had no indication of an infection. He still wanted to do a biopsy. In any case, as I already explained, I refused the biopsy and my subsequent PSA (6 weeks later) was back to 1.4. I am now guessing that as you all pointed out, I did indeed have Prostatitis of unknown origin. We will see what my PSA is in 3 months. Thanks again for the input. Im 69 and healthy otherwise..PSA ran .7 then to 1.5 over 15 years then jumped from 2 in 2016 to 8.5 in 16 months. Freaked me out! a second test in 4 weeks shows it down to 2.7 very similar precursor of urinary frequency 6 weeks ago. Going to follow this up with another consult and discussion regarding closer monitoring and or tests. Keep you posted!",
