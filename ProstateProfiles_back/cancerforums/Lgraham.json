    "Content": "My husband was diagnosed with Prostate cancer in April of 2017. He had a biopsy with 16 core samples taken. All cores came back with cancer. Gleason score was 9 in most. Since the cancer had already spread outside the prostate they did not remove it. They did 45 radiation treatments. His PSA went from 12.8 down to 0.1 after radiation. 6 months later it went up to 6 then to 12. They also found bone metastasis in the spine. They started Taxotere and had no good results so they added Casodex which also did nothing. The side effects were too much and the fact that his PSA was still rising he decided to quit after 3 treatments. His PSA kept rising and was at a 53 just a few weeks later. Then they chose Xtandi. After a week and a half on Xtandi PSA is at 114. He has another PSA in 4 days, he will have been on Xtandi for 3 weeks. Hopefully we will see some good results.. The cancer has spread throughout the spine and a bone above the spine in his head and is now affecting nerves in the eye area which is causing double vision and eye pain. Since starting Xtandi and this eye problem he has become very angry and extremely moody. I have to walk on eggshells all the time. So I am wondering if anyone else has had extreme mood changes or eye or vision problems on Xtandi. Or is it just the tumors in the head. Oh and by the way they are radiating the head now. Very stressed right now.",
