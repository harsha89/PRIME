      "Content": "We got a chest xray, contrast CT abdomen, and a bone scan done. The disease is stable - we were very relieved to hear that it hadnt gone up. The PSA rise was making us wonder if the cancer wasnt coming in control and spreading to the organs. Thankfully it was just a flare of the PSA, either due to catheterization or due to the chemo drug (Taxotere/Docetaxel) itself. Re: Why it is not going down - my naive brain was thinking it would, the doc said it takes the full chemo cycle for us to see the effect, and in our case because the cycle was interrupted due to the brain surgery, he said that once all 6 cycles of Docetaxel are done, then he will suggest we do these tests again to see whether it has come down. Anyway happy that it isnt going up, even if it isnt coming down.",

      "Content": "Hello again, Dad was diagnosed in Oct 2015 with a PSA of 176 and a Gleason of 4+4 with bone metastates, and stage 4 prostate cancer. Early November we did Orchiectomy, and his PSA came down to 78. The surgery also helped remove all his pain symptoms. We also started chemo in mid November to double attack After Chemo 1, PSA came down to 5. I was very happy with the downward trend. After Chemo 2, however, PSA rose to 38.5. We ruled out UTI through a urine test (he had also had a subdural hematoma and had to undergo neuro surgery and was hospitalized and we had to delay his chemo by a week to allow for recovery) Now after Chemo 3, PSA rose to 98.6. So it seems to be on a rising trend. I have some questions: 1. Just with orchiectomy, the PSA should have stayed down and it takes about 12-18 months for the cancer to become castration resistant and grow. But we added chemo, so it should be going down not up right? 2. Does this indicate the chemo isnt working for him at all? How do we know the cancer is going down? 3. He doesnt have pain symptoms, he previously had a lot of back pain, and knee pain. Are there other symptoms that would indicate that the cancer is growing? 4. How does PSA going up again affect his prognosis? Our oncologist had said 18-24 months before we started treatment but also said that newer research is always coming, so dont worry about it. But the PSA trend is making me worried sick. 5. My dad has been responding well to the chemo. He definitely fatigues easily, but overall in good spirits and good appetite. He does a slow walk in the home for about 60 mins every day, in multiple 20 min chunks, and he does some resistance training for 15 mins with his own body weight. He has not had nausea or mouth ulcers/sores. Could this mean the chemo isnt affecting him at all, especially the drug they are giving him - which is docetaxel? We meet our oncologist tomorrow and have his 4th chemo. Would love to hear from folks here about the questions above and what I should be querying my oncologist about? Thanks a lot, and hoping for some quick responses.",

      "Content": "Thanks Michael F and Highlander for your responses and your support. We did his next chemo today. He does have nail discoloring, but thankfully no other bad symptoms. The team of oncologists decided that since his PSA is going up, it could be one of two things - a flare from the catheterization, or perhaps the chemo isnt working to control the cancer. They have advised we should do a repeat bone scan, chest XRay and a CECT abdomen in two weeks, and another PSA before the next chemo to figure out what is going on. I really hope and pray that the cancer hasnt spread to the organs, that would really suck.",

      "Content": "Hi all I wanted to share an update on dad. Quick summary - Dad was diagnosed in late October with Stage 4, Gleason 4+4, PSA 172 after he had major pain symptoms all over his back and pelvic area. We did subcapsular orciectomy (chemical castration) in Nov and then started him on chemo. He had his 8th chemo a couple of weeks ago. There was a break after 2 chemos due to the recovery from the brain surgery he had for his hemorrhage. After his PSA fell down to 5 after the first chemo, it rose again, going up to 92 and then with the 7th chemo came down to 23. This 8th chemo it stayed stable at 23. Given it was not trending strictly down, the oncologists were discussing next steps with us. They considered 3 options - continue with 2 more chemos (Docetaxel), give Abiraterone or give Bicalutamide. They are suggesting we give Bicalutamide and give his body a rest from chemo, and also because Abiraterone is more toxic. I dont know how the next few months are going to play out. I would love to hear thoughts from you guys if you had similar experience or know more about the pros and cons of these options. Dad is in India and wants to visit me and the children this summer, in two weeks he has a follow up appointment and we will discuss if he is reacting OK to the bicalutamide, re-measure PSA and then decide if he's OK to travel.",

      "Content": "Hello all, My dad, 71, was diagnosed with prostate cancer - stage 4, with extensive skeletal metastates, and aggressive (Gleason score of 4+4) All this happened on Oct 25th, just about 10 days ago. We're in Delhi, India. My dad complained of back pain a couple of months back, and we didnt realize it was a symptom of the cancer. We dismissed it as muscular pain/old age/weak strength. Then when we went to a doc and he examined the prostate, he asked that we get a PSA test done - which came up to 176! After that, one test after the other - bone scan showed extensive metastatis, biopsy showed all cores infected. Big mistake on our part to not have tested PSA regularly, we were not aware, despite the fact that my dad had HOLEP surgery for BPH about 3 yrs back. We went in for orchietomy (subcapsular, so physically my dad doesnt feel anything) this Monday. Chose this instead of the hormonal treatment. He is recovering fine from the surgery, did have severe constipation for a couple of days, but the back pain is down. The next step our oncologist has recommended once his stitches are removed, is to start on Chemo (docetaxel). Normally they wait to start on chemo but due to http://www.cancer.gov/news-events/pr...ses/2013/E3805, our doctor suggested we could start on chemo sooner. My dad also has borderline diabetes and takes medication, but of late due to no exercise when he had bad back pain, his blood glucose has climbed. The doctor said we need to get this under control before starting chemo. We're tentatively scheduled for our first chemo on Nov 21st. Needless to say we're overwhelmed, and in shock from what the last 10 days have thrown on us. We're trying to focus on what we can treat, and then hope for the best. Based on this background, I was interested to get help on the following: 1. Any feedback on the course of treatment so far and what we've been advised on? 2. What should we ask our oncologist that would help change/alter/supplement his advise as we proceed with the chemo? 3. My dad so far feels normal after the surgery - he was very tired and drowsy yesterday, today was better (4th day after surgery). I've been reading up on the side effects of the hormonal treatment, was interested in first hand information on what to expect as the days go on? 4. How can the family best support him? 5. Any other gotchas? 6. I am interested in reviewing his reports with an Oncologist in the US, as I live there and fly back soon. However, he will be here, so is it possible for us to show all his reports there and have someone review and give us their advise on the treatment plan? Thanks, and I am sorry to be here - one thing is there, I thought I knew about cancer, but when it hits you, you realize how little you know, and how evil it is, and how hard is it to see your loved one suffer. I am hoping we can control this or keep it growing at a very slow pace... Kay",

      "Content": "Thank you all very much for your encouraging responses, I am happy to see the optimism (as much as is possible in this situation). Very fortunate to have stumbled upon this community. I will also ask dad to read up and share his experiences so he can get help and see that he's not alone and that things will be better. Regarding this suggestion - this sounds like a great idea. Would you know how to contact them? So far I contacted Seattle Cancer Care Alliance since I live in Seattle, and their response was underwhelming - they wanted me to deposit $30,000 for international patient intake, to do an evaluation and all tests, even though we have all teh reports, and they want my dad to show up in person, whereas all I asked for is a consult and review of the reports we already have. So if you have experience doing the below, I want to know exactly who to contact who can review this over the phone/email, i am definitely willing to pay for it, just dont think it should cost $30,000. Originally Posted by newporter The thing I would do if I were you is to send his biopsy slides to Johns Hopkins or Bostwick for a second read. I would be most interested in finding out his cancer type, i.e., the most common form or the rarer forms. The treatment protocols may be different depending on that. After the second read by a US lab, you can then do a second opinion consult with a US oncologist (i.e., JH, Mayo or MDA, etc.). That can be done by telephone. Best wishes.",

      "Content": "p_shah - I am in US, my dad and siblings are in India, and my dad was diagnosed with metasized prostate cancer at the end of October. He's in Delhi. We went to Max Super Speciality Hospital's Cancer Center. He had orchiectomy in November. And we started Chemo in Dec. We did not wait for the cancer to become castration resistant since there were studies that Chemo + HT (via orchiectomy) could prolong life span. My dad was 71.5 at the time. And his symptoms were weight loss and extreme pain in his back. His PSA was a whopping 172, he had not measured PSA before that (except for a BPH prostate enlargement case 3 yrs ago and had surgery for it but the doctor SUCKED since he did not advise any regular tests or preventative care). The pain went away after orchiectomy. The chemo made him a bit weak, but he hasnt had nausea. He also has some cataract which is expected to be made worse with the chemo (steroids that are added as part of this). My dad also had an additional complication that he had a brain haemmorhage after his 2nd chemo and we had to delay the chemo to allow him to recover from this, and then they added 2 more chemos for a total of 8. He just had his 7th chemo today. His PSA dropped to 5 after chemo 1, and then started rising and came to 35, then 92. The doc said it could be a flare from the chemo drug docetaxel/taxotere (in India). We measured PSA yesterday and thankfully it is down to 23. We were thinking of adding HT if it was still going up. Not sure what the plan is after the chemo ends, probably start and keep him on HT to prolong and keep the cancer at bay for as long as we can. For us the chemo wasnt as bad as we thought, but we are very careful with the diet and visitors and going out. I was very strict with them about this given how many people like to come visit in India.",

      "Content": "Had our chemo today, session#3. Doc changed the drug from Doceaqualip to Docetaxel/Taxotere and increased dosage to 120 mg. They also suspect a potential Urinary Tract Infection, which could explain the PSA spike. We have given the urine culture and are awaiting results. When my dad had the neurosurgery and was on complete bed rest in the hospital for 3 days, he was on a catherer, so perhaps that caused it. Other reasons the doc thinks could be - we stopped the steroid to avoid sugar spikes that may interfere with wound healing, we also delayed the chemo by a week. However, he thinks the PSA spiking up due to the cancer returning more aggressively so soon after the orchidectomy (hormonal therapy) is unlikely. So I hope it is a spike from the UTI and that it can come back. I have been waiting to see my dad's PSA fall in the valid range ever since we were diagnosed and started treatment. Meanwhile if anyone else has experience with rising PSA and our situation, please do help. Thanks SuperNewman.",

Now we dont know why the PSA became 8x, when it was nicely trending down (176 on Oct 27th, 78 on Nov 13, 5 on Dec 4) before it went back up to 38.5 on Jan 1. My dad's oncologist says that we will see the trend when we measure it again the day before our next chemo. I am worried obviously since rising PSA isnt a good sign, and I hope it isnt that even with the surgery and the chemos, dads cancer isnt coming under control.",

      "Content": "I have a question that I havent found a satisfactory answer to. My dad has Stage 4 Prostate Cancer, Gleason Score of 8, with extensive bone metastates. We did orchidechtomy to control the testosterone production and hence affect the cancers. We've started chemo as well with Docetaxel. Given our biospy found all 12 cores infected, why isnt it a good idea to remove the prostate? My oncologist says its because the cancer has already spread outside the prostate. But if the cancer grows by multiplying the cells that exist, isnt it a good idea to get rid of anything we can to reduce the source of multiplication? I understand the cancers there would shrink from both the chemo and the orchidechtomy, but isnt one of the reasons stage 4 isnt fully curable that they really cant be fully eliminated from these two procedures?",

      "Content": "I have a question that I havent found a satisfactory answer to. My dad has Stage 4 Prostate Cancer, Gleason Score of 8, with extensive bone metastates. We did orchidechtomy to control the testosterone production and hence affect the cancers. We've started chemo as well with Docetaxel. Given our biospy found all 12 cores infected, why isnt it a good idea to remove the prostate? My oncologist says its because the cancer has already spread outside the prostate. But if the cancer grows by multiplying the cells that exist, isnt it a good idea to get rid of anything we can to reduce the source of multiplication? I understand the cancers there would shrink from both the chemo and the orchidechtomy, but isnt one of the reasons stage 4 isnt fully curable that they really cant be fully eliminated from these two procedures?",

      "Content": "My dad had cycle #2 of doceaqualip (docetaxel nanotech prep) on Dec 5th. Last night in his sleep he passed stool. He woke up after some time from the smell and was sitting there when my brother noticed the light and went to check on him. He was very sleepy and did not know what happened. We took his sugar and it was 234. Called the doc and he said to bring him in the morning to check on sodium/potassium levels. This morning he was very weak. Didn't want to risk falling down. So spoke to the doc and he was speaking coherently but has no recollection that he pooped last night. Doc said given the weakness, let him eat something and then come after resting a bit. I am worried and wondering if anyone has experience with this. I am back in the US and mom is with dad and brother was visiting last night. Thanks for any advise.",

He had to undergo brain surgery. His left brain had moved 12 mm out of position, and they removed 170ml of blood from there. That day when they took my dad to the hospital, they did the various tests and also did a brain MRI and CT when they discovered this was going on. My dad has no memory of the events starting from that night he was very drowsy, he only remembers life before it, and then after the surgery. Did not want this complication on top of his stage 4 prostate cancer, but looks like fate is playing a bad joke on our family.",

I think this is similar to Provenge, but a different protocol. But I havent done a lot of research on this yet. Hoping to hear thoughts from other folks here. Thank you.",
