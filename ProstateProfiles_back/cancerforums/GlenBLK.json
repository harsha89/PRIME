      "Content": "Originally Posted by Otago Glen, you sound terribly confused about the situation. Your posts, if they can be understood, indicate you have not had a DRE. I find it almost impossible to believe that a urologist examined you, and indicated to you that he might do a biopsy and yet he had not yet done a simple DRE. You also failed to indicate what your second PSA is. Though I'm not sure it will be meaningful if you are still suffering from a inflamed prostate. Personally if I was you, I'd slow the entire procedure down before I'd let them do a biopsy. You need to learn more about your particular situation. Either you were not told the facts or you don't fully understand them, or you are mistaken. What was your second PSA? As others have indicated, infections or inflammations can take some time to calm down. Not all of them are bacterial based and as such do not respond to antibiotics. Figure out if you did or did not already have a DRE done by the urologist. This is no small matter. BTW, before the last PSA, was any exam preformed that same day, prior to drawing the blood? For that matter what was done, if anything, on the day they took blood for the first PSA? Also what is your complete history of PSA's. Sounds like you have had 2 done, but we've only heard the results of the first one, right? Getting a biopsy is not something you want to do, like getting a simple test, unless it is really called for. And I'm not saying that just because of the pain and possible infection. Thanks for the reply I will try to be clear. I have had two rectal exams by the colonoscopy specialist who both said my prostate felt inflamed so my psa was done 10 minutes after! He then said he will tell my doctor to refer me to a urologist. The urologist looked at the data and gave me antibiotics for a month and did another psa. I went back a month later and this urologist just listened to my symptoms and said do you want a TRUS as you PSA is marginally high at 2.4. So I am a bit confused as nothing has been clear and both urologist did not do a dre! I think on Monday I will call up and get a clear answer. Please explain why I should not have a biopsy.",

      "Content": "The PSA was done after the symptoms started and not at their worst by the colonoscopist. The urologist a week later checked my tubes and said they were slightly inflamed but did not do a DRE but I had my PSA done again. I went back a month later and after hearing the antibiotics had not cleared my symptoms the urologist suggested the TRUS. Will they definitely take a biopsy or does that depend on how the prostate looks on the ultra sound? thanks.",

      "Content": "I have been given an appointment for an ultrasound on my prostate a possibly a biopsy. My PSA the Urologist said was marginally high at 2.4 Naturally I am worried and want to ask others who have been through all this if their prostate flared up and went down with prostate cancer? My symptoms are some mild burning on the tip and I did have a very sore inflamed prostate in March and could not sit down. I have had aching testicles and tubes with some occasional pain. I had Cipro and things eased off then it flared up again but not as bad as it was in the 1st place. Then I was prescribed trimethoprim for a month in my tubes on the left testicle were aching again. I still have the burning on the tip. Feeling worried I am 41 based in the UK my ultrasound is a month should I ask for one sooner? I had a colonoscopy and that specialist said my prostate felt inflamed. He also gave me a MRI with contrast and apon it being clear suggested my doctor referred me to the Urologist. All the best.",
