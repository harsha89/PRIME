Whilst I do fear it will be in the advanced stages, I now feel way more positive that it will be able to be controlled hopefully for many years. We will now wait to see what the consultant has to say on Thursday. HighlanderCFH my dad will turn 65 in July. Thanks again",

      "Content": "Hi, We only found out last week that my dad has suspected prostate cancer after going to the doctors because he was feeling tired. The doctor did a blood test which came back abnormal. He also did an examination which he was not happy with. He then ordered a blood test to test his PSA levels. This has come back so high that we know it is definitely prostate cancer even though it hasn't yet been confirmed. We're so worried that because it is was so high does this basically mean he only has months to live? It came back with a PSA in the 800's. Whilst looking online I've only ever seen people with PSA at 10-80 so I am terrified with it being so high. Please be honest with how bad it is as I'd rather go to the consultant prepared with the worst rather than getting a massive shock. I know it won't be curable if it's advance but can it be treated or is this it now? Sorry if I've not been very medical, this is completely new to me in the last week. Thankyou",
