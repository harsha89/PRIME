      "Content": "Originally Posted by m i qureshi I had my prostae removed on Sept. 13:04. I haven't gained eraction yet . I have used, Viagra , Cialis and even injected three times Coverjet impulse, once in clinic by doctor , at this time I had slight response but not enough to carry on further . Other two occassions injection was administered by my wife , who happened to be registered nurse. No response at all. Well in that case you may as well try the vacuum pump system, it?s almost guaranteed to work. The only draw back is you can?t be spontaneous as with anything more natural, but if it works for you won?t really care.",
