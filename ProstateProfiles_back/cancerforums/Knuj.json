    "Content": "My husband has been battling prostate cancer for several years. His Gleason score is 10. He had cryogenic surgery and radiation 7 years ago. He has been getting Lupron shots every 3 months for several years and takes 6 chemo pills each day. The PSA had been creeping up for the last year or so and it seems the HRT is not working anymore. We just learned that both of his pelvic lymph nodes are very enlarged with cancer and that his kidney is being blocked so he will need to have a stent inserted. We will be consulting with two oncologists in a couple weeks and it's been suggested that chemo and radiation will probably be needed. We aren't sure if more radiation can be done or not at this point. Does anyone have any knowledge as to how long he might be able to survive at this point? I don't know if we're looking at years or months. Also, at the beginning of his treatment we were told that chemo doesn't work on prostate cancer so I'm not sure why that's an option now.",
