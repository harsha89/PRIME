My surgery was February 4th and the time since has been an interesting time period. First three weeks were nightmarish. I didn't get much sleep at all and pretty much wished I were dead. Catheter stayed in 15 days and I survived, slowly started to get more and better sleep and things have gotten progressively and slowly better. The pain you mention has gone away along with all the others......I just feel little shadows of former pains these days. After a little more than four months--I actually feel pretty good and had a 99.9% dry day yesterday while being quite active. In my experience, you can expect almost anything in the way of pain. A lot happened down there. Most of us get better, it just takes longer than we would like.",

      "Content": "The biopsy is a pain in the ass (well, mostly the prostate itself) in more ways than one, quite bearable, but not something you want to do if you don't have to do it. It also has some risk of dangerous infections that can be troublesome in older men (I'm 67). And......I still have a small amount of discomfort at times and a small amount of dark brown blood in the urine at bowel movements after 14 days. I'm hoping there are no real problems lingering, like a low-grade infection of some kind. Then there's the question of when I go back on aspirin again and the question as to whether going off the aspirin a day regimen puts me at any increased risk for heart attack or stroke (nobody knows for sure, of course). If.....IF your PSA and digital exam are not totally damning, you CAN, as I did, ask for a PCA-3 and the MRI with rectal coil first. The MRI is annoying, but not painful and no risks involved and the information was useful in more ways than one. If mine had been clear I'd have opted for taking a few months before trying more testing. My PCA-3 was negative, but MRI showed \"concerning\" results that meant likely cancer in the prostate, so I then agreed to the biopsy (which turned up two 4/3 samples with the rest clear). In my case I may have just wasted time, but it gave me peace of mind and really only wasted about 10 days. I am lucky enough to be near a world-class facility, and would advise anybody starting this journey to get to the best place that's within reasonable reach in order to minimize risk and maximize good results. Remember that prostate cancer is unique to every man and comparing yourself to others is fairly unproductive. Your experience may well be totally different from any you read about here, so just do your homework and make decisions that feel right to you.",

However, your world-renowned urologist didn't get that reputation by giving bad advice. My intuition tells me he figures you are in such early stages that he feels you can safely go slow. Believe me, while getting surgery too LATE is a big problem.......the MOST damage these days is done by treatment that comes too often and too early--and your rock-star urologist knows that. A lot of the Mayo doctors don't even do routine PSA screening anymore because it is unreliable and it ends up doing more harm than good. Repeated biopsies are not good for you......and that's only the beginning of what's not good for you--the stress and even anguish can be crushing. I remember doctors saying that the left side of my prostate felt a little odd when I was in my 40s.....here I am finally getting my first biopsy and surgery at age 67. Thank God they didn't start messing with me when I was 50.......because some of the happiest and best years of my life would have been ruined for nothing. Maybe your doctor is just protecting you from that.",

      "Content": "Well, you certainly want to delay surgery as long as possible, because while you may be CLOSE to the same afterwards, you'll never be exactly the same and with just a little bad luck may never regain certain functions. That said, you are certainly approaching the limits. I'd have to say that you need to go ahead sooner rather than much later and err on the side of being able to get cancer-free. It would be nice if we could get more precise information to make decisions, but nobody knows for sure what to do in any particular case......they are all pretty much unique.",

      "Content": "Third opinion couldn't hurt (unless he recommends another biopsy--that will hurt). (A little dark humor there.) However, your world-renowned urologist didn't get that reputation by giving bad advice. My intuition tells me he figures you are in such early stages that he feels you can safely go slow. Believe me, while getting surgery too LATE is a big problem.......the MOST damage these days is done by treatment that comes too often and too early--and your rock-star urologist knows that. A lot of the Mayo doctors don't even do routine PSA screening anymore because it is unreliable and it ends up doing more harm than good. Repeated biopsies are not good for you......and that's only the beginning of what's not good for you--the stress and even anguish can be crushing. I remember doctors saying that the left side of my prostate felt a little odd when I was in my 40s.....here I am finally getting my first biopsy and surgery at age 67. Thank God they didn't start messing with me when I was 50.......because some of the happiest and best years of my life would have been ruined for nothing. Maybe your doctor is just protecting you from that.",

On the other hand......I turned out to have a serious prostate cancer with that 2.8 PSA. Go figure. Then again, most guys your (our) age probably have at least a very early stage of prostate cancer (that may never need treatment). We're all guessing here, even the doctors.

Going to a recumbent bike can solve both these problems in some (perhaps many) cases. Awareness of this fact could help a lot of people. I know well that there can be an addiction to certain specific types of exercise because they become part of a man's chosen identity.....but we have to face up to such things and make adjustments.

I also sent a message to Mayo through my page on their website and (this could not be applied to all cases, of course) got a response saying it's perfectly reasonable to limit evening fluids to minimize urine output overnight.....and the rest of the time drink to thirst and do your best to stay hydrated. Since I was a runner for many years I sort of automatically watch my urine color to stay hydrated, so I'm happy with that response. The ability to have a page on the website, send messages to your doctor and access all your medical records is one of the great benefits of being a Mayo customer.",

I would stop drinking by 7pm. My goal was to go through the night without getting up. Get Depends, male diapers and put a pad in it. It should keep you from wetting the bed. You can sleep on a towel for extra protection. You'll see progress over time, especially if you keep a daily chart. Keep track of when you get up during the night, pad usage, etc. Before you know it you will be charting erections, penetration, and your spouse/partners orgasms. Thanks, much, NYC.",

Lotion helps to calm it down but it is relentless. Thanks for your time You need a consult with a back specialist.....may just be sciatica-- \"A set of symptoms including pain caused by general compression or irritation of one of five spinal nerve roots of each sciatic nerve\u2014or by compression or irritation of the left or right or both sciatic nerves. Symptoms include lower back pain, buttock pain, and pain, numbness or weakness in various parts of the leg and foot. Other symptoms include a \"pins and needles\" sensation, or tingling and difficulty moving or controlling the leg. Typically, symptoms only manifest on one side of the body. The pain may radiate below the knee, but does not always. Sciatica is a relatively common form of low back and leg pain, but the true meaning of the term is often misunderstood. Sciatica is a set of symptoms rather than a diagnosis for what is irritating the root of the nerve to cause the pain. Treatment for sciatica or sciatic symptoms often differs, depending on underlying causes and pain levels. Causes include compression of the sciatic nerve roots by a herniated (torn) or protruding disc in the lower back.\" You need a prescription from a good dermatologist for your jock itch. This could be: http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/e...cle/000872.htm Lichen simplex chronicus is a skin condition caused by chronic itching and scratching. Causes This disorder may occur in people who have: Skin allergies Eczema (atopic dermatitis) Psoriasis Nervousness, anxiety, depression, and other emotional problems The problem is common in children, who cannot stop scratching insect bites and other itchy skin conditions. It is also found in children who have chronic repetitive movements. Symptoms This skin disorder leads to scratching which in turn causes more itching. It may start when something that rubs, irritates, or scratches the skin, such as clothing. The person begins to rub or scratch the itchy area. Constant scratching causes the skin to thicken. The thickened skin itches, causing more scratching, which causes more thickening. The skin may become leathery and brownish in the problem area.",

Also, with the horrible winter weather we've had......I COULD NOT have kept up the driving back and forth demanded by a radiation schedule and even the attempt would have been extremely stressful. Surgery won mainly by default. The previously mentioned elimination of the prostate and thus the probable elimination of most or all of the BPH issue was another important consideration.

Why is this procedure not used first to determine if there is cancer since it is more effective in actually determining its presence, and the results could be used for biopsy purposes for grading of the cancer? Is it purely a money thing? The danger of public forums is that one can be influenced by people stating opinions not backed by experience. Be careful of that hazard. I am one who actually had an MRI with endo-rectal coil and dye injected into bloodstream so I speak from experience. The MRI detected my prostate cancer and I then felt comfortable with risking the biopsy to get more detailed information. I insisted on having the MRI PRIOR to the biopsy because the biopsy DOES have significant risk factors. Doctors generally minimize the risk factors, but the risk of the major factor--sepsis--has been increasing in recent years due to more forms of bacteria becoming resistant to antibiotics. Sepsis will put you in the hospital and in rare cases it can kill. Your age and general health level must be considered in figuring your own risk level. Is it all about money? Well.......yes, the biopsy does look like the quick and profitable alternative--taking only about 20 minutes. The MRI takes 45 minutes with at least a half hour of prep prior to that. So, biopsy is more high-volume and thus probably considerably more profitable. I am guessing, but they can probably perform three biopsies in the time spent on an MRI. More important is that the biopsy is traditional--and doctors are big on tradition......locked into it in some cases. As to your question about the PSA test, my answer (again, from actual experience) is that my PSA test was (just like yours) done incorrectly the first time (right after DRE came back with a 4.8 result) and when correctly done came back with 2.8 instead. Significant difference. Deal with the very best doctors with the latest, state of the art equipment you can find and you will have the best chance of the best outcome. Good luck.",

Too many can make things worse. Remember, you're using that sphincter muscle whenever you're moving around and thinking about staying dry. It gets tired. Mayo recommends six kegals before bed and maybe add another six at some point during the day if you really want to after a couple of months. Overusing that sphincter muscle will do harm. Be patient and don't be worried by all these big stories of immediate continence after catheter removal. Everybody goes at their own rate and your chances of being dry in six to nine months are very good. Just give your body time.

Attempting to somehow say that my experience should influence anyone else is just ridiculous. My experience has not been anywhere near as lovely as TCB's experience. While I'm happy for him, I suspect that not many of us could count on such an incredibly smooth road......nor should we. It's usually a mixture, I'd wager. Thinking that the experience of another should influence me (or anyone) is, at best, highly speculative.",

      "Content": "With mine.......I did call the doctor......several times. They said it must be bladder spasms. I was repeatedly told to take the nasty pain-killers they had given me when I left the hospital. I repeatedly told them that those pain-killers caused an erratic heartbeat so I couldn't use them. They said it was my choice and I could use them or not, it was totally up to me. They also said I could fall back on the Tylenol, but that didn't do much, if it did anything, and the suggested doses were very high so I didn't want to keep using it anyway. My only alternative was to head back in to see the doctor and I figured that the way things were going--that would probably end with more delay, more insult, more injury, more painful and annoying treatment and more damage to me in the long run anyway. Anyhow......like you, I survived. I think there was some defect with that catheter and it was irritating the nerves where the major cutting out of the prostate had occurred. My bad luck. My recovery is now progressing at normal or slightly better so I'm satisfied with the outcome, but totally UNIMPRESSED with the way they handled my care after the surgery. It's like they focus on great surgery and then say to hell with you after that. This may have something to do with the fact that they don't profit at all from patients on Medicare.......so you basically get the bum's rush out of there and they expect you to kiss their rock-star feet and be eternally grateful.",

      "Content": "First of all, maybe your family history is a positive thing. If your dad was old enough to have dementia when he was diagnosed he must have been pretty old. Doesn't that give you hope that your cancer may be a non-aggressive type that may not require treatment? In my case, as I was in my late sixties, my doctor said that at my age I probably had prostate cancer because so many men have it at that age (this was early in the process, before I was diagnosed). The only question was......does it need treatment or is it better left alone because it will never impact your life? That's the question for you, I think. Treatment surely will impact your life.....perhaps severely. I suggest a LOT of research before doing anything you can't take back.",

      "Content": "The doctors seem proud that something other than prostate cancer usually kills the prostate cancer victim before the prostate cancer kills him. I figure that it's often the TREATMENT for prostate cancer that kills--because it exacerbates other existing conditions through stress and side effects. Hormone therapy seems to be the worst, but after coming through the \"easy\" robotic surgery and finding it anything but easy, I don't doubt that surgery can also be problematic. I know I didn't get a decent night's sleep for six weeks after surgery and it was easily two months before things began to really improve. That stress probably would have killed me if I hadn't been in good physical condition. From what I read, radiation hits some folks fairly hard, too. Obviously, if you need treatment you must get it, because NOT getting it would be a greater risk, but don't let anybody push you into it too soon, especially if you have other health issues (like heart disease) that might be adversely impacted. So, I'm thinking that the least treatment is the best treatment. If you need it, by all means, get it--but don't get it any sooner than necessary. Remember, we tend to hear more from those whose treatment was a cakewalk and less from those who are no longer with us.",

Doesn't that give you hope that your cancer may be a non-aggressive type that may not require treatment? In my case, as I was in my late sixties, my doctor said that at my age I probably had prostate cancer because so many men have it at that age (this was early in the process, before I was diagnosed). The only question was......does it need treatment or is it better left alone because it will never impact your life? That's the question for you, I think. Treatment surely will impact your life.....perhaps severely. I suggest a LOT of research before doing anything you can't take back.",

      "Content": "The doctors seem proud that something other than prostate cancer usually kills the prostate cancer victim before the prostate cancer kills him. I figure that it's often the TREATMENT for prostate cancer that kills--because it exacerbates other existing conditions through stress and side effects. Hormone therapy seems to be the worst, but after coming through the \"easy\" robotic surgery and finding it anything but easy, I don't doubt that surgery can also be problematic. I know I didn't get a decent night's sleep for six weeks after surgery and it was easily two months before things began to really improve. That stress probably would have killed me if I hadn't been in good physical condition. From what I read, radiation hits some folks fairly hard, too. Obviously, if you need treatment you must get it, because NOT getting it would be a greater risk, but don't let anybody push you into it too soon, especially if you have other health issues (like heart disease) that might be adversely impacted. So, I'm thinking that the least treatment is the best treatment. If you need it, by all means, get it--but don't get it any sooner than necessary. Remember, we tend to hear more from those whose treatment was a cakewalk and less from those who are no longer with us.",

I didn't have a pillow on my 45 minute ride home, but I was able to recline the seat. I still felt EVERY bump and irregularity in the roads. It was not pleasant. Once home, I managed without a recliner (since I don't own one). I just slumped on the softest seats I could find and arranged pillows to get comfortable.

The pain in general is good unless I move too fast and the bladder spasms seem to hit more rarely and with less intensity. Mostly frustrated with hospital as the way they had me wearing the catheter apparently contributed to both the bleeding and the spasms. Cath care instructions conflict and since fittings are a different size you can't do the cleaning as instructed. Couple different cath vendors involved, with slight changes in hardware. New cath started leaking drops on the floor before I even got my clothes back on. Glad I noticed it before I left the room. They replaced it and then gave me spares. Spares? How unreliable are they? Oh well, I'm not in pain right now and I may even get some sleep tonight.",

The man did not say he was lied to.......he said he felt like he was lied to. He's perfectly entitled to that feeling and no excuse for jumping on him. As far as the actual leakage problem goes, it could simply be a temporary condition from being overtired or fighting off a cold or flu bug. Americans are generally sleep deprived. I can tell you from experience that if you have a few nights of little sleep, perhaps along with a few days of stress......your leakage problem will suddenly get worse and you probably will not know why. First rule: Take care of yourself. Get extra rest. Watch your diet scrupulously. You're recovering from a major life trauma that was a physical and psychological and emotional shock. It rocked your world.......body, soul and spirit. And if that's not it, the other suggestions here have been good. Kegels, etc. I'm fairly slender and athletic looking for being almost 68 and my doc always comments and tells me to keep up the exercise and good eating because that's why I'm doing so well.

They have a new kind where they remove the seeds after treatment and that appears to be emerging as the new best choice for many. You have to find a facility that is highly regarded and just do it. However, if they insist on hormone therapy in conjunction with the Brachytherapy......I'd just go for surgery instead. The side effects of hormone therapy are such that it's probably better to use that as last rather than first resort. Side effects vary, but I've heard too many people saying too many bad things about hormone therapy--and some simply refusing it even as a last resort. That's just information I've gleaned from nine months of study, but it's been pretty intense study. I ended up choosing surgery, but that was primarily because I had a fair amount of BPH. (I also wanted to get things over quickly and surgery seemed quick.) I really only found out about the problems with hormone therapy later. Good luck to you.",

I can tell you from experience that if you have a few nights of little sleep, perhaps along with a few days of stress......your leakage problem will suddenly get worse and you probably will not know why. First rule: Take care of yourself. Get extra rest. Watch your diet scrupulously. You're recovering from a major life trauma that was a physical and psychological and emotional shock. It rocked your world.......body, soul and spirit. And if that's not it, the other suggestions here have been good.

This is to test the theory that your sphincter is suffering from burnout.....like an overuse injury. Don't run at all for three days. Then slowly get back into it by running half your normal distance every other day for a week. Eat smart, get plenty of rest and avoid stress. This, coupled with the cutback on Kegels, will be a big enough change that you should expect noticeable improvement by the end of that ten day period......IF your sphincter is suffering from overuse. I'd think this is the way to go, because it's so hard to believe that your sphincter needs even MORE exercise than your already strenuous program. The secondary theory would be that you have a physical ailment like an infection. That's how I see it. Incontinence is pretty mysterious.",

I'd only add that if that little sphincter muscle is SORE..........YOU'RE OVERWORKING IT (caps for emphasis). Overwork will do harm. Age and physical condition are important factors. I am (after a slow seven months) to the point where leakage is little enough that I don't need pads, but sometimes if I'm going to be out and active I'll wear two pair of underwear so none of those few drops can get to the outer clothing. Let me also add that getting plenty of rest is important. If you don't get enough sleep (including, ideally, NAPS) and you are a bit tired......that sphincter will also be a bit tired, your brain will be a bit tired--and you will have more little leaks. Be patient, be smart, listen to the guys who wrote above......and you'll have the best chance of your best possible outcome. As my doc said.......a few drops of urine now and then is no big thing.

As I said before.......if you get sore, you're doing too many. You are not training for the Goddamned Olympics, though your urologist seems to think so. Seven kegels just before you go to sleep is plenty for most people. Sets are for tennis. We're getting our sports all mixed up. A kegel is clamping that sphincter down for ten or 12 seconds and then relaxing for 30 seconds or so. (At least that's what's worked for me.)",

      "Content": "Brave, in this situation I'd do an experiment--do a drastic change and see what results. This is to test the theory that your sphincter is suffering from burnout.....like an overuse injury. Don't run at all for three days. Then slowly get back into it by running half your normal distance every other day for a week. Eat smart, get plenty of rest and avoid stress. This, coupled with the cutback on Kegels, will be a big enough change that you should expect noticeable improvement by the end of that ten day period......IF your sphincter is suffering from overuse. I'd think this is the way to go, because it's so hard to believe that your sphincter needs even MORE exercise than your already strenuous program. The secondary theory would be that you have a physical ailment like an infection. That's how I see it. Incontinence is pretty mysterious.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by Otago Well, ideally you would have been better served by having him tell you to wait a few days or a week for the PSA blood draw. If that was easy for you. Either way, your PSA would probably have been 4.0 or more. Do you know your PSA history? The doctor was not wrong to do some extensive \"digging around\" in the exam. That is exactly the right thing for him to do before making you get biopsy. Right now you may want to get another urologist, but then he will have to re-examine your prostate again and you'll still have to get another PSA.. This time do it prior to the exam, and if possible long enough ahead of time for the new urologist to have the results when you see him for the exam. Then, he'll probably tell you to get a biopsy. Still in the long run, better to deal with someone you feel comfortable with. Whether your PSA is 2.8 or 4.8, with the nodule, they'll tell you to get a biopsy. Or, you can just forget all this and take your chances. Odds are good you'll die from something else before prostate cancer, if you have any, gets to you. That is not a totally unreasonable approach, though some may object to such ideas. Thanks for the info. Yes, doctors tend to want to........doctor. I wish I could get advice from a totally unbiased yet well-informed source. This is an area where almost everybody has at least a little bias, it seems. Yes, the idea that death from something else could save me is a bit counter-intuitive, but it's probably true in this case--the only difficulty is in figuring the odds and making a decision.",

As to your statement on the needles spreading cancer--I can't find any indication that anyone is really keeping track or doing serious research to determine the facts of the matter. Obviously, cancer often spreads to other parts of the body at some point after biopsies, but as to WHY it spreads or whether the biopsy might have been part of the reason it spread........nobody seems to be keeping tabs on it or trying to find correlation between the biopsies and the spread. Maybe they should? Maybe there is reasonable doubt until they do? I don't have a track record of PSA tests although it would be completely normal for them to show as slowly rising to the currently normal 4.8 as I progressed through my 50s and 60s.......and so, that again would be normal and it would only tell us that I'm normal.

      "Content": "Originally Posted by Otago Well, ideally you would have been better served by having him tell you to wait a few days or a week for the PSA blood draw. If that was easy for you. Either way, your PSA would probably have been 4.0 or more. Do you know your PSA history? The doctor was not wrong to do some extensive \"digging around\" in the exam. That is exactly the right thing for him to do before making you get biopsy. Right now you may want to get another urologist, but then he will have to re-examine your prostate again and you'll still have to get another PSA.. This time do it prior to the exam, and if possible long enough ahead of time for the new urologist to have the results when you see him for the exam. Then, he'll probably tell you to get a biopsy. Still in the long run, better to deal with someone you feel comfortable with. Whether your PSA is 2.8 or 4.8, with the nodule, they'll tell you to get a biopsy. Or, you can just forget all this and take your chances. Odds are good you'll die from something else before prostate cancer, if you have any, gets to you. That is not a totally unreasonable approach, though some may object to such ideas. Thanks for the info. Yes, doctors tend to want to........doctor. I wish I could get advice from a totally unbiased yet well-informed source. This is an area where almost everybody has at least a little bias, it seems. Yes, the idea that death from something else could save me is a bit counter-intuitive, but it's probably true in this case--the only difficulty is in figuring the odds and making a decision.",

The chance of complications from a biopsy are low. I got Cipro before and after the biopsy. I would suggest further blood tests at the least. Good luck. Thanks much.

I will get together with my GP and talk things over and if he insists I'll start again with a new urologist that will have better social skills and hopefully, better and safer options for tests. The way I see it, we have ZERO evidence that the nodule is dangerous. Actually, I can remember a doctor telling me that one side of my prostate was a little hard about 30 years ago and I think it's been mentioned a couple of other times. Also, from what I've managed to glean from the internet......at age 67 there's a fairly good chance that I could have a slow-moving form of cancer anyway. So why get this prostate all riled up by brutally stabbing it with 12 needles? Should we let a sleeping dog lie or poke it with sharp objects? I really don't know, but maybe some of the folks here can speak to me from their greater experience and add to my now very limited knowledge. Thanks in advance.",

Either way, your PSA would probably have been 4.0 or more. Do you know your PSA history? The doctor was not wrong to do some extensive \"digging around\" in the exam. That is exactly the right thing for him to do before making you get biopsy. Right now you may want to get another urologist, but then he will have to re-examine your prostate again and you'll still have to get another PSA.. This time do it prior to the exam, and if possible long enough ahead of time for the new urologist to have the results when you see him for the exam. Then, he'll probably tell you to get a biopsy. Still in the long run, better to deal with someone you feel comfortable with. Whether your PSA is 2.8 or 4.8, with the nodule, they'll tell you to get a biopsy. Or, you can just forget all this and take your chances. Odds are good you'll die from something else before prostate cancer, if you have any, gets to you. That is not a totally unreasonable approach, though some may object to such ideas. Thanks for the info. Yes, doctors tend to want to........doctor. I wish I could get advice from a totally unbiased yet well-informed source. This is an area where almost everybody has at least a little bias, it seems.

Do you have other symptoms like weak urine flow or ED issues which point to an enlarged prostate? I had three biopsies ever 6 years to check for PC and never had any issues of infection or pain. I had what I considered a very conscientious and experienced urologist who I trusted enough to do my surgery and believe he has got me cancer free. They do exist and I would suggest you find yourself one. Good luck and stay positive, Fran Thanks, I'm sexually functional (a little slowed down at 67, but working without drugs so far) and I can sleep through until five or six a.m. most nights, so I'd regard my urinary function about par for age maybe better than some.

      "Content": "Referred to urologist because GP Doc thought he felt something on one side of the prostate. I'm 67 and in good health. Urologist says \"You have a nodule.\" He schedules me for a biopsy. I say ok. (What do I know?) Then he sends me for a blood test to get a PSA count. I say, \"When will the results be back?\" He says, \"I don't know.\" Disinterested. Doesn't look at me, just keeps tapping on his computer. I give him a confused stare and presently he says, \"It doesn't make any difference. We need to do the biopsy.\" He mumbles something about the results being useful in determining treatment options. Now, maybe my attitude is tainted by the fact that he was a bit rough with the exam. He did everything except put his foot in there and pretend my prostate was a cigarette butt he was grinding out on the pavement.......but I started to distrust and dislike him at the point he said, \"I don't know.\" I mean, technically--I suppose he didn't know EXACTLY when the results would be back, but he could have said, \"Usually in a day or two,\" or something friendly and helpful. I am, after all, pretty vulnerable at this point and friendly answers to questions would naturally be appreciated. I go home and start researching and I find that the PSA should be taken BEFORE the poking and prodding of the prostate--NOT after. I also find that he really glossed over the risks and problems of the biopsy. He quickly said that infections sometimes occurred. Never mentioned that the biopsy can spread existing cancer. Never mentioned that infections have recently been INCREASING and that bacteria that are resistant to penicillin are an INCREASING problem. Never mentioned a rectal swab to check for dangerous bacteria. Never gave me any numbers to assess the risks but did manage to alienate me. Basically, I felt a bit railroaded, treated like a piece of meat and offended by his callous attitude and the total absence of empathy. So.......I learn a lot on my own on the internet and find that the biopsy is dangerous in at least a couple of ways and find especially interesting a story about three doctors who were in my situation and all three chose NOT to have the biopsy and INSTEAD have some sort of MRI as their first test. I find that the head of the MAYO Clinic teaching operation has referred to the current biopsy procedure as \"medieval and barbaric.\" So.......when I find that my PSA turned out to be 4.8, I cancel the biopsy appointment.

He did everything except put his foot in there and pretend my prostate was a cigarette butt he was grinding out on the pavement.......but I started to distrust and dislike him at the point he said, \"I don't know.\" I mean, technically--I suppose he didn't know EXACTLY when the results would be back, but he could have said, \"Usually in a day or two,\" or something friendly and helpful. I am, after all, pretty vulnerable at this point and friendly answers to questions would naturally be appreciated. I go home and start researching and I find that the PSA should be taken BEFORE the poking and prodding of the prostate--NOT after. I also find that he really glossed over the risks and problems of the biopsy. He quickly said that infections sometimes occurred. Never mentioned that the biopsy can spread existing cancer. Never mentioned that infections have recently been INCREASING and that bacteria that are resistant to penicillin are an INCREASING problem. Never mentioned a rectal swab to check for dangerous bacteria. Never gave me any numbers to assess the risks but did manage to alienate me. Basically, I felt a bit railroaded, treated like a piece of meat and offended by his callous attitude and the total absence of empathy. So.......I learn a lot on my own on the internet and find that the biopsy is dangerous in at least a couple of ways and find especially interesting a story about three doctors who were in my situation and all three chose NOT to have the biopsy and INSTEAD have some sort of MRI as their first test. I find that the head of the MAYO Clinic teaching operation has referred to the current biopsy procedure as \"medieval and barbaric.\" So.......when I find that my PSA turned out to be 4.8, I cancel the biopsy appointment. A 4.8 is NORMAL for a 67-year-old man according to what I've read. I will get together with my GP and talk things over and if he insists I'll start again with a new urologist that will have better social skills and hopefully, better and safer options for tests. The way I see it, we have ZERO evidence that the nodule is dangerous. Actually, I can remember a doctor telling me that one side of my prostate was a little hard about 30 years ago and I think it's been mentioned a couple of other times. Also, from what I've managed to glean from the internet......at age 67 there's a fairly good chance that I could have a slow-moving form of cancer anyway. So why get this prostate all riled up by brutally stabbing it with 12 needles? Should we let a sleeping dog lie or poke it with sharp objects? I really don't know, but maybe some of the folks here can speak to me from their greater experience and add to my now very limited knowledge. Thanks in advance.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by Otago Well, ideally you would have been better served by having him tell you to wait a few days or a week for the PSA blood draw. If that was easy for you. Either way, your PSA would probably have been 4.0 or more. Do you know your PSA history? The doctor was not wrong to do some extensive \"digging around\" in the exam. That is exactly the right thing for him to do before making you get biopsy. Right now you may want to get another urologist, but then he will have to re-examine your prostate again and you'll still have to get another PSA.. This time do it prior to the exam, and if possible long enough ahead of time for the new urologist to have the results when you see him for the exam. Then, he'll probably tell you to get a biopsy. Still in the long run, better to deal with someone you feel comfortable with. Whether your PSA is 2.8 or 4.8, with the nodule, they'll tell you to get a biopsy. Or, you can just forget all this and take your chances. Odds are good you'll die from something else before prostate cancer, if you have any, gets to you. That is not a totally unreasonable approach, though some may object to such ideas. Thanks for the info. Yes, doctors tend to want to........doctor. I wish I could get advice from a totally unbiased yet well-informed source. This is an area where almost everybody has at least a little bias, it seems. Yes, the idea that death from something else could save me is a bit counter-intuitive, but it's probably true in this case--the only difficulty is in figuring the odds and making a decision.",

Remember, when you walk you tend to be working that lone little remaining sphincter almost constantly so as not to leak and that tends to overwork it and it can suffer from burnout.......you must nurture that tiny muscle. So easing off for a bit could be good strategy as Mikem suggested. As you get back into it.....walking every day and alternating two miles and four mile days might be better. My early post surgery routine was to walk around the house (including two flights of stairs) for 15 to 20 minutes daily and five minute walks at least every two hours. My strategy has always been that I end the walking session if I start to get significant leakage. To me that indicates that the sphincter is overtired and further walking may be detrimental. I have a semi-recumbent exercise bike--and at about two months I used it for about ten minutes one day and then 20 minutes the next day and had a few drops of blood in the pad (this was noted later in the day after a walk of about a mile). Later I had a little blood at the start of urine flow on one urination. Checked with doc and he just said to call him if the bleeding continued and ease off on exercise. No more bleeding. So......I kept up my usual routine and added some walks up to three miles outside. I did want to get back on the bike, though, so after waiting about a month I put a box under the front of the bike to make it even more recumbent (this shifts pressure to the tailbone and back rather than the prostate area) and tried it again. No blood and I have been gradually increasing my time on the bike. I think that, after enough healing has occurred so you can safely use the bike, the recumbent bike is actually better than walking because you don't tend to leak as you do with walking, therefore the sphincter does not get stressed. I do six ten-second Kegals (with thirty seconds in between them) before bed at night as Mayo recommended and have added another set of six during the day now with their permission. At four months I am still using a pad during the day at times when I'm active and no pad when fairly inactive. Leakage is minor, but still happens. I'm 67 years old and in pretty good health otherwise. Age is indeed a factor in how soon you can expect to be dry.......or shall we say, mostly dry. I don't think most doctors expect perfection in this issue. It was revealing to me when my doctor said, \"A few drops of urine once in a while is no big deal.\" Reading between the lines, I think the message is that few of us can expect to ever be as dry as we were before surgery......at least that's my impression. My main advice I can give from my experience is: be patient, don't worry, be moderate in exercise and all things, drink enough water but not too much and enjoy your life. Especially go easy on alcohol and caffeine. I drink decaf (which still has a bit of caffeine) and I always have a glass of wine in the evening.

I'm now almost 12 months out and while I'd never want to do those first three months again, it was better than keeping the cancer. My PSA is normal and I'd call the incontinence/ED part of it at above 95% of normal. I don't have to use pads anymore, but nice thick cotton underwear is recommended just in case. If you're younger than me, (I'm 69) you'll probably recover faster and with less annoyance. My doc says a few drops of urine here and there is just no big deal. He's right, of course, but it would be nice to have zero drops of urine. You tend to wonder if you'll ever get to that level. I hope I do. So, it's been unpleasant at times, but you'll get through it like most of us do. Read all the stickies here carefully and take note of all the good advice. You should do just fine, but don't be fooled by the \"walk in the park, piece of cake\" crap. Some may be that lucky, but that does NOT mean that everybody is that lucky. I'd call it a walk in the dark and a piece of cheap steak. It's not enjoyable, but if you keep your wits about you......you can get through it and beat cancer.",
