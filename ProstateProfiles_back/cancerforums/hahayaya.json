      "Content": "Hello, everyone, I would like to pop up and say hi first. Just joined the group! I am a 65 years old male. I had rising PSA for 5/6 years with a score of 10. This year in May it has raised to be 12. Just went to a urologist and done a DRE. He felt the hardness on the right hand side. I do have family history of prostate cancer. My father had PC diagnosed at his 60s. He passed away at his 80s after the Prostate Cancer surgery. Right now I am waiting to do a prostate biopsy the week after next. It will a ultrasound guided. The Uro plans to take 12-14 samples. I would like to ask any suggestions from you, gentlemen of what to do after the biopsy if the biopsy shows cancer cells. Maybe I should be asking for a second opinion from a research/teaching hospital as well. We are in the Bay Area. Any good doc here to recommend?",
