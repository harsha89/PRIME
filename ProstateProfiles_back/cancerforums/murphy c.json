    "Content": "I am in the process of picking a surgeon to perform my robotic surgery for gleason 7, prostate contained cancer. I have talked to a surgeon at a major medical center here in Texas but I can't find anything on line about him. He states that he has done over 600 daVinci surgeries so there should be feedback from his patients but I don't know where to find it. Any suggestions would be appreciated.",
