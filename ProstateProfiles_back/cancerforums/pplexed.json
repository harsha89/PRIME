I just received the results from ExoDX Prostate Intelliscore and they are 51.71, with a cut off of 15.6. Thus, agressive Pca Gleason 7 or higher. Any one else have this test and have similar results with a negative biopsy? My uro is not dismissing, however he has stated that my psa should be higher? Thoughts?",

I had a previous FISH showing four cells with polysomy for chromosomes 3,7,9,17, however my bladder work-up with a CXbladder and cysto was negative. Based upon my symptoms, would you be of the opinion that I have aggressive PCA (per low T), or prostatitis? Also, would you recommend a PCA 3 urine biomarker? Pplexed",
