      "Content": "Hi Everyone, It has been almost 11 months since my Radical Robotic Prostatectomy performed by Dr. David Samadi @ Lennox Hill Hospital in NYC. My incontinence is gone completely. I have one major issue and that is I get a terrible, severe pain in my large hip muscles in my but and surrounding area when I get \"Aroused\" and I start to get an erection. It feels like a wave of pain that is like a \"Brain Freeze\" but in my hips, all across my backside. I don't this pain any other times except when I am getting a stimulated erection. I have type II diabetes and maybe it is neuropathy pain? This pain is so severe that I stops me from having a natural erection. Has anyone experienced this pain condition??? What are your experiences and what have you done to treat this??? FrankP",

My erections can happen if aroused but the Arousal pain stops the process. It is a Tingling Pain like getting a \"Brain Freeze\" in my Hips!!!! it is a very odd condition. I only get it when I am getting aroused. I have looked into it further and I found that it could be Bursitis in the hip muscles. I get all across my hips in the big muscle groups. I don't get the pain at my penis nor at the surgery area, just all across my hips and some into my thighs. It is like an anxiety attack. FrankP",

The incontinence is almost 100% gone now. The ED is very much a work in progress and I really do not have any sensation. I go back to my Psychologist on Wed. this week my second visit. I urge anyone having difficulties dealing with the changes to you body and coping with how your body has changed, to go to talk to a health professional and get it all off your chest. The burden of coping is very overwhelming and the Stress is unbearable. I have some \"ok\" moments but most of the time it is very very hard to deal with. I have read what many have said that it takes time. That is the hardest part. I will take months if not years to recover fully. I see my Urologist on the 24th. I will bring him up to speed as to what I have been going through and what help I have sought. FrankP",

      "Content": "Hi Guys, I went to speak to a Psychologist tonight. We spoke 2 hours about everything. It was good to talk to someone that wanted to listen and that understood the Entire Anxiety, Sadness and Mental Emotional Pain I am going through after my Prostate Cancer Surgery. I told him about all of the stresses in my life and my fear and anxiety of not being able to perform and be the same person I was before the Surgery. I told him that for me, it has been very difficult to understand that I am not the same as I was before the Surgery and that the Scars on my stomach Remind me every day of what I have been through. We all have this situation to face, to deal with and to cope with. We have fears of not being able to be a man for our lover. I know I have this fear of not being able to perform for my Girlfriend who is 12 years younger than me and I worry about my longer term future with the condition and that the Cancer may come back. It is about 6 months now and my incontinance is about 100% gone now. I have been told by doctors and people posting that I am still early into my recovery and Patience is the most important thing to keep in mind and sexual function can and will return. I have been going out of my mind these last few months and I have looked for anything to get a spark or a positive response to make myself believe I am getting better. I was at my Cardiologist yesterday and he said that much of the problem is in my head and that I have to relex and give it time. So with that in mind, I urge anyone having problems coping and dealing with the Post Cancer Surgery Stress to talk to someone, your Doctor or a Psychologist and know that it Does help and it Does give you hope for a recovery. I thank all of you for all your Support, FrankP",

I Broke my back in car accident when I was 23 causing a compression fracture of (T-9, T-12 & L-1). At 39, diagnosed with Type 2 Diabetes (blood sugar 779 / Triglycerides over 2000 / very high blood pressue & always fighting to keep my blood sugar down! At 51, diagnosed with Prostate Cancer and had my Prostate CAncer Surgery on September 15, 2014! I am a Prostate Cancer Patient and had my Robotic Radical Prostatectomy surgery on September 15, 2014 @ Lennox Hill Hospital with Dr. David Samadi performing the surgery using the Da Vinci Robot. He is quite frankly, THE BEST! The Prostate Cancer Surgery took about 2 hours and I was in the recovery room for about a few hours after that. I woke up with the Catheter in place and I spent one night in the hospital. I went home at about 4:00 PM the next day. Dr. Samadi's private Hospital Wing at Lennox Hill Hospital is a marvel of an Ultra Clean Environment with the most advanced Technology. His Hospital Staff was Exceptionally Warm, Comforting, Soothing and very attentive to my needs. I can not say enough about Dr. Samadi and his supporting Staff. He and his Staff are the best! Original PSA : 8.9. Came down to 5.6 prior to Biopsy. Biopsy found 25% Prostate Cancer. Gleason Scores : 3+4=7 & 4+3=7 Post-Op Pathology : Cancer found to be 42% of Prostate involved all contained inside Prostate. Seminal Vesicles, Lymph Nodes and Margins : ALL NEGATIVE! 1st Post-Op PSA (Nov. 2014) = 0.01 (Undetectables) 2nd Post-Op PSA (Feb. 2014) = 0.02 (Undetectable) The Surgery and the healing went well. Very small amount of blood in urine the first few weeks and then bleeding stropped. Had incontinence the first 3 months after surgery. Now at about 5 1/2 months, the Incontinence is about 98% resolved and I stopped using \"Depend Thin Shields\" at about 4 1/2 months. At about 3 months or so I started to have very bad Anxiety and sadness. Mentally I have been feeling that my biggest fear and dread of the Erectile Dysfunction will not get better! I had false hopes that things were getting better and that I would return to my former state prior to the Prostate Cancer Surgery. I have had a false impression of the reality of my condition. Now at almost 6 months, I have decided to seek out an Oncology Counselor to help me cope with and deal with my \"Changed\" physical and mental Condition. I do not feel myself anymore and it is very hard to deal with this and it has been difficult to cope with the many other health issues I have. I will keep you informed as to how my condition progresses. Yours truly, Frank P.",
