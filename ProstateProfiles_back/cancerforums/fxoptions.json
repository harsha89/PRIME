      "Content": "Hi Guys. Well it been about 2 years since my last post and surgery and all has been going fine. still no real movement in my manhood but that was expected ( Non-Sparing surgery), and leakage only once in a while, but no big issue. The problem is my last PSA test came back .1 all along it has been undetectable. I have been going to Sloan every 6 months and all have come back <.05 my reg.Dr. has also been checking it once a year ( Regular PSA total Test) and that has been coming back at <.1 so all good until this last test from my dr which came back at =.1 so it went from <.05 on 5/18 to .1 on 10/18. that is fairly quick doubling time. Any thoughts? I am going to get it checked again this week. 12/17/2016 Surgery Surgical Pathology: Focal extracapsular extension: The location of the extracapsular extension is left posterior mid Surgical Margins: Tumor present at apical margin Tumor present at left anterior margin Staging pT3a (extracapsular extension) PSA Tests uPSA 2/17 = <.05 (Sloan) PSA 4/17 = <.1 (Dr) uPSA 5/17 = <.05 (Sloan) PSA 9/17 = <.1 (DR.) uPSA 11/17= <.05 (Sloan) uPSA 5/18 = <.05 (Sloan) PSA 10/18 = .1 (Dr).

      "Content": "thanks Dj for the reply. I never ask my regular Dr to check my Psa. he just does it with my regular blood work every so often ( once a year or so, guess he is just. trying to be thorough). I am going to him tomorrow and seeing if he can do a PSA Post Prostatectomy blood test with quest which goes out two decimal point places instead of the Total PSA test which he does I am also calling Sloan to see if they can push up my Regular uPSA test which is set for Nov 15 th. and try to get it done this week instead, I am just hoping the .1 is wrong",

T1a: Not Palpable in DRE. found incidentally, when tissue is removed by a TUR:5% or less of the removed tissue is cancerous T1b: Not Palpable in DRE. Greater than 5% of the removed tissue is cancerous T1c: Not Palpable in DRE, identified by needle biopsy because of elevated PSA level T2a Palpable: involves less than half of one lobe of the prostate T2b Palpable: involves more than half of one lobe but not both lobes of the prostate T2c Palpable: involves both lobes of the prostate T3,T4 palpable : penetrates the wall of the prostate and /or involves the seminal vesicles I hope this helps, but like the advise above the book is excellent by Dr Patrick Walsh, Surviving Prostate Cancer",

My final Pathology report came back with a few concerns and would love some advise on what to do if anything. Final Grading was pT3a Gleason 7 3+4 lymph nodes 0 Surgical Margins 2: Tumor present at apical margin Tumor present at left anterior margin Focal extracapsular extension The location of the extracapsular extension is left posterior mid Should I get treatment with Rad in a few months? Most of the articles I read say with the positive margins and EPE you should get extra treatment? or should I wait until PSA testing ? My doctor is a wait and see guy in general so I know what he will say at our next meeting.",

      "Content": "Hi, I am new to this, so please excuse my ignorance on this subject. Below are the results of a CT scan I had for diverticulitis before a colonoscopy I will have on 10/11/2016. CT results pelvic :Prostate shows heterogeneous density and nodular apex indenting the base of the bladder. It measures about 6.3 x 3.9 x 5.4 cm (CCxAPxW). There is no suspicious pelvic adenopathy I was told to make appointment with a Urologist, which I did. He stated that he can feel the nodule and it is NOT small. I had a PSA test back on 11/2016 was 1.9 and another on 9/2016 (after results of CT scan) it was 2.5 . The Urologist said he did not like the velocity and the fact that he can feel the Nodule, coupled with the fact that I am only 55 and healthy I should have a biopsy( on 10/13). Should I be worried? is the prostate large? Is it worse that the nodule is on the apex ? What % of nodules are cancerous ? I do have issues urinating. Any input will be helpful thank you",
