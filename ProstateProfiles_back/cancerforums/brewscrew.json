      "Content": "Thanks for all the responses and insight. I arrived at my dads a little while ago and I have more info. He is 64 y/o. He said his weight loss was over an 8 month time period. He believes his weight loss is due to eating less and being more active (went back to work after a short retirement). 12 cores. TRUS biopsy. Right prostatic tissue (focal atrophy, focal minimal chronic inflammation and a few atypical acini) Left prostatic tissue (adenocarcinoma, 3+3=6, 1/6 core involved, tumor length: .15cm, tissue length: 6cm, 2.5% tissue involved) Also found out he has to get a pace maker(he is scheduling this asap so his heart will be as healthy as can be if intervention is needed.) Any idea what an out of pocket cost would be for a second opinion? (IF his insurance doesn't cover it) What is the most comprehensive test for the severity of PC and for whole body scan. I heard a PET scan is the best but is pricey and hard to get insurance to cover.",

      "Content": "My dad called me yesterday with news that his test results showed he had PC. This devastating news took my breath away. Immediately I thought to myself get surgery and get it out of you. I was even more shocked and confused when he told me the plan was to wait and see what happens while periodically monitoring changes. This made absolutely no sense to me at all, which led me to do some research and fortunately I found this forum. I've learned a lot so far from others post's and from the stickies (thank you all). It has relieved some of my stress and is somewhat comforting learning from others experiences. However I'm still very concerned. I don't have a lot of specific's about his test results yet(he lives in a neighboring state), but i'm going to visit him today. He went for his annual exam this June. His PSA #'s were high. The DR. gave him some meds to see if the levels would decrease and they did not. He had a biopsy done and found out the awful results yesterday. The doctor said this was a \"slow-growing\" type and it was in it's early stage. But his symptoms seem to be telling me something different. He has lost a lot of weight (20 lb guesstimate) to the point that people are asking my mom is something wrong with him. His demeanor has changed somewhat also(seems lethargic). I'm definatly going to try to convince him to get another opinion on the matter. His gleason score is 6. Tumor size is .15cm and tissue involved is 2.5%. That is all the info I have for now. I'm really concerned about the reasoning for his unexplained weight loss. I've read somewhere that it is a sign of metastasis. Can anyone who is currently practicing AS tell me if they've experienced such an unexplained weight loss? Thanks",
