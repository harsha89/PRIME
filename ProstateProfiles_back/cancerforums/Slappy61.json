    "Content": "HI, It has been 3 years since brachytherapy. I'm 61. 3+4 Gleason. Am curious about some recent developments. First, ever since the procedure, I've had tenderness in the area between the anus and genitals (assume but not exactly sure if this discomfort is coming from my prostate). The tenderness occurs after prolonged sitting. Is it normal for this soreness to continue to happen 3 years out? (It was a bit pronounced riding a bike yesterday). Second, I have blood in my semen. My doc is not too nervous about this. He says much of the issues caused by brachytherapy occur after 2-3 years. Is this your experience too? (It could be coincidental but I first noticed it after a couple of bike rides 3 months ago.) thanks, jeff",
