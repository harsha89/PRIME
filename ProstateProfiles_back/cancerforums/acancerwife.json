    "Content": "Hi. I'm new to this forum and reaching out to see if someone here has had a similar experience and is willing to share their knowledge or perspective with me. My husband was diagnosed with stage 4 prostate cancer roughly 14 months ago, with 3 bone mets. Treatment has included lupron, casodex and lifestyle improvements. His PSA has steadily declined and is now at .01. His follow-up bone scan shows the lesions are no longer present. His doctor says that bodes well for his prognosis, but hasn't given us a lot of specifics. I don't see a lot of information on lesions resolving, and wonder: 1. does that change the staging of the cancer? 2. Is this considered remission? We are feeling pretty blessed, but I am actually wondering: how good is this news? Specifics on just how this changes his prognosis? Thank you for reading, and I wish you well on your healing journey.",
