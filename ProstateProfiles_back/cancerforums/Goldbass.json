      "Content": "Hi, I'm new here- this looks like a great site. I have recently had a rise in PSA 14 years my radical prostatectomy. That's considered pretty unusual. But two PSA tests in the past 6 months read 0.2 after 14 years of .1 or less. I am 64, in decent health, could lose 10 lbs. I'm mulling over watchful waiting vs. radiation therapy (w/o hormone regime) It would be great to hear from you who had the salvage radiation treatment, what the side effects were like during, and after your treatment. Thanks, David",

      "Content": "I want to thank all of you for your input. Last week I had an MRI done with a coil- it wasn't too bad of a procedure. I met the next day with my highly recommended oncologist, and his trusty resident. They had requisitioned slides of my post surgery biopsy from 2001. Nothing of concern turned up in either the MRI or the review of my biopsy. I was definitely a T1c, 3+3, and no evidence that my cancer was not confined. HOWEVER... my PSA is now .2 after being .1 or less for 14 years. The onc offered me radiation and said I had a great chance of squashing the cancer once and for all. But he also said watchful waiting was a reasonable approach given the slow growth of the cancer. My questions to him about the pct. of patients he had treated who complained to him of the aftereffects of radiation were not addressed by either of the docs. They just acknowledged that incontinence and further impotence were possible. I say further impotence because I still have pretty decent erections and I have a sex life. If the price of no cancer in my body is being constantly preoccupied with a faulty plumbing system, I'm willing to wait and watch. They scheduled me for another PSA in 6 months. I'm going to check it in 3.",
