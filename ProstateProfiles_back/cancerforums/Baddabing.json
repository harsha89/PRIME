      "Content": "I just finished #39 of my proton treatments. Finished!! The problem with the slow urination is the prostate is getting irritated by the radiation and is inflamed this can cause the flow to get real slow. I was told by my Dr. to take 2 cranberry pills and Alieve each day. When that did not work they put me on flowmax taken after my last meal. It worked immediately. Talk to your dr. now it can be fixed today.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by HighlanderCFH Welcome to the forum, Bing, Can you tell us your age? In any case, 5.28 is not a horrifically high PSA, so it bodes well for this being a curable cancer, still confined to the prostate, etc. My own advice would be surgery. But I would not consider proton. I'm not familiar with VMAT, which apparently is another way of delivering radiation treatments. If you are absolutely ruling surgery out -- and will not reconsider -- I would seek out a very highly experienced radiation oncologist and talk about either external beam radiation or radioactive seeding (brachytherapy). These two methods will treat the entire prostate and are equal with surgery in terms of cure rate. Proton (and probably VMAT) only target where the cancer is thought to be -- and a standard 12-13 core biopsy misses other tumors about 20% of the time. That is why treating the entire prostate (through surgery, or the two radiation methods I mentioned) is the best way to go. Also be aware that the side effects of EBR or seeding are about the same as with surgery. There are potential (and often probable) side effects with ANY type of treatment. With all this being said, if Gleason 6 is the only type of PC involved, you have an overwhelmingly good chance of being cured because Gleason 6 is seldom a fatal form of the disease. And that is great news for you! There will be others jumping in with their own opinions (remember that we're all just patients here, not doctors), experiences and advice. Good luck! Chuck I just turned 60 and thought about seeds but was informed that my prostate is enlarged and would need to be on hormones for about 3-4 months to shrink it for the seeds.

      "Content": "This is my first post and I am not used to talking about this, but I need help trying to decide on a treatment to treat my prostate cancer. On Nov. 4th I visited a local Urologist only since it was getting close to the end of the year and I had no co-pays and I was see all doctors for checkups. I have never been to a Urologist, he did a prostate exam and took some blood samples. I was told that my prostate was slightly enlarged. That\u2019s it. A couple of days later my landline and cell phone were ringing. It was the nurse from the Urologist. It\u2019s never good when they call you. She informed me that my PSA was 5.28 and it should have been between 2-4. She then said they would like me to come into the office for a prostate biopsy. I said OK picked a date and hung up. Then I asked my wife (an RN) what in the world is a PSA and how do they do a prostate biopsy. I was very unpleasantly enlightened. A couple of weeks later I had the pleasure of getting this biopsy (13 pops). Five days later I called the doctor\u2019s office to get my results. I got more than I ever expected, over the phone the nurse told me that 4 of the biopsies came back positive with cancer and the doctor would like to see me and my family in two days to discuss the results. I slept good that night finishing off half a bottle of Gentleman Jack. We saw the Urologist and he said I have microscopic cancer. My PSA was 5.28 and out of 13 biopsies 4 cores came back with a gleason score of 3+3=6 on the left side. His recommendation was for robotic surgery to remove the prostate. My family and I decided that I am NOT going to do the surgery. I have now gone to two large Oncology offices. I feel like I am now going to fancy car dealerships. I am looking at either Proton Therapy or VMAT Treatment. Each dealership (Oncologist Office) has given me reasons Not to use the other treatment. I hope to get some impartial info on positives and negatives of Proton or VMAT treatment. I am now totally confused and need help trying to decide on one of these two treatments.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by Jim215 Since the OP had treatment with SpaceOAR (Space Organs At Risk) gel two years ago, he is likely outside of the U.S. because the procedure was only recently approved by the FDA in April, 2015. According to the literature, it is primarily used to protect the rectal wall from radiation directed at the prostate and prostate bed. The injected liquid (supposedly) turns into a gel for about a 3-month period, then is intended to dissipate and dissolve within the body and exit via urine after 3 to 6 months. Well, I will be having this procedure done this afternoon at UF Health in Florida. I have researched and I have heard many good reports outside the US mostly Australia. I will let you know how it goes in my other post on the SpaceOAR gel topic. I am a bit nervous 6 hours and counting.",

For Tuesday, I am scheduled to have my 4 gold markers inserted into the prostate and the new SpaceOAR Gel inserted.",

      "Content": "I am set to begin proton treatments for my prostate cancer at the end of February in NE Florida. Not sure if you are aware that there are 39 treatments with proton therapy and for each one a sort of balloon is inserted and filled wit a saline solution to separate the prostate and the rectum. I was offered a new way to space the rectum from the prostate instead of the \"balloon method\". It is a gel, placed between the prostate and rectum. It's called SpaceOAR hydrogel and it is supposed to push the rectum out of the high dose radiation region. It's new in the US but has been done in other countries, is anyone familiar with this procedure? I am leaning heavily on doing this shortly.",

As you wrote, it was intended to minimize radiation exposure to the rectum. I decided to sign on because it made perfect sense and I had no real rectal side effects during or after treatment and it has remained that way for 11 months post brachy treatment. They said it might feel it but I didn't. Hope this helps. Mark thanks, that is what I wanted to know.",

      "Content": "I just felt I needed to put a post out there now that it has been 6 months since I finished my Proton radiation. I went through Proton Therapy for my prostate cancer six months ago. I have not seen many posts with information on the choice of Protons so I will add my own information for others. It started for me November 2015, I just turned 60. I went to see a Urologist for the first time. He told me I had a slightly enlarged prostate and then drew some blood. A week later my landline and cell phone were ringing. It was the nurse from the Urologist. She informed me that my PSA was 5.28 and it should have been between 2-4. She then said they would like me to come into the office for a prostate biopsy. A couple of weeks later I had the pleasure of getting this biopsy (13 pops). A week later I called the doctor\u0092s office to get my results. I got more than I ever expected, over the phone the nurse told me that 4 of the biopsies came back positive with cancer and the doctor would like to see me and my family in two days to discuss the results. We saw the Urologist and he said I have microscopic cancer T2. My PSA was 5.28 and out of 13 biopsies 4 cores came back with a Gleason score of 3+3=6 on the left side. His recommendation was for robotic surgery to remove the prostate. I wanted to get consultations on all my options available to me. Later that same day we went to a \u0093privately owned\u0094 Proton center about 5 minutes from my home in Jacksonville. My family meet with the technicians, social workers, nurses and Oncologist. It was a beautiful facility which has been using the Proton beam radiation for approximately 6 months. We were very impressed with the doctor and his staff. Two days later we went to another Oncologist in Jacksonville. He specialized in external radiation beam and Brachytherapy (seeds). This doctor informed us that he was one of the top doctors in the nation treating prostate cancer. He said that because of my enlarged prostate, he would not do Brachytherapy without first putting me on hormone therapy to reduce my enlarged prostate. He then recommended Photon radiation (VMAT Treatment). His VMAT was the latest state of the art with precise imaging tools attached to the gantry to help be extremely precise this the photon beam. Once again we were very impressed with the doctor and his staff. I spoke with a business acquaintance who a few years ago had gone through treatments at UF Health for prostate cancer, he was very pleased with his treatments and the results. I called UF Health Proton Institute for information and two days later I had an overnight package at my door with two books and lots over very informative information from UF Health PI. My eye doctor had a patient who had prostate cancer a few years earlier and offered to give him my phone number. That person did call me and informed me that he had prostate cancer and was treated at UF Health PI. He said that his treatment at this facility was outstanding. I made consultative appointment for at UF Health PI for 12/31/15. I hate to repeat myself but this facility also impressed us. Now it is to my advantage to be living in Jacksonville Florida. I have more choices than most for treatment of my prostate cancer. I have locally Baptist MD Anderson Cancer Center, The Mayo Clinic Florida, T*** Oncology for Prostate Cancer, A***** Proton Center and UF Health Proton Institute. They are all excellent looking facilities with great reputations. It felt almost as though I was going to new car dealerships. I sent a lot of info to my sons, my sister and my wife (who is an RN). While my wife and I were eating out with another couple the subject of prostate cancer came up and to my surprise he had prostate cancer and had gone through surgery. When I asked his opinion, he informed me if he had been eligible to go through proton therapy that\u0092s what he would have chosen. However do to some metal replacement parts in his hip and knee he was not a candidate for the Proton radiation. The choice was not an easy one for me. Watchful waiting was not an option that my family wanted me to consider. I decided to not wait while I still have choices in treating the cancer. Next is either surgery, external or proton radiation. All have the same prostate cancer cure rate of 98%. My wife was NOT in favor of me going through the surgery. It is the lowest cost and the quickest of the options. I was not happy with having to use a catheter for a few weeks. I looked at all the possible side effects and I chose to go with the Proton therapy. Of my two choices in Jacksonville for proton, I chose to go with UF Health Proton Institute because they have a longer track record of 10 years and I actually know 2 people that went to UFHPI. Once I decided on UFHPI, I called and made an appointment to meet and agree on my doctor. Friday Jan. 22nd patient staging lead called to set up 3-day work up. Should begin Mon. 2/1 thru Wed. 2/3. Once this is done my Proton Therapy should begin on Feb. 29th and end April 22nd (39 days, 8 weeks). She also said I should have a colonoscopy prior. On Jan. 27th I was offered a new way to space the rectum from the prostate instead of the \"balloon method\". It is a gel, placed between the prostate and rectum. It's called SpaceOAR hydrogel and it is supposed to push the rectum out of the high dose radiation region. It's new in the US and had just been given the FDA approval. I agreed to be one of the first (a guinea pig) for the SpaceOAR gel. The Colonoscopy was delayed until Friday Feb. 12th. On Feb. 18th I got the notice of my upcoming 3 day workup by FedEx. Monday I was scheduled to have a chest x-ray and an MRI of the pelvic area. Tuesday, I was scheduled to have my 4 gold markers inserted into the prostate along with the new SpaceOAR Gel being inserted. On Monday Feb. 23rd I had my 1st day workup, which was an orientation of the UF Health Proton facility, we then met with a financial counselor who took $$$$ which was my catastrophic out of pocket max. I had a chest X-Ray met with my nurse and went over the insertion of SpaceOAR Gel and then had a pelvic MRI with contrast performed. I had the SpaceOAR gel inserted and have never had any side effects from this procedure. For more info on this procedure, search for SpaceOAR to see read the post I wrote in February. I started my Proton treatments on Thursday 3/10 at UF Health PI. My only complication was that I had a problem with slow urination. I learned that this was because of my enlarged prostate. It was getting irritated by the radiation and was inflamed. This caused the flow to get real slow. I was told by my Dr. to take 2 cranberry pills and an Alieve each day. On Monday 3/21 which was my 8th treatment, they put me on flowmax. It worked immediately. On April 21st I began to get freckles (slight sunburn) the size of a softball on both hips. On May 3rd, I completed my 39th treatment with the proton therapy. I was one of the first patients here in NE Florida to have this new SpaceOAR gel. Except for the day of insertion which IMO was painful, there have been absolutely NO side effects and it made each treatment a piece of cake not needing the balloon! I recommend a higher dose of pain killers before the initial insertion but that was just me. The two gentleman that had it done before me felt no pain at all. I weened myself off of the Flowmax and was no longer using it 6 weeks after my last treatment. Important things to know about this facility: 1. Every second and fourth Wednesday at 10:15 AM there is a Men\u0092s prostate support group and a separate companion\u0092s support group that leads into the Wednesday FREE catered lunch. 2. Every Wednesday at noon there is a FREE lunch. 3. If you stay at the 3rd and Main housing there are usually plenty of things to do. I was told by some of the prostate patients that they felt like they were on a radiation vacation. The two most important issues were that within 3 days after my final proton treatment my PSA was at 1.9 and my 6 month follow up PSA level is currently 0.6. Any questions on this procedure you can email me at [email protected].",

Currently every 6 months I will be getting follow up exams - How long does it take for the SpaceOAR to be resorbed/cleared? It should be fully dissolved, they said about 6 months to be absorbed.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by Michael F Hi Baddabing! Re \"Your treatment has been deemed not medically necessary\" First and foremost: Your Treatment certainly appears to have been medically effective!!! Congrats! It seems insane that: 1) This was not 100% \"pre-approved\" in advance of treatment. You paid your Out of Pocket re$ponsibility in advance. 2) You are receiving a denial of claims letter 8 months after the procedure. What is the UF Health PI Center telling you? Are you responsible for the balance? Here is UFHPIC's vague answer to \"The BIG Question:\" Q. Will my health insurance provide coverage for proton therapy to treat different kinds of cancer? A. Generally, proton therapy is covered by Medicare or other insurance providers in the United States. To reduce the potential of financial uncertainties, this information will be reviewed with you prior to your consultation. We have a full-time staff of financial counselors who will discuss your coverage and answer any questions that you may have. Treatment for PC is never on an emergency basis, so all patients should be informed of their insurer's approval and 'estimated' out of pocket costs well in advance of treatment/therapy. It appears that PBT is covered for only a few conditions above the neck. Ror example, here is United Healthcare's Guidelines Effective Nov 2016: Proton beam radiation therapy is proven and medically necessary for treating the following indications: Intracranial arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) Ocular tumors, including intraocular/uveal melanoma (includes the iris, ciliary body and choroid) Skull-based tumors (e.g., chordomas, chondrosarcomas or paranasal sinus tumors) Proton beam radiation therapy is unproven and not medically necessary for treating ALL other indications, including but not limited to: Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) Bladder cancer Brain and spinal cord tumors Choroidal hemangioma Esophageal cancer Gynecologic cancers Head and neck cancers Hepatocellular carcinoma Lung cancer Lymphomas Pancreatic cancer Prostate cancer Vestibular tumors (e.g., acoustic neuroma or vestibular schwannoma) Let us know \"the rest of the story\" and how UFHPIC's resolves this issue. Meanwhile, continue to keep us updated with your low PSA results. May they forever remain on the rock bottom! MF Well here is the latest and final update on BC/BS Federal's response to my claim: Back in December of 2015 BC/BS DID give my wife the OK to go ahead with UF Health Proton Therapy. The hospital had also been given the OK for me to have proton therapy at that time (which to this day I have kept on my voice mail). On Feb. 17th I received a voice mail from a finance employee from UF Health saying I was approved and will start my 3 day work up and to bring in on Monday Feb, 22nd my out of pocket deductible of $5,000. So I did as she asked and started my work-up. Throughout my 39 treatments I continually asked this finance person about my claim. She kept responding not to worry this is normal from BC/BC. Up until my last two weeks of treatment she changed her story, saying publicly I should never have been allowed to start my proton therapy. Well I did worry and spoke with the Director of the Hospital who put his director of finance manager on this. This women was excellent. She told me and put in writing that if my BC/BS appeals were denied the hospital would NOT expect me to pay out of pocket since their finance person gave me the OK to start. So that made me feel better but I still as my post shows kept fighting. I am BC/BS Federal of Florida and I went in person to my local BC/BS Fed reps. They were very helpful also. They instructed me that BC/BS Federal allows me to after an appeal denial to send them a LETTER OF RECONSIDERATION. If that fails I have one more appeal to the Office of Personnel Management. As I stated a few posts back BC/BS Federal has denied my letter of reconsideration on the grounds they feel it did not meet their requirement of being \"medically necessary\". BUT because back in December they gave my wife the WRONG information, on a one time basis they will pay the hospital all the charges but they are officially denying my claim. My wife and I fought and won this hard battle for coverage and to choose proton therapy.",

      "Content": "Anyone thinking about Proton therapy, please be advised you may no longer have the option to chose this course of action based on your health care provider. 1/29/17 Letter I just received from BC/BS Fed: For our purposes, \u0093generally accepted standards of medical practice\u0094 means standards that are based on credible scientific evidence published in peer-reviewed medical literature generally recognized by the relevant medical community and physician specialty society recommendations. The fact that one of our covered physicians, hospitals, or other professionals or facility providers has prescribed, recommended, or approved a service or supply does not, in itself make it medically necessary or covered under your plan.\u0094 Based on all the submitted documentation, it was determined that the services were not medically necessary or appropriate for you.

      "Content": "Hey Maverick, February 23rd I also had the 3 gold markers inserted into the prostate along with an insertion of spaceoar gel. They did not do it thru the rectum instead it was placed the same way they implant the seeds. It hurt like hell but only as they were doing the insertions. Next day all was well. I agree they should have a light blue parking space.",
