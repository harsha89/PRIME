      "Content": "I have looked around the forum and haven't seen this addressed directly. I'm having the RALP in 17 days and I am trying to prepare where I can. The question is: how is going up and down stairs the week after surgery with the Foley catheter in? My house has 3 levels and I am trying to decide if I need to prepare to spend 8 days (the time I am currently scheduled to have the catheter) parked on just one floor or if I will be able to negotiate the normal amount of household stairs between floors. I have had a couple major abdominal surgeries in my life but both required about a week post-op in the hospital recovering and I didnt go home with a catheter, so this is new territory. Thanks!",

      "Content": "Thanks, Nick. I'm just imagining how not fun moving around with the catheter will be, but luckily this forum has put some of that fear to rest. Like I said, I have a couple surgeries before and both required a catheter,,,but only for 24 hours and I was laying in hospital bed during that time. But during that time, Mr. Johnson tried to get away by making himself as tiny as he could. He is a big baby...well a small baby...I am sure he is going to try to hide even more this time,, and I'm sure the staff will get a big laugh out of it.",

      "Content": "last week I received an email from my Dr at Johns Hopkins with a very lengthy and detailed document attached which is the after discharge instructions and what to expect in the near aftermath of the surgery. It does include instructions on walking for 5 minutes or so 6-8 times a day with the catheter and unlimited walking after its removal. I just noticed that it says I can do stairs \"slowly\" - at first I thought that meant for the weeks after surgery but I now think it means when I have the catheter.",

      "Content": "i didnt have a recliner, but my bed is fairly high and I used a big best rest pillow to prop up on. I didnt feel like leaving the house, so I didnt worry about any contraptions to carry and conceal the bag. I walked around the house in just a robe. One thing that helped me alot, is that I took some new shoe strings (the kind that about 1/4 wide that go in athletic shoes and tied two of them together so that it made a big loop that I wore 'crossbody' or \"bandoleer' style so that the loop was just about crotch level and hung the bag on that. Then I could walk around the house hands free and this kept the bag lower than the bladder level. (doesn't have to be shoestrings, it could be anything else you have around) The bag should have a hook attached to it so it is easy to hang on things. When I was in the bed, I hung on the bed rail. My instructions were not to use any petroleum based lubricant on the tube from the penis, but that water-based KY was ok. I only used it a couple of times. ALSO! I bought a donut pillow to sit on for the times I needed to sit down. You cant sit directly on your butt for a couple weeks after this surgery -- that is why being recumbent like in a recliner or propped up in the bed is most comfortable. I was surprised at how much and how often my big bag filled up. Dont let it get too full. I didnt like to let mine get to over 900ml. My wife was awesome and would get up and empty it while I slept. Really look at the way the tubing is attached to the anchor point. maybe take a photo. When I was getting discharged, the nurse took it apart to show us how in case we wanted to use the leg bag, and then she couldnt get the fat Y part of the tubing into the anchor so she just put the thin part of the tube back in the anchor, which allowed it to NOT BE ANCHORED. After a couple days at home dealing with excessive movement, I ended up having to tie the clip to the anchor to keep the tube from pulling on the penis.",

      "Content": "So, I had surgery 7 months ago at Hopkins....which is about 50 miles from me and takes me about 90 minutes to get to with always a chance of horrible traffic. While I was happy with my surgery there and all that, they are so busy that it is difficult to get appointments for just follow-up. I am thinking about going to see a Dr more local to address post surgery ED. I have 2 choices: 1. I can go see a \"concierge\" practice of 2 urologists that do almost nothing but vasectomies and treat ED and Low T. They don't take insurance, but will give me the documentation I need to file my own claims. They also do mostly compounding pharmacy prescriptions which also doesn't involve insurance. They are much closer to me and easier to see -- and as a coincidence they refer patients they find need further exams for PC to the exact same surgeon I had at Hopkins. They told me that at each appointment they allot a whole hour for each patient. The cost is $575 for the first 2 appointments and then $300 a month while I am under their treatment. 2. I could go to standard urologist (that say they treat ED on their website) at one of the local urology groups near me. My Uro surgeon at Hopkins gave me a script for Sildenafil at my 3 month follow-up, but it is not really working. With those and a pump I can get kind of there, but not good enough, not to mention how terrible I feel the next morning I feel from the Sildenafil. My Uro Surgeon mentioned that I could get injections while I was waiting to recover my erectile function (I HOPE IT COMES BACK!) So, I am looking to go to someone to see about injections or other options...I know 7 months is not \"that long\" from surgery, but I'm growing impatient and want to jump start something. Just wondering if it is worth the extra cost to go to the concierge practice or if a regular jack of all trades URO will be good enough. Also: prior to surgery my erectile function was 1000%. and around 60-70% of nerves were spared on both sides.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by Ian Moome Hey Jake, I was 56 at the time of my surgery. My erections did not return until about 9 months post-surgery ...so keep the faith. If you Hopkins doc does not have time to address your ED concerns, I'd find someone who does. My doc was very aggressive with penile rehab. He started me with Cialis and a vacuum pump about a week after catheter removal. Neither had immediate stellar results but he encourage me to stick with the regimen since both promoted blood flow to penile tissue. He said that top priority was maintaining healthy tissue until my body took over. After about 4 months, he suggested that we do a few treatments with Trimix. He called it priming the pump. Once I got over the horrors of getting an injection in my junk, I tried it. Trimix worked great once we got the dosing perfected. The dosing was a little dicey ...3 hour erections are no fun. Spontaneous partial erections did start occurring after Trimix therapy began. Then one morning in January 2018 (surgery was April 2017), I awoke to an old friend staring up at me. The first few were a little painful but worth it. Be patient. Your body will heal. ~I Ian, Thanks for the info. I was 55 1/2 when I had my surgery 7 months ago. I want to try some Trimix also. I have read that it takes some trial and error to get the dosage right. Also, if I have a partial or any extra blood flow for a more full state, it is sore and slightly painful also. Looking forward to that going away.",

      "Content": "Hi to all and first off, I have been reading through a great many posts. So much information to digest, but really appreciate all who have contributed to this community. Had my biopsy Dec 18 and finally got in to hear the results yesterday. Gleason of 3+4=7 mostly in the right side (six samples from the right side and one from the left contained cancer.) Group 2. My urologist said that as a relatively younger patient, surgery was the best option. I mentioned brachytherapy and he said that it was better for older patients because the side effects were less at first but grew worse over time, but with surgery, the side effects were worse for the first year or two and then a lot better for the rest of your life. I have not been able to find info on the long term bad side effects of brachytherapy. My urologists did say I needed to see a radiation oncologist and \"here it from him\". I have an appointment on Feb 1. questions: I hear that I should seek a second opinion. but a second opinion from a urologist? or a second opinion to what my upcoming radiation oncologist will suggest? Is going to a cancer center worth it - like Anderson in TX or Sloane Kettering? I do live about an hour or so from Johns Hopkins and could go there for a second opinion. I'm wary of urologists who \"boast\" (cant think of a better or proper word) about how many radical prostatectomies they have done and think that for them, surgery will always be their first choice. Any advice is welcome. Thanks in advance.",

      "Content": "Hi to all and first off, I have been reading through a great many posts. So much information to digest, but really appreciate all who have contributed to this community. Had my biopsy Dec 18 and finally got in to hear the results yesterday. Gleason of 3+4=7 mostly in the right side (six samples from the right side and one from the left contained cancer.) Group 2. My urologist said that as a relatively younger patient, surgery was the best option. I mentioned brachytherapy and he said that it was better for older patients because the side effects were less at first but grew worse over time, but with surgery, the side effects were worse for the first year or two and then a lot better for the rest of your life. I have not been able to find info on the long term bad side effects of brachytherapy. My urologists did say I needed to see a radiation oncologist and \"here it from him\". I have an appointment on Feb 1. questions: I hear that I should seek a second opinion. but a second opinion from a urologist? or a second opinion to what my upcoming radiation oncologist will suggest? Is going to a cancer center worth it - like Anderson in TX or Sloane Kettering? I do live about an hour or so from Johns Hopkins and could go there for a second opinion. I'm wary of urologists who \"boast\" (cant think of a better or proper word) about how many radical prostatectomies they have done and think that for them, surgery will always be their first choice. Any advice is welcome. Thanks in advance.",

      "Content": "I was one of the ones who was quite incontinent after catheter removal. However, I mostly got by with maximum absorbent pads instead of diapers. I didnt find that the Depends diapers and a store brand I had really were better than the pads. The one thing I would do to prepare; is think about sleeping --- I slept on good quality bed pads for a couple of months. For the first week or 10 days I was leaking alot and when I slept on my side or back, urine would run down the sides where diapers dont have padding. I got 4 washable bed pads on Amazon for around $32. Also, they are larger than the disposable ones you can buy at the store. At around the 2 week point I was continent laying down and all night -- with the exception of an occasional accident here and there (maybe once every 2 weeks) for about 2 - 3 months. I was going through about 3 of the max pads a day for about the first 2 months. Seems like at around 4 months I was able to go to 1 pad a day and later could get by with a medium pad (Tena makes good mediums - but I never have seen them in a store...I order them online.) Another thing I did, I took a couple new shoestrings and tied them together in a loop that I hung crossbody style and hung my catherter bag on it which allowed me to walk around the house hands free -- the bag has to be below your penis so mine hung around my lower thigh/knee area. Unlike some people, I never bothered trying to change to the small leg bag. Also, I never tried to wear any clothes for the time I had the catheter. The most convenient thing for me was to wear a robe around the house. And again, unlike others, I never left the house during the nine days I had the catheter. But do whatever you feel you can do. I dont have a recliner, so I just slept propped up on some big pillows on the bed and the catheter bag would hang on my bed frame -- again, the bag has to remain lower than your groin area. you might want to have some lube of some kind -- most say don't use petroleum based products - for the tip of your pens where the catheter enters. Can help with irritation if you get that. I suffered from a version of jock itch from being damp all the time down there. The active medicine for athletes foot and jock itch is the same although there are a few different kinds/brands. I got the spray powder type that was actually for athletes foot because it went on dry -- and I was already wet, so the lotion didnt seem like as good of a choice for me. That stuff really helped. Also, for this reason...as soon as I was continent laying down, I would sleep on my pads naked just so I could dry out and minimize the rash. And for me, a donut pillow was necessary as I was kind of sore down there for a couple weeks - month. Mr Dr recommended not sitting directly on that area anyways for a while. But I only needed the donut on hard chairs or straight back chairs. I didnt use one for sitting on the couch or puffy chairs you can lean back in a little. When you go to get your catheter out, take a couple diapers with you. And like I said, I only went through about 5 or 10 diapers and then it was all pads all the time for me.",

      "Content": "I'm 10 months out from surgery. Still full ED. I have generic Viagra (sildenafil) in 20mg tablets. It does nothing for me other than give me a stuffy head, and a headache and a general feeling of malaise for 6 or 8 hours. If I take 60 mg its not so bad, but 100mg usually is not fun at all...also it doesn't give me an erection. So my Dr had me try Cialis. The 20mg one made me more ill than Viagra and also didn't work. Half of a Cialis made me feel terrible too. Injections: They work great for me, maybe too good. I have been on a trial and error routine to find the right dosage with them for about 2 months. At first I had to increase the dosage to get it to work good, then it was too good -- like the erection was too hard and for too long. Then I backed off the dosage continually, where now I get good erections but still they last too long (3-4 hours)...so my Dr. thinks that I am healing and that is why I keep having to decrease my injection dosage. Giving yourself injections (of Trimix or Bimix) is not fun, but tolerable. The goal I think is to get a good usable erection that lasts around an hour. As for my experience so far, there aren't any side effects. There is some prep time: you have to store the Trimix or Bimix in the freezer or refrigerator. I store mine in the freezer. it only takes it about 15 minutes to thaw. Then you have to put it in the syringe and prep the area with an alcohol wipe and then give yourself the shot. Takes me about 10-15 minutes to get a full erection. So far I haven't had one that lasted under an hour. I'm telling you this because if the pills will give you an erection, then you probably don't need much dosage of the shots. The Drs don't recommend this, but I have seen on the franktalk message board that some people will mix them...a little Viagra and a small dosage of the shot. Whatever you do, if you decide on the shots, you must go to the pharmacy and buy psuedoephidrine (PE)-- the plain PE that comes in 30mg tablets -- NOT the extended release versions...PE acts as an antidote to the injections if your erection is going on past 2 hours. I know nothing about the suppositories.",

I probably could have gotten by with 2. they wash up fine. I think I only leaked on one maybe about 2 times, so it wasn't like I was having to change them out multiple times a night. You will find continence returns soonest when lying down. I also took a couple with me when I traveled during the first couple months of my recovery. As I sad before, they can be a little warm since they don't breath great. I solved this by placing something like a soft thick towel over the pad.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by rmotacek1 Jake XYZ- Thanks for the info on Trimix. I am going to ask my uro about trying it on my next visit. I have tried the pills and got nothing. I am a little nervous about some posters saying they started to develop peyronies when they were taking the shots. Have you had any trouble with that? Anyone else? Rmotacek, I have no signs of Peyronie\u2019s yet. I have done 9 or 10 shots in 2 months. I had some real pain in my penis anytime I had any semblance of an erection ever since surgery. But in my case, it just felt like I needed to \u201cstretch it out\u201d. Every shot I have done, the resulting erection was less painful than the one before. So the last couple have been pretty good and successfully used. I\u2019ve never had any bending or irregularities in my erection since doing the shots. Other than I think I lost a half inch at least. So, so far so good with my shots. I am not going to the same Dr who did my surgery. I\u2019m going to a Uro who specializes in ED. And I have been talking to him weekly as I have been doing the shots and reporting the results and issues...so I\u2019m not just winging it. So, in summary..so far the shots have worked well for me. And like I said in the above post, my biggest issue now is having erections last 2-4 hours. Which is not fun at all. You would think maybe 2 hours would be great but it\u2019s really uncomfortable.",

      "Content": "He is way way way ahead of where most RALP patients are at 2 months....even ahead of where most are at 6-9 months. If I could get an erection with 20mg of Sildenafil I would be doing back flips. But we all think what ever problem we have is a BIG problem, no matter how it relates to the average recovery of the average patient - I know I am guilty of that too. All I can say is that post RALP orgasms are DIFFERENT...and not necessarily different in a good way. For me, Sometimes they feel more intense than before surgery. Sometimes they are more duds. But the journey there is always pretty good. Before surgery and when hot semen was in play, orgasms felt more centered in the head of the penis and related to act of ejaculation. Now after RALP, they seem to flow backwards into my pelvis and upper legs. maybe because I feel them in a larger area, they could be said to be more intense. I would rather have the old way, but the new way is OK. As others have said...give it some time. 2 months is way too early to be worried about anything. This reminds what Dr. Walsh says in his book: 'that half the adults in the world have \"dry orgasms\"...they are called women'. So, now I'm thinking I orgasm like a woman! ha.",

      "Content": "Just wondering if anyone else has experienced this. I have not seen anyone talk about it before around here. So here goes: I am at 9 months post surgery. From the time I got my catheter out until now, anytime I would get even a tiny bit of a start of an erection, my penis would be sore with any kind of touch that involved the slightest pressure. Over time it is not as bad. However, the couple times that I used Viagra and the pump to get some semblance of an erection, it would kind of painful if I squeezed it with any pressure. Now, I am doing Trimix injections which work really well..sometimes too well. Anyway, I get a perfectly great erection, but when I try to have intercourse it really hurts. I can grip it lightly with no problem, and probably could masturbate fine...but putting it in the woman, it hurts so bad I cant finish. (I think the 8 months my wife didn't have sex - made her tight like a 18 year old -- ha! no, really! -- which is even more torturous because I really want to experience that! I was able to finish the other day in a position that I used to hate because it was too \"loose\". But now that is the only one I can tolerate. Anyway, the Trimix erections are nice and firm and better than ever, except quite painful! I'm hoping it just needs to get worked back into shape. It does seem to slowly be getting a little less painful each time I try it...but still slow going.",

      "Content": "My biopsy was done by my local urologist in northern Virginia on 12/18/2017. The specimens were sent to Memphis to be analyzed. I got my results as seen in my sig on Jan 23, 2018. On Feb 9, I went to see Dr. Pavlovich at Johns Hopkins. While they had ordered the slides from original Dr to have Hopkins pathology look at them, they didnt arrive until a few weeks after my appt. Dr. Pavlovich told me at my appointment that I needed to have something done within 6 months of my biopsy due to my Group 2 classification and --at that time no evidence that the cancer was outside the prostate. After 2 ROs told me that I wasnt a good candidate for RT because I have inflammatory bowel disease (which I have almost no symptoms of these days), I decided to schedule surgery for next available with Dr Pavlovich which is May 14 and about 5 months after my biopsy. So I just got onto MyChart for Hopkins, and I guess Hopkins pathology finally got the slides...because MyChart online has the results of their pathology report that was done Feb 28, 2018. The Gleason scores are exactly the same with some small variations in the percentages in a couple of cores as the original report. BUT the Hopkins report added a few facts that seem darned important that the original report did not have...LIKE perineural invasion detected! and cribiform morphology detected in a couple of the cores. Now I am worried that I shouldnt wait another 2 months although from my brief Internet research, perinueral invasion of the nerves in the prostate doesn't have to mean that the cancer is outside the prostate. Cribiform morphology supposedly indicates that upon RP surgery, the grading/staging would be graded higher than the original biospsy. Since all of the offices are closed right now, I have to wait until tomorrow to call to see if I need to alter my plans....so I thought I would vent on here. oh I guess I feel better that the Hopkins report has this at the bottom: NOTE: THIS CASE WAS SHOWN AT THE DAILY QUALITY ASSURANCE CONFERENCE.",

      "Content": "I had robot assisted prostectomy on May 14, 2018 at Johns Hopkins Bayview. Seemed to go ok as I was knocked out the whole time . It took 4 hours (1p -5p). I spent one night and most of the next day before being released. The nurse showed me and my wife how to take the catheter apart to change to the leg bag if we wanted to but then she couldn\u0092t get the Y part of the Foley back in the clamp and decided just to put the small tube in the clamp! Fail! As now the tube had nothing to keep from pulling on the penis end. For a couple days I tried to tape it to the clamp but tape would not stick on the silicone tube. Then I got the bright idea to take some twine and tie it around the tube, over the Foley clamp and over the Y and that held it still for the rest of the time. Oh yeah, the drain removal was no pain at all. Catheter went OK. I made an over the shoulder cross-body strap from new shoe strings that I used to hang my bag while I walked around the house. Didn\u0092t wear anything but a robe for 9 days. Didn\u0092t try leaving the house. Was able to go up and down my stairs \u0096 slowly \u0096 with no problem. The first 7 days of the catheter were not terrible but the last two days it started to annoy me. Well having a bowel movement was pretty painful in the penis as the bladder activated and spasmed as I involuntarily tried to pee around the catheter. That really hurt. I took some stool softener and any never had any problem going but it really hurt in the penis around the catheter when I had a bowel movement. By far the worst thing about post-op catheter time. I could never find a good way to sit on the toilet. Had no post-op pain, just was sore and swollen in the abdomen area. Didn\u0092t take any pain meds other than some Tylenol and Motrin a few times. My swollen abdomen made it so that I could only eat a small amount before I was full. I have lost 9 pounds so far! Yay! Although I was a guy that hit the weights alot and probably alot of that loss is muscle, now in my sedentary lifestyle Catheter came out on May 23\u00859 days after surgery. Ok, that was kind of painful. Turns out the pain was from the tip of the penis and after putting a little Neosporin on it a couple of times that all went away. Nurse sad she felt bad that I had pain because she takes pride in painless catheter removal. Its now 6 days after catheter removal and I\u0092m leaking like a sieve. Hard to sleep more than an hour or two at time before I either pee in my sleep (which runs out the sides of depends and pads) or have to get up to pee. This keeps me in a fairly tired state. I got some of the bed pads like they use in the hospital from Amazon \u0096 washable and reusable although I got some disposable ones from the grocery store also. I posted in a separate thread about how small my penis is post surgery. Hope this isn\u0092t permanent. Pre-op Gleason 3+4=7, 7 of 12 Cores positive Post op pathology: Gleason 3+4=7, Grade Grp 2. 10% Pattern 4 Max tumor dimension 18mm: cancer pretty much in ALL zones BUT \u0091organ confined\u0092! Lymph Nodes (3 right and 8 left) negative. Seminal Vesicle invasion: none Margins: negative Prostate= 52g, 4.3cm x 4.5 x 4.3cm No more treatment needed \u0093at this time\u0094. First PSA test will be 6 weeks from surgery. I asked Dr about post op ED therapy. He told me to get continent first and then we could discuss it, but that I shouldn\u0092t expect an erection before 4 \u0096 6 months \u0096 no ED pills for me yet. He told me he spared 60-70% of nerve bundles on each side\u0085maybe he was being optimistic and telling me what I wanted to hear?\u0085I guess we will see. That's all I can think of at the moment. It is true that the incontinence part is big. But I am really perplexed \u0096 even though I expected it \u0096 for there to be absolutely no erection ability\u0085even a tug or twinge. My brain still thinks about it as much as before and visual stimuli is still interesting but has no effect. All of this is kind of depressing, but I right now I am trying to remain optimistic.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by Michael F Years ago I was researching Open vs Robotic RP and I read a quote from HBC, MD, (I think!) back when robotics was in its childhood. He stated that robotic RP was tantamount to malpractice! If this is accurate, it goes to show that even the very best get it wrong on occasion. MF A year ago when I was looking for a URO surgeon at Johns Hopkins, I was reading the Dr's individual pages on JH's website. I haven't looked now, but I imagine it hasn't changed -- on Dr Carter's page he disparaged robotic surgery in a very explicit way. He was one of the first pages I read and it took a while after reading that for me to consider DaVinci. It was after I saw that everyone else at JH was doing DaVinci that I thought he was alone in this thought. If you look at Walsh's latest edition. In the part on saving erectile function he says that with open, you can feel the nerve bundles sticking to the prostate and with that tactile feeling work to preserve them. But he says with robotic, you can see the nerve bundles and thus work to preserve them. I think he went on to say that he felt that the ability to see them slightly outweighed the ability to \"feel\" them.",

      "Content": "the pain in the shoulders is indeed from the air they pump into your abdomen to inflate you so they can see better to operate. The residual air pushes on the diaphragm and results in pain in the shoulders. Mine never bothered me laying down, but when I would get up is when it would hurt. And yes, they claim now that they try to get the air/gas out now before they close you up. I had abdominal surgery in 1994 and again in 2004 and the pain was excruciating from this. This time it was there but mild, but it lasted a good week at least. moving around helped. My doc/nurses told me not to put the catheter bad on the ground for fear of germs and stuff getting on it and inducing some sort of infection. But me and my bag drainer (my great wife) were meticulous in using the antiseptic wipes on cleaning the catheter drain tube where it connects, in every time we emptied the bad. I crafted a homemade strap out of a new pack of shoe strings for athletic shoes that I put over my shoulder - cross body/bandoleer style -- that I hooked the bag to so that it was about mid thigh/knee area. This enabled to me walk around hands free.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by Michael F Years ago I was researching Open vs Robotic RP and I read a quote from HBC, MD, (I think!) back when robotics was in its childhood. He stated that robotic RP was tantamount to malpractice! If this is accurate, it goes to show that even the very best get it wrong on occasion. MF A year ago when I was looking for a URO surgeon at Johns Hopkins, I was reading the Dr's individual pages on JH's website. I haven't looked now, but I imagine it hasn't changed -- on Dr Carter's page he disparaged robotic surgery in a very explicit way. He was one of the first pages I read and it took a while after reading that for me to consider DaVinci. It was after I saw that everyone else at JH was doing DaVinci that I thought he was alone in this thought. If you look at Walsh's latest edition. In the part on saving erectile function he says that with open, you can feel the nerve bundles sticking to the prostate and with that tactile feeling work to preserve them. But he says with robotic, you can see the nerve bundles and thus work to preserve them. I think he went on to say that he felt that the ability to see them slightly outweighed the ability to \"feel\" them.",

      "Content": "My biopsy was done by my local urologist in northern Virginia on 12/18/2017. The specimens were sent to Memphis to be analyzed. I got my results as seen in my sig on Jan 23, 2018. On Feb 9, I went to see Dr. Pavlovich at Johns Hopkins. While they had ordered the slides from original Dr to have Hopkins pathology look at them, they didnt arrive until a few weeks after my appt. Dr. Pavlovich told me at my appointment that I needed to have something done within 6 months of my biopsy due to my Group 2 classification and --at that time no evidence that the cancer was outside the prostate. After 2 ROs told me that I wasnt a good candidate for RT because I have inflammatory bowel disease (which I have almost no symptoms of these days), I decided to schedule surgery for next available with Dr Pavlovich which is May 14 and about 5 months after my biopsy. So I just got onto MyChart for Hopkins, and I guess Hopkins pathology finally got the slides...because MyChart online has the results of their pathology report that was done Feb 28, 2018. The Gleason scores are exactly the same with some small variations in the percentages in a couple of cores as the original report. BUT the Hopkins report added a few facts that seem darned important that the original report did not have...LIKE perineural invasion detected! and cribiform morphology detected in a couple of the cores. Now I am worried that I shouldnt wait another 2 months although from my brief Internet research, perinueral invasion of the nerves in the prostate doesn't have to mean that the cancer is outside the prostate. Cribiform morphology supposedly indicates that upon RP surgery, the grading/staging would be graded higher than the original biospsy. Since all of the offices are closed right now, I have to wait until tomorrow to call to see if I need to alter my plans....so I thought I would vent on here. oh I guess I feel better that the Hopkins report has this at the bottom: NOTE: THIS CASE WAS SHOWN AT THE DAILY QUALITY ASSURANCE CONFERENCE.",
