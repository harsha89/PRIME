      "Content": "Originally Posted by HighlanderCFH Hi Tim, Hi, Highlander! Welcome to the forum. At the same time, we hope we can avoid admitting you as a member of the PC Club. I surely hope so. I'm not enjoying getting older, having had pretty perfect health for most of my life; never had an operation, never any major health issues at all - got malaria in Africa once, but we cured that and it hasn't recurred. Getting older sucks. :-/ (and for some entertainment, this little clip from \"The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen\" seems apropos - https://youtu.be/2URGjwlzOl0?t=798 ) While it is highly unlikely that you would have PC with such a low PSA, it is still within the realm of possibility. Usually a uro would not recommend a biopsy with such a low number, but the hard areas on the prostate change the game a bit. So does the frequent urination and weak stream. Did the doctor say anything about having an enlarged prostate? Both he and my GP said it was slightly enlarged, yes (tho' they didn't seem alarmed). Also, the urologist said something along the lines of some people having \"symmetrical\" harder areas on their prostate which can just be a genetic variation, or something like that. If not, for safety's sake -- and peace of mind -- it is probably not a terrible idea to have the biopsy. Remember that the squeaky wheel gets all the grease (no pun intended), which means that most of the wheels are just fine. In this analogy, the VAST majority of biopsies go without any complications, so we never hear about them. Only when a complication arises does it become something to talk about. In other words, the odds are HIGHLY with you that the biopsy would go just fine. I would make sure that the doctor numbs the rectum and the prostate for a painless experience. You could probably ask the doctor about waiting a few months and taking another PSA to see if it rises at all. But the urination problems, and hard areas, are still going to be there, so the biopsy is probably a good idea. If you opt to have it, I would make sure that the uro is very highly experienced at performing biopsies. Stick around with us and you'll be getting more advice & comments from others here. Good luck! Chuck Yeah, it seems the best course of action, though it'd be nicer if there were better, less invasive diagnostics available that were reliable. Some folks had mentioned that an MRI before can \"guide\" a biopsy, though no medical person chimed in about that on those discussions. And I agree about the squeaky wheels - it's like product review sites... most of the reviews will be about how bad a product was, problems with it; the happy customers won't say much unless they're just over the top with joy. I didn't know the urologist beforehand, but apparently he's very well-respected in my area (San Francisco); in fact, my next-door neighbor had PC and it turns out we share the same urologist. He researched him a bit, and has heard that he does biopsies and prostate surgeries a lot, and is considered to do very good work, so that's reassuring. The neighbor also mentioned, though, that urologists can tend to think of cancer like a plumber thinks of home plumbing... if something's stuck in there, you GO IN AND REMOVE IT! i.e. they're very oriented to finding the problem and \"fixing it\", even if aggressive treatment isn't that necessary... so they tend towards wanting biopsies, surgeries, etc. It was an interesting perspective to hear, and I'm glad I have him around to talk to. He got some new experimental treatment for his PC and has had no problems since (about 3 or 4 years ago, I think). As for numbing the rectum - not sure what he's going to do in that regard; I got prescribed some Xanax to relax me, some Vicodin for pain, and an antibiotic, so I should be a bit drugged up for it anyway. Anyway, the more information and opinions I can hear about it the better, so let the information roll in! - Tim",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by Sarg I agree with the others that you probably should go ahead with the biopsy. If you get it done you will have some peace of mind and then can make a decision on what to do next. If you don't get it done you will always wonder if you should have. As for the biopsy, mine was no big deal. I went into a surgery center in the morning and my urologist put me under (only way to go). I woke up a couple of hours later and had no clue of what had been done. For me the worse part was the cleaning the day before. And just so you know, after a biopsy you pass blood when you ejaculate for a few times. So don't be shocked, it is normal. Thanks! Yeah, it sounds like that's the general consensus here (and I thank everyone for their helpful and kind words!). Good supportive place here! My urologist is just going to dope me up a bit (Xanax and Vicodin), but not going to get knocked out. I got knocked out with Propofol for my colonoscopy last year, and that was definitely the way to go. I don't think my urologist does that for biopsies, unfortunately - oh well. :-/ I just got the home-enema kit out to read the instructions; I hear it's not as bad as the pre-colonoscopy cleanse (which I fasted a couple of days before so it wasn't too bothersome). I heard about the blood in stool/urine/ejaculate - that'll be freaky for sure. The only time I've seen red in stool/urine is when I ate a lot of beets. - Tim",

I called his office, but he says we should still go through with the biopsy, due to the irregularities he felt. Do you think this is wise? I have read a lot about not getting biopsies if it can be avoided; getting an MRI first; etc. But this is all new for me, so I'm wondering what the best next step is. Does anyone have any good advice on the subject? I will also search further in this forum to see what I can find. Thanks much! - Tim",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by Sarg I agree with the others that you probably should go ahead with the biopsy. If you get it done you will have some peace of mind and then can make a decision on what to do next. If you don't get it done you will always wonder if you should have. As for the biopsy, mine was no big deal. I went into a surgery center in the morning and my urologist put me under (only way to go). I woke up a couple of hours later and had no clue of what had been done. For me the worse part was the cleaning the day before. And just so you know, after a biopsy you pass blood when you ejaculate for a few times. So don't be shocked, it is normal. Thanks! Yeah, it sounds like that's the general consensus here (and I thank everyone for their helpful and kind words!). Good supportive place here! My urologist is just going to dope me up a bit (Xanax and Vicodin), but not going to get knocked out. I got knocked out with Propofol for my colonoscopy last year, and that was definitely the way to go. I don't think my urologist does that for biopsies, unfortunately - oh well. :-/ I just got the home-enema kit out to read the instructions; I hear it's not as bad as the pre-colonoscopy cleanse (which I fasted a couple of days before so it wasn't too bothersome). I heard about the blood in stool/urine/ejaculate - that'll be freaky for sure. The only time I've seen red in stool/urine is when I ate a lot of beets. - Tim",
