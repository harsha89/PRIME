      "Content": "Hello, My husband recently had Robotic surgery and his pathology report came back with Negative margins, Gleason 3+4,pT2c. He also had 2 of 9 removed lymph nodes that were cancerous. Largest node was 1mm. Before the surgery his PSA was 5.9. I was wondering if anyone on here had a similar result. It seems strange to me that He would have lymph node metastasis when everything else was clear and the tumor was confined with negative margins. We were told to wait 3 months and get another PSA and decide on treatment based on that. I was wondering if anyone was advised differently in a similar situation. It seems a long time to wait when cancer could be moving through your lymph system. We want to get another opinion but what kind of doctor should we go to? Has anyone had radiation for lymph nodes mets? Just don't really know what to do at this point. Thanks for any input you have.

      "Content": "I think I accidentally deleted my original post so I will try again. I'm trying to hear from people who have PC with lymph node involvement, how they are being treated, how its going, and what type of doctor is managing their treatment. My husbands pre surgery psa was 5.9 Had DaVinci surgery on 6/3/2014 Gleason Score 3+4=7 25% of prostate cancerous extension: negative seminal vesicles: negative margins: clear Lymph vascular invasion: present -2 of 9 lymphnodes removed had cancer Perineural invasion: present primary tumor: pT2c regional lymph nodes: pN1 I'm trying to see if there is anyone on here that had lymph node involvement when everything else was all clear. No positive margins, or extension. No seminal vesicle involvement etc. It seems odd and I haven't really seen anyone else in that position so I am curious how it is usually treated. Our doctor recommended waiting 3 months to test for PSA and that seems like a long time to do nothing if there is a risk it is in the lymph nodes. thank you so much for any input you have.",
