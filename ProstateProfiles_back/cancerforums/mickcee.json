      "Content": "Hi everyone, I had a radical prostatectomy in April last year at 50 years of age and erections are completely non existent despite several compounded mixtures of bimix and pap, viagra, cialis and 2 different kinds of pumps. My wife could not be less interested in me sexually and has made it clear that ' there is nothing sexually attractive about a flaccid penis'. I am finding my enforced celibacy very frustrating and frankly regret my decision to have surgery ( yes I do know the consequences of not treating this cancer). On the rare occasions that I have been able to orgasm despite my permanently flaccid penis it is an unpleasant experience often with a cramping pain in the abdomen that lasts for some time afterwards. Given that I don't seem to be getting even a hint of sexual function back and the likelihood of any penile rehab involving my wife is zilch where do I go from here? I feel like the part of my body that allows me to function sexually has been mutilated/removed but the part that makes me want to function sexually is left intact and working as well as ever. I do not believe I will ever regain sexual function (certainly not in the only way my wife is interested) and I just want any and all sexual desire gone. It feels cruel to lose the ability but keep the desire so I see the only thing that could alleviate the distress I feel about this is some means of ablating my libido.... castration either chemically or surgically. Can anyone tell me how effective this is in reducing sexual thoughts and frustration with celibacy and if these procedures are ever done for this reason ? The only advice Ive had regarding this matter is to keep trying..... well thats just not going to happen.... I just want to reduce the distress my impotence causes me as I hold no hope at all of it being resolved. I would appreciate your thoughts, thank you.",

      "Content": "Thank you for the responses I appreciate your thoughts. I have tried phentolamine which only half worked but was so painful i will never try it again, bimix and PAP at maximum strength and injecting up to a 100 units didnt work, nor did maximum doses of viagra or cialis (no effect whatsoever). Going to a prostitute and not being able to get it up would be humiliating so I wouldnt consider that. There will be no penile rehab for me and all I want is any help I can get in dealing with desires I cannot act upon and I think some form of castration is worth investigating. I live in a very isolated part of Australia and do not have a regular urologist which is why Im seeking some advice here.",

      "Content": "Hi everyone, I am sure there must be someone else out there for whom no treatments for ED have worked and whos partner is not interested in sexual activity without an erection being possible. As much as I appreciate the attempts to help PLEASE do not respond telling me not to give up, I WANT to give up. I am humiliated and embarrassed by my inability and my wife has made it painfully clear that she is really not interested in me sexually now that I am impotent. I have as much desire as ever but I cannot get an erection despite trying everything available. I have asked here about chemical or surgical castration as a means of diminishing my libido as my current situation is just awful and I want to be less focused on that which I am now incapable of. I find people telling me not to give up distressing so please do not respond just to tell me that but if anyone has any experience and or advice on how to cope with involuntary celibacy I would really appreciate it. Thank you",

      "Content": "Hi everyone, I have had regular nosebleeds that bleed very heavily ( ENT specialist found nothing wrong) and initially ( a year ago) my bleeding times were fine. I wonder if this may be associated with my prostate cancer. I had a gleeson of 9 and a prostatectomy a year ago, my PSA is slowly rising and my urologist said I will need salvage radiation if it continues to rise. Has anyone else here experienced this ? Also can anyone tell me the possible side effects of salvage radiation, is faecal incontinence a possible side effect? At least I dont have to worry about it causing impotence or urinary incontinence as I'm already in that boat.....a silver lining of sorts",
