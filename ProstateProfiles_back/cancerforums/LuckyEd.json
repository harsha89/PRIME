      "Content": "Originally Posted by daughtertakescharge1987 Hi, I'm new to this forum (and forums in general) so forgive me if I'm doing this wrong -- my 65 year old father was just diagnosed with stage 4 metastatic prostate cancer, it has spread to lymphs and the bones in his left shoulder and forearm. He is pretty much computer illiterate so I have decided to take the reigns and do the research for him. His PSA levels were 1053.6 ng/mL which seems INSANELY high, and the doctors have him on Lupron depot every 6 months and have him scheduled to start chemo in August. He is also very poor and is on every government program for assistance that he has been able to qualify for. We are trying to be as hopeful and optimistic as possible, and not enough time has passed since starting treatment to see if it is having any effect, but I would like to know if anyone has been in a similar situation, or has any comments at all based on what little information I have provided. Im trying to stay positive and learn as much as I can but his situation is seeming pretty bleak. When I asked for the prognosis his oncologist mumbled something like \"it could be months or years\" and I really have no idea what that means. I know every patient is different but are we actually looking at a possibility of death in a few months? Any suggestions or advice or opinions or ANYTHING would be so so appreciated. Thank you all! Welcome to the site. Sorry to hear the news about your father. . You have certainly come to the right place to get information and to gain knowledge. There are many threads on this site from very knowledgeable people. I am certainly no expert on prostate cancer so I will leave it to those who know way more than I do. But I will point out that if you use the search function up in the right hand corner of this page, you will be able to find information that is helpful to you and your father. May I suggest searching for stage 4 or metastatic cancer or both. The search will narrow down the threads to a more manageable level. You will find threads from men that have survived for many years with stage 4 cancer. As you stated, everyone is different, so these stories may not be your father's outcome but you will gain important knowledge. Good luck with this journey. There is progress toward finding a cure for this disease. It seems to be a difficult one to solve but them seem to be getting closer every day. The other day I read an article in the Chicago Tribune how researchers at Northwestern Hospital in Chicago have found a way to stop cancer from metastasizing. This is just another step in figuring out how cancer works and may lead to ways to cure it. Good luck and God Bless. Ed",

      "Content": "Merry Christmas Everyone!!! I am 14 months post DaVinci Radical Prostatectomy. I am still experiencing some leakage at night and stress incontinence when walking for exercise or performing tasks around the house. One of the items the surgeon has suggested is to have a mesh installed to deal with the stress incontinence. Just wondering if anyone has had this procedure or has any other solutions to this problem. Have tried to do research online to determine the success rate of this surgery but am having trouble finds stats for men. Noticed that there a lot of attorneys advertising because of botched mesh surgeries on women so a little nervous about proceeding with this surgery without getting some better information. Hope everyone is doing well and enjoying the Holidays with your friends and family. Your input, as always, is greatly appreciated! Ed",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by Another I know nothing about the mesh question. A question I have for the doctor is does it impact future radiation if radiation is necessary for BCR. Are your PSA numbers <0.01 or <0.1? Did you try giving up alcohol, caffeine, and carbonated beverages for a while to see if it makes a difference? How's your weight? Is your BMI between 19 and 24? Are you doing your kegels correctly? Have you tried physical therapy wirth a specialist in pelvic floor muscles? In other words, try everything before choosing surgery solutions, imo. I gave up alcohol, caffeine and carbonated beverages for close to a year. Since it didn't seem to improve the situation, I have one cup of coffee in the morning and maybe a beer with my dinner on occasion. Gained about 10 pounds after surgery because of a lack of activity but my BMI is around the 24 number. I worked with a Physical Therapist who identified that kegels was part of the problem because I experienced pain when doing them. She recommended doing reverse kegels which seemed to help with the leakage but still have the stress and leakage at night.",

      "Content": "Bracehardon Thanks for the encouraging words. I hope I can find a person with a PHD and only works with men after surgery. Unfortunately, in my searching for a PT, I have not found one that only works with men. Most of the PTs I have found, work primarily with women. I will certainly take Consult1's advice regarding the pelvic floor certification. Happy New Year! Thanks, Ed",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by Consult1 I don't have a specific therapist to recommend, but when you're doing your search you might check to see if any potential therapist has completed the specialty pelvic floor certification course by APTA (American Physical Therapy Association). Thanks. That is very good advice. Happy New Year! Ed",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by Bravehardon Hi Ed, my exercise program is as follows. Firstly using ultra sensitive food scale I had to keep track of urine weight at the end of each day: * Three times a day perform kegel exercise as follows: 1) lift floor 25% and hold 5 seconds, lift floor to maximum and hold 10 seconds, lift floor 25% and hold 5 seconds., take a 60 second break and repeat a total of 10 times. Do exercise 3 times day (morning, afternoon,night). * Lift floor to maximum, drop quickly to base 20 times (repeat as above). * once per day walk for 30 minutes while raising bottom floor to 25% and holding for entire walk. The above worked well for me. Good luck Allen Thanks for the info. Kegels are much more involved than what I am currently doing. Will have to give it a try. Thanks, Ed",
