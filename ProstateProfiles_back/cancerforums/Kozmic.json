He had me do an MRI first and it revealed two \"suspect lesions\" One on each side. He said they each score a 4. He referred me to Dr Vipul Patel at Fl hospital Celebration, for an MIR guided biopsy. This all seems like a lot of waiting, weeks. The waiting is killing me.",

The result was that he had treatment without any knowledge of why. Now that I'm in the same boat I started asking him questions, \"what were your PSA numbers?, \"what were the results from your biopsy?\" \"why did you choose \"\"seeds\"\"? He had no answers, he didn't know. I wish he had let me help him with it. He is \"cancer free\", so he feels everything is good, but the side effects are something he still deals with in silence.",

      "Content": "Sweating the details now. Not so much the details of the upcoming surgery, but the details of what I need to accomplish before I can't, and how to recover after. Surgery is Monday. The aftermath is a concern, I need to bounce back as fast as possible, I have a huge change in career paths coming, waiting, and I need to be at an equipment show in Vegas Oct 8th, hanging with the owners and big dogs. Worked hard on pre-surgery, lost 35 pounds, been hitting the cardio hard, quit drinking and have been eating good. Now I need to come up with a post surgery plan to get back up and running ASAP. Yeah, I know, take your time to heal, and I will, but I need a plan. I wish this would't have taken so long to get to. I just got off the phone with My granddaughter, she is scared, she is losing too many family members lately, we just lost my Grandma today at 98 years old, and her Grandmother is dying of lung cancer. I told her I'm fine but she is scared. Done venting for now.",

      "Content": "Surgery was Monday. Everything went well. Dr Patel said he did feel a nodule in the left side of what he removed, pathology is in tomorrow. Day 1, day of surgery, I was all set to be heroic and man up to this, but my body had different plans. They wanted me up at 4 hours post to walk but I couldn't stand without getting light headed aka passing out, so It took me 6 hours to get up and moving. I didn't get much sleep that night, maybe 2 hours. Day 2, discharge day, I was all fired up and got walking in the morning, I thought I was doing great! Until I had to sit in for after care class, after sitting there for about 10 minutes my ears started ringing and I went cold, about to tip over again. My wife, the squeamish trouper, sat through class for us, I had to go lay down. After about 45 minutes I was discharged and WALKED out of the hospital! Good to go! Well kinda. Gas pains in my chest and right shoulder were bad, Sleeping was rough, Neither of us got much sleep. The Dogs were driving us nuts because they wanted in to the bed room or they were going to bark all night long, and they did. We have a 70# Doberman puppy with puppy manners, I didn't want her tangled in the cath tube. Day 3, Major gas pain, intestinal gas, BAD, it wanted to race around inside me but not come out! I laid down for a nap around noon and did pass some relief, By late afternoon I decided that maybe if I sat on the stool I could pass this, That did work, it was loud and very relieving. But, it came with a price. I developed a leak around the cath tube and blood was dripping. I called the doc and they said not to worry, it wasn't a problem it was blood washing out from around the tube and it wasn't \"really\" bleeding. I went to bed and slept good all night. Day 4, While I was sleeping my hot nurse (can't say enough good about my wife helping me!) was getting up and checking my bag, it wasn't filling very fast, not like it had been. I had been passing small clots and the fluid never really cleared up, but now it wasn't flowing. I managed to wiggle and massage the tube to get some clots to pass and called the dr again. They said if I couldn't keep it clear to come in and have it flushed. I worked on it for a bit and got a massive amount of clots to pass, and everything looked better but I was leaking again. So I decided that going in now, mid morning, would be far better than hitting an ER tonight, since I am an hour from the hospital, and went in to have it flushed anyway. They flushed it, refilled the Foley bulb to try to stop the leak and said it looked like everything had passed and I was good to go. Still set for untethering in the morning!! Big issue today is a burning sensation while sitting, I can't get comfortable for long and I get a burning sensation below the belt line on the right side. Only when sitting, goes away when I stand, no problem if I'm laying down. I asked at the Dr office and they shrugged it off as \"normal\". If anyone has advice on this I'd like to hear it. Day 5, Tomorrow get this tube OUT OF ME! Sorry for all the gory details, but that's just how it went.",

Only when sitting, goes away when I stand, no problem if I'm laying down. I asked at the Dr office and they shrugged it off as \"normal\". If anyone has advice on this I'd like to hear it. Day 5, Tomorrow get this tube OUT OF ME! Sorry for all the gory details, but that's just how it went.",

      "Content": "Surgery was Monday. Everything went well. Dr Patel said he did feel a nodule in the left side of what he removed, pathology is in tomorrow. Day 1, day of surgery, I was all set to be heroic and man up to this, but my body had different plans. They wanted me up at 4 hours post to walk but I couldn't stand without getting light headed aka passing out, so It took me 6 hours to get up and moving. I didn't get much sleep that night, maybe 2 hours. Day 2, discharge day, I was all fired up and got walking in the morning, I thought I was doing great! Until I had to sit in for after care class, after sitting there for about 10 minutes my ears started ringing and I went cold, about to tip over again. My wife, the squeamish trouper, sat through class for us, I had to go lay down. After about 45 minutes I was discharged and WALKED out of the hospital! Good to go! Well kinda. Gas pains in my chest and right shoulder were bad, Sleeping was rough, Neither of us got much sleep. The Dogs were driving us nuts because they wanted in to the bed room or they were going to bark all night long, and they did. We have a 70# Doberman puppy with puppy manners, I didn't want her tangled in the cath tube. Day 3, Major gas pain, intestinal gas, BAD, it wanted to race around inside me but not come out! I laid down for a nap around noon and did pass some relief, By late afternoon I decided that maybe if I sat on the stool I could pass this, That did work, it was loud and very relieving. But, it came with a price. I developed a leak around the cath tube and blood was dripping. I called the doc and they said not to worry, it wasn't a problem it was blood washing out from around the tube and it wasn't \"really\" bleeding. I went to bed and slept good all night. Day 4, While I was sleeping my hot nurse (can't say enough good about my wife helping me!) was getting up and checking my bag, it wasn't filling very fast, not like it had been. I had been passing small clots and the fluid never really cleared up, but now it wasn't flowing. I managed to wiggle and massage the tube to get some clots to pass and called the dr again. They said if I couldn't keep it clear to come in and have it flushed. I worked on it for a bit and got a massive amount of clots to pass, and everything looked better but I was leaking again. So I decided that going in now, mid morning, would be far better than hitting an ER tonight, since I am an hour from the hospital, and went in to have it flushed anyway. They flushed it, refilled the Foley bulb to try to stop the leak and said it looked like everything had passed and I was good to go. Still set for untethering in the morning!! Big issue today is a burning sensation while sitting, I can't get comfortable for long and I get a burning sensation below the belt line on the right side. Only when sitting, goes away when I stand, no problem if I'm laying down. I asked at the Dr office and they shrugged it off as \"normal\". If anyone has advice on this I'd like to hear it.

      "Content": "I am at day 9 since surgery. I've had ups and downs, most of the time I believe it is self inflicted, over tired, over worked. My first follow up with Patel is at 6 weeks and they made it clear they expected me to be continent by then. I have a whole stack of supplies, Diapers, guards, shields. I use a diaper at night just for insurance but I've never filled one, just a few \"drainage squirts\" on the way to the bathroom. But I do wake up a lot to go to the bathroom, about 5-6 times every night. Each hour for the first 2-3 times, then 2-3 hours after that. I need to work on holding more volume. When I get out of bed I \"prepare\" myself to try to hold it, but sometimes I have a short drain squirt. Once I'm up it's OK and I'm on guards for the day, and short of the occasional unexplained whoops I'm good most all day. Today I bought shields because they will surely hold any of my mystery whoops moments, and its too flippin hot to be wearing anything heavier. Sometimes I wonder if the wetness I was feeling was sweat or leakage. Thinking about going back to work soon, I'm going to try another day on the shields first. Kegels... did you know there is an app for that? I was told to do kegels every hour, 10 reps for 4 seconds, 100-150 reps per day. I'm trying to do everything they tell me to do to the letter so there is no complaining that I didn't follow the program. What is \"AZ\" Amazon?",

Kegels... did you know there is an app for that? I was told to do kegels every hour, 10 reps for 4 seconds, 100-150 reps per day. I'm trying to do everything they tell me to do to the letter so there is no complaining that I didn't follow the program. What is \"AZ\" Amazon?",

      "Content": "So, I've been diligent for a few months doing my Kegels as required by my surgeon. I'm getting worried that it isn't going well. I can hold a 10, 5 second kegel sets and do them several time each day. But I can't do much more than 5-8 seconds. SO, I have to ask... when you start a urine stream can you clamp it off mid stream? I can't, well not until I'm close to empty. I can almost stop it but not completely and not for long. My sister told me to stop reading so much because I'm getting all worked up about the upcoming surgery and life after surgery. I though I had asked about kegels already but couldn't find where I did.",

      "Content": "Working on it! I'm down 20 pounds and still working at it! But I have to say, I find nothing about the torture of eating weeds and walking and riding to \"nowhere\" enjoyable. I doubt that I will ever find joy in this torture. I used to come home after work and work out in my shop doing something productive till bed time. Now I come home from work, eat weeds, and do work that accomplishes nothing, all while the work I want to do, and need to do, sits waiting. I do understand the need to lose weight, but when I said \"i don't have time for it\" I was right. Now I know why city people live in those zero lot line homes shoulder to shoulder, it's so they have time to do nothing. Originally Posted by Michael F Kozmic: Listen to your sister!

Kegels... did you know there is an app for that? I was told to do kegels every hour, 10 reps for 4 seconds, 100-150 reps per day. I'm trying to do everything they tell me to do to the letter so there is no complaining that I didn't follow the program. What is \"AZ\" Amazon?",

I use a diaper at night just for insurance but I've never filled one, just a few \"drainage squirts\" on the way to the bathroom. But I do wake up a lot to go to the bathroom, about 5-6 times every night. Each hour for the first 2-3 times, then 2-3 hours after that. I need to work on holding more volume. When I get out of bed I \"prepare\" myself to try to hold it, but sometimes I have a short drain squirt. Once I'm up it's OK and I'm on guards for the day, and short of the occasional unexplained whoops I'm good most all day. Today I bought shields because they will surely hold any of my mystery whoops moments, and its too flippin hot to be wearing anything heavier. Sometimes I wonder if the wetness I was feeling was sweat or leakage. Thinking about going back to work soon, I'm going to try another day on the shields first. Kegels... did you know there is an app for that? I was told to do kegels every hour, 10 reps for 4 seconds, 100-150 reps per day. I'm trying to do everything they tell me to do to the letter so there is no complaining that I didn't follow the program. What is \"AZ\" Amazon?",

      "Content": "My nurse told me that they recommend the generics over the depends because they work just as well, and the only difference was color. I don't know if that is fact or not, I never bought the Depends brand diapers. My scrotum was so swollen that penis irritation wasn't an issue for me I went looking for shields today, they aren't as easy to find, I don't need maximum protection right now. I told my wife to just order them from AZ from now on.",

He said that makes my 6.3 more like 11 or 12. I had my 4k test done and an MIR guided Biopsy. That 4k test is pricey, I'm still fighting the insurance on it.",

      "Content": "I just got back from my 6 1/2 week apt. PSA is zero! Continence is an issue but he says it isn't that far off track. And he set me up for PT. He was surprised to hear that I do have some response in the ED dept. He said he thought it would be a year before I saw any improvement. Not ready for action yet, but he said it was a great sign having anything this early. If I could just get off this incontinence roller coaster I'd be GTG.",

I never had any issues with it except the tag along issue. I guess I was fortunate, and I only had it for 5 days. Only? I was very happy to get it out, but I was more concerned about one of our dogs getting tangled in it then anything else.",
