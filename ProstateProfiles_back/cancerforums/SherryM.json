      "Content": "Hi Chuck and thanks for your reply. All of my husband's blood work is negative for an infection. He is 77 years old. He is on Plavix and Xarelto after a stroke 3 years ago. He had major complications with bleeding after the biopsy, 5 ER visits and two hospitalizations in 3 weeks. For now everything is quiet. He has lost about 10 lbs in the last 6 months and his energy level is very low.",
