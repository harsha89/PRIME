      "Content": "My husband has diagnosed in October 2013 with a gleason 9 T2a. After much discussion and several opinions he opted for a clinical trial phase three with docetaxal with lupron injections and will be followed by surgery after every 3 weeks for total of 18 week chemo Thearpy. Has anyone been through this trial ?",

      "Content": "Sorry trying to type on my iPhone and I was not clear about the trial. Yes we discussed all options with 4 different urologist and oncologist. His PSA being so low may be a bad sign. During the last 12 months his PSA has been up and down so it was time to see an urologist. Revealed a firm lumpy rt lobe prostate but normal sign. With his gleason 9 it may not secrete PSA since his cells are so erratic and nasty looking under the microscope. PSA is prostate specific and unfourtunely not cancer specific. After reviewing different tables the likely hood that it has micro metasize is a threat. One method of treatment will most likely be ineffective. Since taxotere is only FDA approved for metastatic PC we opted to optimize his surgical treatment ( in theory) by reducing tumor burden and potential micro metastasis since the 1o year ok look didn't look as favorable. Once in the bones it's difficult to control and the cell don't like to die as quickly so treatments tend to fail after a while. So he will receive 18 weeks of chemo 6 cycles every 3 weeks with taxotere and lupron injections every 3 mons. After 60 days of treatment and a radical prostectomy will be performed with removal of all lymph nodes and surrounding tissue including rt sided nerves. He may need further hormone treatment and radiation post procedure once the final staging is complete. In his case at his age it was our best option.",
