      "Content": "Hi lovely and helpful people, I am so pleased something like this exists to help concerned family members. It is so tough being someone of huge importance but not at hospital appointments to ask your own questions! So, we found out this week that Dad has prostate cancer. He is 67, fit and otherwise healthy. Late last summer he mentioned urination problems so of course we urged him to get to the doctor. He also complained of fatigued muscles/muscle wasting but that could have been due to a lack of physical work which he was used to. He did not want to tell us the bad news over Christmas but they found out in early December that it is indeed cancer. This is the facts that I know and I would LOVE for someone to cast an eye and tell me anything more about the stage he's at and what the out look appears to look like: PSA was 138 at first check The cancer is in ONE lymph node near by. Apparently they tested two, is this right/normal? The cancer is NOT currently in the blood or bones. He has a testosterone blocker implant in place under the skin and has responded very well to this and the PSA at last check was down to 38 and the tumor on the prostrate has shrunk. He briefly mentioned the Gleason score due to the +lymph node is \"7 or 8\".... I don't think he wants to worry us, but I googled and 7 is very different to 8. Scared. Chemo starts in 2 weeks and he needs 6 rounds (3 weeks apart) followed immediately by 7 weeks of daily radiation. Does that sound par for the course please? Can anyone give me further information regarding the cancer being found in one lymph node? Is this how it can travel around the body? If so how quick and will chemo do the job of mopping up all those potential strays? Does chemo kill the cancer in that lymph node AND the prostate gland? It's SO so scary, we are a very close family and feel like we've been kicked by a horse and had the wind knocked out of us. We live in England so are using the good old NHS. Thanks so much in advance.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by HighlanderCFH A big welcome to the forum for BOTH of you. Poppy, did you mention in your post anything about your dad having a biopsy of the prostate? I checked again & did not notice any such reference. Can you get his biopsy stats and share them with us? In parting, I would recommend that you get a copy of the 3rd edition (4th edition coming soon) of Dr Pat Walsh's \"Guide to Surviving Prostate Cancer.\" It is VERY informative. Good luck! Chuck Thank you so much Chuck, I am uplifted by your reply. I have not seen the biopsy report or asked any details of it, but yes he certainly did have biopsies taken and if I can get hold of them I will gladly share! The book sounds great, another one to add to the list instead of reading articles on the internet! Thank you very much",

Often, In the USA, they will attack this with a triple play of hormone therapy, external beam radiation, and High Dose Bracytherapy, with a potential for a curative result. If they have ruled out distant metastasis, by using PET or similar imaging, then there is hope that the cancer can be cured. If not, there has been great progress in managing the disease for many years, while more research may lead to a cure for all stages. Thank you. He had an MRI scan, I believe, after drinking a special liquid. I am assuming that was to highlight in the body where the cancer could be seen? All clear apart from that one lymph node nearby the prostate. I am more and more confident with your reply, thank you!",
