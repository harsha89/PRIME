      "Content": "Thanks for the welcome, MF! My DNA reference was on previous genealogical testing I had done in the past then run through Promethease. The results from Promethease suggest I have some genetic predisposition to higher chance of cancer, especially prostate cancer. Since I lack family history from my father's side (never knew him or that family), I have to combine that with what I know about my mother's side to understand genetic background (some cancer on mother's side, and my grandpa has a prostate \"condition\" that was secret at end of life with no records or people left to confirm what it was). The DNA testing has already been accurate in one issue: it shows I have a genetic predisposition for otosclerosis, and indeed, I'm a long-time otosclerosis patient already half deaf and getting deafer. Your advise about not worrying is on target. I'm really not worried about joining the club, but I'm vigilant and really just want to get the truth about what's going on in there out into the light, because I can tell you, there definitely is something going on in there! Right now, it's mostly just causing progressive discomfort. If it becomes something more serious, we're right on top of it. Great place to be.",

      "Content": "Greetings to my fellow travelers! I began a pre-PCa journey back in Oct 2017. I still don't have a firm PCa diagnosis as of today, but I've accumulated enough mileage to feel like I'd like to reach out and begin sharing with fellow travelers; I originally started this thread in another forum but thought I needed to get into the PCa thread with all of you who have so much more experience in this realm. I\u0092d love to hear from any of you who find some of what I write familiar, particularly anyone who has ASAP results on multiple biopsies without a diagnosis. I\u0092ll include a fair amount of detail. I have some cancer in my family history and a DNA test that suggests I have a higher risk for cancer, especially prostate cancer. I turned 50 in mid-2017 and had that round of 50-year-old testing through my general practitioner. For the prostate, Oct 2017, negative DRE but PSA 5.31. Referral to a great urologist. Dec 2017, negative DRE, PSA 6.67, PSA Free 14%. Urologist recommends biopsy. Jan 2018, biopsy (doc and staff were great, but the experience was much worse than I expected). Pathology: Right Apex, atypical ACINI, suspicious for carcinoma; Right Mid and Left Mid, rare atypical ACINI; all others benign. Pathologist suggests re-biopsy. Mar 2018, PSA 5.62, PSA Free 15%. Urologist recommends MRI. Scheduled for a 1.5T (a prosthetic in my right ear prevents me from 3T). Apr 2018, MRI prostate w/w-o contrast; Two PI-RADS 3 lesions in the TZ, indication is prostate cancer suspected, recommend follow-up. Prostate measure 5 cm with a volume of 43 mL. Lesion 1: anterior TZ, 1.1 cm ill-defined area of low T2 signal, mild decreased signal on the ADC but no restricted diffusion, PI-RADS 3 lesion, volume of 0.57 mL. Lesion 2: anterior TZ, somewhat ill-defined area of low T2 signal measuring 1.6 cm adjacent to the anterior fibromuscular stroma, tethering and low signal spiculations into the adjacent fat somewhat ill-defined and has low T2 signal and also has decreased signal on ADC but no significant restricted diffusion, cannot exclude underlying prostate cancer and would recommend follow-up, volume of 0.75 mL. The radiologist also noted mild diffuse low T2 signal throughout the PZ without areas of restricted diffusion (suggested prostatitis) and changes of benign prostatic hypertrophy within the TZ. Apr 2018, urologist recommends fusion biopsy. Had the fusion biopsy 10 May 2018. I asked for drugs on this one; prescribe vallum and percocet. 20 needles this time. This biopsy was much more difficult than the last; the TZ samples especially hurt (next time, I want stronger drugs). The TZ lesions all came back benign. However, the pathologist found atypical ACINI in all sections of the PZ this time, two zones specifically suspicious for carcinoma. Several cores reveal very small foci with atypical acini that are suspicious but lack definitive morphologic features and do not show all immunostaining characteristics of carcinoma. Immunostaining for p63, CK5/14 and p504S [PIN 4 multiplex (cocktail of antibodies)] reveals the focal absence of basal cell staining for CK5/14 and p63 and no significant increased staining for p504S within the atypical acini. Immunostaining for ERG is negative within the atypical acini. Pathologist recommended follow up; three doctors reviewed on the results. My urologist recommended follow up DRE, PSA Total, and PSA Free in 3 or 6 months; I asked for a 3-month follow-up, now scheduled in August 2018. He said we\u0092d review the next PSA results and determine next steps. I asked him if it would be correct to describe what\u0092s happening as \u0093pre-cancerous activity,\u0094 and he said it could be or not\u0097hard to say but the results thus far do suggest that we continually monitor for further changes. It's been an interesting journey so far. I went from knowing nothing about a prostate to reviewing medical journal articles on all sorts of cryptic details about prostate imaging, diagnosis, and treatment--and, of course, reading lots of forum entries of fellow travelers. I can definitely tell that \u0093things down there\u0094 don\u0092t feel right with symptoms of difficulty increasing slowly over the last year or two. It\u0092s not fun, but I'm not worried at all, really. I'm pretty grateful for the modern medical treatments and, in my case, early screening, detection, and monitoring. I have been surprised that the journey to diagnosis seems to be more of a marathon than a sprint. I'm a military guy, thus I'd prefer to drive the enemy out into the open and meet him in the light of day on the battlefield. It seems PCa diagnosis is more like going door to door, searching a densely crowded city to find a carefully hidden foe who is building and expanding his empire in the dark. Thanks for reading and looking forward to interacting with you all in the miles ahead.",
