      "Content": "I thought I would add a few things after reading some other posts: I don't seem to have any urination issues, don't get up at night, flow is good. Not a frequent loo visitor. One thing that I want to ask, my GP does the DRE right before they draw blood for the PSA, I asked my urologist about this and he said it wouldn't affect the PSA that fast, what do you guys think?",

      "Content": "Hi, I'm 53, just had a dre, my doc says it's enlarged, about the size of a lemon. PSA was 7.2 a year ago, he sent me to a urologist when it dropped to 4.1, urologist said wait and see, the 7.2 was probably an anomaly, PSA is now is 3.3. The thing that bothers me is when he said that my prostate is now about the size of a lemon. Seems alarming. What happened to the \"walnut\"? My GP says come back in 6 months for a DRE and PSA. What do you guys think? My dad is 87 and has an enlarged prostate but they don't think they will treat it due to his age.",
