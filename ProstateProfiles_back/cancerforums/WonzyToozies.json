      "Content": "I have a friend who was diagnosed with prostate cancer about 4 years ago. Since then, they've had him on random chemo therapy treatments throughout ALL those 4 years. They also have him loaded up on pain pills, finasteride, muscle relaxers and some very expensive pill that normally costs thousands a month, but due to him qualifying for some program (coordinated by the doctor) he pays very little for it. Over the years, he's lost a ton of weight and broke his hip after falling over about 6 months ago. The hip break has crippled him and he really started to go downhill after that. He looks like a shell of what he used to be and just seems to be getting worse as time goes on. He's sickly skinny, has lost most of his hair, has no appetite and can barely walk. I believe these are side effects of all his treatments and not related to the cancer itself. When he started treatment, he looked like a normal person. My question is simply this: Is it possible he's getting scammed by his doctor? Why would they have him on chemo therapy for so long (years). if he's taking this magic pill why is his treatment so debilitating and so lengthy? To my knowledge, the cancer hasn't spread. I try to ask my friend questions but he shuts me down immediately and refuses to talk about it. I'll ask \"how many more chemo treatments do you have to do?\" and he'll respond \"until they say\"; meaning until his doctor says he's finished. Is this normal for prostate cancer patients?",

      "Content": "Another, You make a lot of valid points and are probably right about everything you said. I just wanted to make sure the doctors have his best interests in mind. I'm not trying to make any kind of reflection on his competence, but I know people can be vulnerable when they're sick and they're judgement may be clouded as a result. From what he's told me, the doctors initially said \"this is under control\", \"we caught it early enough\" and \"you're going to beat this\". At first, he presented his illness as if it's no big deal and early enough to cure. Then, he broke his hip and has gone through prolonged treatments over the last several years. He has a cabinet full of pills and has had extreme weight loss. The shift from what he initially told me was a minor illness to what I've seen him go through recently was cause for my concern. I appreciate everyone's kind words. As to the gleason index, stage and all that stuff; I'm not sure I'll be able to find that out as he likely won't want to share it with me and I probably shouldn't ask at this point. The doctor is at a cancer care center. I'm not sure who owns it, if it's run by multiple doctors, etc. I gather it's a clinic. My PSA was normal last checked and I have not been diagnosed with prostate cancer.",
