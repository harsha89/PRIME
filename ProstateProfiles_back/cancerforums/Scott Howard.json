      "Content": "Originally Posted by Fairwind A third biopsy is probably called for at this time...I would ask for a \"saturation biopsy\" which takes more samples and reaches places the standard trans-rectal biopsy can not. It is performed differently, in a hospital under general anesthesia.. Some Urologists like to perform a \"T-3 MRI\" before the biopsy to try and locate any possible cancer beforehand so the biopsy needles can be targeted more accurately...Your urologist may want to put you on antibiotics to rule the chance infection is causing the rapid PSA rise....The squeaky hinge gets the oil...Start squeaking....Best of luck to you... My urologist did say after the second biopsy didn't find cancer that if he did another he would like to do a saturation biopsy and maybe do an MRI before to know what part of the prostate to look at if the MRI showed something. I would be for that but would like to rule out other reasons for the change in PSA first. I guess I'm holding out hope that it isn't cancer but weigh that agains't not waiting to long if it is.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by HighlanderCFH I kind of doubt that the big jump in PSA you've seen would be caused by prostate cancer because it. It is possible, but I don't think the PSA would elevate that quickly, not as fast as an infection would. But this also does not mean there cannot be prostate cancer along with an infection, so the saturation biopsy definitely is something to consider for the future. Your weak stream is also suggestive of BPH. Has the uro said anything about an enlarging prostate? This also helps boost the PSA numbers. Thanks for the response, I know he has said my prostate is fairly enlarged and has gotten bigger but I don't know the exact size. I am going to ask that question among many others at my appointment in a few days. My PSA has been moving up from 4.8 fours years ago to 6.8 this June and I was thinking that could be due to an enlarged prostate or BPH. It has been a gradual rise so I hope this big jump in 3 months has some other innocuous reason.",

      "Content": "Hello all, I have been reading prostate cancer posts off and on since May of 2016. My PSA has been rising since June of 2012 when my first number was 4.8 at age 49 years old. I have had two biopsies with 12 probes both times and no cancer was found. One sample did show ASAP cells. The last biopsy was about 3 years ago. I was told I have an enlarged prostate but I don't remember what size they said last time. My PSA in June of 2016 was 6.8 and the DRE didn't find any lumps and prostate was smooth and not rigid. I go to the bathroom mostly one time a night but sometimes twice. I have noticed that I go more often lately and it is more urgent. I have an appointment this Wednesday Sept. 21 and I had my blood PSA tested today for that appointment. I was shocked and scared to see it was a 14.03. It has risen from 6.8 to 14 in 3 months and has me very concerned. I am 53 years old and my dad had prostate cancer and a prostatectomy 3 years ago and is donig fine today. I know I can't do much now but wait for my next appointment and see what comes next. If I do have prostate cancer I hope that it is confined to my prostate at this time and hasn't gotten out. I also would hope that it isn't an aggressive form. The big jump in PSA is what really concerns me. I have read that prostatitis could elevate the PSA so I have my fingers crossed. Anyway thanks for letting me air my concerns. After reading many posts I see there are many knowledgeable and caring people on this forum. Oh, I have a very caring and helpful wife to help me through anything that comes our way. She tells me not to get to worried until we get more information. Scott",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by Southsider It may seem counterintuitive but the fact that you have prostate symptoms is actually a good omen that the rise in PSA scores is caused by prostatitis or BPH instead of cancer. Most prostate cancers don't cause symptoms until later, and prostatitis is perfectly capable of raising your PSA score. Try not to worry about it, there is a good chance that you don't have PC at all, and if you were to have it, there is an excellent chance you'll have a curative case. I should have also mentioned that I have a weak stream at times and flow interruptions to. Sometimes a dribble or two leak.",
