    "Content": "Had my prostate removed 6/25/2013. Arrived at hospital at 6 AM and surgery at 8:30. Lasted about 4 hours. Woke up in recovery room with catheter in place and 5 small incisions on stomach. Very little pain which was controlled with medication. Took my stool softer as instructed and had BM on third day. Home by 10 AM the following morning. Pathology indicated all margins and lymph nodes clear. Confirmed Gleason 3+4=7. Catheter removed today and to my amazement absolutely no leaking. I have urinated 5 times exactly like I did before surgery (no hesitation with strong stream). Have known of PC for 4 years and did Active Surveillance. When last biopsy showed Gleason had changed from 6 to 7, I scheduled my surgery for 30 days later. PSA to be checked in 5 weeks. Happy camper here. Took my Depends back to store. Oh, I am 66 years old and not too worried about sex issue, but we'll see what happens in future.",
