      "Content": "My father has been diagnosed with Stage 4 Metastatic Prostate Cancer 5 years ago. He is now 66 yrs and still fighting the illness with the help of God. PSA = 50 Gleason = 10 ( 5b +5b) Completed MRI/CT scans = Bony metastases The URO doctor in the Philippines immediately prescribed for the medication of Lupron and Bicalutamide. The PSA score where up and down (20, 8, 4, 1, 10, 9) during the span of taking 2 prescription drugs. One thing to note is that no chemo for the past 5 yrs for my Dad in battling the cancer. Just last month, my father completed another laboratory to check again the PSA level. The latest result of the PSA level is 46. The doctor mentioned that the Lupron is no longer effective in lowering the PSA and there is new drug that can be take which is Abiraterone (Zytiga). Any feedback if I need to push first for the chemo prior of taking the new medication Zytiga? I am very worried for my father and the side effect of the new medicine. Thank you very much. Marlou",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by MichiganMan16 Hey Marlou: Sorry to hear about your father, but good to see that he is still fighting hard. We all wish u the best. In all my readings, some doctors use Zytiga before Chemo, and others vice versa. There does not seem to be any certain protocol. I have seen it done both ways. Hopefully someone with the experience will chime in soon. Best Wishes, MM Thank you @Michigan Man16. Godbless!",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by HighlanderCFH Hi Marlou, I join with fl drifter in welcoming you to the forum and also to offer the best wishes for your dad. His diagnosis of Gleason 10 is the most aggressive type of prostate cancer and I admire him for still fighting this five years later. When you mention that there has been no chemo for the past 5 years, has he been receiving any other kind of treatments for the cancer? What was the primary treatment right after he was diagnosed? In the meantime, keep checking back for more answers regarding the new medication. I am not familiar with it, but others here probably have some knowledge of it and they will be jumping in over the next couple days with their experiences, thoughts and advice. Take care, Chuck Hi Chuck, the only medication he took immediately after he was diagnosed are Lupron and Bicalutamide. It effectively lowered down his PSA for the past 5 years. But recently, he was recommended to take Zytiga because the PSA result was high.",
