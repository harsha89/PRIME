    "Content": "I am 72 years old and my PSA scores prior to this past January averaged 1.5. In January (2012) it jumped to 4.4. Given the significant change in velocity, my physician recommended more frequent testing. In February (2012) the results were 3.2 and in August it was 2.6. DRE\u0092s are negative. I am currently taking 4mg of Tamsulosin due to reduced urine flow. I am scheduled for another PSA test next month and I wonder if I should have any other type of test as well as a biopsy preformed? Other recommendations would also be appreciated. Thanks",
