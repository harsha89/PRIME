      "Content": "My husband was just diagnosed with neuroendocrine prostate cancer. It was found on the prostate biopsy.l It's pretty rare. Right now he has just completed scans and the doctors are deciding what to do. It's difficult to even google it, not much comes up. In addition he has chronic lymphocytic leukemia. Life is going to get a lot more complicated I'm afraid. I'll post more information as I get it, because there really isn't much info out there.",

      "Content": "Hello all, I am posting on behalf of my husband, 72 year old Vietnam veteran, exposed to Agent Orange. He has Diabetes II, Chronic Lymphatic Leukemia, and now neuroendocrine prostate cancer. Oh also basal cell skin carcinoma. His prostate diagnosis was the result of a biopsy done in mid-January. It took so long to get the MRI, CAT and PET scans, that we really don't know for sure if it has spread or not. I got a copy of the CAT scan and there are suspicious nodules in his liver, lung and maybe bladder wall next to prostate. We haven't been able to get into the Urology doc or Oncologist yet, possibly next week. The Oncology doctor did say his prognosis for the neuro endocrine cancer could be as bad as 2 months to a year. The problem we are having is that he looks and feels pretty good. He is a very active outdoors man, and aside from some fatigue and hip pain, he just happily keeps on going. If his prognosis is that bad, wouldn't he feel worse? He is opposed to surgery and too much chemo or radiotherapy, but with him feeling good right now, how fast can this type of cancer work? Is anyone familiar with this type of cancer?",
