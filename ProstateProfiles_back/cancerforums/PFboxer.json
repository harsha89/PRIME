    "Content": "My urologist is wanting me to consider hormone therapy soon. My PSA numbers have tripled in the last year. .41 to 1.71 in 10 months. I have done some reading up on the side effects. I realize we are all individuals but I would like to know if anyone has been going through the treatment and how have the side effects been to deal with. I have some gastrointestinal issues that are aggravated by overheating aka hot flashes. These often turn into ER visits. If the hormone therapy is going to be landing me into the ER and the financial ruin that follows....what's the point? Thanks for any input Doug",
