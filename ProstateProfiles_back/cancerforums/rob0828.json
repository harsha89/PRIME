      "Content": "Originally Posted by Jim215 Welcome Rob: I concur with \"Another\" that you are VERY fortunate to have discovered this diagnosis at age 44. Since the other forum brothers have addressed the primary issues (as in focus on mortality rather than erections), I note that you have spoken only about \"open\" radical prostatectomy. Is that because where you reside there is no facility with a robotic option available? Open surgery was the gold standard for prostatectomies for decades but with the advent of the DaVinci robotic method, there is less potential for complications and blood loss and a quicker, less painful path to full recovery. If given the surgical choice, I would always opt for the robotic mode. On the radiation side, Cyberknife may sound like a \"quick fix\" but if you do a search of patient satisfaction surveys following PC treatment, Cyberknife is nearly always at the bottom of the listings as the massive doses of radiation sometimes leave patients with painful burns through the rectal area that may last for years (I personally know two such patients). A Gleason 6 diagnosis may lead many to a sense of relief but the high degree of involvement of the cores and the observation of capsular abutment causes me to agree with Pratoman that something more potent may be lurking. Best of luck, Jim No, I live in central southern Virginia, and I am about 1 hr. 45 min. drive from Duke Cancer Center. They have another surgeon that does the Robotic method, but I have spoken to the one so far. He claims that it is a shorter procedure and that it can be preformed just as effective as the Robotic method. It's about a 4 inch incision above the pubic bone. \"Minimally Invasive Small Incision Retropubic Prostatectomy\"",

I know this seems like the logical choice to make, but at this time I am really struggling with that decision mainly because of the sexual side effects that come with this course of treatment.

I have been reading a lot recently into the Cyberknife (SBRT) method, but its hard for me to find any good recent data. There's also so many mixed reviews out there, its hard to know what to believe.
