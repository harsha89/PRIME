I apologize for all the data below, I didn't know what data might be valuable to the members of this group. I could use some help with what my results actually mean and feedback on my plan. I appreciate your help! I was diagnosed with Prostate Cancer 4 days ago. My local urologist said I had Gleason 6 and 7 cancer and that the prostate needed removal soon. He said I could have surgery or robotic surgery. He said Robotic surgery had no better results but some people liked the newest technology. He said I was not a good candidate for radiation because of my young ((58 LOL)) age. I have an appointment 1n 20 days for a second opinion on treatment from University of Chicago Cancer center. I feel like a team approach at a hospital well skilled in this is the best path. My PSA record 10/2012=3.89, 4/2013=3.51, 5/2015=5.4, 11/2015 = 4.7, 11/2016 = 6.1, 5/2017= 6.4, 8/2017 = 6.9 Had a 3T Color MRI done Feb 2017. Came back clean. No tumors, no issues.

      "Content": "Hello everyone. I have read many posts and am impressed with the knowledge level of this group. I apologize for all the data below, I didn't know what data might be valuable to the members of this group. I could use some help with what my results actually mean and feedback on my plan. I appreciate your help! I was diagnosed with Prostate Cancer 4 days ago. My local urologist said I had Gleason 6 and 7 cancer and that the prostate needed removal soon. He said I could have surgery or robotic surgery. He said Robotic surgery had no better results but some people liked the newest technology. He said I was not a good candidate for radiation because of my young ((58 LOL)) age. I have an appointment 1n 20 days for a second opinion on treatment from University of Chicago Cancer center. I feel like a team approach at a hospital well skilled in this is the best path. My PSA record 10/2012=3.89, 4/2013=3.51, 5/2015=5.4, 11/2015 = 4.7, 11/2016 = 6.1, 5/2017= 6.4, 8/2017 = 6.9 Had a 3T Color MRI done Feb 2017. Came back clean. No tumors, no issues. But PSA kept rising. Had a 12 needle random biopsy 0 11/01/2017: Pathologic Diagnosis : A: Prostate, right apex, core biopsy: - A tiny focus of prostatic adenocarcinoma, Gleason grade 3+3=6, occupying less than 5% of core volume B-D: Prostate, sites as specified below, core biopsies: - Benign prostatic parenchyma, negative for carcinoma E: Prostate, left lateral, core biopsy: - Prostatic adenocarcinoma, Gleason grade 3+3 = 6, involving three of three cores and occupying approximately 10% of total core volume F: Prostate, left base, core biopsy: - Prostatic adenocarcinoma, Gleason grade 3+4 = 7, involving two of two cores and occupying approximately 45% of total core volume TUMOR Histologic Type: Adenocarcinoma (acinar, not other wise specified) Histologic Grade Gleason Pattern: Gleason pattern Primary (Predominant) Pattern: Grade 3 Secondary (Worst Remaining) Pattern: Grade 4 Total Gleason Score: 7 Tumor Quantitation Number of Cores Positive: 6 Total Number of Cores: 12 Tumor Quantitation: Proportion (%) of prostatic tissue involved by tumor: Approximately 5% Proportion (%) of Prostatic Tissue Involved by Tumor for Core with the Greatest Amount of Tumor: Approximately 45 % ACCESSORY FINDINGS Lymph-Vascular Invasion: Not identified Perineural Invasion: Not identified",

      "Content": "Update... I met with a surgeon this week. He has done 1500 prostate surgeries and I am comfortable with him. I have surgery scheduled Jan 2. He said he always waits 8 weeks minimum after biopsy to allow everything to heal up and allow the best odds for nerve sparing surgery. I am still meeting with the Univ of Chicago for a second opinion on pathology on Nov. 29. While I am comfortable with the surgeon I have chosen, I see no harm in a second opinion;. Thanks for the feedback.",

      "Content": "Well yesterday and surgery came and went. The doctor and team at St. Luke\u0092s was great. Surgery itself was a little longer than the doctor thought it would go. The right side went smooth but the tumor was very close to the nerve on the left side. He spent extra time on that side. Had to take about a millimeter of the nerve. I feel pretty good and came home this afternoon. Belly is a bit sore, but so far haven\u0092t taken any thing stronger than a couple Tylenol. Worst part is feeling I have to pee, but obviously have a catheter in. We will see how the first night at home goes, but so far so good. Thanks for all the support and info.

      "Content": "I met with my surgeon today, 6 days post RALP. Dr. Said I was healing nicely and removed the catheter. That was 5 hours ago, as so far still dry. I have urinated twice also during that time. I am encouraged so far. The last two days I walked 2 miles each day. Final pathology had no real surprises. Tumor was Gleason 3+4 =7. 30% of prostate was involved by tumor. Weight was 42.8 G. The Dr. shared with me that the surgery took about an hour longer than planned due to the tumor pressing up against the nerves on the left side. He said he spent a fair amount of time on this section but was able to save 70% of the left nerve. The right nerve was fine with normal margins. So now I try to get a handle on how how incontenance will effect me and start the 90 day countdown to the first PSA test. Thanks again for all the support. Ralph",
