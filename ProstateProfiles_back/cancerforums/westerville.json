      "Content": "Hi, Eligard is the generic form of lupron. You mentioned taking casodex now, it should have been given two weeks prior to the eligard to stop any T flare. I had a shot of eligard in october and just waiting on my psa test results after 3months so I then may be able see if it works for me. I have an appointment Jan 3rd to see Dr. Charles \"snuffy Myers in Virginia. He will put me on triple blockage adt3 with the added avodart. I am gleason 4/5=9 also and have been having trouble getting the right treatment. I understand your complaint about been diagnosed earlier. My family doctor keep telling me psa numbers were wonderful only to find out after going to a urologist and having a biopsy that the reason my numbers were wonderful was because my cancer is aggressive and doesn't produce much psa. Well I hope you just got a bad batch of eligard and it is working for you and me now. Have a nice holiday, Westerville",

      "Content": "Am doing fine. My Psa in Jan. was .04 in feb. .02, So the eligard is working for me. My doctor wants it down to .01 though. Lost the hair on my hands and part of my legs. Had my wonderful appointment with Dr. Myers in January and now feel comfortable with my treatment plan. Take many supplements and added scripts and a new diet. Have blood work done monthly to keep a eye on things which is nice. Still need to get another doctor on board to administer the shot , one that agrees with my treatment plan. Some doctors wait till you get worse to start treatment , reactive. Few doctors treat first when it is easier to reign in the monster, proactive. Am now getting my VA compensation for prostate cancer and agent orange while serving in Vietnam, so that does help with financing all of this. Been reluctant to try the VA doctors but might give them a shot to see what they can do for me. Later",
