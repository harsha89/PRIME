      "Content": "Just finished 44 days of IGRT. Now the three month wait to see if worked. Hardest part of the treatments was having to drive 50 miles a day. Do have some problems getting rid of the water. Am on Rapaflo, which does not seem to do any good, but am afraid to not take it just in case it is working a little. People at Southeast Regional Prostate Cancer Center are great. All are very professional, from the girl at the front desk to the people that operate the machine.",
