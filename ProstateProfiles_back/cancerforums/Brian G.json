      "Content": "I had da Vinci surgery on Feb. 5 after my PSA reached 13.4 in October 2012 (who knows what it was at by Feb. 5 considering it was a 7 in July 2011). My Dec. 18, 2012 biopsy showed cancer in three of four quadrants (3+3, 3+4, 3+4) but no invasion. There was so much cancer my doctor couldn't spare the nerves on the right side. So anyway, I'm going in March 27 for follow-up 90-day ultra-sensitive PSA. When talking to my doctor pre-surgery, I misspoke and said someone else who had it scored 0.2 post-surgery when I meant 0.02. He said they want to see it at about 0.02. So how low should it be? Should I freak if it is 0.04 or 0.05 or 0.1 or whatever?",

      "Content": "I had robotic prostate cancer surgery in February 2013 to remove 4/3 Gleason score cancer in three quadrants. Now I'm into the PSA test every six months phase. My February test result was 0.02 with the \"less than or equal to\" symbol in front of it. My August test result was simply 0.02. I received a letter from Keith Van Meter (Dr. Ellis was my surgeon) at Seattle Cancer Care Alliance along with my test results and he was very upbeat.

      "Content": "Chuck, Thanks. I'm getting one ultra-sensitive PSA at six weeks (March 27) and then another at 90 days (May 15) during my follow-up appointment. That's good to know that it might not be all gone (at least according to the test) at six week mark. He just ordered the ultra-sensitive, he didn't say why. But I'm assuming that he wants to see if *anything* is remaining. Since I no longer have a prostate, it should be close to zero, at least at six weeks. I assume that's the reason for the ultra-sensitive test. So far, I'm impotent but the doctor said that should improve within a year given that I'm 46 and had full function beforehand. (I hope I didn't damage the nerves with aggressive masturbation too early.) I'm sure if that's with or without the $124 a month Cialis that I can't afford. I have nerve damage in my left eye so the understand the concept but it's weird seeing something arousing and not getting aroused.",

      "Content": "I'll be 47 in May. I had da Vinci surgery on Feb. 5 due to a 13.4 PSA (and that was in October) and a biopsy that showed Gleason 3 plus 3 and 3 plus 4 in three quadrants. Because it was so advanced, the doctor said he couldn't spare the nerves on the right side. He said my most significant improvement would be after one year. I'm almost done with my first (free) month of 5 mg Cialis. I don't know where the $124 a month is going to come from after that. With a lot of effort plus visual and mental stimulation, I've managed to have some dry orgasms with what I hardly would call an erection (but not entirely flaccid). I'm not sure if aggressive masturbation is good or bad for me. I've researched it online and heard a) it damages the healing nerves and should be avoided and b) it is good since it's acting like physical therapy. Who's right?",
