      "Content": "Hi I'm 51 year old male. I've been doing PSA Test since I became 40. Everything has been good for the last tests. However, I recently had another PSA Test and the level went up according to the doctor. The Rectal Exam was normal. I don't know the exact PSA Level. The doctor left me a message saying it increased from last year and I should setup an appointment. In doing research, I came across the fact that recent ejaculations can cause the PSA to jump. I did have sex the morning of the exam and took the blood test about an hour later. Could this be the reason for the PSA jump? Does anyone have experience with this? I'm thinking I should take the exam again. Thank you.",
