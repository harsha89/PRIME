      "Content": "I had it as a primary treatment. Very, very slight loose stool after about two weeks. Also after about two weeks it would sting to urinate.....but no big deal. Treatment took about 25 minutes and I would go home to work out and run. Never got tired. Asked the doctor about getting tired once and his reaction was why would you be getting tired? He felt it was more of a mental issue. Within a week and one half of the last treatment all issues were gone. I had it done in 2005.",

      "Content": "Brad, Not sure if it is a bounce or not. Since you still have a prostate it could be an infection and that could explain the increase in PSA. I had IMRT 10 years ago . My lowest PSA was 0.295 after two years. It then bounced around going as high as 0.47 six months after the 0.295 reading. For the most part my readings have been in the 0.35 range. My radiation doctor first told me that after treatment the PSA would be like a saw blade. It would probably go up and down , up and down\u2026\u2026and it has. I can remember him telling me that I had an 88% chance of being under 0.50 mark ten years down the road. I would say relax and see what it is in 6 months",

I mentioned it to my doctor and he told me he had done it once with his fingures crossed. So much for the saying you can not have radiation for a salvage treatment if you start with radiation. Times and techniques are changing. I do think you need an organ to have brachytherapy however. Just my two cents",

      "Content": "I had IMRT almost 9 years ago. The machine was manufactured by Siemens. I had 38 treatments 200 gy a treatment. I was 59 years old ,3+4, T1C, PSA of 3.41 with 3 samples of ten showing cancer. One at 65% and the other two 5% or less. The radiation center was only `12 minutes away and being retired it gave me something to do each day during the winter. Cost back in 2005 was just over 65,000. My insurance picked up most of the cost I paid around 2600 because my treatment went Nov- Jan\u2026\u2026two different years. During treatment after about two weeks I experienced a burning feeling when peeing\u2026\u2026..no big deal. The feeling left within a week or so of the end of treatment. Never felt any fatigue in fact I was able to continue running on most days if the temperature was about 20. My bowls loosened up a little but no diarrhea . I put lotion on the area they were radiating everyday so no burns either. Now eight plus years down the road the only side effect I have is occasionally I will see a speck of blood on my stool after a bowl movement. This is not to often. I have since had two colonoscopies and doctor said everything was ok blood was of no concern. I have been told that some foods like popcorn do not digest that completely and will scrape the delicate veins on the trip out causing bleeding. All functions work if you know what I mean. My decision to go with external beam radiation was mainly to stay as far away from incontinence. The surgeon told me that with an operation I should expect some degree of incontinence. As little as a drop to possibly not being able to control my flow. I asked him if he had my numbers what treatment would he as a surgeon seek. He only had to think for a moment and replied external beam radiation. His remark was that as a surgeon \u201cI could not walk around and operate if I was dripping .\u201d He gave me the name of a radiation oncologist. One last remark it was a large team effort.",

I like the idea. \"A new study appearing in The Prostate has found that certain measles virus vaccine strain derivatives, including a strain known as MV-CEA, may prove to be an effective treatment for patients with advanced prostate cancer. The findings show that this type of treatment, called virotherapy, can effectively infect, replicate in and kill prostate cancer cells.\" I read some where that the body then fights off the measles and you're off to the races. Neutrondbob , do you know anything about Red Clover. I may be getting this mixed up but I thought I read that it was being used in a phase 2 study. It has strong isoflavones and I think it said that they minic estrogin . I might have miss read the article. Saw the same ingredience in a soy product for woman and I wrote the manufacturer to see if in was safe for men to take. I believe it was called Soy Balance. The company replied\" we think so but you had better ask your doctor. \" The soy balance is used to treat hot flashes in woman. Glenn",
