      "Content": "Originally Posted by Jake XYZ Thanks, Nick. I'm just imagining how not fun moving around with the catheter will be, but luckily this forum has put some of that fear to rest. Like I said, I have a couple surgeries before and both required a catheter,,,but only for 24 hours and I was laying in hospital bed during that time. But during that time, Mr. Johnson tried to get away by making himself as tiny as he could. He is a big baby...well a small baby...I am sure he is going to try to hide even more this time,, and I'm sure the staff will get a big laugh out of it. HA! I love it. I have a large catheter bag with a long hose for sleeping at night. Otherwise, the hospital provided a smaller bag that attaches to my leg with velcro straps. It's not bad at all and walking is no problem. If your hospital doesn't supply you with one, I would strongly recommend asking. I can't imagine having to deal with only having the larger bag. Nick",

It felt like I needed to urinate but obviously that wasn't the case. My doc recommended an OTC urinary analgesic. I used AZO. It worked great. But, it caused a metallic taste in my mouth after the first 24 hours so I quit using it. Nick",

      "Content": "Tom Although older than you (I'm 56), I'm still relatively young for PCa. I had my surgery 6 weeks ago today. I too am active and otherwise healthy. Although I did speak with a radiation oncologist, the decision for surgery was not a difficult one for me. There were three major factors.

      "Content": "The procedure went well. The doc said he spared both nerve bundles. That was unexpected considering he previously said he would take the right bundle. He feels pretty good that he got all the cancer, but we shall see when he discusses the path report at my follow up appointment in a week. I did have an issue during surgery. Coming out of anesthesia, they noticed my heart was not firing quite right. The called it a left branch bundle block. That apparent means that the electrical signals firing my heart were a bit out of sync. The did an EKG in recover and another EKG this morning. Both were normal. They also did an ultrasound on my heart and that was normal as well. I've never had any heart problems before. They now think it was just a reaction to the anesthesia so I was discharged today around 2:30 pm. I'm fairly sore but it's tolerable. I don't seem to have a lot of energy, but it's coming back. I suppose that's normal. Thanks for the support, guys! On to recovery. Nick",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by Michael F Fortunately the bladder heals quickly, as does the urethra. Hopefully your URO Surgeon is not prognosticating unwanted outcomes. Did your URO Surgeon address the \"EPEs at Right Apex\" at time of surgery? Please ask him/her. Did he/she preoperativley plan an incision close to the bladder? In my non-medical professional opinion \"PT3A\" qualifies you for immediate post RP PSA monitoring by Ultrasensitive PSA (uPSA) monitoring moving forward starting at the 6 week post RP and then compared to the 12 week post RP level. Be sure to use the \" Same Lab Using The Same uPSA Methodology\" each time in order to compare results and make a Clinilcal assessment of your risk for recurrence status. For now, simply try to relax and focus on a optimizing a good recovery. Remain optimistic & simultaneously vigilant! Best wishes for a complete Cure! MF Hi Michael Great comments. Could you clarify what you mean by addressing the EPE at time of surgery? I'm not sure I'm following you on that. He did say that he tried to cut wide throughout the procedure. In my discussion with him yesterday, he said it was possible cauterization killed any cells that might have remained. In a pre-op discussion, he said he always strives for negative margins... although I imagine that would be the goal of any surgeon. Not sure if this addresses your comment. Regarding the uPSA monitoring at 6 and 12 weeks, I believe that to be the plan. He said he wanted to see PSA scores <=0.02. I assumed that was actually uPSA since I believe only uPSA is able to measure to that level. He did indeed pre-operatively plan an incision close to the bladder and said reconstruction may be a bit more of a challenge due to that incision farther up the bladder neck. I believe I'm doing a good job of being optimistic. If the follow up PSA scores are not ideal, I'll move on from there and take whatever steps are necessary to rid my body of this crap. I've got to admit that having this disease at a relatively young age is a bit scary (as if a CA diagnosis isn't scary enough at any age). The likelihood of BCR at some point along the path is disconcerting. But, I can't let myself dwell on that.",

Agree with what MF said regarding the uPSA...stay on top of your case as much as possible. Use the uPSA as your guide, with 0.03 or > being highly indicative of BCR for pt3 tumors ( higher risk tumors). Stay strong, MM Thanks, MM. I'm impatiently awaiting the uPSA test. In the meantime, I think my attitude is pretty good. There's really no sense in letting my head go to dark places. Nick",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by Michael F Hi Nick! Apologies for the late response. I have both been away and missed your question. Some URO Surgeons will wait intraoperatively for an initial path report on surgical margins. If (+) they go back an excise additional tissues in the 'neighborhood' of the PMs. My only reason for suggesting uPSA monitoring is to detect a potentially rising PSA early. uPSA results are out to the 3rd decimal (and some beyond). Your URO Surgeon simply wants to see your post RP PSA at <0.02 which is 100% perfect. I do strongly advise getting original copies of each lab report. The exact Lab and exact PSA methodology will be listed on the report. Stay focussed on your recovery and forget about future PSAs! Getting rid of \"The Foley\" (a weird but painless sensation) will be make you feel like a new man! Keep optimistic at all times! MF Hi Michael For whatever reason, I didn't notice you replied. Sorry about that. My surgeon did not request intra-op pathology. I'm assuming he would have if the biopsy path report was worse. We never discussed this prior to the procedure so I'm guessing. Got rid of Foley yesterday and that has made a huge difference in my overall demeanor. As you said, I feel like a new man!",

      "Content": "Hi Jake I had RALP six weeks ago today. I was supposed to have my catheter removed one week post op. However, he detected that the bladder neck and urethra seal was not 100% so it stayed in another week. I was leaking badly for about two weeks. I was getting frustrated and concerned with my progress. With that said, I didn't have major problems with night leakage although I did have to get up often. At three weeks after catheter removal, leakage was greatly improved to the point that I graduated from diapers to shields. This past week has seen more good progress. The last few days, the shields have been just barely damp at the end of the day using only one shield per day. I'm sure everyone's experience is different. My advice would be to just relax. After the first couple weeks post-catheter, I started seeing noticeable progress every day. It'll come for you, too. Nick",

      "Content": "Had my first follow up visit this morning. The doc said that he cut the bladder a bit close to the bladder to ensure he got all cancer cells in that area.

If PSA is below 0.02, the likely recommendation will be no additional treatment but need to monitor PSA. If the PSA is higher than 0.02, the likely recommendation will be radiation. My doctor said he's seen hundreds of path reports very similar to mine and says the probability is 60% of a PSA below 0.02. So, the news is a bit of a mixed bag. I'm continuing to be optimistic and looking forward to giving Mr. Foley the boot. Nick",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by Francij4 Re USPSA I am 30 months post op and my USPSA results have been 0.008, 0.014, 0.015, 0.020, 0.024, 0.030, and the most recent 0.023. I was T3A 3+3 15% tumour. Urologist and second opinions from 2 oncologists and they all say the same no further treatment and some men seem to have a residual PSA regardless of outcome, interestingly one of them associated it with fully functioning erection? ??? Anyway they have told me to take a year out from PSA tests and have some fun!! Glad you've got some good scores, Franci. I'm hoping you've cleared a trail for me to follow. Nick",

      "Content": "The procedure went well. The doc said he spared both nerve bundles. That was unexpected considering he previously said he would take the right bundle. He feels pretty good that he got all the cancer, but we shall see when he discusses the path report at my follow up appointment in a week. I did have an issue during surgery. Coming out of anesthesia, they noticed my heart was not firing quite right. The called it a left branch bundle block. That apparent means that the electrical signals firing my heart were a bit out of sync. The did an EKG in recover and another EKG this morning. Both were normal. They also did an ultrasound on my heart and that was normal as well. I've never had any heart problems before. They now think it was just a reaction to the anesthesia so I was discharged today around 2:30 pm. I'm fairly sore but it's tolerable. I don't seem to have a lot of energy, but it's coming back. I suppose that's normal. Thanks for the support, guys! On to recovery. Nick",

When my surgeon contacted me on the phone to go over it he said there was one focal point on the prostate but he exercise tissue around it and that was clear so for all practical purposes I had negative margins. But I am a Gleason 8 so I want to be prepared. My PSA test is on June 13 at 8 weeks. Steve Gotcha. Sounds like it's good news. Congrats on the marriage! Nick",

I was completely incontinent for the rest of the day. I put on a fresh Depends right before bed. I woke up expecting it to be saturated. But, it was just a bit damp. I then proceeded to urinate intentionally in the toilet. YAY!!! I can't recall the last time I was that happy to pee. With the exception of a few drips, I was able to go again intentionally a few hours later! I'm a long way from declaring I can hold my water. But, considering it is two weeks post-op, I'm hoping this indicates a strong probability of returning to complete continence. Nick",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by MichiganMan16 Nick: Do not make to many assumptions at this early stage in the game. It has only been a few weeks, and remember when u are lying down and sleeping, u are not dealing with gravity. All u can do for now is the kegel's, and start a walking routine to build up the muscles. It is way to early to worry about anything. Just take one day at a time, and measure your progress in weeks or weekly. BTW...was your G 4+3 downgraded to 3+4? If so, that is a big bonus for u. Stay strong and stay the course, MM Yeah. I'm trying not to be too excited about this. I realize this is going to be more of a journey rather than a sprint. I was just happy to intentionally hold the urine this morning until I was ready to release it. I didn't expect that. So far today, I'm able to hold in urine when sitting and walking around with a few drops escaping here and there. With that said, it's not like I'm doing jumping jacks. I'm working from home this week. But, I think I'm going to head over to the park for a little walk and see what happens. Good catch on the Gleason score, MM. The path report did show 3+4=7 so, yes. It was downgraded. I should add that to the signature. Nick",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by MichiganMan16 Nick: Do not make to many assumptions at this early stage in the game. It has only been a few weeks, and remember when u are lying down and sleeping, u are not dealing with gravity. All u can do for now is the kegel's, and start a walking routine to build up the muscles. It is way to early to worry about anything. Just take one day at a time, and measure your progress in weeks or weekly. BTW...was your G 4+3 downgraded to 3+4? If so, that is a big bonus for u. Stay strong and stay the course, MM Yeah. I'm trying not to be too excited about this. I realize this is going to be more of a journey rather than a sprint. I was just happy to intentionally hold the urine this morning until I was ready to release it. I didn't expect that. So far today, I'm able to hold in urine when sitting and walking around with a few drops escaping here and there. With that said, it's not like I'm doing jumping jacks. I'm working from home this week. But, I think I'm going to head over to the park for a little walk and see what happens. Good catch on the Gleason score, MM. The path report did show 3+4=7 so, yes. It was downgraded. I should add that to the signature. Nick",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by MichiganMan16 Nick: Do not make to many assumptions at this early stage in the game. It has only been a few weeks, and remember when u are lying down and sleeping, u are not dealing with gravity. All u can do for now is the kegel's, and start a walking routine to build up the muscles. It is way to early to worry about anything. Just take one day at a time, and measure your progress in weeks or weekly. BTW...was your G 4+3 downgraded to 3+4? If so, that is a big bonus for u. Stay strong and stay the course, MM Yeah. I'm trying not to be too excited about this. I realize this is going to be more of a journey rather than a sprint. I was just happy to intentionally hold the urine this morning until I was ready to release it. I didn't expect that. So far today, I'm able to hold in urine when sitting and walking around with a few drops escaping here and there. With that said, it's not like I'm doing jumping jacks. I'm working from home this week. But, I think I'm going to head over to the park for a little walk and see what happens. Good catch on the Gleason score, MM. The path report did show 3+4=7 so, yes. It was downgraded. I should add that to the signature. Nick",

      "Content": "I had my first post-op PSA test this morning which is exactly six weeks from RALP. My surgeon wanted to test 6 and 12 weeks out. I have not heard the news officially from him yet. However, his practice posts all information on their patient portal. I received an email notification that a test result had been posted. It's 0.01. Yahoo!!! I think I'll wait until the next test in 6 weeks before I officially declare myself a member of the Zero Club. But, this is certainly something to celebrate. This was a regular PSA test... not uPSA. Apparently, he's not a fan of uPSA per his nurse. He did a fellowship at Johns Hopkins. They don't seem to be fans of uPSA either, so that likely has influenced his opinion. Regardless, today has been a good day. Nick",
