      "Content": "Hi, First any help is very appreciated. My husband doesn't do computers so I am posting out of concern. I know he should have been testing every year but it's a fight to get him to go, a big one. My husband is 57 years old. In April 2013 his PSA was 1.3 In April 2015 his PSA was 2.3 In Dec 2017 his PSA was 2.6 My question is does anyone think this is alarming? I asked the nurse who deemed it normal and would not let me ask the doctor. To me it seemed high. I am scared to absolute death of cancer having just lost a uncle to it and another uncle going through it with good results so far. My husband is not any kin by blood to them. Thanks in advance.",

      "Content": "Thank you both, that's very reassuring. I know for us not to do the \"deed\" before the test. The only thing he did in that time frame was cut firewood, I don't know if that would be considered to much excercise. But with my uncles diagnosis I do believe he will test yearly now. Again thanks we are all quite on edge now days in our family.",
