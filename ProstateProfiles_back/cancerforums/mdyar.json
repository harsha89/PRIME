From the very beginning of this whole dilemma in '05, there was always a bias there for a cure and not treatment. \" No side effects, no loss of this or loss of that.

In my OP, there is the trajectory of the rise, and it steps up on every other test. But the initial jump here is large over a 6 month period, as as opposed to the initial tracking of it. The second test is near the first value, and Id expect it to nearly double from the .55 on the next one comparing that to the original pattern in my salvo. From what I understand the progression of this is linear, and if left untreated one might go another_______years? But I don't remember if these psa values are all 3 mos. apart or if they were spread out at 6 mos. R. do you know the its doubling rate from those values? Thanks",
