      "Content": "Hello to all on this holiday week. Yesterday, I got a call from my urologist with the results of a Select MDx test they did as a result of my recent PSA test. The results were not good, higher risk than the doctor would like. My PSA was 4.3 in October and they also found a UTI which I took 28 days of antibiotics for. Since I've already had a biopsy in August, 2016 that was negative, they're asking me to get an MRI now. I'm guessing they will decide then if they want to biopsy or not. I'm scheduled to get another PSA test in February and a return visit to the urologist in March. Trying not to get worked up about things and hoping that waiting until March is not a bad thing. I've had bouts of prostatitis in the past and wonder if a biopsy is warranted here. I know over 4 is not good but my numbers don't seem that bad but the Select MDx seems to warrant further checking. I've posted in the forum before as Sandy09 but changed my login and this is my first post at Woodman. Can't quite get the hang of logins and password sometimes! Looking for any suggestions and/or advice as everying has been very helpful and encouraging in the past. My recent PSAs are below. 3.0 Dec 2014 3.8 Dec 2015 3.9 Jan 2016 4.7 Jul 2016 Free PSA 33% 4k Score 21% Biopsy Aug 2016 negative 3.5 Apr 2017 4.3 Oct 2017 UTI - Antibiotics 28 days 4.1 Dec 2017 - UTI gone",

Also thanks for taking the time to read my old posts all those years ago and yes, you're correct, I was overreacting then as well. I'm an expert over reactor. I drive my wife nuts. But folks like you and the others on this forum help me enormously to deal with this. Going to the doctor's office is not one of my favorite things. I've been seeing the same Urologist for many, many years and I've always found him to be pretty conservative and not willing to go overboard on things. When I started seeing him it was for prostatitis and BPH. I've come back usually on a yearly basis and he's always set the return appointment times for me based on what he thinks is sensible. I pretty much follow his lead. I'm encouraged that many of you on this forum feel his advice is sound as you guys have been there and your thoughts are invaluable to me. Not to mention putting my mind to rest about dumb things to worry about. The more I read about the prostate, I'm beginning to see and understand the notion of living with (and monitoring) prostate cancer. It's a concept that has always kept me up at night because I guess I've always thought it should just come out! Spending time on this forum has made me see things in a different light. It's made me feel much better. Thanks for that! Back in July of 2015, my PSA was 3.1. In December it was 3.8. At that time, my doctor said to come back in 6 months and do a free PSA test which came back at 4.7 and 33%. That's where I'm at now. About a week before my last test, I started to get some prostatitis symptoms again which are more noticable after the DRE. My doctor suggested the 4kscore test out of caution and basically echoed what you are saying. Don't panic! His reasoning is the same as yours, if the 4kscore test looks good, we'll just retest in 6 months. I will gather up all my PSA numbers and post them back. Appreciate the thoughs and suggestions. They do me alot of good - you have no ide.",

That's my usual symptom, sometimes a lower back ache as well. The doctor did a DRE and mentioned if he found anything he'd do a biopsy right away. He didn't find anything, fortunately. He did then arrange for me to do a 4kscore test, next week, to see what my chances of aggressive cancer might be. From what I've read, that test does PSA, Free PSA and two other biomarkers of some sort. Depending on the results, he suggested we'd discuss a biopsy or if the results are good, see him again in 6 months. I haven't been tested for Prostatitis by this doc. He has diagnosed me with BPH but he told me my prostate doesn't feel enlarged. Does BPH enlarge your prostate?",

      "Content": "Hello to all. I'm 62 and regular viewer of the forum, albeit Prostate cancer free so far. I just visited my Uro doc yesterday to review my latest PSA readings. My PSA was 3.8, 6 months ago and now it's jumped to 4.7. He did a Free PSA test this time and it came back at 33%. He's told me this is good and I should be comforted by it. When he told me 4.7, however, I immediately thought that we should do a biopsy right away with the change since last time. He advised me not to jump into it so fast and that with my history of Prostatitis and BPH, the number could be related to that. He wants me to do a 4kscore test to see what the likelihood of me developing cancer is and then we'll sit and talk about what to do next, in about 3 weeks. I've been going to this doc for over 8 years and I do trust him and find his conservative approx makes sense in my sensible mind. He says he does lots of biopsies and assures me that if the 4kscore test comes back poorly, we'll arrange for me to have one. Otherwise he could suggest Active Surveillance. My gut tells me that if they find even the littlest bit of cancer I want it out! Am I overreacting to all this? Thanks for letting me get it off my chest!",

Not to mention putting my mind to rest about dumb things to worry about. The more I read about the prostate, I'm beginning to see and understand the notion of living with (and monitoring) prostate cancer. It's a concept that has always kept me up at night because I guess I've always thought it should just come out! Spending time on this forum has made me see things in a different light. It's made me feel much better. Thanks for that! Back in July of 2015, my PSA was 3.1. In December it was 3.8. At that time, my doctor said to come back in 6 months and do a free PSA test which came back at 4.7 and 33%. That's where I'm at now. About a week before my last test, I started to get some prostatitis symptoms again which are more noticable after the DRE. My doctor suggested the 4kscore test out of caution and basically echoed what you are saying. Don't panic! His reasoning is the same as yours, if the 4kscore test looks good, we'll just retest in 6 months. I will gather up all my PSA numbers and post them back. Appreciate the thoughs and suggestions. They do me alot of good - you have no ide.",

      "Content": "Thanks ASAdvocate for your response. My doctor seems to think the same as you. He doesn't want to just jump in a do a biopsy unless it's absolutely necessary. We discussed the 4k test which I will get next week. He said if it looks good, we'll just keep checking every 6 months and stay on top of it. It seems so unusual to me that one could \"live\" with Prostate Cancer without the urge to get it out. You're living proof! Thanks again for the helpful words.",

      "Content": "Hello to all. I'm 62 and regular viewer of the forum, albeit Prostate cancer free so far. I just visited my Uro doc yesterday to review my latest PSA readings. My PSA was 3.8, 6 months ago and now it's jumped to 4.7. He did a Free PSA test this time and it came back at 33%. He's told me this is good and I should be comforted by it. When he told me 4.7, however, I immediately thought that we should do a biopsy right away with the change since last time. He advised me not to jump into it so fast and that with my history of Prostatitis and BPH, the number could be related to that. He wants me to do a 4kscore test to see what the likelihood of me developing cancer is and then we'll sit and talk about what to do next, in about 3 weeks. I've been going to this doc for over 8 years and I do trust him and find his conservative approx makes sense in my sensible mind. He says he does lots of biopsies and assures me that if the 4kscore test comes back poorly, we'll arrange for me to have one. Otherwise he could suggest Active Surveillance. My gut tells me that if they find even the littlest bit of cancer I want it out! Am I overreacting to all this? Thanks for letting me get it off my chest!",

      "Content": "Thanks for the note back, Chuck, I do remember that a day before my last PSA test, I had that \"feeling\" of fullness in my perineum, kind of like sitting on a golf ball. That's my usual symptom, sometimes a lower back ache as well. The doctor did a DRE and mentioned if he found anything he'd do a biopsy right away. He didn't find anything, fortunately. He did then arrange for me to do a 4kscore test, next week, to see what my chances of aggressive cancer might be. From what I've read, that test does PSA, Free PSA and two other biomarkers of some sort. Depending on the results, he suggested we'd discuss a biopsy or if the results are good, see him again in 6 months. I haven't been tested for Prostatitis by this doc. He has diagnosed me with BPH but he told me my prostate doesn't feel enlarged. Does BPH enlarge your prostate?",
