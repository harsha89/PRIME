      "Content": "Thanks Chuck. My urologist is relatively young but kind of a hot shot. He does vasectomy reversals and the most inflatable penile prostheses (IPP) on the west coast. I am not sure how much experience he has with prostate cancer but he is in a large practice in Mountain View, California (home of Google) where standards of care are pretty high. He did say that if I had a positive biopsy with a score of six, he would favor just watching it closely. I understand the arguments in favor of active surveillance but don't think it is for me. The way I see it a score of six is actually AT LEAST six, with upgrades occurring in up to 50% of cases that proceed to prostatectomy. It is my understanding that you can't get in to see Dr. Peter Carroll at UCSF unless you already have a cancer diagnosis. I am unsure who to try to get to do the biopsy. The fact that I do have an IPP that Dr. Karpman did adds some additional factors to think about and lead me to lean toward letting him do the biopsy and take it from there.",

      "Content": "Reading about all you guys struggling with ED really pains me because it is so unnecessary. I struggled with ED due to unknown causes (although chronic Lyme Disease may have had something to do with it) since my early forties. I tried the pills and got mostly side effects. My testosterone was low and being on injectable testosterone helped for a number of years but eventually that became ineffective. My history of Dupuytren contractions was an absolute contra-indiction to injecting into my penis and pumps were not for me. So I got an implant at age sixty-three. The actual surgery took about twenty minutes. I stayed in the the hospital overnight for IV antibiotics and pain control and drove myself home over two hundred miles the next day. I now have an erection on demand that lasts as long as I want it to, every single time. My insurance paid for most of the cost. Both Medicare and the VA cover it. My only regret is not having done this many years earlier. Hopefully this thread will be an avenue for discussing this option that is not offered often enough, for reasons that I just do not understand. I am glad to answer questions and also suggest a website named frankalk.org. It is a moderated website dealing with ED.",

      "Content": "Rooster, As I mentioned, I drove home over 200 miles the day after surgery. Dr. Karpman had me come in a week later and taught me how to inflate AND deflate and urged me to do it frequently. He had me back two weeks after that and cleared me for intercourse and again urged me to inflate as much as I could stand it, as often as I could stand it, in order to maximize size. He had me semi-inflated for the first week so that was a bit awkward but I wasn't lying around on pain pills, at all. That said, surgeons' skills vary and I went to the top doc for this procedure on the west coast. I am totally satisfied with the outcome. In several ways it is better than new.",
