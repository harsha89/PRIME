      "Content": "Hi Barry, The help and support I have recd at this forum is priceless. You struck gold when you happened upon this site. I just wanted to wish you good luck and try to calm your stress a little bit by repeating to you what the doc told us and that is the cancer is not contagious through semen. As the wife I am surely hoping he's right. In the beginning of this unwelcome journey there was a mountain that We had no clue how to navigate through. But little by little, slowly but surely, my husband and I made it over the crest and you will too. Just remember to breathe. And ask lots of questions. Kat",

Approx 3hrs post surgery nurse got me up to walk. Got from hospital room window to the hallway door. Felt dizzy and nauseous. Nurse said \"breathe\". Best advice. In thru nose out thru mouth. At midnight couldn't sleep. Elected for two Percocet and finally fell asleep. Passed gas and stained bed pad. Embarrassing but felt great. 4am took first of many laps around the nurse's station. Next day, Friday: discharged 2pm with 2 Percocet for anticipated pain getting in and out of cab. Abdominal pain was primary pain, catheter was second. 2nd day post op, Saturday: Bowels began to function as gas and diarrhea. Felt like a king. Finally allowed to eat solid food. Walked hallways at Hope Lodge and ventured out to the city streets 4 doors down to deli for first taste of solid food since Tuesday. 3rd day post op Sunday: abdominal pain subsiding. Only using Advil. Walking hallways and city streets. Walking helped reduced abdominal pain, increase blood flow and stronger bm's. Took well deserved shower. 4th day post op Monday: BM's more structured. Experienced soft erection during the night 3/10. Walking morning and afternoon. 5th day post op Tuesday: BM's solidified followed by blood in urine (cranberry colored) runs clear between BM's. This is common as per doc. Frame of mind very strong. Experienced moderate erection 6/10. Abdominal discomfort minimal and stomach swelling significantly reduced. Longer walks twice daily. 6th day post op Wednesday: continue feeling stronger. Solid BM's. Woke up with stronger erection. Presently 9th day post op (Saturday). Minimal stomach swelling, no Advil needed since 5th day post op. Continue to drink copious amounts of liquids: water, coconut water, decaf tea & coffee. Twice daily walks are longer in distance, pace and duration. My diet is simple as to not tax my digestive tract. Oatmeal, fruit, eggs, pasta, vegetables, salad, soup and a daily sweet or two. No meat. Sleep is restful. Urine is clear even after BM. The catheter is not an issue and I continue to be awakened out of my sleep with a welcomed feeling of bliss knowing that my cancer is gone and I can still function as a man for my loving wife of 33 years. I am scheduled to meet with Dr. Tewari on Monday 2/24 for the removal of the cathetar and pathology reports. Please feel free to ask anything. Hope this helps.",
