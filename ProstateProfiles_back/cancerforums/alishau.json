      "Content": "Hello. My father has asked me to post his info here so that we can find someone with a similar diagnosis to his. He has had a biopsy, a cat scan, and a bone scan. His Gleason score is 6...8...9 and deemed \"very aggressive\". He is 68 years old. We see an oncologist monday. At this point we have been told that it is all contained in the prostate. He is leaning towards radiation and not surgery. Any helpful info will be VERY much appreciated. This is all new to us as we have not had cancer in our family. We are in the Toledo, Ohio area.",

      "Content": "Another, my fathers dad lived until 93, at which time, he succumbed to complications from a broken hip. Also, the use of the word \"confined\" was my own loose description. After we received the results of the biopsy, bone scan, and cat scan, we were told that it doesn't look like it has spread beyond the prostate. Anxious to hear what the oncologist has to say. Thanks for your reply!",
