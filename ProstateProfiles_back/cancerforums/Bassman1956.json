      "Content": "I was diagnosed with prostate cancer in January 2012. Since I am relatively young to have had this disease, age 55, urologists suggested robotic surgery to remove my prostate; alternatively, I could \"watch and wait\" since the cancer had not advanced very far at that point. (Gleason score: 3 + 3 = 6) I understood that the surgery is almost 100% successful if caught early, as would be expected in my case. However, I did not want to have a prostatectomy unless the cancer spread to the point it would threaten my life. To me, surgery was a treatment of last resort. Instead, I spent the next several months researching alternative treatments to mainstream cancer therapies; this included juicing and preparing smoothies from fresh vegetables and fruits (organic when possible), exercising regularly, and stress reduction techniques through meditation. Of course, I had to cut out most of the junk food I had been eating. Several Netflix documentaries opened my eyes about the dangerous food we eat and how we are being poisoned by all kinds of chemicals in the environment. As time passed, I maintained the juicing/exercise/stress reduction program, even though I somewhat lost faith in this alternative approach as I spoke to others. Here's what some had to say: \u0095 A supportive friend and retired radiologist who warned that listening to anyone espousing such alternative treatment could actually cost me my life. \u0095 A fellow musician who had experienced the prostatectomy with no long-term problems said the natural approach did not work for him. \u0095 On a follow-up visit with my first urologist, I asked about curing the cancer through proper diet and nutrition. He said this approach will do nothing to cure cancer. (I found a new urologist after that.) \u0095 Even my health insurance advisor told me I have to be careful where I get my information as there are many who prey on victims desperate for miracle cures. On Nov. 29, 2012, I had a third biopsy, fully expecting this to be a prelude to having the DaVinci robotic surgery. To my surprise, the doctor telephoned me a few days later to inform me that the biopsy showed no cancer. No follow-up appointment necessary, just that terse statement. They were out of the picture now. My question: Is there undisputed scientific evidence out there somewhere that proves that you can conquer cancer through eating well, exercising and reducing stress, while eliminating sugar and other toxic chemicals from your body? My personal opinion is that there is, even though some treatments like the Gerson Therapy have been quashed by mainstream healthcare since there is no money to be made from patients who take control of their own health. Though anecdotal evidence abounds, I personally know of only one other person who claims to have been cured of cancer through eating fresh vegetables and fruits and avoiding toxic chemicals in the environment. Anyone out there had a similar experience? Can anyone point me to credible evidence that proves diet and exercise can cure cancer? If this is the case, I would like to be an inspiration to others. Thank you.",
