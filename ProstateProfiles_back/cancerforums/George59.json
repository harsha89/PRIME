    "Content": "Hi all, Dr. Tewari performed my surgery about a week before yours. The day after dischsrge I was walking up 70th Ave and admiring the young ladies. I was walking slowly. Two days after the cath was removed I woke up with a usable erection. Continence is not where I want it to be but I get by on one pad per day. Dry at night. I do not ejaculate urine. My Gleason was upgraded from 6 to 7 (3+4) and one positive margin. Take care,",
