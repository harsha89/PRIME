      "Content": "My dad is diagnosed with Gleason (3+5) yesterday. My parents currently live in China with my sister in a provincial capital city. I live in the SF bay area. My parents visited me numerous times in the last few years. We are in total shock and trying to cope with the news. My dad is 66 years old with good health. His tPSA is over 100. His fPSA is 16.86. His bone scan came back negative. He will have CT scan for lymph nodes in the next few days. Prostate cancer is not very common in China. The number of operations performed in the province where my parent live is relatively small. I plan to have my dad's prostate biopsy specimens sent to Dr. Jonathan Epstein in JHU or other labs for reexamination. Is there anyone familiar with international shipping of prostate biopsy specimens? Surgery, Radiotherapy, Hormone therapy, what should we do? My sister is contacting doctors in Beijing that have more experiences with prostate cancer. I want to take my dad to a hospital with prostate cancer expertise in the SF bay area. Can anyone recommend some good hospitals and doctors? My dad has no medical insurance in the U.S.. Does anyone know the cost of the treatments in the U.S. without medical insurance? Your helps are greatly appreciated. Thanks, Tim",

The current approach prescribed by my dad's Dr. is HT for three months and then decide between surgery and HT. We consulted another Doctor, which is also one of best experts in PC at my home province, and he wants to perform surgery now. His reason is because PC is still confined (negative bone scan), we should act now. My sister is going to Beijing to consult several experts next week.
