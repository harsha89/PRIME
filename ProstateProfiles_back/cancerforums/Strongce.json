    "Content": "I'm 14 months post surgery (June 04, 2013) and back to normal workouts lifting and running without leaks. However, I can't hug my wife without leaking on contact. Diagnosed 3+4, tumor in 2 of 12 cores. Fortunately back to 80% sexual capability but have this annoying urine leak with every squeeze of the wife. Anyone figured out how to get past this?",
