    "Content": "My grandfather died some weeks ago. He had bone metastasis and struggled for 2 years with the cancer, that came back 7 years after an apparently successful prostatectomy. Among the drugs he had home I found Zytiga 120 abiraterone acetate 250 mg tablet and Lupron depot-3 Month 22.5 mg. This drugs are quite expensive what should I do with them? Is there any possibility of getting back some of the money spent on this drugs?",
