I think the plan is to line up multiple specialists, and I would greatly appreciate the input of anyone who has been to CC. I think we'd like to meet with: 1) urological oncologist 2) surgeon 3) focal therapy specialist 4) sex medicine specialist We also have an appointment at the local proton therapy center next week for a consultation, and are considering a consult with another highly recommended radiation oncologist. Any advice/input would be greatly appreciated!",

      "Content": "Not good. 5 positive cores, 4 Gleason 6 (3+3) and 1 Gleason 7 (3+4), all on the right side. I'll add the detail to the signature later. While driving home I was able to book an appointment at Cleveland Clinic on May 10th with Dr. Berglund. Will be having everything, including pathology slides sent to Cleveland tomorrow when Virginia Urology opens. I'm also going to book an appointment with a well regarded local radiation oncologist, and at the Proton therapy center in Hampton, which is about 45 minutes away from us to cover all our options. I'm FURIOUS that there was a 9 month delay to biopsy after the MRI. The MRI wasn't a false negative, it wasn't interpreted by their radiologist - they simply accepted the interpretation of a hospitalist radiologist in a 43 year old man with a PSA density of .5. While I know it doesn't make a difference in how advanced the cancer is, it makes the treatment timing very difficult given our personal circumstances. However I'm grateful that his PCP did a PSA test at 42, because if he had waited till 50, this could be catastrophic. I'm also so thankful that my job provides EXCELLENT health insurance that includes CC in-network AND would cover Proton therapy.",

      "Content": "Wife posting, Cognitive fusion biopsy done today with general anesthesia, will get results next week. Stats: Age 42-43 over course of timeline below: 2/2018 - routine physical popped up a PSA of 15 3/2018 - PSA 13 4/2018 - PSA down to 11.6! 1st % free PSA done, 18% -prescribed antibiotics for suspected prostititis, I asked for PHI, 4kscore, or other advanced blood urine test - was denied. 6/2018 - PSA 10, free PSA 20% more antibiotics 7/2018 - mp- MRI done, prostate volume =22cc, report said signs of inflammation consistent with prostititis, no lesions or areas of interest. 11/2018 - PSA back up to 14, free PSA down to 11%, Urologist recommends TRUS biopsy - took weeks to get an appointment to discuss 1/2019 - I asked for PHI or other advanced blood/urine testing, since the MRI was clear. He offered to have their internal radiologist re-read the MRI and \"look into\" if they could do the PHI test. 3/2019 - PSA 12, free PSA 17%, were told that the urology specialist radiologist re-read MRI and found a PI RADs 3 lesion - so we scheduled cognitive fusion biopsy immediately. All DREs have been negative, and at 22cc, it seems his prostate is quite small for any type of BPH issue. Zero urinary or sexual symptoms, he occasionally reports a sensation of \"pressure\" in the region though and has a history of lower back pain. I'm frustrated that over 6 months went by between the MRI and a reading by their internal radiologist, and that they have consistently denied requests for anything beyond PSA & % free PSA tests. And that the MRI was read with a PI RADs 3 in January and we weren't given the results until the end of March. I know that prostate cancer is typically slow growing, but because of his age I feel they should have had a greater sense of urgency. Not to mention this has been hanging over our heads for over a year! Nothing to do now but keep our fingers crossed for the biopsy results I guess.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by ASAdvocate AceVA, I\u0092m not going to give advice, given the 30+ year age difference. But, I agree with your direction of consulting with different specialists. It is extremely important to select the best primary treatment , and not allow one specialist to describe a different treatment. BTW, where in VA are you? I am in Alexandria, and within driving distance to Johns Hopkins in Baltimore. We're in the Richmond/Williamsburg area - Hopkins was an option, but our PCP said he prefers Cleveland, so that's where we're headed first.",
