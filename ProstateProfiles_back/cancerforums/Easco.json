      "Content": "This is my first post and like most others, I have a lot of questions about being newly diagnosed with Prostate Cancer Stage2. I had a biopsy done two weeks ago and was called in for the results. My doctor has me scheduled for a CT Scan and bone scan on December 30 to ensure the cancer has not metastasized. My questions is this, how could he diagnose me with stage 2 if he has not yet ruled out the spread of cancer to other areas? My PSA is 8.7. Out of 12 biopsies 7 came back positive. My Gleason scores were 7's 8's and one 9. Previous PSA around one year ago was 4.6.",

      "Content": "Thank you for the explanation. It makes more sense now. Yes, I have a bone and CT scan scheduled for December 30th with a follow up appointment with the urologist on January 8th. The waiting is the most difficult. Originally Posted by Pratoman EaScott, staging from. Biopsy is called clinical staging, vs staging after all tests and surgery if you have it, which is more definitive and called pathological staging. I assume he is ordering bone and CT scans? Which would be standard. Probably will show nothing, in which caseyoeuatage would remain T1, and I assume that's based on negative DRE, In other words, nothing felt on the digital rectal exam. If they find a spread outside the area, it old be upgraded (if that's the right word) to Stage t2a, assuming no lymph node involvement. You should request that your slides from BIopsy be sent to another lab that specializes in PC. Either Dr JOn Epatein at Johns Hopkins or David Bostwick at Bostwick laboratories. Also, that G8 (3+5) is unusual. I had one core labeled that way and it was downgraded to g6(3+3) by Epstein at Johns Hopkins Second opinion is almost a must, and it's easy, your Urologist gets these requests all the time, just tell them where you want it sent. If you say Epstein r Bostwick, that's all they will need, they have the information. Start doing your own research, the docs will usually oush their specialty, surgeons red SURGER Radiation Oncologists rec radiation. Your age might lean you towards surgery though, I think , not sure, that 70 is sort of borderline for SURGER. Others might know better than I. Sorry you need to be here dealing with this, but stick around and ask a lot of questions,you will learn plenty. Good luck",

      "Content": "Hi HighlanderCFH, Thank you for you assistance. I have a copy of the pathology report and it says nothing about staging. The urologist told me it was Stage 2 and gave me a lot of paperwork to read about it. Do you understand the CaPStage Risk Assessment? Mine shows 96.6% above average with the baseline being 8.8%? The node involvement: 998.1% increased risk? I don't understand what any of this means. Originally Posted by HighlanderCFH Hi Easco, Welcome to the forum. I moved your post (and Pratoman's reply) and created its very own thread so you can get more attention. The biopsy report (clinical report, as prato says) is based on what the pathologist thinks of the cores s/he examines and then estimates the staging from there. It is important to realize that a biopsy report is ONLY a guess. They can be wrong in about 20% of the cases. The abdominal CT and bone scans will help give a clearer picture on what the actual staging is. Was it the urologist who told you it is stage 2 -- or was it on the pathologist's report? Good luck with those scans. Hopefully they will further suggest you are only stage 2 and you can then hope for curative treatment. Good luck! Chuck",

      "Content": "This is my first post and like most others, I have a lot of questions about being newly diagnosed with Stage 2 Prostate Cancer. My questions is this, how could he diagnose me with stage 2 if he has not yet ruled out the spread of cancer to other areas? My PSA is 8.7. Out of 12 biopsies 7 came back positive. My Gleason scores were Left Lateral 3 + 5 76%, Left Base 4 + 4 10%, Left Lateral Mid 4 + 3 90%, Left Lateral Apex 4 + 3 44%, Left Mid 4 + 3 40%, Right Lateral Mid 3 + 4 40%. All six of the left biopsies were malignant, only one of the six on the right side was malignant. Previous PSA around one year ago was 4.6. CaStage Risk Assessment Above average 96.6% and the Relative Risk 998.1% increased risk.",
