      "Content": "My husband Frank had a prostatectomy last summer. He also completed 38 radiation treatments on April 3 without side effects. Two weeks later, he began experiencing a burning pain in the left side of his groin. It is intermittent but has become more severe and it's happening more often. We finally reached his RO who said she would confer with his surgeon and call back. Yesterday we received a call from her office saying the surgeon wants to see Frank. Has anyone else experienced anything like this and can you shed some light on the subject? Thank you in advance from both of us.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by HighlanderCFH Hello Ann, Welcome to the forum. Hang in there and let's see if some comments come in over the next few days from someone with a similar situation. As the others have said, this does sound unusual. Any side effects from radiation usually happen a year or longer after the treatment, although this case could be different since your husband's radiation was a follow-up from surgery instead of the primary treatment. The hernia idea suggested by one of the others sounds like it could be a possible answer. Please let us know what the doctor says. Good luck! Chuck Will keep you posted as to the latest in the Diary of Ann and Frank",
