      "Content": "My name is Hollie and my husband (45) was diagnosed with prostate cancer on 1/14/14. He has no signs or symptoms of the cancer. They started him on hormone therapy and after 6 weeks his psa fell to 139 and then after another 6 weeks it is down to 39. I am very glad to see the numbers drop but does this mean they will go back up faster as well and the cells become resistant? I have so many questions just not sure where to start??",

      "Content": "Thank you all for responding, as far as other stats there are no other psa test. Due to his age they never tested no family history. He pulled a muscle in the back and went to hospital for xray and that's when they noticed the bones did not look right. they did a ct scan and told us he had stage 4 cancer but not what kind. There were many lymph nodes involed and lesion they could not identify, we were sent for a biopsy of the closest node in the middle of the back. They did the biopsy of only the node. when the test came back and it was prostate cells they sent us to urology, when he saw the numbers so high he said there was no need to do biopsy on the prostate that we just need to treat. We started bicludimide and one week later started the hormone injection in the stomach that lasts 6 months. injury to the back was just a pulled muscle thank goodness. I have read a lot about gleason scores and there is none for him. Our doctor told us how serious it is in him but he did say he's not having get your affairs in order just yet. I feel like there is so much that should be done but then its just a waiting game. We had the bone density test done they thought about starting xgiva but his score came back at a 2.6 and they decided to wait. I feel that is a good thing since bone regenerates every six weeks. Insurance will not pay for a pet scan unless we do a lung biopsy (makes no sense) so we did the full bone scan and it revealed cancer in the skull, jaw, shoulders, hips and spine. Brain scan showed none in the marrow or the brain. so blessed for that. Still my husband in in great spririts has missed no work and still has no symptoms. You look at him and think is this man really sick.",
