      "Content": "Hi, my husband who was 44 last year when diagnosed with PC. He has PSA of 170 and Gleason grade 9, T stage 3-4. It is in his breast bone ( which he has had radiation therapy) also in his lower spine, currently he is onto his 3rd chemo treatment. The chemo has helped with the bone pain but his PSA ( which originally wend down to 2 after his first drug casodex was given) is now back to 160. Things look pretty bleak at the moment and I/we don't know if we really should ask the doctor what the long term prognosis is.Any one got any suggestions as to what we should do?? I would really appreciate any input.",
