      "Content": "Mark, I sure hope they do return...I had cryogenic surgery on June 14 and, so far, am not able to achieve a successful erection ( I just started taking the daily Cialis and I use a vacuum pump 1-2x a week, so maybe that will help turn to the green lights on again ). My interest and desire are still very much intact but the message is just not filtering down to the erection machinery! I see very few posts from men who have had the cryogenic surgery so there's not much info on what to be expecting in the way of a full recovery.",

      "Content": "newporter, my uro/surgeon's surgery nurse told me that one of the needles used for the freezing process is a \"warming needle\" that is exactly placed by ultrasound in a position to protect the nerves from the total 46 below zero effect that is used to kill the prostate and all of the contained cancer cells. The nerves are affected, of course, but the \"warming\" keeps them from being absolutely killed....they have a chance to regenerate. My biopsy and bone scan showed the cancer to be complely contained within the prostate. PSA prior to surgery was 2.2, today...7 weeks after surgery, it is 0.002.Was totally continent within 12 weeks but ED is still a lousy side effect but I'm hoping/praying that it will get back to normal.By the way I am 77.",
