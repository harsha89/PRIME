    "Content": "Facts: I have prostate cancer, four cores tested Gleason 6, 7, 9 and 9. One 9 showed 50%, the other 80%. My treatment so far has been radiation treatments, completed 40 of them. I have had two Lupron shots, one in September and another in December. I am presently due for my third shot. The side effects have been bad. My T level is 23.6 and my PSA is .1 or as the medonc says it is undetectable. I understand there is no certainty that Lupron is needed if cancer has not been detected outside the prostate. My question is what has been the experience of others with this decision. I would like to stop taking the shots, I have a week to decide.",
