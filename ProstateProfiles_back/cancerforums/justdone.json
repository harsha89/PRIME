      "Content": "Originally Posted by justdone I had a Da Vinci arm prostatectomy last Friday. Yesterday I got my catheter out and other than my stream being small and slow I haven't had any problems. My doctor never mentioned this as something I needed to watch for. Is this the norm or do I have a problem? I was diagnosed with prostate cancer. I was a 4+3 7 Gleason score. 8 of my 12 tissue samples were 97% saturated and were 4+3 the rest were 30 to 50% saturated with 3+4. My doctor took a pretty wide swath of tissue around the prostate there were no complications. I am sure there is a fair amount of inflammation from the catheter because it still burns like crazy when I pee. Guess I'll wait until Monday and if my stream isn't better I will give my Dr. a call.",
