      "Content": "Thanks for all the pre and post-surgery tips. My husband\u0092s surgery went well and they found no evidence of disease outside the prostate. He had the catheter removed 7/5. The next day, he started running fevers (101) and feeling generally unwell. I spoke with the Urology resident on call, who encouraged us to come in to the ER (of course it was the evening). Husband declined. Fevers continued the next day so I called again and we went in and spent 8 delightful hours in the ER. The bloodwork looked pretty normal; slightly elevated wbc but nothing krazy. Urine test didn\u0092t show bacteria. Abdominal ct scan didn\u0092t show fluid/abscess. So eventually we were discharged. 24 hours later and he\u0092s still running fevers and now having to pee every 20-30 minutes. Has anyone else experienced this? Thoughts, recs, etc? FWIW he was inconsistent with the Miralax in the beginning and is now more backed up than the NJ Turnpike.",

Nothing yet today fever-wise as far as I know. I encouraged h to call he surgeon directly and follow-up with him. I do think he has made progress on the bowel front.",
