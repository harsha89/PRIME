      "Content": "Thanks all for the replies! A few more details from my story. I am 60, married, and live in NW PA. Early in 2016, my family doctor suggested that I see a urologist. I was peeing a lot and had a slightly enlarged prostate. My PSA in 2015 was 3.7. The urologist I was referred to did my PSA for 2016 and it was 4.3. She strongly suggested that I have a biopsy done, since the # was over 4. Obviously, I'm very glad that I took her advice! I was advised of multiple treatment options by the initial urologist and also Dr. Danella in Danville. It was a pretty easy decision for us. We wanted to get the cancer the hell out of there! I think we both would have gone crazy just knowing it was there. We had to wait 6 weeks from the initial consultation with Dr. Danella until the surgery in December. That was probably the worst part of the entire experience, the waiting. Since the surgery, it's pretty much been a blur. We remain positive and hopeful that all goes well! Mike",

      "Content": "This is my first post, but I've been reading this forum for a while since my diagnosis. First of all, thank you to all who have posted about their experiences. I have found all the posts to be tremendously helpful! I was diagnosed in October with 3 cores from my biopsy showing cancer. Gleason of 7 for each. My choice for treatment was surgery (DaVinci robotic). Surgery was performed on Dec. 21 at Geisinger Medical Center in Danville Pa by Dr. Danella. The entire process has been better than I had anticipated. The only pain from the surgery was abdominal when I would move around in bed or try to get out of bed. I only took tylenol for pain when in the hospital and continued with that after discharge. The abdominal pain went away in about a week. The catheter was not a problem, just kind of a nuisance. I had no bladder spasms or other discomfort. It was removed 8 days after surgery with no problems. Bladder control has been pretty good. I have been using pads, but don't need them at night. I also try to go without at times during the day. When taking our daily walks, I use them. That seems to be the worst time for leaks. Overall, I'm very pleased with the way things are going! The doctors were pleased with the surgery. I go for follow up on Feb 7, so hoping for the best with that. The nerves were spared and I do have a decent erectile function. So far, so good! I'm scheduled to go back to work on Jan 23. I was hoping for the best and preparing for the worst when this whole thing started. It has been quite a journey so far and hopefully things will continue to be positive! Mike",

Life is good! Having a very supportive wife has been a godsend. I had my first PSA test post-op this week. My results came back today at .01. What a relief! This forum was a huge help after my diagnosis and my thanks go out to all who share their stories here. Here's hoping the news continues to be positive. My best wishes to all those who are struggling with this disease. Since my diagnosis, I have met many others who are going through this. Sharing is great therapy. Thank you all and God Bless!",
