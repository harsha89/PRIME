      "Content": "chuck- thanks for the reply- it was real helpful and encouraging!! no, very little trouble urinating- urgency is a problem sometimes but not too often- up atleast once at night. Sounds like your surgery was quiye suc. and you are on the mend in functions- that's great that u r continiet- that's one of my biggest concerns with either surgery or radiation. Having to decide which to do myself is the hardest thing about this -rather than having a MD tell me - here's the best outcome and this is how we're going to handle it. Your stats look great. My 4 / 12 core positive samples were in the left mid and left apex with 13%/25%/15%/25% respectively, don't know if that's good or bad. Since I have to get something done, I've pushed up another appoint with Urlog. this next week and will be seeing the radiology oncologist the following week before deciding on treatment. I will let you know when decision time is about to come joe",

      "Content": "thanks for insight on gleason- My MD said gleason of 7 but report did not- just gleason 6 My thinking on surgery vs radiation is the same as yours- however, you were age 55 when first diagnosed- and I'n now almost 69- allthough in real good health. Thats's what I'm going to discuss with my urologisst next week- then will see the radiaolgist the following week befiore deciding. I'll let you know outdomes/decision With your \"failure\", what's the course of treatment and how is it going?? joe",

      "Content": "Diagnosed with T1a prostate tumor 1 year ago. Biopsy was 2 out of 12 cores positive, with gleason of 6 , T1a tumor and PSA of 6. Chose active surv. as treatment with PSA and digital exam every 3 months. Psa kept declining last year. Had another biiopsy in Nov.'12 and there was an increase in the cancer and it was upgraded to T1c - 4 of 12 cores were positive with 2 being a gleason of 6 and 2 a gleason of 7 , with a pathology report saying the gleason was 6- Is that possible with 2 of them 6 and 2 of them 7?. Psa had climbed to 5.9, still under 6. Anyway, active surv. is off the table and I need to decide on treatment. Really having a tough time with deciding. Am in excellent health, but will be turming 69 this month. Never been in the hospital except for several colonoscopies. Have narrowed choice to either removing my prostate or having the seeding. My only hesitation is the serious complications that come with removal. Anyone out there who has my general profile - age about 69 , in good health with the stage of prostate cancer i have , going thu the same deliberations ?? or has gone thru them and what did you decide and why?? I'm really obsessing over it and need to decide and get it done. joe in Delaware",

      "Content": "Fairwind- just happened to re-read your first reply to my first post and realized that your onset of cancer was about at the same age as mine - 68 years. did your phys. give you choice of either treatment optiions and you didn't have any qualms about surgery at age 68?? joe",
