    "Content": "Follow up for cyberknife is certainly shorter than for IMRT. 5 year data does exist that shows 5 year PSA control of 93% and no grade 3 rectal toxicity. Cyberknife has a great convenience factor since it is only 5 treatments. A major technical advantage of cyberknife consists of the monitoring of prostate movement during radiation. This is not done with proton beam or most IMRT. In addition, all radiation biologists agree that the growth kinetics of prostate cancer favor fewer treatment with larger doses per fraction.",
