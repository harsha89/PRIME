Points of interest: No narcotics since Monday night for pain just Tylenol The most challenging part for me is the catheter: I recommend the leg bag makes it easier, however it is difficult to empty so my wife does it. (Taking a poop with a catheter is a challenge I am worried because when I sit down on the toilet I get residual urine leaking and blood seepage around the catheter and I don't want to do damage. No success pooping yet, any advice would be great.) Walking around is easy. I am still a little bloated in the belly, and my urine is slightly rose colored.",

      "Content": "Progressing good Only Tylenol for pain - my pain can be described as to many situps pain also my perinium area is a bit achy and the trochar site that had the JP drain is sore. How long did it take for all of your JP drain sites to heal up and stop oozing? I am getting a dime sized spot of blood / serous sanguinous discharge. Activity level is good except for carrying the urine bag around and explaining to all the neighbors whatÂ\u0092s going on. ItÂ\u0092s interesting because every wife is challenging there husband for the result of there last PSA test or if theyÂ\u0092ve been tested. I can feel the urinary urethra/sphincter in my bladder contracting around the catheter doc said that is good everything is waking up. Also never realized how great a hot shower is. Catheter out this Thursday. Also did an on-site hospital Q/A last night for some guys in the treatment pipeline over 20 guys with their wives and kids showed up. DidnÂ\u0092t realize how big our community is. I must have answered a 100 questions and also recommended this site. More to come.",
