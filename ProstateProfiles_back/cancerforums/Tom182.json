      "Content": "Hi, My first two post op psa tests came back under <0.01. At nine months my results were <0.024. I asked my doctor if I should be concerned and was told the results have been fluctuating from the lab (Labcorp) I've been using. Also, that anything under .1 is undetectable so I shouldn't be concerned. So he wanted me to take another psa test in a month. I just got the results today: <0.039. I haven't discussed the test result with my doctor yet but this seems like a big jump in just over a month. I remember the guideline for the regular psa test was to refrain from sexual activity 48 hours prior and not to take any supplements (I take a lot) a week prior to the test. Does this same guideline apply to the ultra sensitive test? I have my next psa test in under two months and will be having my one year follow up visit with my doctor. I'm hoping the results will be better.",

      "Content": "What are your doctors recommending at this point based on your positive margins? He didn't seem too concerned over my margins being positive. He told me that it would increase my chance for recurrence by about 2%. Which I found odd because everything I read about positive margins indicate otherwise. I too monitor my PSA at LabCorp using the Roche ECLIA ultrasensitive PSA Methodology. BTW, my results are reported simply as a number (e.g. 0.021 ng/ml) and the \"<\" symbol has never preceded the value. This suggests that possibly your uPSAs are being measured via a different assay at LabCorp As far as I know I have been using the same assay since my first test. The numbers on my results are reported in the same manner as yours. That was just a mistake on my part. Sorry for the confusion. I spoke with my doctor's office today about the rising psa level. They told me that fluctuating numbers are normal but like Mike said a third consecutive rise is cause for concern. They also recommended I take a genome test to predict the probability of a recurrence. Based on the results of this test and if my psa continues to rise they could recommend radiation treatment sooner. So I will have the genome test done and another psa test in 8 weeks. At which time I will have my yearly follow up visit with my doctor and we'll see where we stand. Hopefully, the numbers will be in my favor.",

      "Content": "Hi, I'm new to the forums. I was diagnosed with PC on December 10th 2015. It came as a bit of shock due to my age. My father was diagnosed with PC when he was 72 and had a radical prostatectomy. He just turned 85 last year and hasn't had any reoccurrences but suffers from other health issues. He lives in a different state and I'm reluctant to tell him about my diagnosis because it would only upset him.

The Prolaris test results did not come back when I visited with him to go over the results, yet he told me active surveillance is off the table due to a nodule that was found in the written report. I'm currently considering my treatment options. A process that is both mentally and emotionally draining which most here has gone through or is going through. Cyberknife sounded good at first but if salvage therapy is needed later then a radical prostectomy is probably off the table as an option. The robotic radical prostectomy is the standard treatment in my case but I'm apprehensive due to it's invasiveness. The only other option I can see is HIFU therapy(which just got approved in this country) but the cost is high and most insurance companies won't cover it. My doctor wants me to decide what form of treatment I want to pursue by January 15th when I go back to see him. I don't like being rushed into making a decision of this magnitude and was wondering if I told him I still haven't decided would he just drop me as a patient? He initially specialized in laparoscopic/robotic surgery but has only performed around 300 of these surgeries. I've read two of the most important factors in choosing a surgeon is the number of procedures performed and weather he or she initially specialized in laparoscopic/robotic surgery. I was also wondering if I can get a recommendation for a RP surgeon. I live in the Philadelphia area and have an appointment to see Dr. David Lee from the University of Pennsylvania-Penn Presbyterian hospital on Thursday. From what I've researched he is the top guy in the area for this procedure. I know logistics shouldn't be a factor in determining a surgeon. I did want to know when you have to travel about how soon after the initial consultation can the surgery be performed? How long was your stay before you could return home and does the doctor's office help you with accommodations? If someone could walk me through the experience I would appreciate it. Thanks.",

From what I've researched he is the top guy in the area for this procedure. I know logistics shouldn't be a factor in determining a surgeon. I did want to know when you have to travel about how soon after the initial consultation can the surgery be performed? How long was your stay before you could return home and does the doctor's office help you with accommodations? If someone could walk me through the experience I would appreciate it. Thanks.",

      "Content": "Well, It's not good news. My lastest psa test came back at 0.081. The two previous results were 0.024 and 0.039. So there's a clear doubling trend every two months. I went over the results with my urologist and he recommended salvage radiation in the near future. He thought I should wait till my psa hits .3 or .4 to give my body more time to heal since it's only been a little over a year from my surgery. I've read you get better results if you have the treatment at .2 or below; so I'm not sure I should wait that long and I'm guessing the radiation oncologist would want to start immediatly. If anyone could recommend a radition oncologist or cancer center in the Philadelphia area and what questions I should ask during the consultation I would appreciate it. Also, any other advice or suggestions you could offer would be most welcomed. Thanks.",
