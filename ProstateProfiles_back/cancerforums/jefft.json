      "Content": "Originally Posted by Jim215 jefft: Thank you for sharing that wonderful news. It will go a long way toward helping others who find themselves in similar circumstances. I agree that the DaVinci machine has brought this disease to a level where it allows patients to experience the modern advances of science without the fear of so many who don't want to undergo the rigors of open surgery. Even more remarkable (at least to me) are the benefits rendered by the PSA test. The PSA led me to surgery. The PSA found the cancer when it returned and allowed me to proceed with salvage radiation. So, it may have saved my life twice. Whenever I'm in the company of guys over 50 who are friends or relatives, I beseech them to get annual PSA tests. Some never heard of the PSA and that's unfortunate because this is a disease that is almost always curable with early treatment. And the people on that government panel who want to save money and eliminate the PSA because it \"may\" lead to unnecessary treatment and unwanted side effects can go pound sand up their kazoo. They claim that only one life is saved for each PSA test, which I think is a horrible underestimate. What they fail to mention - even if you accept their numbers - is that for every one million PSA tests, a thousand lives are saved. If ANY test can save a thousand lives, that's a good thing, right? Again, congrats. Jim Yeah Jim...anything the gov can do to cut costs...especially medical costs..they will do. Look where medical science related to prostrate cancer has come in the last 10 years...it saved my life...period. In ten more years it will be saving thousands of lives ... The naysayers are motivated by mis-information and personal agendas. Lets hope the medical community can prove PSA scores are essential to prostrate health and do save lives. We are here to attest to it. Jeff",

You will get a lot more attention in here. Yes, your T1 Gleason 6 diagnosis does refer to a curable case of PC. Since you are thinking about surgery, the trick is to be sure that the surgeon is top notch. Whether it is open or da Vinci, you'll want to make sure that the doctor has performed a minimum of 300 of them. There is a long learning curve involved. If your doctor is highly competent, incontinence should NOT be an issue for you after recovery is complete. Without reading yourself into another frenzy, you might still consider the 3rd edition of the \"Guide to Surviving Prostate Cancer,\" by Dr Pat Walsh. Huge amounts of info there. Wishing you the best! Chuck so how do i go about finding out from non-bias medical professionals who is the best??",

Can hold it...feel it coming on..and nothing feels better than peeing after catheter out. Havent yet tested the \"minutes from a toilet and major pee coming on\" situation yet. Read mostly incontinent situations here in the forums... any of you have good continence right off the bat. Now what am I going to do with a box of 40 Depends from Costco? lol. I am blessed I guess. Now if I can achieve wood at some time down the road I'll have the trifecta ... clean path, continence and wood. I'll certainly take two out of three at this point. Keep your chin up prostrate bros.
