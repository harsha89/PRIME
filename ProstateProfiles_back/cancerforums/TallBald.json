I felt 'violated' and literally wanted to punch the MD after it was done.. with that said, the biopsy did confirm my cancer and ultimately saved my life. Gotta keep things in perspective. Never again! That is pretty much what I said when I was done. If I don't have cancer this time, I 100% guarantee I will have it next time! I can't imagine those folks who go through the process multiple times. Did you get the biopsy results yet?",
