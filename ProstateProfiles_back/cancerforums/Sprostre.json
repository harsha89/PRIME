      "Content": "My story. Now age 47. Repeated bouts of lower abdomen pain. One very bad bout in 2013 accompanied with blood in urine and semen. Referred to a urologist who did a PSA = 2.9. Said that was high for my age and proceeded to an 3T MRI. MRI was read as equivocal with a large abnormal area. Could be prostatitis or cancer. Offered a biopsy or serial PSA measurement and follow-up MRI. Chose the latter. Pain resolved and PSA dropped to <1.5. Follow up MRI at 1 year showed no changes. Same large area that was now felt to most likely represent prostatitis sequelae. 3 month PSA follow ups discontinued and frankly I thought we were done. However at the 2 year follow up mark he requested another MRI. This one still showed the old area, but also a new area that was suspicious for cancer. PSA=1.2 (6/15) Doc suggested biopsy. The old pain started up again. Saw a second opinion who agreed a biopsy was the best course forward. He wants to do a targeted fusion biopsy and to do so needed compatible set of MRI data. So back into the tube, both to get a multiparametric view of the prostate and a wider pelvic view to try and identify what he felt was a hernia causing the pain. The Pelvic MRI came back negative for anything possibly causing the pain. The Prostate MRI showed the same findings as the one the previous month. PSA=1.1 (7/15) So, based on the MRI results I am scheduled for a biopsy 10/5. I am diabetic and have a heart condition and am already experiencing a good bit of groin and testicular pain, so I am a bit worried about it. I guess this is the right thing to do?",

      "Content": "Thanks, With so many variables it is difficult to come up with a maximal plan. With my other health problems, despite my age, it is unlikely I'd live another 10 years anyway. Therefore, it is not clear whether it is worth the risks of biopsy to confirm what the first urologist thinks is clearly cancer shown on the MRI. No mater the finding, the \"right\" answer may be to do nothing. I currently have no incontinence nor ED issues and adding those to the list of other problems for a small if any benefit makes the choices difficult. As for the questions. Prostate size in 2013 was measured as 5x3.8x4.2cm which if my math is right equals 42ml. It measured the same in 2014. It was estimated at 40ml in June 2015 Then at the new center in Sept 2015 it was measured by MRI as 5.2 x 4.7 x 4.0 cm corresponding to an volume of approximately 50 cc. Based on my research I asked for a free PSA to be included in a few of my tests. During recovery from the first \"prostatitis\" (1/13) PSA: 2.4, %free 16.7 Recent test (6/15) PSA: 1.3, %free 26.2 I have not had a PCA3 test as the doc said it would not change their opinion on the need for a biopsy given the MRI results. From what I read....EVERYONE qualifies for the club if they live long enough.",
