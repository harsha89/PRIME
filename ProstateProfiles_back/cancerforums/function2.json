I used a (very) clean fingertip to apply. Just keep everything VERY clean and get through it. Those were some of the most horrible ten days of my life.

I also have some very minor bowel problems (smaller, looser, more often) from the radiation.

I was unconscious before reaching the operating room, so I didn't get to meet my machine.

So now its pain control (hydrocodone) and getting used to this annoying catheter and bag (comes out on May 26, next Thursday). I'm eating okay but haven't had a BM yet; I hope that happens today, I think I'll be more comfortable. Anyone get referred shoulder pain? Maybe from gas/pressure; it can be as bad as the incision sites. I'll post my progress in this thread as I recover. Thanks again guys, now we wait and see if they got it all. Fingers crossed.

      "Content": "Had my DaVinci on Monday, came home yesterday. I was much more confident thanks to all of you. My first post was \"post-op questions\". So I had my surgery done at Santa Monica UCLA. Dr. Chamie is my Urologist and Dr. Wong did anaethesia. He had to take a little extra urethra because it looked suspicious for cancer outside the prostate, but he did save my sphincter. Also took a bunch of lymph nodes. I was unconscious before reaching the operating room, so I didn't get to meet my machine. Spent one night in the hospital (ZERO sleep thanks to some nurse or whoever coming in every 30 minutes), and was discharged yesterday. Six incision sites. So now its pain control (hydrocodone) and getting used to this annoying catheter and bag (comes out on May 26, next Thursday). I'm eating okay but haven't had a BM yet; I hope that happens today, I think I'll be more comfortable. Anyone get referred shoulder pain? Maybe from gas/pressure; it can be as bad as the incision sites. I'll post my progress in this thread as I recover. Thanks again guys, now we wait and see if they got it all. Fingers crossed. I need to know which brand of diaper is best, what did you all use? Is Tenna good? I have a coupon, lol.",

Surgery didn't get all of it (RALP, PSA rising after surgery) Radiation didn't get all of it (40 treatments + Lupron) Last 3-month tests were .03 .15 .57 2.7 So now we are doing a PSMA scan, which is new and very sensitive, and may be able to locate remaining cancer. There are only a few of these machines in the country, and insurance doesn't cover it. Worth it I think to buy the best scan I can get. Possible surgery (lymph node, for example) or radiation (if it's on a bone) if found. Otherwise, more waiting and scanning. So, that's where I'm at. All with a disease I've never felt a single symptom from. This adventure continues!",

My Uro said exactly what you did; that location is important now (and why I'm getting the more sensitive scan). He had one case where the remaining cancer was sitting on a single lymph node, which he took out. That patient has a consistent low PSA now. I'm focused on that scenario!",

      "Content": "Hi all, It's always been a safe zone to come here and report in. (especially when I first found out). Surgery didn't get all of it (RALP, PSA rising after surgery) Radiation didn't get all of it (40 treatments + Lupron) Last 3-month tests were .03 .15 .57 2.7 So now we are doing a PSMA scan, which is new and very sensitive, and may be able to locate remaining cancer. There are only a few of these machines in the country, and insurance doesn't cover it. Worth it I think to buy the best scan I can get. Possible surgery (lymph node, for example) or radiation (if it's on a bone) if found. Otherwise, more waiting and scanning. So, that's where I'm at. All with a disease I've never felt a single symptom from. This adventure continues!",
