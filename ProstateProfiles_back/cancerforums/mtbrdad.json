      "Content": "Hello everyone, first post here as I find my way along this path. Here are the details: At the age of 54 on 5/15/17 I had a PSA test done and it rang in at 5.1. I'm in the western suburbs of Chicago and my previous history of the PSA from memory was that in about 2009 it was about .8 and rising up to about 2.3 in 2013 or 14, from there no tests were done until just recently. A biopsy was scheduled on 6/10/2017 and the results of that were: A. Prostate, right base; biopsy: Benign prostatic glands and stroma, no malignancy identified. B. Prostate, right mid; biopsy: Benign prostatic glands and stroma, no malignancy identified. C. Prostate, right apex; biopsy: Benign prostatic glands and stroma, no malignancy identified. D. Prostate, right lateral base; biopsy: Prostatic adenocarcinoma, Gleason score 3+3=6 (Grade Group 1), involving one out of one core and approximately of 8% of entire specimen. No perineural invasion identified. E. Prostate, right lateral mid; biopsy: Benign prostatic glands and stroma, no malignancy identified. F. Prostate, right transitional zone; biopsy: Benign prostatic glands and stroma, no malignancy identified. G. Prostate, left base; biopsy: Prostatic adenocarcinoma, Gleason score 3+3=6 (Grade Group 1), involving one out of one core and approximately 5% of entire specimen. No perineural invasion identified. H. Prostate, left mid; biopsy: Prostatic adenocarcinoma, Gleason score 3+3=6 (Grade Group 1), involving one out of one core and approximately 2% of entire specimen. No perineural invasion identified. I. Prostate, left apex; biopsy: Prostatic adenocarcinoma, Gleason score 4+3=7 (Grade Group 3), involving one out of one core and approximately 20% of entire specimen. No perinueral invasion identified. J. Prostate, left lateral base; biopsy: Prostatic adenocarcinoma, Gleason score 3+3=6 (Grade Group 1), involving one out of one core and approximately 5% of entire specimen. No perineural invasion identified. K. Prostate, left mid; biopsy: Benign prostatic glands and stroma, no malignancy identified. L. Prostate, left transitional zone; biopsy: Benign prostatic glands and stroma, no malignancy identified. I've been told the cancer moves relatively slow so I decided to just enjoy the summer and learn what I can. To me it appeared my Dr gave 2 choices of treatment, well 3 if I coount waiting it out to see what happens: 1) Since my prostate was relatively small, I think he said about 16grams, I would be a good candidate for the seeds along with hormone therapy and 2) The robotic removal. Any advice appreciated just trying to figure out where to go from here.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by Another The 4+3 is not slow growing and you have a significant amount of it. Be careful to not collapse your facts, i.e. PC is slow growing, into all the facts. The majority of prostate cancer is slow growing. The majority of PC is 3+3 and 3+4. You have 4+3. It is not slow growing and it is not like 3+4. Because of your young age surgery now and radiation later is the most common path. Best case scenario is surgery does the trick, but with 4 +3 recurrence is more of a concern. Let's say your recurrence happens in 10 years. You then treat with radiation at 64. If it comes back in another 10 years you have hormones at 74 and that gets you what it gets you. Short story, surgery first buys you a longer treatment game. As a youg person, the current view is to treat this as a chronic disease you manage such as diabetes. PC \"cures\" mostly are windows of time. Radiation leaves the prostate in place. Generally not a problem for an older person who will die of something else before the prostate regenerates the cancer that was irradicated by the radiation, if it was a slow growing type, i.e. 3s or 3+4s. If a higher grade it can regenerate sooner. With a successful surgery only minute amounts of prostate remain to continue to harbor or generate cancer. Again if you are producing 3s and 3+4s not a big problem, but if you are producing 4s and up it moves quicker. This scenario is more managable with follow up radiation and/or hormone therapy. Worst case scenario is that of a good friend of mine with 4+3 and 57. Surgery missed a significant portion. The suspicion is they were to go wide on the right and went wide on the left instead. Follow up radiation was not very effective, and he is now looking at hormone therapy from this point forward. All side effects are present. Not a happy camper. So, best advice imo, don't dally with primary G4, start with surgery, and find a competent team. Thanks, very good info.",
