      "Content": "Hi all. I am new to the forum and been reading tons of posts which I find helpful. In 2016 I was starting to have some dribbling and slow stream issues. PSA was taken and antibiotics given for prostatitis. PSA 1.6 meds didnt work. I was then referred to urologist who didn't suspect prostate issues and put me through the ringer with bladder void tests, sonograms urodynamics testing and cystoscopy. Found high bladder neck and recommend surgey if I wanted to release pressure. I declined as I could live with the issue and was suspicious. I used to pee like a race horse as a kid. Did another PSA later in 2016 (7 months later which came back 1.9). He said to keep eye on this and follow up 6 months later in 2017. After being put through the ringer by this one doctor and spending close to 5k on all these tests I changed doctors. Anyway, I just got my PSA take and it is now 4.9. Dr ordered biopsy for 2 weeks. Originally said it could wait till November.... until I pressed him harder saying I need this to be the up most priority. Additionally, they did a urine analysis and rectum swab (not sure why). The new Dr does not seemed concerned at all and that bothers me. He said PSA going up that high and fast is typically not a symptom of cancer but rather inflammation. I also did research last night showing that persons under 40 are at about 1% chance getting prostate cancer. No prostate cancer in my family ever. Should I be concerned or be cool like this Dr?

      "Content": "Hi all. I am new to the forum and been reading tons of posts which I find helpful. In 2016 I was starting to have some dribbling and slow stream issues. PSA was taken and antibiotics given for prostatitis. PSA 1.6 meds didnt work. I was then referred to urologist who didn't suspect prostate issues and put me through the ringer with bladder void tests, sonograms urodynamics testing and cystoscopy. Found high bladder neck and recommend surgey if I wanted to release pressure. I declined as I could live with the issue and was suspicious. I used to pee like a race horse as a kid. Did another PSA later in 2016 (7 months later which came back 1.9). He said to keep eye on this and follow up 6 months later in 2017. After being put through the ringer by this one doctor and spending close to 5k on all these tests I changed doctors. Anyway, I just got my PSA take and it is now 4.9. Dr ordered biopsy for 2 weeks. Originally said it could wait till November.... until I pressed him harder saying I need this to be the up most priority. Additionally, they did a urine analysis and rectum swab (not sure why). The new Dr does not seemed concerned at all and that bothers me. He said PSA going up that high and fast is typically not a symptom of cancer but rather inflammation. I also did research last night showing that persons under 40 are at about 1% chance getting prostate cancer. No prostate cancer in my family ever. Should I be concerned or be cool like this Dr? Thank you.",
