I asked him whether anyone else would participate and he said that it would be him and only him that does the actual surgery, though others may observe. Of course, you can't go wrong with Dr. Samadi either.",

There are MANY qualified surgeons that have done over 1000 surgeries (my number is higher than Chucks . In the end, I went with Tewari in NYC... could not have done better IMHO.

      "Content": "Hi n....., The others have pretty much summed it up. There are other advanced imaging tests (e.g., MRI with rectal coil or Color Doppler ultrasound) that can be performed prior to a biopsy that will either help with indications of PC and/or help target the biopsy. But finding these locations, getting insurance approval and determining how much they really help is all up in the air to some degree. Best bet (IMHO) is to go forward with the biopsy and based on that result determine what to do next. Good Luck!",

The question that has to be asked is: Will it help make better treatment decisions by better identifying men with non-indolent cancer... over current practice? It certainly should help better cancer identification in the biopsy process... but then what? A scenario: An MRI is performed identifying a potential 1cm mass on the left lobe. To get the best chance of knowing the Gleason Score they put 4 needles out of 12 and only those 4 needles come back positive and the final score is G6 with low % involvement. Now what... is he considered Very Low or Low risk? Does it affect the treatment decision? I don't know. As a patient, I would certainly feel better with this additional information but I am not sure the insurance is going to pay for a MRI just to make me feel better (unfortunately, economics plays a role).",

      "Content": "Hi n....., The others have pretty much summed it up. There are other advanced imaging tests (e.g., MRI with rectal coil or Color Doppler ultrasound) that can be performed prior to a biopsy that will either help with indications of PC and/or help target the biopsy. But finding these locations, getting insurance approval and determining how much they really help is all up in the air to some degree. Best bet (IMHO) is to go forward with the biopsy and based on that result determine what to do next. Good Luck!",

Also, did the doctor do a DRE and give you feedback on what he felt? You may want to go to a Urologist as a follow up... depending how comfortable you are with how knowledgeable the GP is with PC. As was mentioned, there are several benign reasons for elevated PSA (including if he did a DRE before the PSA blood work). What advice did the GP give you?",

If you go open and pick someone at the level of Dr. Burnett at John Hopkins then open is just as good as RALP by many other surgeons. I almost went with Dr. Burnett but changed to Dr. Tewari after talking with him. It was just a personal choice (Dr. Burnett's recovery times rival RALP). Both doctors spent their own time with me on the phone at night and made me feel very comfortable. Sounds like you are going to talk to a few as well, that should really help with your decision.

As far as injections, I find it to be really no big deal to inject and only takes less than a minute. The idea sounds worse than the actual act. Your doc will probably put you on either Bimix or Trimix (2 or 3 active ingredients) and start you off at a base dose. Once you try that you see how it works (how hard and how long) than you adjust the dosage. After 4 or 5 doses you should have it pretty well nailed down. I can pretty much nail it down so my erection lasts about 20 minutes though once in awhile I get a dud (I assume user injection error). I've never had an hour long erection since I crept up on the right dosage. But, the result of injections is amazing. Things happen right away (within minutes) and you are ready to go! You may also wan to consider getting the VED pump. Between the pump and injections I am almost at the point where I was before surgery. Good luck!",

      "Content": "Hi Island, You can search through my threads to see what I did to research surgeons, including having phone calls with some of them (big names). I felt that given it is cancer and knowing the side effects I wanted one of the top surgeons to do it. If that meant traveling and paying for a two week stay at a hotel then so be it. That is why I picked Ash Tewari and traveled. JH surgeons are just as good and it all comes down to who you feel comfortable or connect with. I chose surgery over radiation: 1. Wanted to know the final pathology that you can only get after surgery 2. Found a surgeon that I trusted immensely 3. Worried about secondary treatment if the first was not successful 4. Wanted to deal with the side effects right off the bat versus wonder if they would get worse over time You also have the option of AS. We are similar in age and diagnosis... I chose treatment because my father is still alive and doing well at 84 (was just cutting down trees last weekend) therefore I have a pretty good chance of living another 30 years and did not want to take the small risk of cancer progression if I was on AS. Good Luck!",

The article you published seems to indicate that there is no risk... which is good to know. When I had sinus surgery a couple years ago, I was scheduled as the last surgery (out of 4). The procedure before mine took 3 hours longer than planned and I did not even go into surgery until after 5pm. I joked with the doc about how tired he looked... he said \"don't worry, I'll take a standing cat nap and eat my burrito in the OR while the anesthesiologist is putting you under\". At the follow up appt, he said it was probably one of the best outcomes he has ever had (I guess the burrito and cat nap worked). Who knows what really goes on in the OR.",

Foreign body... shutdown\" due to the catheter being there) - First catheter was removed a week ago, but had trouble taking a wiz (just drops and dribble... AND lots of pain!). Had to go to ER to get new catheter put in (they were in contact with doctor since the got a little anxious when I told them I just had surgery. - Got 2nd catheter out today (oh what a relief it is) and all is well. Had a pad on all day and it is still dry (even with all the coughing due to a cold). Will keep fingers crossed that this continues. - Except for the healing incisions, I feel and look as good (or bad) as I did before surgery Dr. Tewari and his staff are top notch. Even the PA who was text-ing me constantly on Sunday when I had the problem peeing. He said he was extremely confident that he got it all. The way he does it is by doing a MRI prior to surgery and then using that as a map to make his first cuts and removal of the prostate. After he removes it he takes several samples and gets an immediate pathology (while this is going on, he went out and talked to my wife). Based on this pathology, he decides if he needs to take more, which he did not need to do for me. All and all, extremely pleased with the results to date.",

      "Content": "Hi Hogiebear.... Sorry to hear you have joined our little club. There is a wealth of info available here (recommend the stickies) and many members that can help. Can you share the details of your biopsy (number of cores, number of cores positive, % of each positive core)? That will help with the replies (you can see most of us put it in our signature). For Gleason 6 you may have various options with the three main types being radiation (few different types), surgery and Active Surveillance (AS). Should you end up going forward with treatment, I would also recommend you talk to both an experienced surgeon and a radiation oncologist. But, AS may be an option as well depending on your pathology report. I am a bit biased, but you have one of the top surgeons in the world right there in NYC (I traveled from FL to use him), Dr. Tewari. If you look at surgery, then you may want to talk to him. Finally, a G6 diagnosis means you have plenty of time to think about your decision... there is no rush. Research, ask questions, get comfortable with what YOU think is best for you. There are many here that can help and have done a great deal of research already... so ask away if you have questions. Good Luck!",

      "Content": "Well it has been 2 weeks and thought I would give an update: - Final pathology: G6, 5% involvement, negative margins - Had some movement down there during first week, erection during this past week (though the alarms went off \"Foreign body... Foreign body... shutdown\" due to the catheter being there) - First catheter was removed a week ago, but had trouble taking a wiz (just drops and dribble... AND lots of pain!). Had to go to ER to get new catheter put in (they were in contact with doctor since the got a little anxious when I told them I just had surgery. - Got 2nd catheter out today (oh what a relief it is) and all is well. Had a pad on all day and it is still dry (even with all the coughing due to a cold). Will keep fingers crossed that this continues. - Except for the healing incisions, I feel and look as good (or bad) as I did before surgery Dr. Tewari and his staff are top notch. Even the PA who was text-ing me constantly on Sunday when I had the problem peeing. He said he was extremely confident that he got it all. The way he does it is by doing a MRI prior to surgery and then using that as a map to make his first cuts and removal of the prostate. After he removes it he takes several samples and gets an immediate pathology (while this is going on, he went out and talked to my wife). Based on this pathology, he decides if he needs to take more, which he did not need to do for me. All and all, extremely pleased with the results to date.",

If you are getting some movement then you may want to talk to your doc about a similar rehabilitation regime. The theory is that when you start artificially creating hard erections the nerves and all the associated parts will relearn and get exercised. It is definitely working for me. Guess I am not sure why someone would go directly to an implant before exhausting all the other options. Good Luck!",

Tomorrow will happen pretty fast and before you know it you will be up and walking and kicked out of the hospital. Then walk, walk, walk as much as possible to help get that first fart out which leads to the bowel movement... THEN YOU CAN EAT! Good news, that first meal tastes SO good. I had a full breakfast (eggs, toast, hash browns, bacon, coffee and orange juice) at a diner. Good Luck and see you on the other side!",

Question, if you don't mind, I am curious when you take a piss, can stop your pee mid stream? Not sure this matters, but it is my own scientific mind thinking that the more you do this you develop muscle memory (really brain reflex memory) to do this when you leak. Again, unscientific, but this is what I did pre/post surgery instead of doing kegals. On the ED front, definitely go for the injections, IMHO. There is BiMix, TriMix and QuadMix (2-4 different mix of drugs). Your doctor will pick one of them and the ratio of the mix based on what he thinks will work the best. Most popular is TriMix, but I am on BiMix and it works great. Also, you may want to try the VED pump. Between the injections and the pump my spontaneous erections definitely improved. Good Luck!",

Dr. Tewari will probably talk to you halfway through the surgery when he is waiting for his quick pathology report on the samples he takes. You will probably get a pretty good feel for how things went at that point. I am pretty certain he only has one team (I am pretty sure I asked him this and remember the response of \"Of Course!\". We got 10\" of snow when we were there and everything in NYC kept on ticking, so I don't expect that you will have problems. Be sure to leave enough time for the slower traffic (unless you are going in at 5AM like we did). Tell your husband I said \"Hi\" and to feel free to call me if he has any questions after surgery.

Dr. Tewari will probably talk to you halfway through the surgery when he is waiting for his quick pathology report on the samples he takes.

      "Content": "CyberKnife is high precision higher dose radiation. It is delivered by a robot in 5-7 sessions (so much less treatments then typical external beam) where the robot delivers the radiation around ~150-200 different angles and positions during each treatment. The prostate has gold markers that are used to image guide the robot in real time to make sure the radiation is being delivered accurately. The idea is that it provides increased accuracy in the delivery of the x-rays and therefore is more likely to spare surrounding tissue/organs. I considered this for treatment but decided against it due to the higher dose and relatively low amount of information long term side effects.",

      "Content": "Based on what I know and have read, PSA can bounce around a little. Mine went from 4.5 to 3.4 to 4.6 within 6 months. So it is hard to get a read as to whether it is really increasing. But you are consistently over so I would be concerned... heck, I was concerned after 3 tests. From what I have read there is a slight chance... sounds like on the order of a couple percent... that cancer could get into the blood stream but it is not likely to live there long. The trade off is not doing it, having cancer that spreads to other organs... then you are in a much worse position. I personally think the trade off is worth it. For me, the biopsy was no different than giving blood. I had my wife with me, but I am certain I could have driven after. I've read where some folks have taken a pain med prior the biopsy (based on mine, I don't see the need) and therefore I would not recommend driving if you take pain med. [note... this raises an interesting question as to why PSA tests are not done more often. For the cost (~$40) it seems like the extra data would yield a better prediction curve]",

      "Content": "Based on what I know and have read, PSA can bounce around a little. Mine went from 4.5 to 3.4 to 4.6 within 6 months. So it is hard to get a read as to whether it is really increasing. But you are consistently over so I would be concerned... heck, I was concerned after 3 tests. From what I have read there is a slight chance... sounds like on the order of a couple percent... that cancer could get into the blood stream but it is not likely to live there long. The trade off is not doing it, having cancer that spreads to other organs... then you are in a much worse position. I personally think the trade off is worth it. For me, the biopsy was no different than giving blood. I had my wife with me, but I am certain I could have driven after. I've read where some folks have taken a pain med prior the biopsy (based on mine, I don't see the need) and therefore I would not recommend driving if you take pain med. [note... this raises an interesting question as to why PSA tests are not done more often. For the cost (~$40) it seems like the extra data would yield a better prediction curve]",

      "Content": "Hi Dan, First, I would get another read on the biopsy slides. You can have your uro send them somewhere, I had mine sent to John Hopkins, instructions here. This way you are sure it is a 3+4 and not something worse or better. Your uro should have no issue with this. As lancepeace said, you need not be in any big rush... take some time and research surgery and radiation. Others might comment on other treatment options. I is also helpful to look at the NCCN guidelines as they are recommendations from a group of cancer centers around the world. The book by Patrick Walsh is also recommended. It is an easy read and goes over everything you might want to know. My take on everything I have read, for your age and score, is that your best bet is surgery since you can get radiation later if surgery is not fully successful. But it is not always a good option the other way around. Active Surveillance is also still an option, but you are right on the fringe of being able to to that IMHO. There are pros and cons to Surgery and Radiation. In general, the side effects with surgery are immediate and usually get better. The side effects with radiation are better right after treatment but can get worse with time. That is why I think surgery might be a better option. In the end, it is really a personal decision based on the quality of life objectives and understanding of the risks of whatever path you take. That is why you should do research and only take what you read on here as input to augment that research (everyone will be a bit biased based on their own personal situation). Good Luck and continue to ask questions and keep us informed!",

      "Content": "Hi Dan, First, I would get another read on the biopsy slides. You can have your uro send them somewhere, I had mine sent to John Hopkins, instructions here. This way you are sure it is a 3+4 and not something worse or better. Your uro should have no issue with this. As lancepeace said, you need not be in any big rush... take some time and research surgery and radiation. Others might comment on other treatment options. I is also helpful to look at the NCCN guidelines as they are recommendations from a group of cancer centers around the world. The book by Patrick Walsh is also recommended. It is an easy read and goes over everything you might want to know. My take on everything I have read, for your age and score, is that your best bet is surgery since you can get radiation later if surgery is not fully successful. But it is not always a good option the other way around. Active Surveillance is also still an option, but you are right on the fringe of being able to to that IMHO. There are pros and cons to Surgery and Radiation. In general, the side effects with surgery are immediate and usually get better. The side effects with radiation are better right after treatment but can get worse with time. That is why I think surgery might be a better option. In the end, it is really a personal decision based on the quality of life objectives and understanding of the risks of whatever path you take. That is why you should do research and only take what you read on here as input to augment that research (everyone will be a bit biased based on their own personal situation). Good Luck and continue to ask questions and keep us informed!",

It sounds like you have enough MRI information to do a targeted biopsy at this point and get a good read on the aggressiveness of the tumor. Although the MRI data you show above indicate 3 lesions. The previous MRI finds one Posterolateral (side/back) 14mm from mid-line (that is why I say side first in side/back) and the latest finds one Anteromedial (front/side) with one side at the mid-line (therefore front is first). This would indicate to me two separate areas of concern? What does your doctor say/recommend about this latest MRI? Good luck to you!",

Not sure it helped, but it gave me a little more confidence that I was making the right decision. You should do whatever makes you comfortable with your decision but I assume you will get a similar response from all of them. Good Luck!",

      "Content": "Yes, I was on T when I was diagnosed 15 months ago. I immediately stopped at that point. My local uro (he did not do my surgery) felt the way I did about the risk and agreed that after three months post surgery if my PSA was undetectable I could restart T... which I did... with the agreement that I get tested every three months (PSA, T level and CBC [make sure my Hematocrit stays acceptable]). I feel your pain about going off T. I was hit pretty hard when I went off with similar symptoms. It did get a little better after a few months when my body starting generating some T on it's own, but my levels were still low.",

      "Content": "Been a while since I have posted (life kinda got in the way) but thought I would give an update. PSA: Undetectable Testosterone: Still on 80mgs IM per week Incontinence: Still nothing to speak of. A drop here or there while working out, pushing out a fart, or laughing hard. ED: After getting to ~75% of where I was pre-Op I stalled. So I am currently on a rehabilitation plan: - 5 mg Cialis/Day (backing off to every other day) - 2 EDOX Cardio tablets per day - Pump(VED) everyday. Hold suction for one min, off for one minute, repeat 3-5 times - Viagra 100-200mgs twice a week - Bimix: ~0.2ml 2-3 times per week I have to say the Bimix is a wonder drug. Doing the injection is no issue for me, but the results (and resulting sex) is amazing. I've been doing all this for about a month now and the number and firmness of my spontaneous erections has increased significantly (night time or morning wood). Doc said I can start backing off if everything continues after another month and would like me to be off everything but Cialis in under 6 months (or less). Will keep my fingers crossed. Other: My orgasms have not changed or may have gotten a little more intense. The lack of ejaculation has taken some time to get past. I do still miss that part, but not enough to let it bother me or interfere. Exercise: I workout (weights) 3-5 times per week and watch my calories and nutrition balance (carbs, fat, protein)... I think this has been a big help in my overall feeling. Though I still hate cardio so only do it 10 min per workout. Finally, my wife has been incredibly patient, helpful and understanding during this whole process... I love her dearly.",

There is concern by some docs that there could be cancer cells left and T will feed them but others that think risk is minimal. I had a low Gleason disease and pretty confident it was all taken out. Also, I tend to agree with the research that T levels above a pretty low number have no further affect... So boosting T levels does not increase the risk. I would not advise anyone else to do this without doing their own research and making their own decision. If I had done AS, drugs or even radiation, I would not be on T now.",

      "Content": "IMHO, you have to pick a number that makes you feel comfortable that the surgeon is past the learning curve and has come across various complications AND has enough history to be meaningful when you ask questions. For me, this was 1000. Then you can ask all the questions about outcomes (ED, incontinence, positive margins, etc.) to get a feel for the likelihood of a trifecta for someone with your conditions. As with other decisions around PC, there is probably no real wrong answer, just whatever makes you feel good and gives you the most confidence about the potential outcome.",

      "Content": "Given the amount of discussion around AS versus treatment in the various threads, I thought it might be useful to have that discussion in a thread of its own. This way we are not commandeering someone else\u0092s thread. Don\u0092t think of this as Mikla\u0092s thread, think of this as a neutral ground debate thread. ALL opinions are welcome, spirited debate is welcome, point/counterpoint arguments are encouraged. We should show as much respect as possible, but everyone has to understand that there is a great deal of emotions behind the topic so only read and post if you have a thick skin. In other words, we should all be able to go out for a beer (or your beverage of choice) at the end of the day. I urge everyone to participate, even those that are lurking who might have questions or opinions. Highlander will monitor the thread and as the admin and will step in where necessary (along with posting his own thoughts). So\u0085 Buddy(Bud) Iamanonymous is our imaginary friend. He is tipping over the line to have surgery versus Active Surveillance (AS) and is looking for help to either push him over or pull him back to AS.

His current state in some side effect areas is 1) ED: Some problems, 2) bowel: excellent, 3) incontinence: excellent His reasons and position for leaning toward surgery: He definitely wants to live another 30 years Based on Partin Tables, 20% of men with G6 PCa have a higher grade decease found after surgery and his chance of extraprostatic extension (beyond the prostate) are 18% link. Based on his latest PSA and the fact he has two HGPIN at biopsy indicates his chances of having G7+ are even greater. NCCN states that one of the criteria for AS is to have <20 yrs of life expectancy link: see PROS-B. This is also stated in the guidelines by John Hopkins link He has ruled out radiation: Some studies have shown that radiation side effects get worse with time, not better. link Reoccurrence treatment options are limited with radiation (salvage surgery is more difficult) link. Some side effects can be worse than the original problem (radiation cystitis or proctitis). Some studies show that long term survival after radiation is not much better than AS link. His rise in PSA is concerning. While it could be something else benign, he has no symptoms of prostatitis. If PCa caused, then this doubling time is well beyond most limits for AS. link Several studies show that the mortality rate are improved by ~5% at 15 years for men that choose surgery versus AS It is easier to recover from surgery at a younger age and the surgical risks are lower link link Even with AS and all the PSA tests and biopsies, there is no clear tipping point on when to get treatment (studies appear to be all over the map on this), if at all\u0085 so why bother to even monitor it. link For men with long life expectancies, AS is putting of the inevitable treatment. Trading potential (because there could be none or minimal) side effects of treatment, for shorter term perceived gain. 30% of those on AS will have cancer progression within 5 years link Any future curative procedures or solutions will not have historical data to support any claims of being better than what is available today with surgery While there are studies that indicate G3 cells will not advance to G4 cells, these studies are still a bit inconclusive link There are other studies that conclude that the PCa does evolve to higher levels over time link link link. So while there appears to be no conclusive evidence at this time, there is some basis that indicates PCa does evolve\u0085 so why wait? So there it is, feel free to jump in and help Bud by either refuting or supporting his position.",

Think of him as my evil look-alike that has gotten me in trouble by pretending to be me... he is fair game as far as I am concerned. Your right about the lack of definitive research. As you say, PCa is slow growing and the prostate is in a very difficult place making direct observation through a scope nearly impossible. There are lots of trade offs between radiation and surgery. Incontinence has certainly shown to be better with radiation, but ED appears to be about the same over time depending on how much ED you had pre-treatment (with radiation getting a slight edge). But you run the risk of bowel problems with radiation along with not getting some definitive answers on the progression of the disease. Then again, as you say for your condition, if it is outside the prostate then you might end up getting radiation anyway. So radiation vs surgery seems to come down to what fits your needs. It sounds like you picked the perfect treatment for your situation.",

      "Content": "Hey Joe, Hard to predict without a biopsy, thought Walnut may chime in about his experience with a type of MRI. Looking at just your PSA, your doubling time is about 35 months and your PSA velocity is 1.86 ng/ml/yr. There is still some debate on whether either of these is a good predictor to prostate cancer. Reference: http://prostatecancerinfolink.net/di.../psa-velocity/ But with the family history and your trending PSA you do have an increased risk (IMHO). Of course, this is complicated, as has already been said, there are other benign causes of increased PSA (e.g., BPH and infection). Others will chime in and please post your biopsy results.",

Think of him as my evil look-alike that has gotten me in trouble by pretending to be me... he is fair game as far as I am concerned. Your right about the lack of definitive research. As you say, PCa is slow growing and the prostate is in a very difficult place making direct observation through a scope nearly impossible. There are lots of trade offs between radiation and surgery. Incontinence has certainly shown to be better with radiation, but ED appears to be about the same over time depending on how much ED you had pre-treatment (with radiation getting a slight edge). But you run the risk of bowel problems with radiation along with not getting some definitive answers on the progression of the disease. Then again, as you say for your condition, if it is outside the prostate then you might end up getting radiation anyway. So radiation vs surgery seems to come down to what fits your needs. It sounds like you picked the perfect treatment for your situation.",

This way we are not commandeering someone else\u0092s thread. Don\u0092t think of this as Mikla\u0092s thread, think of this as a neutral ground debate thread. ALL opinions are welcome, spirited debate is welcome, point/counterpoint arguments are encouraged. We should show as much respect as possible, but everyone has to understand that there is a great deal of emotions behind the topic so only read and post if you have a thick skin. In other words, we should all be able to go out for a beer (or your beverage of choice) at the end of the day. I urge everyone to participate, even those that are lurking who might have questions or opinions. Highlander will monitor the thread and as the admin and will step in where necessary (along with posting his own thoughts). So\u0085 Buddy(Bud) Iamanonymous is our imaginary friend. He is tipping over the line to have surgery versus Active Surveillance (AS) and is looking for help to either push him over or pull him back to AS.

His current state in some side effect areas is 1) ED: Some problems, 2) bowel: excellent, 3) incontinence: excellent His reasons and position for leaning toward surgery: He definitely wants to live another 30 years Based on Partin Tables, 20% of men with G6 PCa have a higher grade decease found after surgery and his chance of extraprostatic extension (beyond the prostate) are 18% link. Based on his latest PSA and the fact he has two HGPIN at biopsy indicates his chances of having G7+ are even greater. NCCN states that one of the criteria for AS is to have <20 yrs of life expectancy link: see PROS-B. This is also stated in the guidelines by John Hopkins link He has ruled out radiation: Some studies have shown that radiation side effects get worse with time, not better. link Reoccurrence treatment options are limited with radiation (salvage surgery is more difficult) link. Some side effects can be worse than the original problem (radiation cystitis or proctitis). Some studies show that long term survival after radiation is not much better than AS link. His rise in PSA is concerning. While it could be something else benign, he has no symptoms of prostatitis. If PCa caused, then this doubling time is well beyond most limits for AS. link Several studies show that the mortality rate are improved by ~5% at 15 years for men that choose surgery versus AS It is easier to recover from surgery at a younger age and the surgical risks are lower link link Even with AS and all the PSA tests and biopsies, there is no clear tipping point on when to get treatment (studies appear to be all over the map on this), if at all\u0085 so why bother to even monitor it. link For men with long life expectancies, AS is putting of the inevitable treatment. Trading potential (because there could be none or minimal) side effects of treatment, for shorter term perceived gain. 30% of those on AS will have cancer progression within 5 years link Any future curative procedures or solutions will not have historical data to support any claims of being better than what is available today with surgery While there are studies that indicate G3 cells will not advance to G4 cells, these studies are still a bit inconclusive link There are other studies that conclude that the PCa does evolve to higher levels over time link link link. So while there appears to be no conclusive evidence at this time, there is some basis that indicates PCa does evolve\u0085 so why wait? So there it is, feel free to jump in and help Bud by either refuting or supporting his position.",

As you say, PCa is slow growing and the prostate is in a very difficult place making direct observation through a scope nearly impossible. There are lots of trade offs between radiation and surgery. Incontinence has certainly shown to be better with radiation, but ED appears to be about the same over time depending on how much ED you had pre-treatment (with radiation getting a slight edge). But you run the risk of bowel problems with radiation along with not getting some definitive answers on the progression of the disease. Then again, as you say for your condition, if it is outside the prostate then you might end up getting radiation anyway. So radiation vs surgery seems to come down to what fits your needs.

      "Content": "Hey Joe, Hard to predict without a biopsy, thought Walnut may chime in about his experience with a type of MRI. Looking at just your PSA, your doubling time is about 35 months and your PSA velocity is 1.86 ng/ml/yr. There is still some debate on whether either of these is a good predictor to prostate cancer. Reference: http://prostatecancerinfolink.net/di.../psa-velocity/ But with the family history and your trending PSA you do have an increased risk (IMHO). Of course, this is complicated, as has already been said, there are other benign causes of increased PSA (e.g., BPH and infection). Others will chime in and please post your biopsy results.",

      "Content": "Based on the NCCN guidelines (PROS-1 ==> PROS-3 ==> PROS-C) you are a \"Low\" risk (T1-T2a, Gleason <=6, PSA < 10). For \"Low\" risk, NCCN says all three options (radiation, surgery, AS) are available (there is no mention of number of cores for \"Low\" risk, only \"Very Low\" risk). Except, they infer (my interpretation) on the AS page of the guidelines that AS (they actually state \"Observation\") is not preferred for >= 10 year life expectancy. Which would rule out AS for you IMHO. But it sounds like you already sorted this out. As has been stated, you have time and really should see a Radiation Oncologist. Others on here have successfully gone the radiation route at about your age. It doesn't hurt to get a consult. Good Luck! NCCN Guidelines (you may need to create a free account)",

If I had known, I would have got the script earlier and stocked up. Also, hit up the doc for samples (push hard for extras), you may be surprised how many samples they have. Also the diet and exercise, I think, were a big part of my recovery. I started before surgery and at six weeks post surgery I started back up. I work out 4-5 days per week for 45-60 minutes. I use FitDay to track my calories and macros (protein, fat and carbs) every day. While not everyone can or will be this disciplined, any exercise and a little controlled food consumption (I hate the word \"diet\"... it still makes me cringe) can keep us older farts feeling a little younger.",

It is not like you can get another biopsy and it would seem out of the norm that a doctor would recommend treatment. The treatment threshold is still typically .2 with >.1 being the concern level. IMHO it just adds another opportunity to worry about something that may be nothing. But, in the end, it is your body and if this information helps than go for it... just try to make some threshold decision points in advance so you know when you need to take action.",

      "Content": "Hi Bow, As others have stated surgery was pretty much a breeze. I was up and walking the halls within a few hours after surgery. Walked around all night and was released the next day before noon. For me, the catheter was a non event... did not bother me in the least. Lidocaine and KY lube where the catheter went in a few times a day worked wonders. I had surgery during the winter in NY, so the leg bag had the added benefit of keeping my leg warm! Everyone's recovery is a bit unique and times vary for ED and Incontinence to return to \"normal\". I was lucky and had no incontinence issues and minor ED issues. The skill of the surgeon is probably the most important factor in recovery... one of the reasons I flew to NY to have it done. Check with your uro and get his thoughts on T after surgery... opinions vary widely. Personally, I have gone back on T but researched the heck out of it and for my particular scenario decided it was extremely low risk (my uro agreed). Good luck!",

You come on the forum and within a few posts become defensive and authoritative while letting all know you wrote a book. You don't even put your stats in your signature, instead you promote your book. As a suggestion, it may have or is better to post in the stickies and refer to your concerns as \"Side Effects to Ask About if Considering Surgery\"... since you do bring up some very valid concerns and thoughts. Also, since you tend to point out the negatives it would be helpful to point out counter arguments and thoughts. Otherwise you have to be prepared for the onslaught of questions, criticism and counterpoints that the knowledgeable folks on this forum will provide. Finally, you authored a book and you posted on a public forum... you need to have a thicker skin... all authors are criticized at some point. The good ones roll with it and provide sound retorts or are will to concede that others are making valid points as well. IMHO",

Therefore, you might consider what your doctor suggests or get a 2nd opinion as suggested in your other thread. There are a few on here that have concerns over a biopsy (I am not one of them), but like all topics in life there are folks on the extreme ends. I would say most folks find them no big deal. Takes about 10 minutes for a 12 core sample and has some minor discomfort (pinch yourself with your fingernails 12 times).",

      "Content": "Hello All... just got the news yesterday that I have PC. Good news is that it appears to have been found about as early as possible. I know I have time but I am looking at my options. Doc said the most probable options are AS or radiation. He told me it is really up to me and whether I can deal with knowing I have cancer while on AS. He also said to go talk with the folks at the radiation lab (he suggested a doc at SFRO) to get their input and what radiation technique would be best... so I will do this next week. The minor complication is that I have low testosterone and have been getting 100mg testosterone/wk IM and it had significantly improved my energy level, mood and libido. Since I am no longer taking it, the symptoms have returned. Doc said it is possible that given successful radiation I could look at going back on testosterone six months after completing radiation but no promises. Another minor factor is that I am currently between jobs so now would be a good time to get treatment as when I work I usually travel quite a bit. My wife is awesome and very understanding, but having low energy and libido is taxing on her and me. So I am a bit stuck... I am currently thinking that this would be the best plan: 1. Stop smoking 2. Lose some weight and improve diet 3. Exercise more (I certainly have the time) 4. AS for six months and re-access #4 could change to radiation based on my visit to the lab, but I am interested in your thoughts. Thanks!",

ThatBiopsyHurt (I love the handle, though my biopsy was no worse than giving blood), I like the idea of another biopsy (being an engineer, the more data I have the more accurate the analysis)... guess I have to talk to the doc to see when that can be done. My wife is very involved and definitely wants to be with me during visits and meetings. fasteddie... thanks for the tip on keeping notes and data... I need to go back to the two docs I used to make sure I have all the test results... I'll do that Monday. Though I only show 2 PSA tests in my sig, I do know I had 4 and one of them was around 3.8... the only one less than 4 (but I think this was a different lab). Forums like this are a GREAT source of information and support... thanks to all and Good Luck and best wishes right back at all of you!",

      "Content": "wishful, you should really consolidate all your posts to some degree and put your info in your signature in order to make it easier for folks to reply. Unfortunately, you have joined our club. Your biopsy appears to say you have Gleason 7 (3+4) with three cores positive with a max involvement of a core of 20%. The \"High grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia\" or HGPIN looks like another read on that core or another from that area. It means they found tissue that may be a precursor to cancer, but cannot be called cancer. It does not mean that the cancer they found on the apex is \"high grade\"... your Gleason score is what is important. By NCCN guidelines you are Intermediate Risk. I would suggest that you have your slides sent out for a 2nd opinion to validate the scores. In some cases the scores are changed... and if changed down, then AS would be an option. Regardless, if the score remains 3+4, you are still in an excellent position for successful treatment (or even AS dependent on your age). What did your urologist recommend? Still no need to panic, you have time to think through this and what you want to do. Best of luck and keep us updated.",

Samadi is certainly one of the top surgeons and one I considered in my list. The benefit with surgery is getting the post-surgical pathology report so you know how aggressive the cancer really is. Of course, you have the risks, but ask Samadi what his history has been with someone with your Dx in terms of getting the trifecta (no ED, no Incontinence and Cure) after surgery. Good luck!",

You will find a great deal of information here from members who have pretty much seen it all and are more than willing to help and answer questions. What type of surgery are you having... e.g., open or robotic? I suggest you start by reading the stickies: What I wish I knew before my Da Vinci surgery What I Need to Know About ED What I Need to Know About Incontinence These threads have information in them about the surgery (most of it applies to any type of surgery) and the possible side effects. The surgery thread has info on the types of things you might need pre/post surgery. Also, it would be helpful to know if you are getting surgery locally or have to travel (e.g. by car for hours or plane). Take a look at those then ask any follow up questions you may have. Someone will have and answer or opinion. Good Luck!",

I think much of the advice above is sound about doing kegals and maybe seeing another urologist. As far as ED, only you can determine if you are satisfied with your post-op progress. But, don't give up... try all the other suggestions and methods that are available to you. Try to stay positive. We don't have all your detail, but I will assume you are currently cancer free.

      "Content": "wishful, you should really consolidate all your posts to some degree and put your info in your signature in order to make it easier for folks to reply. Unfortunately, you have joined our club. Your biopsy appears to say you have Gleason 7 (3+4) with three cores positive with a max involvement of a core of 20%. The \"High grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia\" or HGPIN looks like another read on that core or another from that area. It means they found tissue that may be a precursor to cancer, but cannot be called cancer. It does not mean that the cancer they found on the apex is \"high grade\"... your Gleason score is what is important. By NCCN guidelines you are Intermediate Risk. I would suggest that you have your slides sent out for a 2nd opinion to validate the scores. In some cases the scores are changed... and if changed down, then AS would be an option. Regardless, if the score remains 3+4, you are still in an excellent position for successful treatment (or even AS dependent on your age). What did your urologist recommend? Still no need to panic, you have time to think through this and what you want to do. Best of luck and keep us updated.",

Based on what (in 50 words or less)? montrob, You are obviously frustrated, sounds like it is mostly due to not being informed (by whatever means). I think much of the advice above is sound about doing kegals and maybe seeing another urologist. As far as ED, only you can determine if you are satisfied with your post-op progress. But, don't give up... try all the other suggestions and methods that are available to you. Try to stay positive. We don't have all your detail, but I will assume you are currently cancer free. If so, you beat cancer... you can beat the ED issue one way or another. Good luck!",

You don't even put your stats in your signature, instead you promote your book. As a suggestion, it may have or is better to post in the stickies and refer to your concerns as \"Side Effects to Ask About if Considering Surgery\"... since you do bring up some very valid concerns and thoughts. Also, since you tend to point out the negatives it would be helpful to point out counter arguments and thoughts. Otherwise you have to be prepared for the onslaught of questions, criticism and counterpoints that the knowledgeable folks on this forum will provide. Finally, you authored a book and you posted on a public forum... you need to have a thicker skin... all authors are criticized at some point.

      "Content": "Hi Bow, As others have stated surgery was pretty much a breeze. I was up and walking the halls within a few hours after surgery. Walked around all night and was released the next day before noon. For me, the catheter was a non event... did not bother me in the least. Lidocaine and KY lube where the catheter went in a few times a day worked wonders. I had surgery during the winter in NY, so the leg bag had the added benefit of keeping my leg warm! Everyone's recovery is a bit unique and times vary for ED and Incontinence to return to \"normal\". I was lucky and had no incontinence issues and minor ED issues. The skill of the surgeon is probably the most important factor in recovery... one of the reasons I flew to NY to have it done. Check with your uro and get his thoughts on T after surgery... opinions vary widely. Personally, I have gone back on T but researched the heck out of it and for my particular scenario decided it was extremely low risk (my uro agreed). Good luck!",

      "Content": "Hi RTS... we are in a very similar position. I am still not sure what I am going to do, so I've defaulted to AS while I continue to research and listen/read what others on here have to say. Read up on Pat Walsh's book that Highlander recommends. My take from his book is that for someone in our age range he recommends surgery (but he is a surgeon) due to the amount of potential lifespan we have left. He does also say that AS is an option in other parts of his book so he contradicts himself in some regards... which is about what you will hear on this site. Read several of the threads on this site and you will also get a feel for the various arguments around AS and treatment. All of them are very good (though can be a little passionate at times and will give you a sense for what the risks and benefits are. In the end, as several docs have told me, you can't make a bad decision... just one you have to live with. If I go treatment, I have started moving more towards surgery versus radiation... but even that decision is hard to nail down (various pros and cons of each). I'll post some links to various sites I have used if you are interested. Good luck and I will stay tuned to your progress!",

      "Content": "Hi RTS... we are in a very similar position. I am still not sure what I am going to do, so I've defaulted to AS while I continue to research and listen/read what others on here have to say. Read up on Pat Walsh's book that Highlander recommends. My take from his book is that for someone in our age range he recommends surgery (but he is a surgeon) due to the amount of potential lifespan we have left. He does also say that AS is an option in other parts of his book so he contradicts himself in some regards... which is about what you will hear on this site. Read several of the threads on this site and you will also get a feel for the various arguments around AS and treatment. All of them are very good (though can be a little passionate at times and will give you a sense for what the risks and benefits are. In the end, as several docs have told me, you can't make a bad decision... just one you have to live with. If I go treatment, I have started moving more towards surgery versus radiation... but even that decision is hard to nail down (various pros and cons of each). I'll post some links to various sites I have used if you are interested. Good luck and I will stay tuned to your progress!",

      "Content": "Hello All... just got the news yesterday that I have PC. Good news is that it appears to have been found about as early as possible. I know I have time but I am looking at my options. Doc said the most probable options are AS or radiation. He told me it is really up to me and whether I can deal with knowing I have cancer while on AS. He also said to go talk with the folks at the radiation lab (he suggested a doc at SFRO) to get their input and what radiation technique would be best... so I will do this next week. The minor complication is that I have low testosterone and have been getting 100mg testosterone/wk IM and it had significantly improved my energy level, mood and libido. Since I am no longer taking it, the symptoms have returned. Doc said it is possible that given successful radiation I could look at going back on testosterone six months after completing radiation but no promises. Another minor factor is that I am currently between jobs so now would be a good time to get treatment as when I work I usually travel quite a bit. My wife is awesome and very understanding, but having low energy and libido is taxing on her and me. So I am a bit stuck... I am currently thinking that this would be the best plan: 1. Stop smoking 2. Lose some weight and improve diet 3. Exercise more (I certainly have the time) 4. AS for six months and re-access #4 could change to radiation based on my visit to the lab, but I am interested in your thoughts. Thanks!",

My wife is very involved and definitely wants to be with me during visits and meetings. fasteddie... thanks for the tip on keeping notes and data... I need to go back to the two docs I used to make sure I have all the test results... I'll do that Monday. Though I only show 2 PSA tests in my sig, I do know I had 4 and one of them was around 3.8... the only one less than 4 (but I think this was a different lab). Forums like this are a GREAT source of information and support... thanks to all and Good Luck and best wishes right back at all of you!",

      "Content": "Hello All... just got the news yesterday that I have PC. Good news is that it appears to have been found about as early as possible. I know I have time but I am looking at my options. Doc said the most probable options are AS or radiation. He told me it is really up to me and whether I can deal with knowing I have cancer while on AS. He also said to go talk with the folks at the radiation lab (he suggested a doc at SFRO) to get their input and what radiation technique would be best... so I will do this next week. The minor complication is that I have low testosterone and have been getting 100mg testosterone/wk IM and it had significantly improved my energy level, mood and libido. Since I am no longer taking it, the symptoms have returned. Doc said it is possible that given successful radiation I could look at going back on testosterone six months after completing radiation but no promises. Another minor factor is that I am currently between jobs so now would be a good time to get treatment as when I work I usually travel quite a bit. My wife is awesome and very understanding, but having low energy and libido is taxing on her and me. So I am a bit stuck... I am currently thinking that this would be the best plan: 1. Stop smoking 2. Lose some weight and improve diet 3. Exercise more (I certainly have the time) 4. AS for six months and re-access #4 could change to radiation based on my visit to the lab, but I am interested in your thoughts. Thanks!",

Questions about the doctor: \u0095 How many procedures have you performed? \u0095 How many do you do per day? \u0095 How many patients have you treated who are my age? \u0095 Will you personally be operating the console for the entire surgery? \u0095 Are there any other surgeons in the room (e.g., interns) and what is the role of the other surgeons in the room during the surgery? Questions about my preparation: \u0095 Are there other tests that I should have to determine the exact size, location, and aggressiveness of the cancer (e.g., MRI, CT, etc.)? \u0095 What can I be doing TODAY to prepare my body for the surgery and to reduce side effects? (Kegel exercises? How much is too much? Exercises?) \u0095 If I decided this week, when would we do the surgery? Questions about the surgery: \u0095 Explain the procedure\u0085 pre op, op and post op. \u0095 What may be removed other than the prostate itself (nodes, etc)? How and when will you decide what to remove? \u0095 Will you attempt to preserve the internal (top)/external (bottom) sphincter urethra muscles? \u0095 Does the size of the prostate have any influence on the difficulty of the surgery less or my body post op? \u0095 How will you manipulate/remove the prostate using the robotic tools without tearing the capsule (possibly causing cancer cells to be \"spilled\" inside my body)? \u0095 What will you do to spare the nerves around the prostate? \u0095 How is bleeding controlled? \u0095 How many openings will you need to make for the robotic components? \u0095 Is the size of the incision above the belly button related to the size of the prostate? \u0095 How big of an incision should I expect? \u0095 How will the incision be closed? I have heard of people who have had their incision become herniated after a few months. When will the stitches/staples/etc be removed? \u0095 How are the loose ends of the vas deferens closed? If there are clips applied, what material are they made of any how do you ensure that they never open? \u0095 Will the surgery involve changes to my bladder capacity? \u0095 Will you do the entire surgery? Questions about the outcome: \u0095 What are the outcomes of your patients that are my age (cancer cure, incontinence, ED)? \u0095 How about these side effects over time, i.e. quality of life 2-3, 5-10, 15+ years out? \u0095 I have heard reports of penis size reductions that have occurred due to prostatectomy. Is that true, and what will be done to prevent/minimize it? \u0095 What tests/monitoring will be necessary to track whether the cancer returns (in the prostate or elsewhere nearby)? \u0095 How soon after the surgery will I get the pathology report? \u0095 If the cancer returns, what's next? Questions about recovery: \u0095 How long should I expect to need a catheter? \u0095 What role does your staff play in my post op recovery? \u0095 Since I will be traveling, how is post op follow up performed? \u0095 What rehabilitation strategies will I use after the surgery to minimize incontinence/ED? (Daily 25mg of Viagra? Vacuum pump?) \u0095 How soon can I return to work? \u0095 How soon can I return to my regular daily workout regimen (aerobic/weights/cycling)? \u0095 How soon can I return to sexual activity? \u0095 When would you want to do the first post-surgery PSA test, and what would you expect for results? \u0095 What is your role vs. my urologists' role in my recovery and care: 1) treating side effects from the surgery; 2) long-term monitoring for cancer recurrence Other: \u0095 I'm told that if I have radiation as my primary treatment, that surgery is still an option as a salvage therapy.

I wore it high up on my thigh and it was connected directly to the catheter with no extensions. This is the one I was using. It was easy to tell when it was getting full (just reach down an put my hand on it) and it was easy to drain. I almost always wore sweat pants or loose jeans. Could just go to the toilet, raise my pant leg and open the valve while standing. When I showered, I would just let the catheter dangle and rinse the bag out with the running shower water before putting it back on when I got out of the shower.",

As far as you now know, you are a 3 core G6... those are the current facts. The last person most folks would question is Epstein. If you go surgery, then there is a good chance the doctor will want to do his own read of the slides (Tewari did). Since you seemed to have decided treatment, and there is nothing much you can do about what you have, you should focus on selecting a treatment and surgeon or RO. Having said all that, I think everyone hear completely understands and is sympathetic to where you are at... but you have time and things will get/feel better once once you get past the selection process.

      "Content": "It depends on what they find with the biopsy. If the biopsy is clean then good for your husband and the doc may suggest to retest PSA in 6 months or a year. If the biopsy comes back positive for PC, then there is a whole other discussion based on what is found. I might have missed it, but is your husband getting the biopsy or are you looking to see if he should forego it? Personally, I think he should get the biopsy. It's pretty safe (I think going to the dentist can be riskier), quick and relatively painless. He is same age as I was with similar PSA numbers. It turns out I had PC, but I had more information and could decide what to do about it (treatment or AS). As far as \"over diagnosis and over treatment\"... pardon me, but who cares? There are a bazillion (OK, I am exaggerating) opinions on this topic that generalize a population and I was not part of the general population... this was about me. Your husband needs to make the best decision for him and his situation. BTW, what are your husbands thoughts on this? Good Luck!",

      "Content": "Pratoman... IMHO, you are over analyzing (though must of us probably have done the same). Folks go to JH for the exact reason you did and you got GOOD news. As far as you now know, you are a 3 core G6... those are the current facts. The last person most folks would question is Epstein. If you go surgery, then there is a good chance the doctor will want to do his own read of the slides (Tewari did). Since you seemed to have decided treatment, and there is nothing much you can do about what you have, you should focus on selecting a treatment and surgeon or RO. Having said all that, I think everyone hear completely understands and is sympathetic to where you are at... but you have time and things will get/feel better once once you get past the selection process. Good Luck!",

      "Content": "Excellent post Walnut... but I tend to think of it as pretty simple, not complicated. The Pelvic Floor Muscle is just that, a muscle... just like any other muscle it needs exercise. The more you exercise it, the stronger it will become and it's endurance will increase. More importantly you will get muscle memory. Muscle memory is not stored in your muscle, but in your brain (motor learning). It allows for involuntary muscle reaction to known situations. Based on my research, the jury is out on \"over training\" this muscle. Since the important part is muscle memory, the more training you do the more likely it is to take place. Now, having said that. If you want to strengthen the muscle then you need to train it hard and then let it rest. Like any other muscle, the strength and size happens during these periods of rest. So, in this case, you can over exercise. For instance, when I train a muscle group I lift heavy for about 45 minutes. Then I let it rest for 4-5 days before training that muscle group again. Smaller muscles (like the pelvic floor muscle) can be trained more often. Since your urethra passes through the Pelvic Floor Muscle, this muscle have excellent muscle memory, endurance and strength... in that order. This is why Kegel exercises are so important. The number you do helps with endurance and memory. The length you hold them helps with strength. My advice is to group all your exercises that affect this muscle so that you do them all together then rest. Since walking and biking are endurance and longer training periods I would do one or the other after doing Kegels. Do 15 minutes of Kegels and make them very difficult (squeeze as hard as you can for as long as you can). Then skip a day and do it again. I am no doctor but muscle training is a pretty well understood process. All of this, of course, is IMHO.",

      "Content": "As Gman says, get some Lidocaine and also pick up some KY Lube. Put both on the tip of the penis around the catheter (Lidocaine first). I used a q-tip to put the Lidocain on and just dripped the KY on. The Lidocaine will help dull the pain and the KY will help lube the catheter to move in and out. I put it on about 4-5 times a day. Between the two of these, I had no discomfort with the catheter. Also, make sure the tube has enough slack in it for movement so that it is not constantly tugging.",
