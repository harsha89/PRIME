As a reference point from the day my Cathy was removed until just recently, I used 1 small pad in the day that got about 1/2 soaked and 1 pad at night that would usually only have a few dribbles in it and only twice was it soaked, I never had any problems with the sheets getting wet. Now, it has changed for the positive as when I get that weird feeling just before I squirt onto the pad, when I do get that feeling I can stop it about 70% of the time and get to the toilet in time, even if I am in a store or my car for about 10 minutes. So I feel improvement just with the Kegels, again just recently. I hope that helps a little, BTW: what exercises is your Physical Therapist making you do? Once you know what they are, can't you just do them at home? Al Get \"weird feeling\" also, feels like I am about to leak however pad is always dry.

      "Content": "Today is exactly 19 weeks post operative for me. For the most part, I can honestly state that I am progressing extremely well in recovery. Never any pain or problems worth mentioning. Incision scars are only noticeable when viewed, if not looking I don't know where they are from feel alone. I had a lot of discomfort with continence first couple of weeks; however, by 8th week was into light day Shields and by 12th week one Shield per day with dry at shower time. Now sleeping in jockeys with a Shield and no leakage at all. Over weekend, got up and immediately started on \"honey-do's\" and didn't think about pad. Unfortunately, ended up wearing same pad from previous night all that day with no drips or dribbles. My biggest issue at this time is ED. Like you, I experienced slight arousal early which didn't last long, but did provide hope. Was taking Cialis and recently switched to Sildenafil and with suggestion from URO purchased a VED for enhanced blood flow. Recently, had intercourse, first about 5 days ago through use of PDE5 combined with VED. I did not climax; however, it was successful enough that wife did! And, believe me it was a great boost to my psyche/ego..! Night before last we decided to help my healing again, took 20mg sildenafil and pumped away. This time, we both climaxed. You don't know what a difference that makes. I know I am not anywhere near healed and nerves are still recovering from trauma but I never have given up. Am I happy with silldenafil and VED? Not entirely but they work and I have hope for much more improvement. Have opened dialogue with URO about using BiMix gel to see where that goes. I just mention this help show that patience is the key along with hope. Don't get frustrated nor give up hope. Take care.",

      "Content": "Today is exactly 19 weeks post operative for me. For the most part, I can honestly state that I am progressing extremely well in recovery. Never any pain or problems worth mentioning. Incision scars are only noticeable when viewed, if not looking I don't know where they are from feel alone. I had a lot of discomfort with continence first couple of weeks; however, by 8th week was into light day Shields and by 12th week one Shield per day with dry at shower time. Now sleeping in jockeys with a Shield and no leakage at all. Over weekend, got up and immediately started on \"honey-do's\" and didn't think about pad. Unfortunately, ended up wearing same pad from previous night all that day with no drips or dribbles. My biggest issue at this time is ED. Like you, I experienced slight arousal early which didn't last long, but did provide hope. Was taking Cialis and recently switched to Sildenafil and with suggestion from URO purchased a VED for enhanced blood flow. Recently, had intercourse, first about 5 days ago through use of PDE5 combined with VED. I did not climax; however, it was successful enough that wife did! And, believe me it was a great boost to my psyche/ego..! Night before last we decided to help my healing again, took 20mg sildenafil and pumped away. This time, we both climaxed. You don't know what a difference that makes. I know I am not anywhere near healed and nerves are still recovering from trauma but I never have given up. Am I happy with silldenafil and VED? Not entirely but they work and I have hope for much more improvement. Have opened dialogue with URO about using BiMix gel to see where that goes. I just mention this help show that patience is the key along with hope. Don't get frustrated nor give up hope. Take care.",

      "Content": "Had first PSA post-op at 6 week point on Sept 19th which came back < .010 ng/mL and had 3 month check yesterday, Nov 01, and it also came back as < .010ng/mL!! Very good news which really made my day. Additionally, on the exact day of 12 weeks post-op I went ALL day with 1 light day pad which stayed completely dry! As support to other comments I have read I noted significant improvement on continence during the 8th week with improvements in control up to this date. Never had issue during night time and now believe I am 99% back in \"control.\" Have appointment with URO next Monday which should be interesting with PSA results and bladder control. Alas, no rise from Wee Willie at this point but haven't given up hope on that at this time. Staying positive - #1 - Cure #2 - Continence #3 - Potency. In that order.....! Best wishes to all and God bless to all. I will be lurking in the background. V/R",

My 8 week post PSA just came back. It's .32ng/mL. Not such good news. Agree. Believe it would have been better to state, \"....adjuvant with HT, as/if necessary.\" While not nearly as educated as most on the forum on PCa issues, involvement of intraductal and SVI, from my prospective seems to make it a good idea to come to terms with the possibility that these treatments could be in my future. Not being negative just \"looking down the road.\" Noted with EPE also; however, it being noted as focal gives me hope that it doesn't become a major player. Into 7th week post-op and basically using one shield/guard a day. Dry at night, new guard in morning and dispose at shower time. Taking 5mg Cialis every other day with fingers crossed. Sorry to see your results, stay strong and positive. Early June, '17, I was hospitalized with both C. Diff and E. Coli, went sepsis. Take care.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by Michael F Hi IS! Not sure why your updated \"Signature\" has not automatically updated across all of your posts?!?! Your Path Report places you an elevated intermediate risk status based on findings of: - Gleason (4+3) with 80% Pattern 4 - Tertiary Pattern 5 - Seminal Vesicle Involvement - PNI = \"extensive\" You can go to the GenomeDX website in plug in your post RP Path Report data and then receive a response http://deciphertest.com/patients/is-...-right-for-me/ I would schedule an appointment with the URO Surgeon to review his/her intraoperative surgical findings & the Path Report findings. Have the MD determine your risk for recurrence. Then ask \"What additional beneficial info or value can/will 'Decipher' provide?' Most importantly you will need to monitor your PSA at regular intervals. Since your risk status is elevated, discuss with your URO Surgeon the need to monitor with an Ultrasensitive PSA (uPSAMethodology. This can detect a clinically significant rising PSA early. In order to compare results, you must have the uPSA analyzed at The Same Lab using The Same uPSA Methodology each time. Please keep The Forum educated by providing your URO Surgeon's suggestions. Good luck! MF Thank you for the followup. Sorry it's taken a while to get back as yesterday I had the catheter removed and was miserable all day. Rough night but managed to keep everything dry. That little dribble is driving me crazy! As does everyone I have been reading and considering options and am kind of settling into what I, uneducated as I am, will discuss with URO. I have to get the formal path followup appointment scheduled as I was scheduled early for RP (08/08/17) as that was his last week prior to his being out for two weeks (wife due). That would have been 3 additional weeks and he didn't want me to wait. That Friday afternoon he called me after following up with pathologist on findings and he wanted me to know. At this time, he mentioned Decipher for additional info in determination of course of action and appointment with RO to begin workup for ART. My thoughts now basically are discussion with URO on specifics of path findings/report, get scheduled for visit with RO (with whom I have already discussed my case and he had accepted me for RT(VMAT)/brachytherapy/ADT) prior to surgery decision, wait until @ 6 weeks after surgery for initial post PSA blood draw. Hopefully, I can use a few more weeks for urinary rehabilitation. I believe at this time regardless of PSA that I am strongly leaning towards ART with hopes of avoiding ADT. With the SVI, believe hitting area with ART in near term is better than waiting to commence SRT if needed. Does this seem logical?",

      "Content": "Find myself in the same situation as review of my signature will indicate. I requested uPSA from the on-set in order to identify any activity at an early stage with intent of hitting it early and not wait for the .2 standard. I was fortunate to go 9 months with undetectable (<.010) readings,then somewhere between 9 and 12 months I presented with detectable. Even at extremely low levels, I have been told that I present with an example case of BCR. The initial undetectable months lead to ruling out residual matter or other source PSA and the steady rise shows growth. After the initial detectable of .018, I requested monthly checks in order obtain data points for PSA activity. The subsequent readings (.021, .028 and .031) provided the necessary data to drive action. My feelings were and are that if/when I hit the magical .03 level I would \"pull the trigger\" on SRT. With my pathology I view it as being unreasonable to wait and would be going against the very reason for having uPSAs. I had meeting with both my URO and RO with both agreeing RT and that the decision of ADT was my call to make. I just met with them for their input to see how it matched with my thoughts. I had already decided on 6 months ADT (Firmagon) and RT. My thoughts on ADT were exactly as yours, 6 months now or \"what if\" scenario and years of ADT if RT alone did not achieve success. Yes, even though if tested using a standard PSA I would still be <.1, I am still proceeding with SRT as that's what the uPSA was for. Advance identification of BCR and to hit it hard at around .03. I am scheduled for initial dose of Firmagon on December 7th, and will be meeting with RO to discuss my treatment plan and schedule simulation. RO stated treatment would be using IMRT. I contacted my URO office today and requested they submit order for one more uPSA with testosterone measurement to establish a baseline data point so plan on blood draw on Wednesday with Firmagon injections on Friday. Requested Friday in order to give myself the weekend, if needed, to stabilize physical well-being. Best wishes to all.",

      "Content": "Jeff, your report is very similar to mine with exception being I was downgraded from 4 + 5 to 4 + 3 with overall involvement of 25 percent. Also, \"hit\" with SVI (left) and EPE (focal); however, also have clear margins. I had thoughts of possible ART due to T3b and discussed issue with URO about meeting with RO and at this point we are \"holding\" further action as I have had both a 6 week and 3 month post-op PSA with both < .010 and my 6 month test is in 2 weeks, so waiting those results. Like you, I am weighing everything very closely and will proceed to ART if necessary. As far as continence, just shy of 6 months and I would rate myself 99.9 percent continent. Take care.",

Regardless of post-op PSA believe I am visiting with RO in very near future. Have RO in mind as met with him prior to final decision to go with RALP. Keep posting on status. Regards",

      "Content": "RALP 08/08. Catheter out 08/21. When removed inserted 120cc fluid, voided 175cc, urine no blood. Other than incontinence no urinary issues. Started Cialis (5mg) 09/10 every other day, have taken prior for BPH with no SEs noted. Shortly after beginning for rehab noted funny tingly feeling in penis then began to note a very light pinkish tint to urine. Last night, experienced an episode of nocturnal emission or more commonly known as a \"wet dream\" obviously without fluid. At least my memory of such things isn't too foggy as it was as I remember prior to surgery sensations and all. I awoke immediately afterward as was usual, \"Wee Wille\" wasn't intercourse hard there was an obvious half staff. This morning I noted more of a reddish tint to urine and later noted darker. Worked outside (light) and drank plenty of water so it seems now urine is back to normal. Question if anyone has experienced this sort of issue while healing. My hope is \"something\" is at least trying to function and that this is a good sign. Additionally, received Decipher results which scored me as being an \"Avg Risk\" with risk at RP - Percent Likelihood 5-Year Metastasis 7.8% 10-Year Prostate Cancer Specific Mortality 7.1% Scheduled for 6 week post-op PSA draw this Wednesday, then another 6 weeks following initial and one immediately prior to 3 month doctor visit in December. Keeping fingers crossed. God Bless to all brothers and sisters..!",
