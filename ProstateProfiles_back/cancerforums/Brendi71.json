    "Content": "My husband was diagnosed with aggressive prostate cancer in Dec of 2016 (he was 5. He had his prostate and lymphnoids out. His PSA never went to 0 the lowest it went was .03 and has been going back up, in Jan. Of this year he started radiation everyday for two months and hormone therapy. His PSA was .09 before he started radiation and after radiation it was at .06 which the doc said to wait another three months as testing PSA right after radiation it does not always read right. Doc also said when we go back in June he may not do the last hormone shot depending on his PSA. Not sure how to take that if hormone therapy is supposed to help it why would the doc not want him to continue with it? Doc also says there are many other options still left and that we should not worry to much. What is left if none of the three options above worked? When they removed husband prostate they said that the cancer had gone above the margins and there was something else I can\u0092t remember but that was part of the reason to do hormone therapy and radiation. Any advice on what we should expect to possibly come next would be great help to us we just want a heads up and some time to do some research to see what the best next plan will be. Thanks for any help anyone can give me.",
