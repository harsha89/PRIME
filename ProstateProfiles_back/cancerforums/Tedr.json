I read an article recently (not online) that was prepared 4 years ago and it indicates this test has promise for diagnosing cancer or at least supporting PSA tests and DREs in identifying the need for a biopsy. Has anyone done any research on this? I have just started looking into this and so far I'm not finding a lot. I'll keep trying, but maybe someone here is way ahead of me on this.",

      "Content": "I have not taken either of these, but my urologist prescribed Flomax. I am going to give Naka Prostate a try first. It is compound of saw palmetto and other natural bits that are reputed to be effective. I doubt the natural product will work. The Mayo clinic site says there was a study that showed saw palmetto was helpful, and a later study that showed it was no more effective than a placebo. I consider my urinary problems to be mild so I'm ok with experimenting with saw palmetto. If there is no improvement I can always get Flomax. My wife is a great believer in natural remedies and she always wants me to try natural products before prescription medications. This time I am willing to follow her advice because for me there isn't much risk at this point. Like you I am interested in what others might have to say from their experiences.",

I am very impressed by the willingness of forum members to give advice and the level of knowledge being shared. I have had quite a few PSA results over the years which are listed below.

      "Content": "Thanks for those speedy responses. In response to Flkjr, I do have some urinary issues. There are times - infrequently - when I have trouble starting. My stream is not very strong at the best of times. I get up once in the night almost every night. I did a test at my recent appointment with the Uro and I had a slow flow, stops and starts and I did not empty my bladder very well. Never any pain or bleeding. He prescribed Flomax. No problems with ED. To Jim125, I'm a Canadian citizen so Obamacare is not an issue. I'm lucky to have very comprehensive health care, but I'm not so lucky to have to pay the high taxes associated with it. But right now I'm happy about the health care side of that equation. I'm still curious about how many biopsies a person can safely have. I'll wait a day or two before deciding what to do. There may be other opinions to consider, then I'll weigh everything and make a decision. I'll let you know what I decide. All of the sage advice so far is very much appreciated.",
