      "Content": "Thank you all. There will be many questions in the future, first is did any of you change your diet/lifestyle in response to your diagnosis? I don't smoke or drink much. I'm 25 lbs overweight and not an athlete. Stress or other illness will initiate my prostitis flares ups. This one I'm in now has gone on since July 2014. I have asked for years if removing the organ is an option to relieve the constant burning I have. Was always advised against that as a first option. Opinions please. Is there general agreement on bringing an oncologist in at this point in my journey or is that premature?",

      "Content": "A question. I had one of the serious side effects of ED drug therapy. They then suggested and I bought a 15 day supply of sildenafil to give it a try. My question, is there any chance that life will return to my mid section naturally or is chemical Intervention the only option. The hearing problem came on suddenly in the 4th week on Cialis and I'm not sure I want to revisit that or chance developing vision problems. Is everyone on a ED med post surgery? Thanks",
