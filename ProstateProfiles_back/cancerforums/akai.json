I was diagnosed with 3+3 in August 2012, tracking PSA religiously, every three to four months at two different places to avoid false readings. One Prolaris Test, low risk of 2%. Two Oncotype DX tests, low risk. Two subsequent biopsied from first Bx showed G6s. PSA gradually rose from 3.2 to 5.3, brought that up with my uro but my uro just said PSA was not the best indication. Last Bx on 05/05/2017, one G9, one G8, one G7, two G6s. I think the first three biopsied missed the G9, genomic tests gave me false sense of security, they are only as good as the samples tested. All biopsies were T3MRI fused, two at USC and two at UCLA. MRI never picked up this G9 or G8 spots. I thought that the 3TMRI would pick up aggressive type of PCa but apparently not. The G9 spot was from the systematic 12 samples not from the targeted spots pointed by the MRI.",

I was diagnosed with 3+3 in August 2012, tracking PSA religiously, every three to four months at two different places to avoid false readings. One Prolaris Test, low risk of 2%. Two Oncotype DX tests, low risk. Two subsequent biopsied from first Bx showed G6s. PSA gradually rose from 3.2 to 5.3, brought that up with my uro but my uro just said PSA was not the best indication. Last Bx on 05/05/2017, one G9, one G8, one G7, two G6s. I think the first three biopsied missed the G9, genomic tests gave me false sense of security, they are only as good as the samples tested. All biopsies were T3MRI fused, two at USC and two at UCLA. MRI never picked up this G9 or G8 spots. I thought that the 3TMRI would pick up aggressive type of PCa but apparently not. The G9 spot was from the systematic 12 samples not from the targeted spots pointed by the MRI.",

So I copy-pasted the body of text into akai's post so that the main message can still get through. --Chuck Myriad Matters Blog Back to Blog Medicare Covers Prolaris Genetic Test for Low-Risk Prostate Cancer Mark Capone Portrait 6.2.15 WebAugust 13, 2015 On August 13, 2015, Medicare approved coverage of the Prolaris® test for men diagnosed with low-risk and very low-risk prostate cancer. The decision is the culmination of years of scientific discovery, research and collaboration, and is an enormous step in improving patient care. Every day, 630 men in the United States are diagnosed with prostate cancer, and 82 die from the disease. Daunting statistics like these underscore the tremendous need for better tools to fight this deadly cancer. We know that most prostate cancers are slow growing; however, some grow quickly. The challenge always has been telling aggressive from nonaggressive cancer. Prior to the genomics revolution, and for the last 50 years, physicians largely relied on the Gleason score, clinical grade and, after its development, PSA to evaluate the prognosis of men with prostate cancer. A Gleason score is determined based upon how cancer cells look under a microscope \u2013 the higher the score, the worse the prognosis. Although clinically useful, the Gleason score is subjective and imperfect. Fast forward to today. [part of content, with graphic, removed] Prolaris is the first prognostic test to determine the aggressiveness of prostate cancer and has been studied in more than 10 clinical studies with thousands of patients. The test measures the activity level of 46 genes and provides physicians with precise objective information that is based on the tumor\u2019s genetic profile. Simply put, men with a low Prolaris score have a low risk of disease progression and may be candidates for active surveillance, while those with a high score are at higher risk and may benefit from additional therapy. The Prolaris test already is changing the equation in the fight against prostate cancer. Any physician who has treated prostate cancer knows all too well the personal and financial cost of undertreating an aggressive cancer or overtreating a slow growing, indolent cancer. More work needs to be done to reduce the death toll from prostate cancer, but Medicare\u2019s positive decision will help ensure that Medicare patients who need a Prolaris test will have access.

      "Content": "Hi: I think you already are aware that high PSA score does not mean you have cancer. That said, 3.35 at 53 yrs old is a bit high, hopefully it was caused by the enlarged prostate. There are other tests such as PCA3 that is more cancer specific than PSA. If you are not comfortable with your Uro you should find another one. Biopsy, while extremely uncomfortable, is not that painful. You may not want to travel right after biopsy as you will see blood in your urine, stool, and semen that may freak you out. Find the best care possible, do not compromise, best of luck. Keep us posted. Ask more questions if you need to.",

      "Content": "Hi Davis, ask your uro to send you a copy of the result. Looking at my copy, -1.5 is almost the lowest score, the graph shows -1.7 as the lowest. Your report will have the interpretation of your score. I think pretty much your mortality risk of 10 years, if managed conservatively, is close to 0%. Not sure what managed conservatively means. My score was -0.1 which gives me the mortality risk of 2%. I was Dxed in 2012 with 3 out of 14 samples, all G6, second Bx showed 1 sample out of 15 at G6. Still on AS. The Prolaris test gave me a little peace of mind while still on AS.",

This is what I am doing for myself. I have done Prolaris Test which classified my PCa as not aggressive. The limitation of the Prolaris test is that the result is based on the samples provided, so if the Bx missed the higher grade PCa, then the result may be misleading.",

      "Content": "I am G9 but no met (localized) , my MO started me with Casodex and Eligard in June, then switched from Casodex to Zytiga with Prednisone in July, still with Eligard. Initially my insurance company denied the coverage of Zytiga but my MO appealed. I am neither Castrate Resistance nor Met. Casodex + Eligard was working, my PSA went from 5.3 to 2.54, so it was working, my PSA went down 0.25 one month into Zytiga (it might have been 0.25 anyway with Casodex but will never know now). Almost two months into Zytiga, my PSA was down to 0.05 on 08/28, two days before my HDRBT. I think one of the studies concluded that a combination therapy of ADT plus Abiraterone provided overall significant survival in men with locally advanced or Metastatic prostate cancer. My MO participated in one of the two Zytiga studies. http://www.practiceupdate.com/journa...0&lid=10332481 On Wednesday I completed a single HDBRT at UCLA as a boost to IMRT which is coming up soon. My MO never mentioned that Zytiga is not safe for radiation. I will probably start IMRT in about two to three weeks. Hope this help.",
