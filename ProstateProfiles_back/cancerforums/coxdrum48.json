Recheck with Surgeon 7/3/18 and he wants to refer me to medical and radiation oncologist. I am hesitant to rush to see them. I'm starting a new job Tuesday and I want to settle in before I commit to a bunch of new treatments. I'm also a little tired of bouncing around the medical establishment. I don't think I want Hormone Therapy, I'll do radiation but there are no guarantees as we all know. Any harm in waiting a while? Can anyone think of other options? Thanks, Lantz",

I've got a couple months of Hormone Therapy and then 8 weeks, 40 radiation treatments to look forward to. I have to keep working. I don't want work to know about it. I'm a contractor. I hear you can get tired, fatigued after starting radiation. I guess I'll have to drive and hour 15 to work, work 9 hours, hour and 15 home then radiation. Does anyone have any tips for dealing with the fatigue? I'm tired already, without the radiation but I do have every other Friday off. I've read about provigil that people take to deal with daytime tiredness from \"shift work\". It's not an amphetamine but \"promotes wakefulness\". Do Drs prescribe anything like this to combat the tiredness? Does anybody have any advice along this line. I'm a little worried about falling asleep while I'm driving. I don't have shortterm disability .I'm on my wife's insurance since Bristol-Myers Squibb laid me off for getting too old. Ironic, the big cancer drug company. Thanks, Lantz",
