      "Content": "Thanks ya'll for the welcome. Just to answer what was asked, I am 43 (DOB: 9/1972) and under AS I am (now) just being managed with my Urologist with repeated 6-month PSAs and annual biopsies. Definitely not the group I hear lots of folks volunteering for (grin), but I know that I'm not alone and that in itself makes it manageable. Glad to be here. - TJ",

      "Content": "Michael, your sense of humor is noted and highly applauded my friend. I am just outside Montgomery, AL and my urologist was trained at UAB in Birmingham so I feel very fortunate to have him here. As you guys all know, it's the anxiety and watchful waiting that can definitely drive you crazy. I had an appt today and they will re-do the biopsies (which were 12 cores) on Feb 19. More to follow!",

      "Content": "Welcome to the club (although it's not one that people are wishing they were in). I too have a Gleason of 6 (I'm a little younger than you), and I am participating in active surveillance at this time. So far, 18 months post diagnosis, we are holding the same and there has been no change anything. If you are not ready to have the surgery, then by all means don't. Having very honest conversations with your urologist are the most helpful in this area - and you NEED to ensure you are regularly staying on top of it. With a Gleason score that you have I would definitely recommend waiting on the surgery for now and of course repeat your PSA and biopsy every 12-18 months. And to be an encouragement, my urologist told me, \"You will die with this, but certainly not from it. Most men find out they had Prostate cancer in their autopsy report.\" Bottom line: You (we) have cancer, no doubt about it ... but if you are staying on it like white on rice it is NOT the end of life ... merely a different way of living.
