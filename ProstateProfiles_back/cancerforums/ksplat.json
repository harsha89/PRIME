      "Content": "Hi there, Welcome to the Cancerforum. I pray there will be a reply to your post from someone \"in the know\" regarding your treatment & PC. GOOD ON YOU for being proactive in regard to your illness & treatment. Your tenacity is inspiring to say the least. We often become complacent with regards to what we're \"prescribed\" or \"informed\" by our medical team. We should be asking questions all the time (not only when outcomes \"let us down\") & we should be doing our own research for our own benefit. I know you will receive lots of support on this forum, it's an excellent resource for Cancer in all it's forms. Thankyou for sharing your experience. God bless & my best wishes. Cheers, Aussie Angie.",
