      "Content": "It was the first urologist rushing the biopsy. Interesting point about stressing my body - I will jog 3+ miles every other day. Forgot to mention that - I am very much physically active. As of late I have not felt run down. In fact less run down. And that is probably due to diet changes for the better. But I have some leg and back issues, coupled with my first uro's scare, that make for anxiety. But 3 other doctors, two GP's and my new uro do not think I have to worry. The time spans for the PSA's were 8.4 in October, 8.4 in November, 7.4 in January.",

      "Content": "Thanks for the welcome! My age is 56 (two months ago). Virtually no family cancer history. And my DRE's (two of them) showed a prostate of normal size with no abnormalities. My first two PSA were a little over 8 but then a subsequent PSA was a little over 7. My new urologist recommends to wait til May with another PSA. If this new urologist then recommends a biopsy, I will get it. I have some sort of testicular issue that my urologist seems to think might be contributing to the PSA reading.",

      "Content": "I don't yet officially have cancer, but I was told recently by a urologist that I have a 60% chance of having prostate cancer based on PSA tests, so I have spent some time being scared silly as of late. I am considering getting a biopsy soon. Going through just a tiny bit of the trauma, I emphasize with you, especially if you have family that depends on you. If you wish for me to pray for you personally, reply here or send me a private message.",
