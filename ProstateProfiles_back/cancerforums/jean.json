      "Content": "A loved one says his prostate cancer (treated with radiation 4 years ago and now age 7 has spread to his backbone. This was over a year ago. Not sure he is telling the truth as he has been saying he doesn't have long to live but been saying this for 5 years. Says he's never asked doctor about life expectancy. Does this make sense? What is life expectancy when yearate cancer shows up in bones? Don't know where to start looking for info----are we talking one year or 20 years?",

      "Content": "Hi again, I started this topic and thanks for answer about how hard it is to predict how much time a person has left on earth. What does it mean when the patient is getting Zometa infusion once a month for two years? Is this still experimental to give to prostate cancer patients who have cancer metastisized to the backbone? Is it used to prevent metastesis? Also received a Lupron shot and hadn't had one of those for a while, what does this mean? Also I wouldn't mind knowing the best place to find the answers to these questions, I keep ending up reading an advertisement or a drug company site which I'm skeptical of the information since they want everyone to use their drug of course.......",
