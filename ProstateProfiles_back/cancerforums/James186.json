      "Content": "Originally Posted by HighlanderCFH Hi James, I'm glad that, at least, your Gleason was a 6, which means you should go on to live your full life expectancy. Are you still doing kegel exercises? If not, give them a try and see if it helps. There is a sticky near the top of this forum that gives the instructions recommended by Mayo Clinic. If you have not been doing them, I would suggest giving them a try (even if they failed in the past) EXACTLY they way Mayo recommends. In the meantime, so you have leakage during the general day away from the bedroom? If so, there are medical procedures that might be able to help. Good luck! Chuck Thanks Chuck.. Yep I'm still doing them and keep convincing myself its ok day or rwo rhen for no reason I just have a pants soaker. No one has said this but when I had the prostectomy things went really bad and they had to rush me back in to do a do over and a bunch of transfusions. One of the by products was some of the clips fell out and got stuck in the bladder (Which btw hurts like heck) Anyway I think my bladder and associated plumbing just took an extra major beating and thats why the kegels aren't doing the trick. Abd the longer it goes the less likely I see it being resolved with Kegals. I saw my MRI and it looks like a grenade went off. So - my Urology pdoc and I talked about starting out this way. She knows I'm not keen on jumping back on the Urodynamics chair unless there is some serious danger of something serious like bladder cancer etc. She ran the testing for that pre op and the tiny test cath plugged me up so bad thay they had to pump everything out and fit me for catheters that used several times a day. My GDoc thought it must have been horrible but being unable to void is must worse. I maybe more squeamish about pads and leakage during sexual climax. The pads just spell weird. A former significant other just flihhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh hhhhhg as hell. I count my lucky stars that I don't need adult diapers and that the small pads seem to be ok or pretty close. Spinging a leak during sex is not make our somewhat messed up sex life better. I did some reading about the sling. It seems simple enough. I don'thave any room for the patient operated devive even if I wasted one.",

      "Content": "Its been two years since my Radical and I still have Climacturia (Today is the first day I knew it had a name) I guess the embarrassment factor is large with me so its not helped with our sex life. I also retain urine so voiding before getting intimate doesn't really do the trick. I've done double voiding (or more) and can feel emptied out zip up and leak right away or later. Anyhow I've been doing kegels until I'm cross eyed. I saw a urologist for the first time in quite some time and brought up this embarrassing stuff. I did the urine test (came out good - no uti or bladder infection) and they did the sonar thing to see how much was left in the bladder. I can't remember the number but it wasn't huge but it was significant. So we had a good conversation on what to do. Since it seems like I can't quite empty the tank I was sent home with some catheters and a months worth of a drug (Which unfortunately is not on my formulary) The cath before sex scheme worked fine and I didn't bother to wear a pad and surprise! No leakage. The thought of Cathing again was pretty unappealing but I will admit its nothing like it was when I was trying to thread a coude' past a cancer bloated prostate. I now know that I'm dealing with Climacturia but I'm not sure what the combo of random what just happened leakage and retention problems is called or what if anything is out there (thats on my crappy formulary) that might help with that combo. From memory my gleason score was 3+3 cancer confined to prostate with negative margins *yeah! PSAs since then have been zilch. **yeah!!",

      "Content": "Hormone treatment messes up your sex drive at least in my complicated experience. ED is at the core a problem in getting blood into and staying in the corpora and while drugs work in some cases they can be damned expensive. Injections can also work but you may experience erections that last a little (lot) longer then you want and finding the dose that does a perfect job? VEDs are something that aren't mentioned as much but they have a high rate of success and are (I think) worth giving a try. If all else fails (Or is too much of a pain in the arse) you can check out implant surgery. It really works when all else fails so knowing that it exists should be a reason to not loose hope. Anyway - don't let it depress you. And for SURE don't think its some failure of yours. Too many men think it signals a lack of being \"man enough\" or whatever which is a bunch of bunk. Best wishes!",
