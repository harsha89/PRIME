      "Content": "Thanks Highlander and thanks for posting the calcification info 1953MEB. That is encouraging to me. Hoping that the dense calcifications in my prostate could be part of the rise in my PSA and not an indicator if spreading cancer. Totally went blank at the doctors office today and forgot to ask about the calcification. My wife went with me and she forgot too. My prostate is really acting up now...severe pain this morning and constant but not as severe pain right now. My urologist previously told me that cancer is not the cause of those symptoms so I'm thinking I have an infection or maybe just a flare up. If my next PSA is high again.....I will have the biopsy and my doctor talked about radiation as opposed to surgery....if needed at all. This site is a great source of information and I'm so grateful I can read the information here. Dense calcification in otherwise unremarkable CT scan in December of 2016 12 core biopsy in February 2017 2 cores positive, both 3+3=6 (one 50% and one 5%) 1 core suspicious PSA Oct 2016 = 6.23 PSA Nov 2016 = 5.9 PSA April 2017 = 7.2 PSA July 2017 = ? PSA September 2017 = 6.8 PSA Nov 2017 = 8.7 (Having urinary symptoms)",

      "Content": "The prostate stones are of interest to me. My CT scan showed dense calcification in my prostate. Could this make your PSA higher than normal? My PSA is now 8.7. My biopsy showed 2 cores positive for cancer and one suspicious. I am doing AS but as of today my urologist wants another biopsy. I had the original biopsy in February of his year (2017). I wondered about the prostate stones but did not ask my doctor.",

I am going to see him soon and talk about the PSA and possible second biopsy. I have other issues that make it hard for me to get out of the house. I will also ask about the genetic testing and other suggestions. The two lesions in my bladder were biopsied and came back as negative for cancer.

Family doctor prescribed Cipro and I am 2 days into taking it with no change in symptoms. I've read that results from radiation and surgery are basically equal, so why do people choose one over the other? Could the increase in PSA be just because I have a large prostate and does Pca enlarge the prostate? It definitely feels enlarged and uncomfortable even sitting on a hard surface. I hated the biopsy but I had a bladder biopsy at the same time for two suspicious places in my bladder. No cancer was found in bladder. Based on my numbers, what would YOU do?",
