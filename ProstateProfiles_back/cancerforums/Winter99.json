      "Content": "I'm going on my 1st post-op date this Friday night. Also my 1st date in 20 years . My ex filed for divorce about the time I was diagnosed and then it was finalized about 1 year ago. Had the operation 8 months ago. Operation went well and my recovery seemed quick. No incontinence problems after about 2 months. Started having occasional full erections at about 3 months while taking Cialis (2.5 mg/2 days) However. . .I have noticed that my erections (without the Cialis) are certainly not as firm and don't last very long. Getting curious, I tried a small dose of the sildenafil and wasn't thrilled with the results (don't have prescription with me but it says 1-5 pills, I took 1). I was not happy with the results of one pill and am a bit worried. I say 1st date, but really this is someone with whom I've had a friendship and we are ramping it up. We came to this conclusion and then we took turns travelling out of town for two weeks with finally being in the same place this weekend. (we actually have 2nd +3rd dates planned to ) So we're moving a bit quick and I think that's ok. She's good people and I'm not completely afraid of talking about it to her, but I'm still in a bit of a panic - maybe unfounded. Any advice here on how to handle sex with a new partner with the possible ED? Again, she should be understanding - we've discussed some aspects of the surgery although not ED specifically. I didn't notice much 'extra' from the one pill - will the max dosage make big difference? Does it make any sense at all to try a bigger dosage in the next couple of days just to know what to expect... or just leave it alone? In the past I never saw much difference with small amounts of alcohol . .does drinking one or two beers to take the edge off make any sense? Any suggestions for success? (Honestly, I do realize I'm in a bit of a panic that I need to talk through with her and perhaps a the therapist from the hospital . . still wanting some thoughts though) Thanks, R",

      "Content": "Got an MRI and also went to get a 2nd opinion on the cancer. MRI basically notes a 2.2 cm lesion (relevant text at the bottom of this message) 2nd doctor had different opinon on treatment. 1st doctor leans towards Active Survelience and after the MRI wants to do a 3rd biopsy targetting the suspect area to verify the gleason index of 7. 2nd Dr just wants to cut it out. 2nd Dr. definetly knows how to gain confidence - Offered without asking that he has 1800 of the surgeries under his belt and gave me a list of former patients and phone numbers. I don't know the experience of the 1st dr - he's younger, but not too fresh. Geographically the 2nd dr is in ann arbor while the first is local in Grand Rapids. Trying to figure out if the AS is worth it. If I'm delaying only a few years, I don't see the point. If it's 10 or more, maybe it makes sense. I just finalized a divorce last month and don't have any immediate urges to start a new relationship (kinda bitter right now . . I'll get over it though) so just getting it over with might make good sense. Thoughts? Does anyone have experience with longerterm AS when younger (50)? MRI Findings The prostate gland measures 4.2 cm transverse x 3.6 cm AP x 3.9 cm craniocaudal. Calculated gland volume: 31 mL Suspicious prostatic lesions for cancer: A 2.2 cm lesion is seen in the anterior one half of the gland with the epicenter in the right mid transition zone. The lesion is hypointense on the T2-weighted images, markedly hypointense on the ADC images, and markedly hyperintense on the high B value diffusion-weighted images. This lesion has a PIRADS assessment of 5. The lesion extends to the midline. The lesion also involves a small portion of the right peripheral zone of the mid gland at the10 o'clock position. The lesion also extends into the apex transition zone. No other suspicious lesion is seen. Prostatic capsule: The above-mentioned 2.2 cm suspicious lesion in the anterior one half of the gland does involve the capsule, but no gross extracapsular extension is seen. Neurovascular bundles: No evidence for involvement by prostate cancer. Seminal vesicles: No evidence of involvement by prostate cancer. Adenopathy: None Urinary bladder: No evidence of involvement by prostate cancer. Pelvic bones: No bone metastasis is seen. IMPRESSION: A 2.2 cm lesion is seen in the anterior one half of the prostate gland and has a PIRADS assessment is 5. No other lesion which is suspicious for clinically significant prostate cancer is seen. PI-RADS v2 Assessment Categories PIRADS 1 -- Very low (clinically significant cancer is highly unlikely to be present) PIRADS 2 -- Low (clinically significant cancer is unlikely to be present) PIRADS 3 -- Intermediate (the presence of clinically significant cancer is equivocal) PIRADS 4 -- High (clinically significant cancer is likely to be present) PIRADS 5 -- Very high (clinically significant cancer is highly likely to be present)",

MRI basically notes a 2.2 cm lesion (relevant text at the bottom of this message) 2nd doctor had different opinon on treatment. 1st doctor leans towards Active Survelience and after the MRI wants to do a 3rd biopsy targetting the suspect area to verify the gleason index of 7. 2nd Dr just wants to cut it out. 2nd Dr. definetly knows how to gain confidence - Offered without asking that he has 1800 of the surgeries under his belt and gave me a list of former patients and phone numbers.

      "Content": "Had that problem too. Just a couple days after the 1st was removed. The pain was awful and ended up going into the ER since my Urologist was 2.5 hours away. Mine was due to clotting. Had to flush the new cath a couple times because of clogging (again..pretty painful when there was no flow)",

      "Content": "No - the insurance didn't pay. The pump cost a bit over $100 as I recall. I also got a Prelude device for around $60. For me the Prelude worked ok for it's purpose (It's a therapy device, not a aide for intercourse so it's not for achieving full erection) I found the pump difficult to use and only tried it a couple times (probably just me, because I know it worked for others)",
