      "Content": "Thank you. I've been lurking, reading posts for about a week now and the folks on this board seem very supportive. Which is fantastic! I'm learning all kind of new words/phrases that I never wanted to know anything about. I'm concerned about Dad's high Gleason score and hope that the cancer was caught before it has a chance to spread. From what I've been reading, the low PSA when you have a high Gleason score can be misleading. Meaning, that ordinarily a low PSA would indicate that the cancer hasn't progressed much but sometimes if the person has a high Gleason, it just means that the cells aren't producing as much PSA because they're so abnormal. Here's hoping for the best...I guess we'll know whether or not it's spread once the results from his scans come back next week. I'm also concerned about any problems he may have after the surgery - especially if the doctor isn't confident that the nerves can be spared. But I suppose we have to just take this one step at a time...",

      "Content": "Hi All, I'm new here and it totally sucks My Dad (age fifty-eight) recently went for a biopsy. His PSA is 4.5 8 of 12 samples are positive for cancer Gleason score is 9. Not good news. Right now we're waiting for CT and bone scans to verify the cancer hasn't spread. That's my current worry. Apparently, prostate cancer tends to spread to bones first. I'm hoping and praying that it's contained to the prostate. Initially, with the low PSA the feeling was that the cancer had been caught quickly and wasn't likely to have spread outside the prostate. Then we found out his Gleason score was very high...that makes us all nervous. The doctor has recommended surgery and has already stated that he doesn't believe my Dad's nerves can be spared. Also not good news... Then three months after the surgery he will have 25 radiation treatments. I don't really have any questions right now...just here lurking while I pray for the best.",
