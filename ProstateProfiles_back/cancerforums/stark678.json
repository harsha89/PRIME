I did talk to him today and he said that he recently had an exam (not a biopsy, but one where his doctor physically felt the prostate I believe) and he felt nothing whatsoever. So that is good, but he's suggesting the biopsy scheduled for next week due to the PSA level rising. I wish I knew more as it'd be a bit more helpful! Like I did mention, he has reported no symptoms such as difficulty urinating, back pains, etc.",

      "Content": "Hello! I am new to this forum and am hoping for additional knowledge and possibly peace of mind. My dad (age 57) has a PSA that rose from 2.something (I cannot remember the exact number) to 6.9 in the past three years. I am reading a lot about PSA velocity being not only a good indicator of Prostate Cancer, but also of the aggressiveness. As far as we know, he is showing no symptoms whatsoever. He has a biopsy scheduled in one week to (hopefully) rule out cancer. From what I've researched, high PSA can be mean many other outcomes than cancer, with infections being the more likely reason. However, I have also read that a rise in 2.0 per year is of high velocity and is more likely to be cancer, whereas infections tend to cause a drastic rise over just weeks or months. I'm hoping for some insight on all of this information. What's true and what isn't true. What to expect. Testimonials. Etc. Thanks in advance!",

      "Content": "UPDATE: So we received both good and bad news from my dad's biopsy. The bad is that there is cancer. The good news is that it's only in about 25% of the prostate so it's small, confined within the prostate and has not spread. On Wednesday we will find out my dad's Gleason score and what actions the doctor recommends taking. What is everyone else's experience with this? My dad was first told about some sort of pellet that is inserted that releases radiation and is worried about surgery. From what I've always understood, although invasive, surgically removing the cancer has the best rates of survival. Thoughts? Thanks again!",
