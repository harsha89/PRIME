    "Content": "My husband was diagnosed in September 2015. Surgery was not an option. He had radiation and casodex and has now been on Lupron shots every 4 months. Been doing really good until recently. Got a shot in May. His PSA and testosterone levels barely readable. But in the last couple of weeks he has become extremely tired and says he very achy. He is working but it is a desk job. He comes home and is falling asleep by 7:30ish. I am worried. Should he get his levels rechecked",
