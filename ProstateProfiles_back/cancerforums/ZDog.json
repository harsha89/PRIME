      "Content": "At my recent one-year post surgery visit to the surgeon, the doctor noted only the small scar above my belly button was visible. The other small incisions from my Da Vinci surgery had faded. My 3+4 cancer seems to be gone too since my PSA remains undetectable. Yet, the whole experience does leave some invisible scars doctors can't readily see. A year out, you don't think about your prostate cancer quite as much as you do in the months around diagnosis and treatment, but there are reminders: peeing is as quick as when you were a kid now (a nice side effect!), rare occasional leakage occurs for me when lifting or running long distances, and worst of all, I was among a minority of guys who developed some Peyronies about six months after surgery. There are arguments about whether that developed as a result of using Trimix injections post-surgery (no longer using Trimix) or if something about prostatectomy surgery triggers Peyronies in guys who would've gotten it eventually. Either way, it is what it is. I'm glad to be alive and healthy. Something other than Prostate Cancer is probably going to have to do me in some day. My grandfather died of Prostate Cancer and my father in his late 70s is doing nicely treating his with hormone treatments after his prostate cancer surgery years ago. All in all, I feel pretty lucky a year after surgery!",

      "Content": "As Paul Harvey used to say, \"And now you know the rest of the story.\" I just got my PSA done again today --- this time at Memorial Sloan Kettering where I had done all my post-prostatectomy PSA tests until the one a couple of weeks ago that came out higher than undetectable .1 ng/mL. The good news is that MSKCC's lab shows my PSA is actually <.05 ng/mL and I remain in the zero club. My first mistake was changing labs. My primary care doc had me go to Quest Diagnostics to have my PSA tested along with other routine blood work. The second issue was my primary care doc ordered a Total PSA test, but (based on my subsequent investigation online) Quest Diagnostics evidently also offers at least a couple of high sensitivity PSA tests for post-prostatectomy folks, but that's not what my primary care doc ordered. The third issue is Quest Diagnostic's Total PSA results are not necessarily reported as <.1, when there should be a less than sign. (I found a discussion about inconsistency of Quest Diagnostics reporting Total PSA with a less than sign on another forum.) Important takeaways: always get your post-prostatectomy PSA tests from the same lab if you can, be sure it's the right version of PSA test, and watch out for possible omitted less than signs on reported results from certain labs. Whew!",

      "Content": "Zak, in February, after years of careful monitoring showing my PSA creeping upward, my urologist said to me, \"if we believe in the PSA it's time to do a biopsy.\" In March I did a biopsy. It was unpleasant but it was done in 8-10 minutes. My biopsy found Gleason 3+4 tumors. I was fortunate that timely surgery removed organ confined disease. Zak, ChemoMan's guidance is exactly right. You are not going to be able to dodge a biopsy before treatment. My advice: just buck up and do it if you suspect PC. It'll be over in 10 minutes, and the data you get can help you make a sound, science-based, medical decision.",

Just \"go with the flow\" and you'll probably find that your bladder starts to hold more as the days pass.

I remember reading posts here months ago suggesting that, after treatment, for some (maybe most) the cancer focus fades and life goes on --- perhaps explaining why some forum participants with excellent outcomes drift away. When I first read that, I couldn't imagine not thinking about my Prostate cancer all the time. Now, I find days go by without really giving it any thought. I still wear a pad just when I'm out running. ED is still a reminder, but Trimix is a reliable (hopefully interim) fix. All in all, a lot better than the outcomes from Prostate cancer that my dad and his dad experienced.",

      "Content": "Finally got into Sloan Kettering today. Multiple plaques identified by ultrasound today are causing the erection discomfort and new mild bend to starboard. Doc says mild pain with erections will disappear with time. Bend is there to stay. Current thinking, he says, is prostatectomy somehow accelerates appearance of plaques in men with genetic predisposition to develop Peyronies. Genetic predisposition is more common in men with Northern European ancestry. Can't say when it would've appeared in my case if I hadn't had Prostate surgery. Mine came six months after prostatectomy.",

      "Content": "My understanding is that urologists are typically guided by the core(s) reflecting the most mutated cells, so, for example, if any core was found to have Gleason 4 mutated cells that were more prevalent than the Gleason 3 cells in that core, urologists would say you have Gleason 7 disease with a 4+3. Other cores with lesser scores are notable, but treatment is guided by the high score finding. Remember, 12 cores still sample only a tiny fraction of your overall prostate tissue. Pick up a copy of Dr. Walsh's book. It's a great reference recommended frequently on this forum.",
