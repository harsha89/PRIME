      "Content": "After waiting 16 excruciating days for the post op pathology to come back, I got the bad news above. Except I don't know how bad it really is . My doctor is recommending 2 years ADT and EBRT no matter what the 6 week PSA turns out to be. Even if it comes back 0.0, he wants to do the Adjunct therapies. I thought if the PSA comes back zero, I could wait on the EBRT and ADT. Now, I don't know what to think. I'm an old guy...just turned 72 and I don't want the radiation and ADT side effects chewing up my last few years. I have researched the heck out of it and I can't seem to find the 10+ year survival rates for my situation. The only other medical condition I have is Inflammatory Bowel Disease. I can only imagine the negative effects the EBRT will have on that. Do I have my head in the sand here? They found no cancer in the 4 abdominal Lymph Nodes or on Bone and CT scans. Am I being over treated? This is such a confounding disease and the doctors will not commit to anything. Color me CONFUSED? Any input appreciated.",

      "Content": "Thanks to all who have responded. I have edited my Signature to reflect that the margins and Lymph Nodes were negative. I have resigned myself to the EBRT and ADT. They are waiting for six weeks for me to heal from the RALP and then regardless what the PSA is, the additional treatments begin. If there is any good news about my condition, it is that I was continent from day 1 after catheter removal. The doc tells me that if I am continent before the EBRT, I should be continent afterwards. I am scrounging for nuggets of good news Again, thanks to all who responded. You pulled me off the bridge.",
