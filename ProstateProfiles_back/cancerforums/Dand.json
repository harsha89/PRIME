      "Content": "LRP surgery went great & PSA has been <0.03 ng/ml since. Had a Inguinal Hernia in 2003 & finally had it repaired September 2016. Because of previous prostate surgery DeVinci Robotic Surgery had to be done. IH surgery went fantastic no meds needed see my post http://www.herniatalk.com/hernia-dis...c-post-op.html. Have not posted on Prostate Forum of over 12 years but good luck to all members- it is always easier after the treatment.",

      "Content": "Let me start off good luck to all forum members & hopefully you will be making or have made a right treatment decision & end up with great results. A summary of my PC trip: 3/15/2003 at age of 60, 1st PSA test PSA 11. 5/15/03 needle Biopsy PSA 10.5 Gleason 6 Much research attending different prostate groups, internet forums. Had many consultations with varied Surgeons, IMRT Radiologists, & Seed Oncologists. 7/23/03 Consultation Dr Peter Scardino at MSK-he did open surgery & was a highly regarded. After attending a lecture with a surgeon who did DaVinci Robotic Surgery I asked Dr Peter Scardino about the procedure. He let me know that I would be a good candidate for LRP & has just put a surgeon into his MSK department who does the procedure. I met with Dr Guillonneau a French surgeon who was a pioneer in the LRP procedure & became part of the MSK staff. Decided to have surgery with him. Got a telephone call & was asked if I would be willing to have my surgery done & have it streamed live to a urological conference happening in Canada. I agreed & surgery was done on Sunday, 9/21/03. Left with a catheter... recovery was uneventful & the rest is history. Been having Micro PSA tests since which have been today at the low ends of the test range <0.02 ng/ml. It certainly been a lot easier on this side of the operation. After 13 years I had to have surgery done on a inguinal hernia that I had prior to the prostate surgery & grew to a large size. Because of the LRP it had to be done either open or Robotically... laparoscopic was not & option. I found a great surgeon expert with DaVinci Robot. Had fantastic results was able to work the same day & did not have to take any pain meds... no more hernia. Did not know about this forum in 2003 & now are on the forum because of my wife's cancer. My advice do your research & what ever treatment you select make sure to use the best Doctor you can find. Note: Profile is my wife's not mine",

      "Content": "Rob her Chemo treatment did not require a port as it was given at the hospital intravenously in a vein in her arm. Was not a problem in the beginning then accessing the vein became harder with bruising. My wife wishes she had gotten the port a month earlier. It seems to be working much better as lab, ct imaging & chemo can all use the port.",
