      "Content": "Dog and Joe...thank you both for the reply. Of course I am currently rated at 100% because of Agent Orange and the PC diagnosis, and as nearly as I can determine, it should continue being 100% as long as I am being treated, even if my PSA drops ?? I am unfamiliar with Veterans Choice, but I will find out about it. I will discuss this with my PCP, as I have an appt. with him in mid-October, but am concerned about waiting that long, as I can get an injection at the University hospital, probably next week. I'm sure I will have ED after I start the ADT, but thought that an additional rating was only \"after\" treatment and applied to \"residuals\" such as incontinence and ED, but not sure. I don't have a Supplemental plan to Medicare, but I do have an Advantage Plan, so I have Part B, and understand that I would have a CoPay. The University Hospital is a Comprehensive Cancer Center, and does trials and such, so their Financial Department should be able to provide me with the information I need concerning my CoPay's. I'm not sure what ADT med's the VA would use, but I'm pretty sure it would be the same as the Univ. Hospital...a Lupron type injection. The \"care\" other than the injection would just be routine blood work, MRI and such. I am most concerned about finding my way out of the Urology Dept. at the VA, and into their Oncology Dept. if they have one. There is just a lot that I don't know, and don't want to screw up and end up being \"whip-sawed\" around the VA, as it is very difficult to deal with them on administrative matters. I went to the Univ. simply because I wanted another opinion about delaying ADT treatment because of \"side effects\" as recommended by the VA Urology Dept. The Univ. thinks I should begin the ADT right away, as my PSA is rising. I'm just not sure about waiting several more months for treatment to begin at the VA, and if I begin at the Univ. can I continue treatment at the VA later, as I understand the injections are every 3 months ?? Just a lot of stuff I don't know...Thanks, Brownie",

      "Content": "Hello AZMASON, and thanks for your reply. I had a follow up the other day at the Univ. Cancer Center, and the Dr. recommended that I start Triptorelin (3 month injection) asap. They do not agree with my Urologist at the VA, to wait until I have bone pain or my PSA goes way up, to spare me the \"side effects\" of ADT. I understand that Triptorelin is in the same drug class as Lupron and Eligard. I assume I would be given Lupron at the VA. I have Medicare and would have a copay at the Univ. but they say they cannot give me an estimate of costs until the Dr. gives me a treatment plan, so they can use codes, etc. Wow ! can't believe it is this difficult to get info. Anyway, the treatment at the VA will be free, as the PCa is considered \"service connected\" because of Agent Orange. I guess I will just wait until my appt. with my VA PCP in Oct. and see if he can hook me up with the VA Oncology Dept. I don't feel too comfortable with the Urologists, as I had to direct them to page # 2 of my MRI and the Radiologists recommendations. Anyway, my experience with the VA has generally been pretty good over they years, but since my PSA jumped up a year and half ago, it has been a bit \"rocky\"",

      "Content": "Hi Zaldamo. I too have Stage IV PCa, and am the same age as your Father-in-Law. I have been using the VA for the past 10 yrs here in Albuquerque NM, and have been very well taken care of. They do not have much of an Oncology dept. here, and referred me to the University of New Mexico Comprehensive Cancer Center for treatment thru the \"Veterans Choice\" program. PCa is a \"presumptive\" disease associated to exposure to Agent Orange, and if he served in Vietnam at any time between Jan 9,1962 and May 7, 1975, then he is eligible for compensation and treatment. I am considered 100% disabled as a result of the PCa diagnosis. Your Father-in-Law will have to \"prove\" that he served in Vietnam during this period. I know this sounds ridiculous, as the Military should know this, but I was able to provide a copy of my DD214, as well as copies of Citations and Awards during the period, plus I had letters I had sent to my mother in 1968, and was able to provide them, showing postmarks, etc. The local Veterans Administration was very helpful in assisting me in filing this claim. I would suggest he file this claim right away, as the Compensation is very helpful, especially if he chooses to go outside the VA System and has Medicare Copays, etc. There is a lot of information online about this subject, as well as assistance in filing his claim.......Good Luck, Brownie",

      "Content": "Hi Zaldamo. I too have Stage IV PCa, and am the same age as your Father-in-Law. I have been using the VA for the past 10 yrs here in Albuquerque NM, and have been very well taken care of. They do not have much of an Oncology dept. here, and referred me to the University of New Mexico Comprehensive Cancer Center for treatment thru the \"Veterans Choice\" program. PCa is a \"presumptive\" disease associated to exposure to Agent Orange, and if he served in Vietnam at any time between Jan 9,1962 and May 7, 1975, then he is eligible for compensation and treatment. I am considered 100% disabled as a result of the PCa diagnosis. Your Father-in-Law will have to \"prove\" that he served in Vietnam during this period. I know this sounds ridiculous, as the Military should know this, but I was able to provide a copy of my DD214, as well as copies of Citations and Awards during the period, plus I had letters I had sent to my mother in 1968, and was able to provide them, showing postmarks, etc. The local Veterans Administration was very helpful in assisting me in filing this claim. I would suggest he file this claim right away, as the Compensation is very helpful, especially if he chooses to go outside the VA System and has Medicare Copays, etc. There is a lot of information online about this subject, as well as assistance in filing his claim.......Good Luck, Brownie",

I was dx'd with Gleason 6 PC, but the Biopsy indicated that my Prostate was enlarged, but not enough to explain the high PSA of 12.3, and the Dr ordered up a MRI due to the PSA \"density\", well, it didn't find anything in my bones, and indicated that the PC was insignificant, but I had several \"significantly\" enlarged Nodes in my Pelvic area. Again, like you, my PSA wasn't high enough to make him believe that the Nodes had PC, so he ordered up a \"investigative Radiology\" Biopsy of a Node. The Radiologist was sure that it was PC, and wondered why the Urologist bothered to order a Biopsy. Anyway, went ahead and got the Biopsy, and it was PC. For now my Urologists are holding off on treatment until my PSA shoots way up, or I get pain in my bones, due to side effects of ADT. Not sure I Agree with that, so I am getting an appt. with a Medical Oncologist. I am much interested in the fact that your Dr's put you on ADT right away...Thanks, Brownie",

      "Content": "Hello Dowden. You didn't say anything about \"leg Pain\". I am interested because my situation is very similar to yours. My PSA had always been below 3.0, then it went to almost 7.0 after I hadn't had it checked for a couple years. Now it is almost 16.0 and my Urologist at the VA wants to wait to start ADT until it doubles in 6 months or I get leg pain. What is your PSA? I had a couple Biopsy samples with Gleason 6, and the MRI indicated no significant Prostate lesions; however, it did indicate large Lymph Nodes, and a subsequent Biopsy showed that the Nodes had PC. I guess this is somewhat unusual in that the PC went directly to the Lymph Nodes ?? I guess no surgery is advised in my case seeing as how the PC is already in my Lymph system. The MO's at the local Cancer think I should be on ADT, and I am awaiting a 3rd opinion from another Cancer Center. Seems like everyone but my Urologist thinks I should be on ADT, and he is holding off to spare me the Side Effects of the ADT . Doesn't make much sense to me...Thanks, Brownie",

The one I usually see assured me that he was \"smart\" and keeps up on all the literature. He said that he conferred with his colleagues, and they all concur that to wait til I have more symptoms of more advanced spreading of the pc before initiating treatment, to spare me the discomfort of side effects. He assured me that he and his colleagues have collectively over 140 yrs. of experience, or actually, that could be 1 year, 140 times. I decided to go to the local teaching college Cancer Center, but that isn't working out very well. he \"new Patient\" girl I was assigned to doesn't seem to know what to do. I left her 3 messages to call me, and when I finally hear from her, she said that \"we had been playing phone tag\" well, that is just not true. I asked if she had obtained my records from the VA, and she replied \"not yet\", and asked where the VA hospital was at in our city...think she is new. She never called me back. I really thought that the State University Hospital would be good for this, but lately have begun to think that it is \"state\", and all that implies. I do have an appt. with them next month but think I will cancel it, and go to a local Cancer Center. It is really scary. Probably forgot to mention that I am in New Mexico, which is roughly equivalent to a 3rd. world country, being 49th or 50th in every bad demographic possible, such as 72% of all babies born last year were Medicaid Babies, and the HS graduation rate is 62%. Really frustrating, and scary enough to be sick with this disease, and not have any clear avenue ahead. I think that if I don't feel comfortable with the new Cancer Center, than I will try MDA in Phoenix. Sorry for all the angst. I cut and pasted a comment that I made recently on another thread. I have been researching ADT, as I believe that is what is in my future. My PC went directly to Pelvic Lymph Nodes, tho it was initially deemed a Gleason 6 from my Prostate Biopsy; although, i'm sure something was missed, and it is much more aggressive. I am being treated at the VA, and my Urologist wants to wait on treatment until my PSA takes a sharp jump upward, or I experience bone pain. His reasoning for delaying treatment is to spare me side effects because I am 73yrs. old, and treatment options are limited. He didn't mention ADT, but I am pretty sure that is the option. I haven't learned much from recent studies except that Immediate ADT for those that have had their prostates removed and new symptoms, seem to benefit from starting ADT right away when PSA increases or the PC metastasizes. My case is a little different in that I haven't had any surgery. I have an appt on the 6th of next month with a Medical Oncologist at the UNM Cancer Center, and I want be be sure that waiting is ok. Your comments and thoughts about this would be appreciated...thanks, Brownie",

His reasoning for delaying treatment is to spare me side effects because I am 73yrs. old, and treatment options are limited. He didn't mention ADT, but I am pretty sure that is the option. I haven't learned much from recent studies except that Immediate ADT for those that have had their prostates removed and new symptoms, seem to benefit from starting ADT right away when PSA increases or the PC metastasizes. My case is a little different in that I haven't had any surgery. I have an appt on the 6th of next month with a Medical Oncologist at the UNM Cancer Center, and I want be be sure that waiting is ok. Your comments and thoughts about this would be appreciated...thanks, Brownie",
