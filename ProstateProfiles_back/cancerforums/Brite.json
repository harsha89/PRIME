      "Content": "Thanks to everyone who has sent replies. To Michigan Man: Surgery was one month ago and no PSAs have been done. The urologist surgeon was a jerk and we had to request a meeting with him after surgery. He passed us off to the NP to go over our Final Pathology report and to tell us we should start on Lupron for 6 months. It was so confusing and inappropriate!!! When we forced him to meet with us he said that the Lupron would freeze any remaining cancer cells and he did say something about the pre op PSA as part of the reason. So ur right! We will have the PSA checked Jan 15th (3 month post op) only because we insisted. I located information about Dr. McCall and Dr. Szmulewitz. We would be staying in Wicker Park with our daughter so I am not sure the Lenox location would work for us. Is there anyone else u would recommend or does she work in other locations in the city? I think Dr. S is a good fit for us. Would I see the RO or MO first?",

      "Content": "My spouse recently had a RP for advanced stage prostate cancer and we want to get a second opinion about treatment in the chicago area. He is 67 years old and healthy. His surgeon urologist in springfield, illinois recommended he start Lupron for 6 months and then follow up with one of his partners in 6 months to check a PSA and consider EBRT. I have posted his stats. We have an appointment scheduled with Northwestern with Dr. Edward Schaeffer on Jan. 8th. I intend to also get a second opinion from University of Chicago but I dont know who to get an appointment with. Suggestions? Has anyone used either of these places for a second opinion or for treatment? Which doc would u recommend or not recommend we consider for transfer of care? We have other options on our new PPO insurance which starts in January so we are open to other places. Thxs.",
