However, the timing of action(s) will ultimately be determined by your URO MD. Questions & Suggestions: - Was the blood drawn for PSA taken before or after the DRE? - Wait for the results of the Select MDX test. Be sure that your MD fully understands and can explain these results. - If not already done, ask your URO MD about repeating the PSA test in about 8 weeks and to request a PSA test that measures both PSAfree and PSAbound fractions. - If & when biopsy is indicated, follow SubDenis' suggestion and ask about a \"multiparametric MRI and fusion biopsy.\" There may be a problem with insurance reimbursement. The MRI can detect most areas of suspicion and the spacial locations programmed so that the TRUS biopsy can be \"guided\" to any hot spots. Try to relax and not panic. You have not been diagnosed with PCa. Even if this happens (hoping not!) you will likely be in a 100% curable category. Keep asking questions and seeking knowledge (exactly as you are doing) and keep us updated. MF WOW - I am really thankful for the responses I received from this Forum - thanks to all! I had no idea what a valuable resource this forum would be in such a short time!! Blood was drawn prior to DRE by a couple of weeks Also I do have BPH and frequent urination including two to three times per night but thank god I usually fall right back to sleep I ride a bicycle 7,000+ miles per year so 4 days a week on the bike and the other 3 days at the local LA Fitness facility for Core and Upper body work - so basically good physical condition at 66",
