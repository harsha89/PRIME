      "Content": "I believe this was one of the articles that convinced me this was the right treatment for me. I think that more and more guys will consider this as time goes on and word gets out. Especially for those who do not want to take what (in my view) are the increased risks of the more lasting side effects from surgery, and who don't feel the compulsion to just \"cut it out\" or the desire to have a final path report that shows grading, margins etc. This is a very effective therapy that has years of research behind it and the results are excellent. In my case, I didn't worry about the lack of a final path report because I was convinced that this therapy would get it all- with margins that can't be achieved surgically (without significant SE's) for good measure.

      "Content": "Hi there: Good point...but I guess it all depends on which study you are looking at and the percentage of patients experiencing any given side effect and how it compares to the percentages of patients experiencing that same side effects from another therapy (e.g. surgery). As an example, in this study from 2015: \"Erectile function was preserved in 72% of the patients who had Grade 0-1 erectile dysfunction before brachytherapy.\" and that 80% with ED will respond to pharmacologic agents. So that also comes into play-the treatable of any inivitable side effects https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4570880/ I don't have the numbers for surgical patients-however, I do recall them seeming to be higher-both in theory and based on the anecdotal evidence of men on the various boards when I was researching. In any case, I am happy to report that thus far for, this has not been an issue!",

      "Content": "Hi there: I will be undergoing this treatment in late April at Stanford. UCLA (and Dr. Demanes) are pioneers of this very successful therapy, with cure rates equal to (if not better for low-to-intermediate risk patients) surgery with fewer side effects. There is very compelling 10 year data on this treatment. There is a thread on this forum to a gentleman who underwent this a number of years ago...search under High dose Brachy. Please do share your details, but I assume that UCLA would not be recommending this approach for you unless you fit into their risk profile for this. You can also PM me for links to to the studies I referred too. I am very happy that I made this decision over surgery, which seemed to me, given my concerns and disease profile, like a very extreme option. Good luck! Gio",

      "Content": "Hi all: I wanted to start a new thread on this topic. It is something I am researching, along with surgery. Have met with 1 surgeon so far, another one on Thursday, followed by a Stanford radiation oncologist next week. The first surgeon suggested that we might want to look at this modality given my staging (T1C) and concerns about side effects from surgery. Here are the inclusion criteria for this procedure: Qualifying for HDR Monotherapy Stage T1c, T2a, or small T2b (limited findings on digital rectal exam) PSA < 15 (as long as the PSA doubling rate is > 1 year) Gleason 2-7 (3+4 not 4+3 and it involves < 50% biopsy specimen) The above criteria are applied to patients on an individual case basis. Most patients with low risk group disease (T1c or T2a, Gleason 6 or less, and PSA <10) will probably be candidates for HDR monotherapy. Some patients who fall into the intermediate risk group will also be considered candidates. Certain patients with prior radiation (external beam or permanent seeds) who have biopsy proven evidence of persistent disease may be candidates for \"salvage\" HDR monotherapy.\" I watched the video on the Stanford website about this procedure and the Dr who runs it did say that should this treatment fail as noted by a PSA rise 12-24 months post treatment (but success rate is 95% range, comparable to surgery for the right candidates), that surgery is one of the options-which has not traditionally been the case with radiation therapy, along with HIFU, cyro, additional rads or HT. We will be meeting with him soon for more info. I know a lot of guys have opted for surgery and have been very satisfied with the results, but I thought this may be of interest to others who may not have yet made a decision. Best, Gio",

      "Content": "I would have to agree with AS on this one. RALP was first performed in 2000, and as this 2012 paper states: \"The rapid growth of RALRP has generated controversy in light of the paucity of long-term follow-up data. Although several large series have demonstrated long-term survival after RRP, similar data for RALRP are simply unavailable due to its recent introduction.\" https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3502048/ So in terms of \"long term data\", HD Brachy as a monotherapy has been around since 1991 so has the same amount time/study behind it as RALP-and and as SubDenis discovered, results are very good. So I think it's a money issue more than a lack of data issue. Hope that changes as the word gets out. A lot of guys resistant to surgery should know about a good alternative.",

      "Content": "Hi All, Recently diagnosed and was hoping to take the active surveillance route when a second MRI guided biopsy showed more diffuse cancer than was initially indicated. I live in the Bay Area so have lots of choices. So far have consulted with Dr. Sonn at Stanford and Dr. Bruno who is Head of Robotic surgery. Any of you have experience with either of them or additional recommendation in the Bay Area for the DaVinci procedure? Also, there seems to be a mixed bag in terms of post-surgical sexual functionality and incontinence. Does it depend if the cancer and related nerves are on one side vs. both? Age? strength of erections before surgery?I am hoping for the best as my wife and I enjoy a phenomenal sex life and we both want to keep that going. Another reason we were hoping that surveillance would be an option. Despite an enlarged prostate for years, I am completely symptom-free of any prostate related issues. Any feedback appreciated. Thanks!",

      "Content": "Hello Highlander: Testing to see if my edited signature provides enough info? We are meeting with 2 different surgeons next week to discuss options, but am assuming I will go with the DaVinci surgery. Still hoping someone from the Bay Area will chime in with any recommendations. My wife was reading the \"post op\" instructions on one of the surgeon's websites and she broke down in tears when looking at all the info about incontinence and ED. We understand that everyone is different, and one of the things we hope to learn from the surgeons (based on the locations of the various lesions found) is if they think they will be able to perform a true \"nerve sparing\" surgery. I'm fortunate to have strong erections \"on demand\" without pharma assistance, so I hope that bodes well. I'm very active and would also hate to struggle with on-going incontinence. We;re trying to stay positive and focus on the fact that this is totally curable at this phase! Thanks again, Gio",

Chuck Thanks Chuck! We are on the west side of the Bay between both Stanford and UCSF, so given that we have good choices over here, it will be more convenient not to have to cross a bridge to see the Doc. One of the guys we are talking to is at Stanford, and the other isn't (but is the head of the Robotics department a a nearby hospital and a teaches for DaVinci). We will probably go see someone at UCSF as well as they also offer CyberKnife which I would like to know more about. I will post again when further questions arise and once a treatment course is established. Thanks for all the support so far.",

      "Content": "Hi Otago: Re; your question \"I am curious, what or who prompted the followup MRI biopsy?\" Surgeon who performed first biopsy (12 cores) recommended surgery right away despite being only one positive core with 10% involvement. When I asked why, he basically said that his opinion was that the one positive core 'probably\" meant that the cancer could be in many more spots. He said the biopsy is like going into a dark room and hoping for the best, but there is a lot you don't see. My wife did the initial research and discovered that I would be a good candidate for AS. So we made an appointment at Stanford and the surgeon there concurred that AS was a good course, but recommended a repeat PSA & MRI guided biopsy 6-9 months out. Had the MRI which showed the potential \"areas of interest\" and he did the next biopsy based on those parameters, which gleaned the current results that kicked me out of AS. (and which in a certain sense could be seen as 'vindication' for surgeon #1 who thought the cancer was likely multi-focal requiring surgery). So now 2 surgeons (as well as a cousin who is a Dr at the leading Urology center in Milan Italy and works under the #1 robotics guy in Italy) concur that surgery is the best course. We are also going to research Cyberknife as an option as well as 5 year data suggest similar outcomes to surgery with fewer side effects. I will take to heart your suggestions as to the definition of the various terms when meeting with the surgeons, and will read the Medscape article as well. Thanks! Gio",

      "Content": "We met with the Stanford surgeon today to go over options. The good news is that given the location of the lesions, he feels that they are more toward the front or top of the prostate, thus he feels that his surgical plan going in would be to save both nerve bundles. Which is good news in terms of ED, especially given that I have no ED of any kind at this time. That said, he said the odds of ED of some kind in his practice can still be as high as 40-60%, which is not encouraging. He says his rate of urinary control is quite high ~95%. As a side note, he says he has performed close to 300 of the DaVinci procedures-which from what I gather, many of you on this board might think that is not enough! We did ask about CK and/or High dose Brachy and he said that although as a surgeon he has his bias towards surgery, the fact is that cure rates between the 2 are virtually the same. He feels that given all factors (Gleason score, location of lesions, T1C staging etc...along with my concerns about urinary control and ED), that these options would offer similar outcomes to surgery, with fewer potential side effects. Obviously, no treatment is risk free! We addressed the issue of what happens if the cancer comes back, and should PSA rise again, then either a) more radiation or other therapies can be given AND b) that surgery would still likely be an option with the high dose Brachy as it is much more targeted than either low dose or external beam treatments that really make mincemeat of the prostate. So the next step is to meet with the High dose guru and hear his side of the story. The benefit to this treatment is that it is brief, with virtually no downtime from normal activities ans there are no seeds left behind (the dose is delivered via needles inserted specifically at the tumor sites under anesthesia). Not sure what this guy's opinion is on the CK procedure. Here is a link on the HDR procedure: https://www.21co.com/radiation-thera...chytherapy-hdr Based on just what the surgeon told us, I am very intrigued to learn more, and will report back. We are also meeting with a different surgeon The guy that is a proctor for DaVinci) on Thursday so I will be interested in his opinion. What a crazy journey-thanks for listening! An initial search on this site didn't glean much in terms of guys that have had this high dose Brachy...so if anyone can point me to a thread here where it is addressed more thoroughly, I'd appreciate it. If not, I can start one to see who responds. Gio",

      "Content": "Hi AS: Of course we won't know if I would be a good candidate for the Brachy with the 9/20 cores affected until we meet with the Radiation Oncologist, but the surgeon did not think that was an exclusion criteria as my PSA is below 10 and most of the cores identified cores were 3+3 with a couple of 3+ 4 (the \"good\" 7) Gleason scores thrown in. My disease appears to be completely contained in the prostate, and that is one of the main selection criteria for high success with this technique. I am not considering cyrotherapy-it is between some form of rads or surgery. Here's something from the UCLA website that might clarify a bit: High-dose-rate (HDR) Monotherapy HDR Monotherapy is used for patients whose disease is believed to be confined to the prostate or immediate surrounding tissues (just beyond the covering or \"capsule\" of the prostate). UCLA\u2019s Department of Radiation Oncology\u2019s HDR Monotherapy prostate protocol was developed in 1996 for patients who, for one reason or another, were not candidates for combined HDR and EBRT. Physician-scientists reasoned that if permanent seeds could be used without EBRT so could HDR. It was subsequently observed that HDR Monotherapy for prostate cancer was a safe and effective treatment and thus began the HDR Monotherapy program. Nearly 500 patients have been treated at UCLA with HDR Monotherapy and it is now a routinely recommended treatment option at CET. The results have shown excellent clinical control of disease and few side effects. The UCLA protocol is designed to minimize side effects by giving treatment in a series of two \"implant\" procedures, performed approximately one week apart. Three HDR treatments (called \"fractions\") are given with each implant so a total of six fractions completes the course of treatment. Since the radiation is delivered quickly, the acute radiation reactions come and go quickly. The tumor control rate (patient without clinical evidence of disease or PSA progression) is more than 95%.",

      "Content": "Hi All: I've been looking through posts here and I see very few who have had or have researched CyberKnife so I thought I would start specific thread for it. This technology has been in use since 2001 and was invented right in our backyard at Stanford. Side note: n a weird coincidence, I actually met the inventor, Dr. Adler at a SuperBowl party a couple of years ago and he was talking about how this is such a huge revolution in cancer treatment. It started out as a way to treat inoperable brain cancer but has been used on other cancers (including Prostate) successfully for some time now. We have meetings later this week with 2 different surgeons as well as a radiation oncologist at Stanford who specializes in CyberKnife. From what I can gather, 3-5 year data suggest that this treatment (for those who are good candidates) has basically equivalent cure rate/efficacy to DaVinci surgery with far fewer side effects & downtime. This was from an 800 patient 48 month patient study by Dr. Katz on the east coast. It remains to be seen if I would even be a candidate for this (looking at the initial criteria of low-to-intermediate risk cancer, (with the \"good\" 7 Gleason scores of 3+4 mixed in with 3+3). My main question other than cure rate vs. surgery would be what treatments would be possible in case the cancer came back. I understand that surgery for the most part isn't an option after radiation (though we do have a personal friend who did find a Dr. in FL who did surgery 10 years after radiation...and now 5 years after surgery, the guy is doing well). I understand that that the case for having surgery is that if it does come back, you can still do salvage radiation. But CyberKnife is a much more precisely targeted form of radiation, so I'm not sure if falls into the same category as other forms of radiation. I gather that there is a bias toward surgery on this forum (not a judgement, merely an observation), but I was hoping to hear back from anyone out there who has either had this CyberKnife procedure or even considered it and what your experiences/thoughts are. Many thanks, Gio",

      "Content": "Thanks for the feedback Jim! I can assure you that I am not relying to the company's marketing on this topic...I have been looking at anything that offers comparable data to surgery...5 year data is OK by me. My wife does medical market research for a living, mostly in the device category and she also assures me that companies are also quite limited about the claims they can make w/o appropriate study back-up-and that respected practitioners are VERY skeptical of anything other than 3-5 year data with fairly large patient populations. I have looked a couple of other PC forums and there have been a number of patients on those boards that seem quite satisfied w/RK and have virtually no side effects. I did see one early study that indicated a possible higher incidence of incontinence when compared to more traditional radiation therapy, but cautioned that it wasn't a correlation, rather something that needed further study. Also, I suspect that similar to the DaVinci method, a lot depends on the operator and level of experience of the operator. I think a number of CK Centers have popped up over the years and perhaps this may have some correlations with side effects vs. an academic center like Stanford or UCSF where this technique has been in use for a longer period of time. But you make a good point (and one that I intend to ask about) is a concern that this technology is better suited for cancers that aren't as multi-focal as PC tends to be. I would be interested in being pointed to patient satisfaction concerns that you feel can be easily found on Google. In my own searching, I found (similar to those who chose surgical) that by and large patients are satisfied with their choice of CK. Some bad stories too-but based on what I'm seeing here, there are guys who had surgery who still struggle with incontinence and to a much greater extent ED. warm regards",

      "Content": "Hi there, just saw this post and thought I would chime in. I had HD Brachy as a monotherapy, 2 treatments in May this year. I did not go home with a catheter nor did I experience any urinary side affects at all (with the exception of about 36 hours of discomfort after the second treatment when I passed several blood clots). I take Flomax 2X/day and pee like a racehorse. At first I had some urgency (couldn't hold it as long as before) but that too has resolved and I feel that I am back to normal. I have no idea if there would be more swelling after having had prior radiation treatments, but that may in fact be the case. The way it worked for me is that as soon as I was awake from anesthesia and able to urinate, they let me go home with a warning that if I experienced difficulty in urinating that I would need to go to the ER and have the cath put back in, but that didn't happen. I seem to recall another guy on this forum who had salvage radiation and had to have a catheter in on and off during his treatment. I think in your situation, I would opt for the 5 weeks IGRT plus HD Brachy boost. Good luck, let me know if you have other questions. Gio",

      "Content": "I will have to respectfully disagree with you here Jim. Yes-clearly Southsider has cancer in his prostate. But: it was only one core, Gleason 6 and then a second biopsy was negative...and the third seems to show some small progression. But, the way I understand it, means he's a still a good candidate for AS until something changes significantly (as it did in my case when the number of cores after an MRI guided biopsy showed more involvement). Hopefully Southsider is getting MRI guided biopsies which are not as \"bilnd\" as the basic 12 core routine. What Southsider gains from this approach is delaying treatment that carries with it significant risks of some concerning side effects without really changing his survival stats. So, in the absence of a fast rising PSA or palpable tumors or other symptoms, it is not a stretch to assume that his cancer is small, and not likely growing rapidly-and that he will still be in a good place to make treatment decisions if the next biopsy indicates more involved cores or other signs of progression. Just my .02. Gio",

      "Content": "Hi Folks: I posted this info under another thread called High Dose Brachy & CyberKnife, but wanted to post it here as well for maximum visibility for anyone considering radiation treatments. There is another form of Brachy which is not the seed implants that may be an appropriate treatment option for low-risk and some intermediate risk patients that is worth looking into. In my research on High Dose Brachytherapy (monotherapy) and CyberKnife, I stumbled across another forum that includes a great discussion of these techniques along with a thorough discussion and input input from guys who chose surgery vs. these other options. I was having trouble finding very many on this forum who had experience with these HD Brachy and could relate their real world experience. It also led me to some great data on the UCLA on comparing outcomes. I think both are worth checking out for anyone still weighing options. Results are VERY encouraging IMO with quite comparable cure rates to surgery without some of the nastier side effects. Radiation therapy (like surgical options) has come a long way and I am really looking forward to talking to the radiation oncologist at Stanford on Monday about this treatment. http://urology.ucla.edu/body.cfm?id=447",

I concur with all here-you've made a decision based on factors that you feel are most relevant to you, and with confidence that radiation is a VERY effective treatment. While it is true that many on this forum have chosen surgery as the best treatment plan for them(and of course it IS very effective), I too will be walking the radiation path via High Dose Brachy Monotherapy. Suffice to say, I am convinced that for my situation, it offers the best chance for a complete cure with the fewest risks of both short and long term side effects. I was hung up for awhile on the assertion that \"well, with surgery, you can still do radiation later if needed and they can see the extent of the cancer in the post-op pathology.\" I have since become convinced that with radiation, the risk of the cancer coming back is actually lower than with surgery, so I am not going to worry about the slim possibility of some future event-especially given that there are many treatment options after radiation to pursue should that happen. Not to mention the advantage over surgery (as I understand it) that radiation can offer about treating the margins in the event that invisible cancer cells are lurking there. It may be that the \"current wisdom\" will be changing to reflect the advances made in radiation therapy, and that more men will consider this option than previously.

While I think surgery is a great option for many men (and does seem to skew that way on this site), I think it's important to learn about all options before making a decision. Especially as more therapies now have longer term comparable data available. Hopefully guys that would like to hear more about non-surgical options will seek out other prostate cancer forums (which cannot be named here!) that have a higher percentage of men who chose those options. That's what I did and found those to be quite informative as well. Gio",

      "Content": "Hello everyone: I had my first of 2 HD Brachytherapy treatments yesterday at Stanford with Dr. Mark Buyyounouski. Brilliant guy. First off, some background and a few reasons why I chose this procedure over surgery. Apologies for the long post, but I think many guys who are still deciding will appreciate my perspective: 1) I went from AS to needing to \u0093do something\u0094 after a second MRI guided biopsy found more affected cores present, with a higher percentage of the cores involved-some of which went from G6 to G7. That said, I was still in what was determined to be a \u0093favorable intermediate risk\u0094 category, with no evidence of cancer outside the prostate. 2) I met with 2 surgeons (one of whom is a proctor for DaVinci and has performed many hundreds of procedures). We talked about side effects, recovery arc-and I talked to several of his (quite satisfied patients). Still, I was not keen on the idea of a surgery and the very real risk of longer term incontinence and ED. I never felt that I needed to \u0093get it out\u0094, nor did I think the idea of having a full path report to tell me about staging and extent were good enough reasons for having surgery. My goal was to kill that stuff with as little downtime and as few SE\u0092s as possible. One of the surgeons (a Stanford guy) heard me loud and clear and suggested that we meet with Dr. B. 3) I read up on non-surgical options and it became pretty clear to me that I would be a good candidate for this therapy, and I was fortunate enough to live close to a center (and skilled RO) that performed it. My wife and I met with Dr. B\u0092s team, he laid out the procedure, the side effects and shared with us the research (5 & 10 year data that shows that this offers similar-if not better disease control than surgery or other forms of radiation therapy). I liked the idea that the very targeted radiation could focus on the focal areas of concern identified by the MRI guided biopsy, but would still radiate the entire prostate-including a 3-5mm margin that is not often achievable during surgery without seriously risking function and SE\u0092s. For me, the idea that I could have the surgery and still possibly face having to do RT on top of that at some point should all the cancer cells not have been removed was not at all appealing. 4) My wife became obsessed with the research and read everything she could, consulted with friends of hers in the medical research arena to vet & understand what she was reading. In the end it was pretty clear: HD BT provides excellent biochemical disease control with fewer side effects (both long and short term) when compared to both surgery as well as other forms of RT, including LD Brachy (seed implants). I was told that I would not need HT as an adjunct therapy and I was sold. As for my experience yesterday: Got to the hospital, was in the Radiation OR by 7:30AM, out by 11:30AM. Once I was awake enough they removed the catheter and I urinated, I was discharged and home by 2PM. I was told to expect a \u0093rough night\u0094 of urinary frequency and burning, to take it easy for 2 days, then go back to work as long as it was not strenuous physical labor requiring lifting of over 10 pounds. I was to take antibiotics, ibuprofen for inflammation & FlowMax and they would see me in 2 weeks for Round Two. I got home, ate a light lunch, drank water and chilled out. Sitting there chatting with my wife and watching an old silent film, I got a spontaneous and very firm erection-which we both laughed about but I assume must bode well for the future. Went to bed at 9, got up several times (primarily due to the massive amount of fluids pushed on me by my wife) but urinated without too much discomfort. Very little blood & no clots so far-which I was told to expect. Very little pain in my perineum where they inserted the needles to deliver the radiation dose into the prostate. I just got back from a walk around the neighborhood and feel pretty normal (just a bit foggy headed). I don\u0092t know if my experience is typical or not, but I couldn\u0092t be more pleased with my choice and the experience thus far. I will report back after round 2 (and of course again after my first PSA test) but I would be open to questions either on this thread or via PM and I would be happy to provide the links to some of the more recent articles on this therapy to anyone who is interested. I think it is an excellent stand-alone treatment option for low-to-intermediate risk PC. Regards, Gio",

While I think surgery is a great option for many men (and does seem to skew that way on this site), I think it's important to learn about all options before making a decision. Especially as more therapies now have longer term comparable data available. Hopefully guys that would like to hear more about non-surgical options will seek out other prostate cancer forums (which cannot be named here!) that have a higher percentage of men who chose those options. That's what I did and found those to be quite informative as well. Gio",

      "Content": "Hello everyone: I had my first of 2 HD Brachytherapy treatments yesterday at Stanford with Dr. Mark Buyyounouski. Brilliant guy. First off, some background and a few reasons why I chose this procedure over surgery. Apologies for the long post, but I think many guys who are still deciding will appreciate my perspective: 1) I went from AS to needing to \u0093do something\u0094 after a second MRI guided biopsy found more affected cores present, with a higher percentage of the cores involved-some of which went from G6 to G7. That said, I was still in what was determined to be a \u0093favorable intermediate risk\u0094 category, with no evidence of cancer outside the prostate. 2) I met with 2 surgeons (one of whom is a proctor for DaVinci and has performed many hundreds of procedures). We talked about side effects, recovery arc-and I talked to several of his (quite satisfied patients). Still, I was not keen on the idea of a surgery and the very real risk of longer term incontinence and ED. I never felt that I needed to \u0093get it out\u0094, nor did I think the idea of having a full path report to tell me about staging and extent were good enough reasons for having surgery. My goal was to kill that stuff with as little downtime and as few SE\u0092s as possible. One of the surgeons (a Stanford guy) heard me loud and clear and suggested that we meet with Dr. B. 3) I read up on non-surgical options and it became pretty clear to me that I would be a good candidate for this therapy, and I was fortunate enough to live close to a center (and skilled RO) that performed it. My wife and I met with Dr. B\u0092s team, he laid out the procedure, the side effects and shared with us the research (5 & 10 year data that shows that this offers similar-if not better disease control than surgery or other forms of radiation therapy).

      "Content": "I fully agree Highlander...I just found that on this particular forum, there were more \"personal stories\" around surgery and other forms of RT and few around this particular therapy, and the one thread I found that specifically discussed the actual treatment was an older one started by SV Golfer. I wanted to give a \"soup to nuts\" description of what led me to the decision I mad as well as to provide the details around the actual treatment. I plan to post as I move through the second round and beyond for that reason-to help guys be aware of this particular modality. In a nutshell, Dr, Bouyynouski's opinion is that LDR Brachy (seeds) is going to eventually be supplanted by the HD Brachy monotherapy wherein the radiation dose is given through a series of catheters over 2 sessions, with no radiation left in the body as is with the seeds. It's great news for everyone affected that treatment options evolve. Best, Gio",

      "Content": "Thanks Shu-that's why I posted this. While I think surgery is a great option for many men (and does seem to skew that way on this site), I think it's important to learn about all options before making a decision. Especially as more therapies now have longer term comparable data available. Hopefully guys that would like to hear more about non-surgical options will seek out other prostate cancer forums (which cannot be named here!) that have a higher percentage of men who chose those options. That's what I did and found those to be quite informative as well. Gio",

      "Content": "Hi Otago: Those were the numbers that really tipped the scales for me in favor of this treatment; I don't think you can hope for better numbers in terms of cancer! I am not aware that Kaiser anywhere is yet offering HD Brachy; however, I think you can appeal/request that they cover the procedure since it is performed at Stanford and UCSF and is in fact a proven (not experimental) therapy. Good luck! P.S. I'm Day 3 out from the 1st procedure and I feel perfectly normal expect for urinating more often (due to the 2 liters of water my wife is forcing on me!). My worst side effect so far is the lack of a decent BM (which they said is a likely result of the anesthesia).",

      "Content": "Hello everyone: I had my first of 2 HD Brachytherapy treatments yesterday at Stanford with Dr. Mark Buyyounouski. Brilliant guy. First off, some background and a few reasons why I chose this procedure over surgery. Apologies for the long post, but I think many guys who are still deciding will appreciate my perspective: 1) I went from AS to needing to \u0093do something\u0094 after a second MRI guided biopsy found more affected cores present, with a higher percentage of the cores involved-some of which went from G6 to G7. That said, I was still in what was determined to be a \u0093favorable intermediate risk\u0094 category, with no evidence of cancer outside the prostate. 2) I met with 2 surgeons (one of whom is a proctor for DaVinci and has performed many hundreds of procedures). We talked about side effects, recovery arc-and I talked to several of his (quite satisfied patients). Still, I was not keen on the idea of a surgery and the very real risk of longer term incontinence and ED. I never felt that I needed to \u0093get it out\u0094, nor did I think the idea of having a full path report to tell me about staging and extent were good enough reasons for having surgery. My goal was to kill that stuff with as little downtime and as few SE\u0092s as possible. One of the surgeons (a Stanford guy) heard me loud and clear and suggested that we meet with Dr. B. 3) I read up on non-surgical options and it became pretty clear to me that I would be a good candidate for this therapy, and I was fortunate enough to live close to a center (and skilled RO) that performed it. My wife and I met with Dr. B\u0092s team, he laid out the procedure, the side effects and shared with us the research (5 & 10 year data that shows that this offers similar-if not better disease control than surgery or other forms of radiation therapy). I liked the idea that the very targeted radiation could focus on the focal areas of concern identified by the MRI guided biopsy, but would still radiate the entire prostate-including a 3-5mm margin that is not often achievable during surgery without seriously risking function and SE\u0092s. For me, the idea that I could have the surgery and still possibly face having to do RT on top of that at some point should all the cancer cells not have been removed was not at all appealing. 4) My wife became obsessed with the research and read everything she could, consulted with friends of hers in the medical research arena to vet & understand what she was reading. In the end it was pretty clear: HD BT provides excellent biochemical disease control with fewer side effects (both long and short term) when compared to both surgery as well as other forms of RT, including LD Brachy (seed implants). I was told that I would not need HT as an adjunct therapy and I was sold. As for my experience yesterday: Got to the hospital, was in the Radiation OR by 7:30AM, out by 11:30AM. Once I was awake enough they removed the catheter and I urinated, I was discharged and home by 2PM. I was told to expect a \u0093rough night\u0094 of urinary frequency and burning, to take it easy for 2 days, then go back to work as long as it was not strenuous physical labor requiring lifting of over 10 pounds. I was to take antibiotics, ibuprofen for inflammation & FlowMax and they would see me in 2 weeks for Round Two. I got home, ate a light lunch, drank water and chilled out. Sitting there chatting with my wife and watching an old silent film, I got a spontaneous and very firm erection-which we both laughed about but I assume must bode well for the future. Went to bed at 9, got up several times (primarily due to the massive amount of fluids pushed on me by my wife) but urinated without too much discomfort. Very little blood & no clots so far-which I was told to expect. Very little pain in my perineum where they inserted the needles to deliver the radiation dose into the prostate. I just got back from a walk around the neighborhood and feel pretty normal (just a bit foggy headed). I don\u0092t know if my experience is typical or not, but I couldn\u0092t be more pleased with my choice and the experience thus far. I will report back after round 2 (and of course again after my first PSA test) but I would be open to questions either on this thread or via PM and I would be happy to provide the links to some of the more recent articles on this therapy to anyone who is interested. I think it is an excellent stand-alone treatment option for low-to-intermediate risk PC. Regards, Gio",

Many guys here have chosen surgery and have had great success and were reassured by knowing that the prostate was gone and that they could receive a pathology report as to the extent of cancer-which is not possible with radiation. However, with radiation, your entire prostate along with the margins will be treated, which for me was reassuring. I also was not comfortable with the level of incontinence and ED that I saw reported both in the data as well as anecdotally, and felt that if there was a treatment that could minimize those SE's and give me the same level of biochemical control of the disease-I was all for that.

HD differs from LD Brachy in that these are not seeds that are permanently implanted, but a treatment where the dosage is delivered through catheters in your perinium over 2 treatments. It can be used in conjunction with Hormone therapy as well as other forms of external beam radiation depending on your case. Below is a link to 10 year data for HD Brachy, which is very encouraging: https://prostatecancerinfolink.net/2...-year-results/ I will be going in for my second treatment tomorrow AM. After my first treatment on April 20, I have have experienced virtually no side effects other than a slight increased urgency to urinate at night (primarily due to the fact that I now drink 2 liters of water a day!) and some blood in my semen. I am completely continent and have not experienced any ED at all. And, contrary to what has been previously thought about side effects from radiation coming later (as opposed to surgery where the \"hit\" is up front), newer studies on the more current radiations therapies do not bear this out. The most important thing is to be as informed as possible about your options and to feel comfortable about your choice. Many guys here have chosen surgery and have had great success and were reassured by knowing that the prostate was gone and that they could receive a pathology report as to the extent of cancer-which is not possible with radiation. However, with radiation, your entire prostate along with the margins will be treated, which for me was reassuring. I also was not comfortable with the level of incontinence and ED that I saw reported both in the data as well as anecdotally, and felt that if there was a treatment that could minimize those SE's and give me the same level of biochemical control of the disease-I was all for that. I wish you the all the best and keep us posted! Gio",

      "Content": "Hi All: In my research on High Dose Brachytherapy (monotherapy) and CyberKnife, I stumbled across (another) forum that includes a great discussion of these techniques along with a thorough discussion and input input from guys who chose surgery. I was having trouble finding very many on this forum who had experience with these options and could relate their real world experience. It also led me to some great data on the UCLA on comparing outcomes. I think both are worth checking out for anyone still weighing options. Results are VERY encouraging IMO and I am really looking forward to talking to the radiation oncologist at Stanford on Monday about this. Perhaps the moderator can advise if I should also post this to another established radiation thread or start a new one?

      "Content": "Hi Mitch: I would imagine that As might be a tough choice for you based on what you've told us. Given your age (and I make no assumptions about your overall physical condition-you may be an extremely fit 66 year old!), surgery should you opt for that at some future point-might present more medical challenges. I also want to add for the amount/G score of your cancer, there is another type of radiation treatment that you might consider, that is neither external beam nor seeding and that is High Dose Brachytherapy as a monotherapy. I completed this 2 step treatment in May, and could not be more pleased with the results and the minimal side effects. I had it done at Stanford, it was pioneered at UCLA, I believe it is offered at UCSF, and I would imagine any number of other academic centers in the East or Southeast. It is well studied and has success rates AT LEAST equivalent to surgery. I urge you to look into this, and/or PM me for more info. I started a thread on this forum entitled : HD Brachy Monotherapy my choice & my experience (which I need to update since my 3 month follow-up). You can also get lots of info on the UCLA site in particular. Chuck, going forward, I would encourage you to also include this therapy when talking about radiation treatment options for men with low-to-intermediate risk prostate cancer (Gleason 3+3 or 3+4, 50% of cores or less affected). https://prostatecancerinfolink.net/2...-year-results/ Good luck and steady on as you determine your next steps! Gio Originally Posted by HighlanderCFH Hi Mitch, Sorry to see all the confusion that is going on between the various opinions. The good thing is that nothing worse than 3+4 has been detected. And the good news is that a 3+4 usually behaves more like the low-risk 3+3. The thing that I'm thinking of are the two original cores that ultimately were judged to be 3+4 (or 3+3, depending on the report). I'm also thinking of the two other cores that are suspicious -- IN ADDITION to the original two cores. This is a potential FOUR cores that are either cancerous or highly suspicious. In my non-medical mind, this really puts you in the Twilight Zone between AS and treatment. With the ability to withstand treatment (surgery or radiation) possibly waning in future years, I would think that choosing a treatment sooner -- instead of later -- would be something to highly consider. Radiation would be either external beam or radioactive seeding. Surgery would get rid of the whole thing at once. With a previous heart attack and the fibrillation events, perhaps surgery would be too risky? Or, perhaps not, since you were able to have gallbladder surgery. In any case, it would seem to be a good idea to attack this condition while you are stronger. Let's see what others have to say. Also, remember that we are not doctors, so these are only our thoughts & opinions. But we sure do wish you well. You do seem to have a very curable case -- which is the best news of all. Chuck",

      "Content": "I chose HD Brachy as a monotherapy. After less than a year of AS, my MRI biopsy showed more involvement and progression than the initial biopsy. Thought originally that I would do surgery, then got totally freaked out by the risk of the main side effects (incontinence and ED), so researched and found out about HD Brachy and the at-least-equal success rates to surgery, less downtime and less risk of SE's. I was not worried about having the complete post-surgical path report: I was confident enough that this therapy would rid me of the problem, and if it didn't there were still options for further radiation and/or hormone therapy (which is Plan B for the surgery guys anyway). Very happy with my choice: virtually no downtime and no SE's. You can read more about my experience if you look for posts under my screen name.

      "Content": "I chose HD Brachy as a monotherapy. After less than a year of AS, my MRI biopsy showed more involvement and progression than the initial biopsy. Thought originally that I would do surgery, then got totally freaked out by the risk of the main side effects (incontinence and ED), so researched and found out about HD Brachy and the at-least-equal success rates to surgery, less downtime and less risk of SE's. I was not worried about having the complete post-surgical path report: I was confident enough that this therapy would rid me of the problem, and if it didn't there were still options for further radiation and/or hormone therapy (which is Plan B for the surgery guys anyway). Very happy with my choice: virtually no downtime and no SE's. You can read more about my experience if you look for posts under my screen name.
