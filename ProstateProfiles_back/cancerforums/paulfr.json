      "Content": "I have high post RP PSA = 0.29 and rising with PSADT = 8 months. For several months now I have full body itching. Back, arms, upper legs, hands, etc. It often takes me 2 hours to get to sleep. During the day I am often itching my arms. I have read this is common for some cancers. What I am wondering is if this means I am now systemic and no longer a Salvage RT candidate. Anyone else have this itching ? I use ice cubes, peroxide and occasionally lotion to deal with it.",
