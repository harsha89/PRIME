      "Content": "Hi folks, Had a question for you guys...my brother just got back from having his physical and his PSA was 2.1, this was up from 0.9 last year (the first time he ever took a PSA). He is 40 years old and his doctor told him that while the increase was surprising he didn't think it was cause for concern and that no follow up was necessary. I guess the initial basline of 0.9 was enough to not concern his doc. Our Dad was dx when he was 65 so there's a family history. Is his doctor's advice sound? Should he request re-taking the test in a couple of months (perhaps after a course of anti-biotics)? Thanks in advance for your help!!!",

      "Content": "Thanks Fasteddie, First and foremost best of luck to you, sorry to hear about your dx. I figure the doc knows what he's doing and considering the follow up procedure is fairly simple I was surprised he took that position. I came on here to see if my logic/conclusion was sound. Anyone think my brother should just follow the doctor's orders (basically do nothing)? Thanks!!!",
