      "Content": "I'm 69 y.o. this June. In 2010 my PCP noticed my PSA was at 3.5 and recommended I see a Urologist. I did, and agreed to a biopsy, which detected an extremely small 0.8mm cancerous tissue in one one of the 12 biopsy samples. I decided on \"watchful waiting\" . I had another biopsy in 2012 which detected NOTHING, and a third in 2015 which again detected NOTHING. My PSA had increased to 5.5 as of Jan 2017, but I had a mild heart attack 4/02/17 and had a stent put in and started taking statin, blood thinner, and beta-blocker drugs. My next PSA test in July 2017 indicated PSA level at 3.5 and as of yesterday it is 3.8. So my Urologist wants to do another biopsy; he thinks one every 2-3 years is necessary. My heart doctor, and my regular PCP recommend not doing another biopsy unless my PSA increases dramatically to 8-10, given the negative findings the last two times. I tend to agree. Would you have a 4th biopsy given a >4 and holding PSA level, most recent 2 out of 3 biopsy's NEGATIVE, and 69 y.o. ? Is it simply a matter of how much uncertainty can you live with comfortably.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by DjinTonic Welcome P. Collen. I think ASA's suggestion of an mp-MRI is spot on. Something in your history has me curious. After the positive biopsy your PSA rose over 7 years from 3.5 to 5.5 and then came down to 3.5 (and then rose to 3.8 )? Was the drop explained? If your PSA fluctuated to that degree, why is the recent +0.3 increase of such concern? No explanation for the drop in PSA level..I did loose about 10 lbs through excercise and diet but nothing extra/special. No concern at all over the+0.3 fluctuation..just the fact.",
