      "Content": "Tim: I too was an early stage 1 with a Gleason 6. I am 68 years old and initially considered the seed implant therapy. In fact I started down that path with consultations and testing (MRI, complete body bone scan and prostate volumetric ultrasound). My prostate was found to be too large for an immediate implant so I underwent hormone therapy to shrink it. During that waiting period I investigated the Proton Therapy treatment on my own by networking with other proton patients, by online research and by reading the book \"You Can Beat Prostate Cancer and you don't need surgery to do it\" by Robert Marckini. Available at amazon.com. softback, very easy reading and about $15. I arranged a consultation at Procure (Proton Therapy Center in Warrenville, IL) near my home. see www.procure.com. Procure has several centers throughout the USA. I was completely satisfied with the center and treatment protocol. Subsequently I underwent the treatment program that is painless. I experienced no side affects during or after and continued my life style uninterrupted except for the time commitment to the treatment schedule. I strongly urge you to give yourself the benefit of a consultation at Procure before you proceed any further with a surgery plan. I have to say this also: your doctor may be pushing you towards surgery just because that is what he knows and is connected to in his medical institution. I was told this exact thing by others during my proton treatment program. I believe also that you have the benefit of time in that your cancer is early stage like mine was. Good luck.",
