      "Content": "I did kegals regularly up to one hundred per day pre-surgery.When i got the catheter removed i was only leaking enough to use one pad per day,one per night though neither was full just changed for comfort,then I started to do kegals as per instructions from doctor, but must have been over doing them and exhausting the muscle as I started leaking more and actually filled a pad during the day,not much fun and kinda of depressing!I then bought a digital food scale and started weighing my pads keeping a log of kegals done and amount leaked,I scaled back on kegals to every other day for seven days and saw a steady .3 oz decline in wieght per day which was very encouraging!I stayed away from spicy foods alchohol and caffiene during the whole time drank water and bland food as to not irratate my bladder.After seven days,seventeen days after cath. removed I woke with a dry pad!!One of the first signs of improvement seemed to be the ability to squirt the last few drops at end of urinating,that happened after a few days of cutting back.I have one cup of coffe per day now and dont leak but have to go often for first few hours after, can even have a couple beers but have to pay attention when bending or stretching or I will have a little dribble.every one seems to have a different routine prescribed by their surgeon so I believe you have to expirement a little and see what works best for you.I was only leaking about 2.5 oz per day .4 over night at the height of flow but it was not comfortable.I also walked 2 miles first thing in the morning.I hope this helps and encourages you when it finally ends you will barely remember how bad it was.Good luck mike",

      "Content": "I too experienced increased leakage from doing kegals but I think I may have been overdoing them ,I cut back a little and did them with less intensity and saw improvement.I have noticed that most people on this forum recieved differing advice from surgeons on the amount of kegals to be done and all of us have had different results.I kept a log of the weight of my pads and the number of kegals to see what worked best for me,also the things you eat and drink can make a dramatic difference alchohol,caffiene and for some reason brown gravy had me leaking like a fire hose,learn what affects you and avoid until you regain control,hang in there and things should improve. mike",

Hope it stays like this.Still a little sore when sitting very minor, abdominals starting to feel normal a little discomfort down low but feeling good,I slept in a zero gravity chair my brother sent me while in N.Y there was no way I could lay down in the bed or get out of the bed if I had to.Why did you have catheter in for twelve days?Any special reason or is that what your doc does?",

      "Content": "Hi delawerean,I would seriously consider getting a room in new york for a couple of days!!I had my surgery on july 18th in new york Istayed for thirteen days after the surgery at the Hope Lodge wich is run by the american cancer society fo free,and i gotta tell you after the cab ride from the hospital three and a half miles to the lodge I cant even imagine a few hours on the train.My stomach muscles were useless for a few days after surgery and the tenderness felt when sitting down wasnt great either,do yourself a favor and look into staying for as long as you can.Who are you having the surgery with?Mine was done by Dr.David Samadi and Icouldnt be happier with my results!Best of luck to you",

      "Content": "Hi Fran,Im 46.The first week was probably the worst as far as continence,I was walking 3 to 5 miles per day in new york city about the fourth day after cath removal but still didnt fill one pad per day.After ten days amount was decreasing by .3 ounces per day + or - and today i woke with totally dry pad.I walked 2 miles and the pad weighed the same at the end of the walk as when i started,the only time I wore a pad today!! Hope it stays like this.Still a little sore when sitting very minor, abdominals starting to feel normal a little discomfort down low but feeling good,I slept in a zero gravity chair my brother sent me while in N.Y there was no way I could lay down in the bed or get out of the bed if I had to.Why did you have catheter in for twelve days?Any special reason or is that what your doc does?",
