    "Content": "My father was recently diagnosed with prostate cancer. About 3 weeks ago he was having trouble with urinating and asked to see a dr. Dr performed a dre and said it was hard and bumpy. He then took a psa which came back at 32. Since then he has had a ct scan which came back totally unremarkable. An MRI which showed a carcinoma covering most of the prostate and extending into the seminal vesicles. Rectum clean. There is one lymph node that was .8 cm which the dr said we should monitor but was under the standard 1 cm for true suspicion. Biopsy 4+5=9 Gleason with all 12. Cores positive. Bone scan clean no bone mets. Father is 68 and in perfect health otherwise We have had a lot of different medical opinions and are really confused. We know his cancer is very serious and drs have all have classified it as locally advanced but have all given us different treatment options. 1. Hormone therapy followed by radiation 2. Hormone therapy and doxataxal for 20 weeks followed by surgery 3. Hormone therapy followed by surgery and then radiation Need advice and hopefully experiences with other people that have had this stage of prostate cancer. Thank you so much",
