      "Content": "I think I'm going to have to get more assertive, so far these dr.s cut me off when I try to describe what I'm experiancing. Side effects are so bad some days I can't hardly drag myself off the couch, it's usually after a nite of having to hit the bathroom 7-8 times besides the flushing and I swear some days I ache in every joint in my body. Add to that the feeling of being lower than whale poo.",

      "Content": "Hello, Brand new to this forum, have been spending hours trying to determine which direction to take on this subject. Have Gleason 9 Pcancer and have been on Lupron for 6 mo. with pretty much every bad side effect that comes with this drug. My problem is I've tried to get an orchiectomy and have been told by two Dr. it won't change my situation. I can and have dealt with the hot flashes, wt. gain and at 69 impotence isn't a concern but the joint pain, extreme fatigue and just overall crappy feeling are really getting me down. I'd really like to hear from those who've had direct experience with the side effects of orchiectomy. BTW I have no problem giving up my \"manhood\" if it will improve my quality of life.",

      "Content": "Haven't yet other than the initial firmagon injection. First uro basically just told me to suck it up and onc told me what I was experiancing was just \"normal\". Have an appointment with a new uro and he is in a Duluth clinic with a very highly qualified onc so I have some optimism. Had my rad onc tell me it sounded like Orchiectomy was \"a viable option\", he said he would write a referral to the surgeon I had lined up but then told the surgeon's nurse \"he didn't recommend it. I've not had very good experience with Dr.s so far.",
