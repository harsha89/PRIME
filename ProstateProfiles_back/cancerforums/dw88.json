      "Content": "Greetings everyone, I've recently had a check-up with my GP due to long term urination tract symptoms. GP did a DRE which is negative with a mildly enlarged prostate and ordered two consecutive PSA tests within 4 weeks. Results returned at 5.3 and 5.6 for both time and with free PSA of 6% at the second time. My question is, with my multiple years of urinary tract symptom and mild pelvis and testicle pain syndrome, what is the odd of the elevated PSA being caused by prostatitis but not the PCa? Could the urinary tract symptom be a sign of PCa progress for an extended period of time. Or is it possible both causes combined to contribute to the PSA elevation? After being on antibiotics for about two weeks, I am seeing a URO in a few days. But really concerns what to do next as to either an 3t-MRI, a biopsy or simply wait and repeat the PSA test be the best course of action. Appreciated if anyone could offer an advice.

      "Content": "Hi Everyone, I'm so grateful to have so many responses from all you guys. All great advice and thank you. As far as my age, I am 48. First time taking the PSA test and found the result being elevated considerably for my age. I am hoping that the antibiotics works which turns off the alarm. But others suggested that antibiotics may or may not work even when the chronic prostatitis case is presented. It seems to me that a Sonogram or MRI might be a reasonable step before a biopsy. That said, I am not sure which is better as an imaging tool to detect PCa between MRI and Ultrasound. I'd like to hear if you guys have any opinions. My other concern is being with LUTS and pelvic pains for a prolonged period time, in the case that the symptoms were indeed caused by PCa, will it be likely that the PCa is at rather late stages. Again thank you so much guys. Blessings to all of you.",
