      "Content": "Hi Tom, Wish you were not here. Before you do surgery, you should get a look at the biopsy report to see whether the % cancer was low meaning 5-10% or high meaning 50%+ since those numbers will influence the better choice for you. The cost of getting a second opinion on your biopsy is low, and the importance of accuracy is high, so on a cost-effectiveness scale, you want to confirm that you indeed have a 6. I suggest that you research the Side Effects of the alternate remedies. A good number of surgeons focus on successful removal of cancer, and don't spend much time telling you that, on average, their patients have 50% rate of either incontinence or impotence. You should have a good grasp of the pluses and minuses of Active Surveillance, seeds, and even my therapy, HIFU, before you select surgery. Good Luck",

      "Content": "DMD I suspect that if we surveyed PCa patients, only a small % would have had your symptoms at the time of diagnosis. For most of us, the first sign of a problem was numbers on a piece of paper. As an amateur guess, perhaps BPH and perhaps prostatitis, but I would not get too excited about prostate cancer until and unless you get the piece of paper and the numbers are unwelcome. Not that the other two diseases are minor, but they are more readily treated with fewer systemic issues. Also, in almost all circumstances, a month's delay has no impact on effectiveness of treatment/progression of the disease. Don't put it off to 2014, but don't sweat the month Good luck",

So excuse us for hoping that you're sick, and therefore not eligible for club membership. Prostatitis, BTW, is reported by all to be a bear to cure, so don't be surprised is 7 days of antibiotics doesn't get it done.",
