      "Content": "Originally Posted by Michael F Welcome undecided! It is very important to not overthink your status or assume the worst. Since you have an established history of prostate issues it is behond time to be seen by a good URO MD. Dj has provided excellent guidance as always. A Free PSA = 9% suggests an elevated risk of harboring prostate cancer (PCa) but is in no way diagnostic. Your URO MD is suggesting a biomarker test which will provide an additional risk assessment. Be sure to determine in advance if your insurance will pay for the test and what your out of pocket responsibilities will be. If me and I had to choose between the biomarker test and the MRI, I would opt for the MRI. I would make certain that the MRI was done at a facility that specializes in PCa and was interpreted by an experienced URO Radiologist. Also ask your URO MD about having a MP 3T MRI that can be Fused with a subsequent TRUS Biopsy if any areas of suspicion are detected. Again, you will have to check if the MRI will be reimbursed. What was the result of your Digital Rectal Exam (DRE)? Take it one step at a time and keep a close eye on your PSA and follow expert MD guidance. Keep asking questions and demand correct answers that you fully understand. Good luck! Keep us updated. MF Thx guys, all very helpful. The DRE was clear he just said the prostate was big for someone my age but I got the same feedback when I had it done once before 7-8 years ago.",
