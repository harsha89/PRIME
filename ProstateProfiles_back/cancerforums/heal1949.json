      "Content": "Originally Posted by newporter heal1949, I wasn't going to respond to your post because I just don't see any benefits of the so call Budwig protocol. I was unable to find any clinical evidences (clinical trials, studies in medical journals...) that it has any benefits. But since you posted your father's case history, I thought it maybe helpful for me to give you my layperson's opinions. First of all I am very surprised that with a post op PSA of .46 his MD, instead of adding additional medications wanted him to get off hormone and do what? If the answer is Budwig, he needs to run and find another MD to help him with his cancer recurrence. There are lot's of options including salvage radiation, combining hormone with chemo, etc., if he is willing to go that route. Second, as for diet supplements, there may be others but the only supplements/diets I am aware of that had gone through clinical trials and showed some promises were pomegranate juice and a supplement combining pomegranate, broccoli, green tea and turmeric extracts. But even there, the evidences were not strong. A recent clinical trial of pomegranate extract vs placebo showed no evidence that pomegranate extract did anything different than the placebo pills. So, my advice is go get a second opinion from another oncologist who specializes in treating prostate cancer, eat a healthy diet and exercise to keep him fit so he can take on the rigor of treatment protocols. He is in a fight and needs to be healthy to keep cancer at bay. Good luck and best wishes to your dad. Thanks for taking the time to reply. I was not clear. My apologies. The MD oncologist wants him off the hormonal treatment because they think cancer may have spread. But because of the hormonal effect and low PSA, they can not pin out out where, if at all. Our prayers are that it has not spread. In 2 months time, he needs to take PSA tests again. As far as alternative meds are concerned, this is 'self medication'. I had wanted to get thoughts on this but he is doing his research. I am helping out of course but the only points to take home from them is a health aspect - which you have pointed out. Good health and exercise. The doctors are therefore want to see what is exactly going on in his body. Reason for this is that the doctor who operated (radical operation) + gave immediate hormonal therapy is different from the current one. The latter would never have given hormones right after the operation and is therefore wanting to understand what is going on. Talking of health and diet, any advise on where to turn to for what is best to do why we wait to next PSA reading. Books talk about no grain of any kind, detoxing, alkalising, juicing. Any thoughts on this? Or how to help body fight cancer with no medicines - at the moment?",
