      "Content": "I've been reading a lot of conflicting information about almost everything related to prostate cancer. One of concern that might have validity is the claim that cancer cells will be released into the bloodstream or elsewhere during a biopsy and find a new home to grow within the body. It would follow to perceive if the test will someday be declared dangerous and we, of this generation, will be the guinea pigs to have learned that on. Is it valid to assume that biopsies may introduce a risk of spreading the cancerous cells?",

I especially appreciate the straightforward comments and feel a lot can be learned by following those that have been on the road I'm just starting on. I'm 62 and in generally good health. Because of a rising PSA (it was 2 for eons and a routine annual test and retest was 6 and 7) my PCP sent me to a urologist. DRE was unremarkable. A biopsy was done. 12 cores, 2 positive, one at 5% and the other at 10%. Gleason 3+3=6. No other information. Only another PSA in 6 months is planned. The urologist suggested I see an oncologist, my PCP didn't think that was necessary. Lots of cancer in the family including two cousins with breast cancer in their 30's, another cousin has a prostecomy at age 59 and my dad died in '63 of stomach and likely other undiagnosed cancer(s) at age 47. Although the numbers are low and I'm told it's minimal risk, I am concerned about it spreading and don't know what I should be looking for. For instance, if it spreads to the bones I'm reading of bone pain but don't know what that means. Do bones ache? Forgive my ignorance. What does one watch for regarding bone, liver and other organs affected by the spread of prostate cancer. Is there anything else I should be doing at this time, except waiting 6 months for another PSA and DRE? Been reading as much as I can about it and there's so much conflicting information... Best.",
