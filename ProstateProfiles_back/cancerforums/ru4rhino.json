    "Content": "On Thursday I got the results of my biopsy and the results were all 7's 4+3 and a 8 4+4 on the left side and 6's and 7's on the right with 3 +3 with one perinueral invasion. I now have to figure out what type of treatment. I was wondering if anyone else has had the similar results and what was suggested to them. I'm not very happy with my urologist, because I had to ask for a copy of the results of the biopsy and look up the info online.",
