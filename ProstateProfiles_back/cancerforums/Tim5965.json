    "Content": "It seems that I have mostly had good news but my surgeon says I have a high probability of recurrence. Diagnosed 18 months ago with Gleason 9, 11/12 biopsy cores >50%, PSA 23. Some seminal vessical invasion and extraprostatic extension. Had six months of Lupron and Zytiga, PSA immediately came down to .3 and then to .2, Radical Prostatectomy on March 1. 24 lymph nodes clear and negative margins. PSA of zero at 30 days and zero again at 5 months. My testosterone is only 12 after 5 months so I guess that could be keeping my PSA at zero but that it\u0092s likely to reappear as testosterone recovers. Does that sound right?",
