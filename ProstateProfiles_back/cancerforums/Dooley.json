Nerve sparing is not going to improve my ability to achieve erection? So, does that mean I tell my surgeon not to spare the nerves? PNI is indicated on 2 or 3 of my positive cores. Intraductal spread indicated on 6 out of 6 positive cores. If I'm already impotent, and DaVinci won't change that, is nerve sparing in my case a bad idea? I have never tried any ED meds... perhaps I need to look into that now, pre-op?",

      "Content": "I had issues with ED for years prior to getting BPH symptoms. In retrospect, I have realized that about the same time my BPH symptoms worsened, my sleeping patterns changed... a lot. Three years ago, I slept for 7 or 8 hours, woke refreshed and ready to go. About two years ago, as my BPH symptoms got more pronounced, I started sleeping longer, felt fatigued and started taking naps as well. By the time of my recent biopsy which was positive 4+3 with PNI, I sleep for 9, 10, even 12 hours and take almost daily long naps when not working. I get very fatigued even when not doing anything exerting. Can undiagnosed PC cause this kind of fatigue? Should I be looking for another cause of fatigue if this is not a symptom of PC? I know other cancers can cause fatigue, but was under the impression that it isn't a common symptom of undiagnosed PC. Has anyone else experienced this?",

      "Content": "I have a hard time accepting that my fatigue isn't PC related... I found these two things on line: Research into how cancers cause fatigue In many cancers, levels of chemicals that cells use to communicate are increased. These are called cytokines. Researchers are investigating the link between cytokines and fatigue. Cytokines include interleukins and a chemical called tumour necrosis factor (TNF). The higher than normal levels of cytokines could cause fatigue by affecting hormones and chemicals that nerves use to communicate. Interferon is a biological therapy that causes tiredness and this may be due to increasing the production of interleukin and TNF in the body. All body chemicals are finely balanced and any upset in one area can easily affect another. This theory has been suggested to explain chronic fatigue syndrome (ME) and could also apply to cancer. Biomed Pharmacother. 2012 Jul;66(5):330-3. doi: 10.1016/j.biopha.2012.03.004. Epub 2012 Mar 26. Human prostate cancer cells induce inflammatory cytokine secretion by peripheral blood mononuclear cells. Salman H1, Ori Y, Bergman M, Djaldetti M, Bessler H. Author information Abstract A substantial number of studies provide evidence that inflammation may play a significant role in the pathogenesis of prostate cancer via increased activity of inflammatory cytokines, particularly IL-6. We have previously shown that peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) are capable of carrying out an in vitro \"immunomodulatory dialog\" with colon cancer cells expressed by an increased production of pro-inflammatory cytokines by PBMC. The aim of the current study was to examine the model of cell-to-cell interaction between PBMC and prostate cancer cells from two lines - androgen resistant (PC-3) and androgen-dependent (LNCaP). For that purpose, cancer cells from both lines were incubated with PBMC, and cytokine secretion by PBMC was evaluated. The results showed a cell-concentration dependent increase in secretion of the pro-inflammatory cytokine IL-6 by PBMC induced by cells from both lines, whereas generation of IL-1Î² and the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 were found to be increased after incubation with PC-3 cells only. The secretion of IL-10 was slightly lower following incubation of PBMC with supernatants derived from PC-3 cells. The results of the study support the possibility that prostate cancer cell-induced cytokine production by PBMC, and particularly IL-6, are involved in prostate cancer development. The discrepancy between the effect of the two prostate cancer cell lines on cytokine secretion by PBMC may be due to their different androgen dependency. I'll discuss it with my doc at my treatment decision appointment. The timing of my BPH symptoms and fatigue were simultaneous. Perhaps it is a low frequency side effect of PC, hard to explain it otherwise.",

If I was concerned and in your shoes I would have your PCP refer you to the VA hospital in Philly or wherever you might find a experienced surgeon affiliated with an academic center. Thanks to all for the advice. This doctor is an out of VA network urologist in a private practice with another urologist. I was referred out of VA network which was fine with me. I've been virtually impotent for some time, after about 5 or 6 years of significant ED. Zero libido. No erections now. No semen as far as I can tell too. Almost zero ejaculate of any kind, although with a lot of coaxing, can still orgasm. I'm single and am not real concerned about remaining impotent. Long term incontinence is my biggest concern. I also suspect it may not have been contained within the gland and feel strongly that radiation be reserved as a salvage therapy. Despite having only two cores that are 4+3 with PNI, givin my symptoms of fatigue, which started about the same time as my BPH symptoms two years ago, frankly I expect that my post op biopsy will show the C is not confined to the gland, although I surely hope that it, is.
