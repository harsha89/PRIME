    "Content": "Hi all, Because it was my first visit since moving to a new town, my doctor asked me in December if everything was ok with my health. I told him about an ongoing urinary issue which has been annoying me for probably 10 years or more. He gave me its name - urgency incontinence. \"Have you had your prostate checked lately?\" he asked. \"Not for ten years.\" \"Up on the bed!\" \"That is not normal, you need a biopsy.\" Urologist: \"We do have to do something\" (explaining the Gleason score 4+3=7) \"I'm not supposed to give you advice but if it was me I'd go for the operation.\" He also prescribed Siterone Cyproterone (testosterone lowering). Because of my work with lifestyle medicine I decided to go on a strictly plant-based diet - no animal products. I then waited a month before deciding to try the drug (half the dose recommended). My PSA went down from 2.5 to .015 in 2 months. My weight also dropped 5 kgs (I'm already skinny). Urologist/Surgeon: \"Operation went smoothly. You definitely needed the op. Cancer all through the gland.\" Surgeon 4 days later: \"It appears we missed a few cells on one margin. We will follow up with PSA tests and if it rises we will consider 1 dose of radiation.\" Today: I'm incontinent and impotent. I'm waiting in hope since I'm assured that it can take several months to regain continence. They don't offer much hope for erections. I read two very good books before my operation (Patrick Walsh's \"Guide to Surviving Prostate Cancer\" and \"Invasion of the Prostate Snatchers\" - Blum/Scholz). Deciding for surgery was the toughest decision I've ever had to make.",
