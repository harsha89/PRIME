      "Content": "Originally Posted by yolli71 I just had my first PSA test done last week after I had robotic surgery on Nov. 12 (3 months ago). Gleason ended up being 3+4 after surgery (biopsy said 3+3). I was supposed to meet with my urologist to discuss it tomorrow, but unfortunately we expect to get some bad weather here tomorrow (DC area) so my urologist cancelled my appointment. That being said, my PSA score was still recorded in my online medical records and it showed my PSA as: <0.100 ng/mL This has me a little alarmed as everything I've been reading says the first PSA test should be around 0, or at worst. .01 - .09. I called and left a message for my urologist but have yet to hear back from him. Does this mean the surgery was unsuccessful? Is it possible the test was inaccurate? Or should I not be concerned with .1 even though that sounds a little high (to me)for just having surgery 3 months ago? Any advice would be appreciated! Request an uPsa. A single digit psa test after RP doesn't provide the required info. But you have a good pathology and the \"<\" sign so you're fine. Celebrate.",

      "Content": "I've too have exhausted my curative options, so the uPsa is probably no longer needed. But my uro still uses it. And I also would prefer to decide for myself whether or not to have anxiety. For those of us who've had adverse pathology factors after surgery, i.e. positive margins, high volume involvement, EPE, LN, etc. the likelihood of needing additional treatment is much higher. The uPsa helps to establish earlier whether there is an upward trend. Earlier response with secondary treatment seems to have better results, (I've been told). But after SRT, there probably isn't any benefit to using a uPsa for a regular test.",

      "Content": "I've too have exhausted my curative options, so the uPsa is probably no longer needed. But my uro still uses it. And I also would prefer to decide for myself whether or not to have anxiety. For those of us who've had adverse pathology factors after surgery, i.e. positive margins, high volume involvement, EPE, LN, etc. the likelihood of needing additional treatment is much higher. The uPsa helps to establish earlier whether there is an upward trend. Earlier response with secondary treatment seems to have better results, (I've been told). But after SRT, there probably isn't any benefit to using a uPsa for a regular test.",

If I had been in a POS or HMO plan I might have had difficulty, but I'm not sure. I interviewed Methodist and MDA for SRT. The Methodist RO was more aggressive, i.e. suggested HT and wanted to nuke some nodes. The MDA RO said it wasn't necessary. So I chose MDA, (and also because she had 35+ years of SRT experience).",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by Ready2Fight Such a good question that I'd be interested in knowing and I should have thought to ask thank you so much Michael F. My uro doc normally suggests to pull the trigger at .03. My pathology, (multiple positive margins, high volume G7) suggested BCR was inevitable and the RO's agreed. I think the uro and RO's just indicated BCR on the insurance forms, but I'm not sure. I had no issues with insurance. I am in a PPO plan with BCBS of TX. So I don't think I needed pre-authorization. If I had been in a POS or HMO plan I might have had difficulty, but I'm not sure. I interviewed Methodist and MDA for SRT. The Methodist RO was more aggressive, i.e. suggested HT and wanted to nuke some nodes. The MDA RO said it wasn't necessary. So I chose MDA, (and also because she had 35+ years of SRT experience).",
