      "Content": "I am a 67 year old in generally good health. A recent urinalysis showed blood in the urine (1+) and I was referred to a urologist. A second urinalysis came back 1+, but a subsequent one was clear. The DRE showed an area of firmness on the prostate. Additional symptoms were frequent urination, weak urine flow and sense of needing to go again almost immediately after urinating. I was treated with two rounds of antibiotics which showed some improvement, but firmness remained as did all of the symptoms, though with improvement. At my last appointment, the urologist recommended a biopsy. After the DRE at that appointment, they drew blood for a PSA. The result came back at 5.7. I asked to have it redone when I had not had a DRE that day, and the result came back at 4.2. In March of 2015, the PSA was 2.3. Although I initially agreed to the biopsy, my inclination now is to wait and monitor it for a while. My reasons include: 1. Results of PSAs don't seem to have a direct relationship to whether you have cancer, either from high or low scores. 2. Although the PSA velocity seems very high, it could be the result of prostatitis rather than cancer. 3. Antibiotics did provide some relief of symptoms. 4. I have had a history of periodic blood in urine and prostatitis. My last treatment for it was about 5 years ago. 5. There is no known history of prostate cancer in my family. 6. At my age, slow growing prostate cancer may not kill me before other things do. 7. Most biopsys seem to come back negative, and there is a small risk of complications, some serious, from the biopsy. The urologist said \"If you were my brother, I would tell you to get the biopsy.\" Although I appreciate that input, it hasn't really changed my mind. We agreed to leave the biopsy on the schedule for later in March, but that I would call back with a final decision. I know there is no definitive answer, and no one here can say with certainty what the right choice would be. But more input is always better to me than less.",
