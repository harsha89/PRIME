      "Content": "I'm 76 years old. I've had ED for about 5 years now with about 50% erection. It's been coming on for 20-30 years. I cannot penetrate now. Cialis and Viagra have no effect on me. It did 10 -15 years ago but not now. I don't have much libido now but my wife insists on occasional sex maybe once every couple of weeks. My wife is 17 years younger than me. She is able to arouse me manually and I do have mostly weak orgasms and I reciprocate with her. Also I have enlarged prostate which is seriously interfering with my urine flow. It's really bad for the last year. Sometimes really painful. I've been taking various saw palmetto formulas but lately not as effective. I got a PSA test for the first time around nov last year at Anylabtest company and it was 65. So a month later I went to urologist in Missouri to get a check up. They did another Psa and it was the same. Also the DRE the doc said soft on one side and firmer on the other side. They said I have a 50% chance of cancer. Since I only have medicare part A and not part B it was too expensive for me to proceed with more tests since I have to pay out of pocket. Also since I have no symptoms other then difficulty urinating I am holding off on doing anything more for the time being. I had to pay $500- a lot for me. I had another PSA in Apr this year ($49 at Anylabtest but they only did total PSA not free PSA) and the result was the same 65. Next time I'll also get the free PSA. I'm in pretty good health other wise and exercise regularly. I try to follow the paleo diet-no carbs except green veggies but plenty of meat and animal fat and coconut oil. I've lost 25 pounds in the last 2 years and plan to lose about 10 more. I'm 170 now. So have you heard of anyone with my high PSA who is asymptomatic except for urinating problem? Do you think I have cancer? and if my PSA hasn't changed in 6 months maybe I can just let it go. Thanks for anyone's opinion.",

      "Content": "Thank you all for your feedback. I didn't get Medicare part B cause I've been living in Hong Kong the last 30 years. Hong Kong does have relatively free medical but long waiting lists and I'm not sure of their proficiency. I've heard mixed info - some good some bad. I've just spent the last year and a half in the States mostly visiting my two daughters - one in New York one in Missouri. Our funds are low but my PT daughter in NY helps out occasionally. So I've got options as to how to proceed. I'll keep you all posted and thanks again for all your great comments. I'm back in Hong Kong right now.",
