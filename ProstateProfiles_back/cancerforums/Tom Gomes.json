      "Content": "It's been a long journey for me. Prior to my diagnosis, I was exposed to lot of negative prostate cancer discussions regarding the value of the PSA test and specifically, patients being over treated. Because of this, my initial high PSA reading was more an annoyance than a fear to me. I was referred to a urologist and she suggested a biopsy. My initial PSA was 8.1 and then corrected to a 4.8 with two weeks of antibiotics. I have no symptoms and a normal size prostate. I very reluctantly agreed to a biopsy. It was January 2012 for my initial reading and the Biopsy occurred at the end of July and resulted in one core of 3+4 and several 3+3. I had a subsequent Endorectal MRI that was negative. When the urologist suggested the biopsy, I began to take this whole prostate issue more seriously and started doing a lot of reading and research. I was mostly influenced by a book by Dr Aaron Katz. He clearly explained all the issues and therapys and I was very intrigued by his \"Holistic Therapy\". In fact, I actually started taking his recommended supplements, changed my diet to \"Organic\" and began a strong exercise routine and am still following this routine today. I have never been a vitamin/supplement kind of guy and was skeptical, but I figured that the only downside is the cost of the supplements. I figured that this approach was like active surveillance with an improved lifestyle. Even if I decide on a procedure in the future, I felt that I would respond to the treatment much better if I was in optimal physical condition. After reading many sad stories of men like me whose cancers progressed made me reconsider possible treatment. I began to worry that I may have waited too long and missed my early detection opportunity to rid my body of this cancer. My reluctance to choose any treatment was because of my fear of the side effects (Quality of Life). It seems that most treatments had trade offs and probable side effects. In December, I came across two new (new to me) treatments. Proton therapy at Loma Linda and HDR Monotherapy at UCLA. I read two books on Proton therapy and was almost sold. I live in Sacramento, so I decided to visit both Loma Linda and UCLA . It is about a six hour drive from Sacramento to these locations. I can expand upon my decision at another time, but will simply say that HDR Treatment at UCLA was a clear winner and I have scheduled treatment for February 27th. Although, somewhat invasive, I felt that because this treatment offered a 95% cure rate and very minimal side effects (if any) and was administered by one of the top medical/urology Centers (UCLA) in the Country/World\u0085that this was the way to go for me. With all that said, I must add a very intriguing part of my story. Getting back to the \"holistic approach\".......my PSA at the time of my biopsy (July 2012) was 5. My next PSA reading came DOWN to 3.8 in November 2012 and guess what?? My PSA came DOWN to a 3.0 in late January. I am still fully committed to my HDR treatment but am very intrigued by my lowered PSA reading. Did the holistic approach actually shrink my cancer...or merely mask the PSA reading? I have read that PSA does not go down without treatment. Regardless, my lowered PSA has to be very positive to my treatment plan and recovery. I would appreciate any comments and will post results as I progress through my therapy.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by HighlanderCFH Hi, Sorry to hear you are no longer a candidate for AS, not with some Gleason grade 4 involved. Also sorry you have joined the club here. Can you tell us your age and your PSA history? One \"good\" thing about your Gleason 7 score is that it is 3+4 instead of 4+3. If you are not familiar with how Gleason scores work, the primary type of cancer cell is identified with the first number and the secondary type is the second number. They add the two numbers together to give the Gleason SCORE. Gleason grades range from 1 through 5 with the lower the numbers the less aggressive. Anything with grade 3 or less is considered low risk. Grades 4 & 5 are more aggressive. In turn, Gleason scores of 6 or less (the combination of the two numbers) are considered low risk. A Gleason 7 is a moderately aggressive form. Scores 8-9-10 are increasingly aggressive as the numbers go up. So your 3+4=7 score means that most of the cancer cells are the less aggressive 3. But, with those grade 4 cells in there, the reasoning for AS pretty much fades out in favor of some form of treatment. You are doing the right thing in visiting a radiation oncologist. It's best to seek a highly experienced one so you can learn all the pros & cons of the different forms of radiation treatments and how they might apply to your case. Be sure that the surgeon you are seeing is also highly experienced. A minimum of 300 previous cases is what you should look for. Others here will probably have info on proton therapy. Wishing you the best of luck! Chuck Your numbers are similar to mine. I went to Loma Linda and talked with their Doctor. I also went to UCLA and spoke with their radiologist about HDR Monotherapy and overwhelmingly chose UCLA. I am 4 weeks post procedure and have very minimal side effects remaining. I urge you to google UCLA HDR Monotherapy. My insurance covered it all and their 8 year success is 96%.",

      "Content": "I have been implementing Dr Katz holistic therapy since last August. If you read his book \"The Definitive Guide to Prostate Cancer: Everything You Need to Know about Conventional and Integrative Therapies\", you'll have a much better understanding of why these supplements were chosen. I believe that a strong exercise program and diet (I chose organic foods) are equally important. Last Spring, my PSA was 8.0, then corrected to 4.8 with antibiotics. In July, my biopsy showed 6 cores at 3+3 and 1 core at 3+4. I thought surgery was way over treatment and did not want to be tethered to diapers for the rest of my life. I began the holistic therapy in August. My first PSA in November was 3.8 and then 3.0 in February. In the meantime, I decided on a newer Brachytherapy (HDR Monotherapy, radioactive seeds are removed)...completed in April...no side effects remaining at this point....and waiting for PSA test in July. I feel the the holistic therapy is just as important post therapy as ever. One of the important supplements recommended by Dr Katz (GCP) was used in an independent 2013 research article where GCP was tested successfully for advanced prostate cancer, please go to http://www.ucdmc.ucdavis.edu/publish/news/newsroom/7503",

I am 3 weeks post Brachytherapy (HDR from UCLA). They put me on Flomax about a month prior to my therapy with the intention of switching to Cialis. I have now switched to Cialis. They indicated that I would be on Cialis for 6 months or longer. My flow seems to be pretty close to normal at this point. Erections seem normal as well.",

I read awful stories all the time on this forum. Last night I read where one man can not sleep at night because he has to urinate hourly if fear of waking up in a pool of urine. Horrible sexual issues are abundant. I consider you blessed with the gleason scores you have. Because of your low cancer risk, you have many options open to you that would not compromise your \"Quality of Life\" and would be equally effective in ridding your body of this disease. My advice (you have plenty of time) is to talk to many doctors to get different perspectives. I met with 6 different doctors and learned so much. I just finished my chosen therapy , HDR (High Dose Radiation) Monotherapy at UCLA about two + weeks ago. I can honestly tell you that I am about 90%+ recovered (including Sexual Function) with minimal side effects that are improving daily. I've been working out at the gym, riding my bike and feel great. My therapy also shows a 96% success rate after 8 years. By success rate, I mean that subsequent PSA scores are within standardized limits.",
