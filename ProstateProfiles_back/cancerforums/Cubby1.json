I have had a bone scan which detected wear in my hips and said that there is no definite evidence of bony metastasis. I was previously scheduled for an MRI because of hip pain and will keep that appointment which is schedule May 13th. I believe my father passed away from prostate cancer more than 50 years ago.",

      "Content": "I was diagnosed with prostate cancer about 4 weeks ago. I am 68 years old in generally good health. I do have high blood pressure and take medication for it. It seems to be under control. My PSA was 5.2 and I was referred to the prostate clinic. They said that I had prostate cancer. My gleason score is 3 + 4 = 7. I am stage T2b and from 12 cells that were biopsied, I had 30% of the more aggressive type cancer in 1 of the 12 cells. I was told that I should be doing something and met with the oncologist and urologist to discuss brachytherapy and surgery (radical prostatectomy). I still have a few questions but would like to know how others decided and do they check the margins during surgery to see if any cancer remains. Any other information or thoughts would be greatly appreciated.",
