      "Content": "Me being diagnosed with PC has everyone shocked including me. I have no kids and the thought of not being able to have kids scares me, unless I bank my sperm. I am curious if having spent 15 months in Afghanistan has anything to do with the cause of the PC? Also I have a possible job coming up that would require me to leave the country for 3 1/2 months at a time and home for 35 days and back again. What is the recovery time for PC surgery? Also is a weak bladder and leakage common? I told the Doc I wanted to wait at least a year or two and then treat it because I don't want to miss this job opportunity. But I'll see what he says when I go in for our talk on the 21st of this month.",

      "Content": "Me being diagnosed with PC has everyone shocked including me. I have no kids and the thought of not being able to have kids scares me, unless I bank my sperm. I am curious if having spent 15 months in Afghanistan has anything to do with the cause of the PC? Also I have a possible job coming up that would require me to leave the country for 3 1/2 months at a time and home for 35 days and back again. What is the recovery time for PC surgery? Also is a weak bladder and leakage common? I told the Doc I wanted to wait at least a year or two and then treat it because I don't want to miss this job opportunity. But I'll see what he says when I go in for our talk on the 21st of this month.",
