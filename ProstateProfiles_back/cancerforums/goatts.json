      "Content": "Met with doctor following biopsy on Thursday. Going for bone scan and MRI next Friday. My doctor is a Urogynecologist. He referred me to another doctor who is a urologist and was his university professor to read the scans when they're done. The more I think about this the more I get nervous. Is this standard practice or does he expect the worst by referring me to someone more experienced? He was also discussing debulking and we don't even know for sure that it's spread yet. Why would he do that. Just preparing me for the worst? He said he wants to take an aggressive approach. Thanks in advance for you input. You guys have been extremely helpful.",

Hard to believe a pill that costs .05 cents to produce sells for $15.00 but with some drugs apparently that is the case. Generic manufacturers do not have to absorb any of the R&D cost to develop it, so get away like a bandit. Allen One of my neighbors has been ordering meds from Canada online due to greatly reduced cost. By the way I hate Flowmax, only took it once, it did work and it was generic. Generally the generics are just as good.",

Can anyone give an approximation of how long I should expect to be off work? I am a self employed Handyman, so lots of lifting,bending and climbing. I am in ok shape for 59. Alot of wear and tear for the 40+ years of physical labor though. Any input would be appreciated. I am also self employed so I chose radiation/ADT. Both have similar cure rates.",
