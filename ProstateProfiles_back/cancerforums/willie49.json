      "Content": "Thank you Djjin Tonic! I may have caused confusion as I was posting on behalf of my wife with the liver lesion question (we appear to be quite the pair). As for my prostate cancer, I recently received my MRI results that show a Pi-RADS score of 2, so the dr. has recommended active surveillance for 1 year. Hopefully, there is no change. I have had mixed feelings about whether or not to just remove it now while I am young and otherwise healthy or keep my prostate as long as I can! Thanks again!!",

      "Content": "Hello, I am posting on behalf of my husband who is very concerned about his PSA results. For the past 18 months his PSA has been monitored. The first result was just over 5, 6 months later, it was just over 7, the next test it dropped slightly to just above 5 again. He had the test done again last week, result was 9.7 <4 ug/L; PSAfree 1.49 ug/L and PSA free total is .15 I am most certain the urologist will perform a biopsy which we are insisting on even he doesn't recommend it. Based on all of your experience here, any thoughts on the latest results? Thank you so much",
