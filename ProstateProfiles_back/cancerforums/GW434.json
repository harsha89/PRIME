      "Content": "Thank you all for your advice. I was going in for a PSA test this morning, but since I had a DRE yesterday, I will follow HighlanderCFH's advice and wait a few days. Thank you for that! Anyway, during the initial doctor visit (UCLA), while stressing that it was \"probably not cancer\", I asked (hypthetically) what he would advise his brother (if he had a brother). He said that he would advise him to go ahead to have the biopsy done. However, after reading the remarks posted here, I think I'll wait until next week and have another PSA test taken. If the results are elevated, then I will most likely get it done. If the results are somewhat static, then I'll wait until my next appointment in July. Opinions?",

So, I'm really back where I started! UCLA wanted to perform \"barnyard medicine\" by doing the biopsy in the office with an injection of lidocaine (I freaked out about that). At least Cedars will put me under and I will avoid most anxiety. Based on the probabilities stated above, are there any opinions out there of similar situations? More info: Recent PSA 1.7 Prostate is not enlarged. Doctor stated that even with those good numbers and based on the other findings, cancer occurs in about 25% of similar cases.",

      "Content": "Thank you all for your advice. I was going in for a PSA test this morning, but since I had a DRE yesterday, I will follow HighlanderCFH's advice and wait a few days. Thank you for that! Anyway, during the initial doctor visit (UCLA), while stressing that it was \"probably not cancer\", I asked (hypthetically) what he would advise his brother (if he had a brother). He said that he would advise him to go ahead to have the biopsy done. However, after reading the remarks posted here, I think I'll wait until next week and have another PSA test taken. If the results are elevated, then I will most likely get it done. If the results are somewhat static, then I'll wait until my next appointment in July. Opinions?",

      "Content": "I am a 62 year old male (aging athlete) in good health. The last blood work that I had done in January of this year showed a PSA of 1.1 I have not been experiencing any troubling symptoms of any kind, but I decided to keep on top of my health and visit a urologist for a general check up. After prodding around for what seemed like an eternity, he sat down and told me that he felt nodules on my prostate which he considered \"abnormal\". He then gave me these statistics based on my previous PSA test results, my age, weight, lifestyle, and general health: There was a 2% chance that the nodules were aggressive in nature. There was a 12% chance that the nodules were cancerous, but not aggressive in nature. There was a 86% chance that the nodules were not cancerous, but something else. He then explained to me what was involved in a biopsy and the fact that a biopsy would be the only way to determine if the nodules were cancerous. Being a squeemish baby, I was more horrified at the thought of the biopsy than the possibility of cancer!- well not really, but I digress. My question to forum members is this: Should I have the procedure done or wait until my next appointment (July 2017)? I am going tomorrow for another PSA test which should make this decision a little easier (hopefully not elevated!) My second question is: There is a 98% chance that a biopsy will result in the prognosis of either \"clear\" or \"watch and wait\". Aren't the odds WAY in my favor? What would you do?",
