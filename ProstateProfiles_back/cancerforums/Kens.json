      "Content": "Originally Posted by HighlanderCFH Hi Kens, Welcome to \"this\" side of the operating room! And glad you are doing so well. Your recovery, so far, sounds almost identical to mine. Never had any pain. The only thing is that I did not find the catheter uncomfortable -- took advantage of its presence by drinking by the gallon in the knowledge that I would not have to get up and go to the bathroom all the time. LOL Also painless when it was removed. The ONLY thing I would caution you on is the sexual part. Having your gf coax things a bit is probably fine. But actual sex is not recommended until about 3 weeks after surgery. But it's still good to know that the mechanics are still working and ready to go after you've hit that 3rd week. Good luck! Chuck Thank you Chuck, but the doc actually encouraged masturbation and light sexual play, as tolerated. He said that encouraging the circulation is a great thing, but be sure not to strain myself. The erection was not sufficient for penetration, but it was definitely encouraging. Honorable mention goes out to any survivor's partner willing to be patient and encourage the rehabilitation process. My girlfriend, who I love very much, has been very supportive and patient through this whole thing and continues to be!",

      "Content": "Hi everybody, and thank you for all the advice and opinions I have received here! I have found other people's information very enlightening and helpful, so much so that I am offering up a dialog of my experience with surgery: Today is my twelfth day post surgery (DaVinci robotic-assisted radical prostatectomy) and my first day back at work (no lifting, lite-duty). I am doing absolutely fantastic! The surgery was done by Dr. Clayton S. Lau at City of Hope in Duarte, CA on October 8th, beginning at 1pm. I was out of surgery by 4pm and on my feet by 7pm, walking the ward (this is very important to recovery). They kept offering me IV pain meds and I kept refusing them about half the time, just enough to keep me comfortable without over-doing it. I kept walking about every hour to two hours until I was discharged at about noon the following day. I went home with 10mg Percocet and a catheter, but only used three of them the entire time (one the first evening and then two the following day). After that I used Tylenol for a couple of days and I was done with the pain meds. I kept exercising (short walks) several times a day, and was hating the catheter! That thing is REALLY uncomfortable... My first follow-up visit was on the 14th, six days (barely) post surgery. I drove myself out there and got the catheter removed (WHEW! what a relief) painlessly (it slides right out after it is deflated). Since I had been doing Kegels since a couple of weeks prior to surgery I was able to immediately stop the urine flow twice during my voiding test during the catheter removal. They also discussed my pathology results and gave me an \"all-clear\", the results had come back Gleason's 3+3=6 and there had been no cancer outside the prostate capsule (they had also removed 9 lymph nodes, to be sure). My recovery at home has been very unremarkable, other than the minor leakage. The Depend Guards have taken care of minor leakage and have allowed me to make regular outings. The leakage seems to be tapering off a little bit. They say that continence returns first to the over-night time frame, then to the mornings, and finally to the evenings. My girlfriend managed to coax a very minor erection over the weekend, so I'm looking forward to improvement in that category and in the continence category. If anybody has any questions I can answer please feel free to ask. I will certainly make my best effort, or I will tell you if I do not know or have doubts. There is a lot of very helpful information on this board and especially from those that have gone before us and who are willing to share their experiences. I encourage anybody interested to do lots of reading and ask lots of questions!",
