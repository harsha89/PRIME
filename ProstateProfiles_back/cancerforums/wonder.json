    "Content": "Swelling concern; My husband's brain surgery was 1/30/17, did anyone have area swelling? (not the incision)and if did, how long did it last? or was it drained. we opted not to have it drained due to the risk of infection. We are very happy with all his doctors, I was just wonder if anyone else had the swelling.",
