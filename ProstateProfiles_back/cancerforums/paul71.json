    "Content": "Just an update on three months after surgery. PSA undetectable, down to 1-2 pads per day. Nothing in the way of ED even with high doses of Cialis. I saw a few things on Trimix gel. Can't do injections. I asked my urologist office about it, but they hadn't heard of it. They did not think that many pharmacies carried it. Need to do more research.",
