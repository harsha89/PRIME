      "Content": "Originally Posted by Jack1954 Thanks everyone, just wondering are ct/bone/dce mris scans are enough to confirm its confined? Or are there any other test, also if this is confined is the radiation as effective as surgery Thanks Hi Jack, No, all these tests will define whether there is a big tumor > 3 cm outside the prostate and how far it is located from the initial source. We have similar pathology report, hopefully though your cancer is entirely confined within the prostate, this would be best case scenario. Nevertheless if your CT proves clear you will have very big possibilities for cure, in some cases even with positive CT scan cure is possible. As far as for radiation or prostatectomy, usually with surgery you control the cancer better meaning that based on post operative PSA you know whether you still have any cancer left or not enabling you to structure your treatment accordingly.",

Easy call in my opinion, since the cancer has spread to 1 of 21 lymph nodes you should commence radiation project as soon as possible, I think that the quickest is 2 months after prostatectomy. At the moment your cancer is trying to multiply in a systemic level, from 1 lymph node to the other and then to other organs. It is not advisable to allow this. Also, 21 lymph nodes is not sufficient sample, 35+ is required for full mapping in terms of high Gleason score patients, most probably you might have additional infected lymph nodes which have not been assessed on a pathological level.",

      "Content": "My first sample of biopsy before surgery was 20% Gleason 8 and 80% Gleason 9. Then the strategy of my urologist was to have proactive ADP before surgery (neoadjuvant therapy). The problem is that when I removed the prostate, the result of the biopsy based on the doctor assessing the prostate was that the Gleason score of the prostate cancer could not be determined due to prior ADP. My question to the forum is whether you agree that upon ADP it is impossible to determine the Gleason score of the removed prostate. Does this makes any sense scientifically?",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by dmcook695 My dad was diagnosed last week Gleason 9 but his PSA is only 2.4. He went for a second opinion/surgery consult, but was told he wasn't a candidate because he is stage 4 and was recommended to have ADT/radiation. He sees the radiology oncologist in the morning. Hi DM, Can I please ask whether the pathology report of your father referred to a prostate cancer tumor type of neuroendocrine carcinoma? If yes, this type of cancer is the most dangerous as it stealth (very low or negative PSA) and very aggressive. I am not sure about the results of the bone scan but my suggestion is to stop the spread of the cancer as soon as possible, either with immediate RT+ hormone therapy of with neo adjuvant hormone therapy after a snapshot of anti - androgens in order to reduce the ''flare'' effect. In my humble opinion even 1 day is critical at this point. I wish the best for your father, we are all here to help and support.",

Hi Ron, I have permanent lymphedema caused by the extended lymph node dissection that I had in September 15. As you said correctly there is no cure, basically you are fighting in order to reduce the swelling and maintain it at the lowest possible level because if left untreated it may lead to elephantiasis. I developed lymphedema in October 2015 and my treatment from back then involves the below: 1. Reduce the swelling by having specialized massage performed by specialists every 1 week (my wife has replaced the specialist over time) 2.Wrapping of the affected area for approximately 8 hours per days with a customized sock adjusted on your body's dimension If you have any relevant queries please don't hesitate to ask, we are here to help you",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by Michael F Hello C33! A simultaneous Warm Welcome to The Forum & \"Club Zero!\" 1st observation is a typo in \"5th part......2/11/2015\" needs correcting. You were diagnosed with High Risk PC (G9) later followed by additional High Risk Surgical Pathology findings: (+) Margins and (+) lymph nodes. Your Urologist has treated your PC aggressively with Hormone Therapy (HT) treatments followed by radical prostatectomy (RP) and then Radiation 5 months later. Your current PSA levels are remarkably low and are considered \"Clinically Zero\" which is exactly where all of us Post PC Treatment Forum Brothers want to be. So Congratulations! You have been through the proverbial \"wringer\" and have emerged in good condition! Thus you are well positioned at the start of \"The Road to Cure;\" however, this is a rather long road and the finish line remains in the distant future. Following cessation of HT will provide better insight as to your actual status. I'm not a qualified medical expert but suggest that you and your Uro MD arrive at a reasonable PSA testing schedule. My suggestion is every 3-4 months. Be sure to have your PSA tested at the same lab using the same PSA Test Methodology each time. Only then can you compare results. The ultimate Goal is the 10 year mark. However, current thought seems to be: 5 years post op with no clinical rise in PSA suggests high likelihood of being cured. Discuss this with your MD as they are best qualified to provide the facts and probabilities. Meanwhile, be very proud of the fact that your PC has been treated aggressively and this has optimized your chances of complete cure. We all certainly hope so and are cheering for you to cross the finish line!!! Beware of the dreaded \"PSA Anxiety\" that rears its ugly head around the time each PSA test is scheduled! It is of no constructive use or value, so simply ignore it and move forward. You will receive a lot of support and feedback. Looking forward to more good results! MF Hi Michael and thank you very much for your analytic feedback, more than appreciated. Regarding your observation, in Europe we put the date first and then the month so by 2/11/2015 I meant 2nd of November 2015, therefore the commencement date of my IMRT radiotherapy was exactly 50 days upon prostatectomy - a very adjuvant radiotherapy. It's very clear to me that the steady nadir PSA of 0,003 doesn't mean anything especially considering that I am on complete androgen blockade but I am really curious why my very experienced urologist dared to even talk about cure at such a short notice.. Maybe he is optimistic due to my very aggressive treatment! I am taking PSA test every 3 months as per above results trend, again thank you very much for your support.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by MichiganMan16 Hello C33: Welcome to the forum, sorry about you having to be here. Our cases are quite alike, the difference being the +LN. So here in the states, you would be pT3bN1. Ok, the good news...I would like to stand and give your doctors a standing ovation. This is exactly the type of treatment ( aggressive style) that your case needs. Standard protocol is just what you are doing for a higher risk case. And your doctors are throwing everything at it including the kitchen sink. Well Done!!! You are to be applauded for taking this approach that may cure u. With a G9, positive margins, and +LN, I would be going all out. I assume your ADT will be lasting between 6 months and 2 years. IMHO, I would go the longer route. I would rather find out that 2 years was to long than 6 months being not enough. Congrats on your PSA. That is great news!! It shows that your body and cancer are responding to the treatments. Those are great numbers. For now I would not worry about being cured. I would just take one day at a time. When will you or I be cured? Ask each one of us in 10 years!!. My Medonc and RO have told me its there job to keep me around for 10-15 years. They say by then with the advances and treatments that are coming down the pike, there will be more drugs, etc. to keep guys like us around for many more years. Could we be cured, sure. But even if not we will have a long life ahead of us. This is a long road, hang tough. congrats on facing this head on. Best Wishes, MM My friend I have the same opinion with you, the treatment was ideal and I am very lucky that I trusted the particular urologist. Some urologists claim that you shouldn't apply neoadjuvant therapy because you will not draw clear conclusions at the first post prostatectomy PSA but who can tell if the aggressive type 9 cancer wouldn't have metastized from the time of the biopsy until the surgery? Nobody!! Also, I am not sure what is the role of the hormone therapy in my 0,003 PSA: 1) The hormone therapy has killed some prostate cancer cells? 2) The hormone therapy has hypnotized the cancer cells? 3) The hormone therapy is helping the radiotherapy to be more effective? 4) The cancer cells will immediately wake up upon cessation of HT? If the PSA of 0,003 is negligible due to hormone therapy then why it has been steady almost immediately after prostatectomy? All these queries are driving me crazy every night..",

Following cessation of HT will provide better insight as to your actual status. I'm not a qualified medical expert but suggest that you and your Uro MD arrive at a reasonable PSA testing schedule. My suggestion is every 3-4 months. Be sure to have your PSA tested at the same lab using the same PSA Test Methodology each time. Only then can you compare results. The ultimate Goal is the 10 year mark. However, current thought seems to be: 5 years post op with no clinical rise in PSA suggests high likelihood of being cured.

We all certainly hope so and are cheering for you to cross the finish line!!! Beware of the dreaded \"PSA Anxiety\" that rears its ugly head around the time each PSA test is scheduled!

The ultimate Goal is the 10 year mark. However, current thought seems to be: 5 years post op with no clinical rise in PSA suggests high likelihood of being cured. Discuss this with your MD as they are best qualified to provide the facts and probabilities. Meanwhile, be very proud of the fact that your PC has been treated aggressively and this has optimized your chances of complete cure. We all certainly hope so and are cheering for you to cross the finish line!!! Beware of the dreaded \"PSA Anxiety\" that rears its ugly head around the time each PSA test is scheduled! It is of no constructive use or value, so simply ignore it and move forward. You will receive a lot of support and feedback. Looking forward to more good results! MF Hi Michael and thank you very much for your analytic feedback, more than appreciated. Regarding your observation, in Europe we put the date first and then the month so by 2/11/2015 I meant 2nd of November 2015, therefore the commencement date of my IMRT radiotherapy was exactly 50 days upon prostatectomy - a very adjuvant radiotherapy. It's very clear to me that the steady nadir PSA of 0,003 doesn't mean anything especially considering that I am on complete androgen blockade but I am really curious why my very experienced urologist dared to even talk about cure at such a short notice.. Maybe he is optimistic due to my very aggressive treatment! I am taking PSA test every 3 months as per above results trend, again thank you very much for your support.",

I could not agree more with what you are saying, basically it takes many years until you can be able to draw some solid conclusions. At least I think that the steady PSA means that there is currently no distant occult metastasis and the treatment keeps the cancer under control, also that the radiation made some work because the PSA dropped from 0,02 to 0,003 in a few days. Maybe if the cancer returns it will not be aggressive and I can adapt a watchful waiting approach. At least I hope so!",

Some urologists claim that you shouldn't apply neoadjuvant therapy because you will not draw clear conclusions at the first post prostatectomy PSA but who can tell if the aggressive type 9 cancer wouldn't have metastized from the time of the biopsy until the surgery? Nobody!! Also, I am not sure what is the role of the hormone therapy in my 0,003 PSA: 1) The hormone therapy has killed some prostate cancer cells? 2) The hormone therapy has hypnotized the cancer cells? 3) The hormone therapy is helping the radiotherapy to be more effective? 4) The cancer cells will immediately wake up upon cessation of HT? If the PSA of 0,003 is negligible due to hormone therapy then why it has been steady almost immediately after prostatectomy? All these queries are driving me crazy every night..",

You were diagnosed with High Risk PC (G9) later followed by additional High Risk Surgical Pathology findings: (+) Margins and (+) lymph nodes. Your Urologist has treated your PC aggressively with Hormone Therapy (HT) treatments followed by radical prostatectomy (RP) and then Radiation 5 months later. Your current PSA levels are remarkably low and are considered \"Clinically Zero\" which is exactly where all of us Post PC Treatment Forum Brothers want to be. So Congratulations! You have been through the proverbial \"wringer\" and have emerged in good condition! Thus you are well positioned at the start of \"The Road to Cure;\" however, this is a rather long road and the finish line remains in the distant future.

      "Content": "Originally Posted by HighlanderCFH Welcome aboard. Sorry to see your particular case, but delighted to see that things are going as well as possible so far. As Michael noted, the road to declaration of a cure is a long one -- but you do appear to be on that road. I'll be praying that there are no \"detours\" so that your PSA stays exactly where it is -- at zero. Good luck! Chuck Thank you for the warm welcome Chuck! I could not agree more with what you are saying, basically it takes many years until you can be able to draw some solid conclusions. At least I think that the steady PSA means that there is currently no distant occult metastasis and the treatment keeps the cancer under control, also that the radiation made some work because the PSA dropped from 0,02 to 0,003 in a few days. Maybe if the cancer returns it will not be aggressive and I can adapt a watchful waiting approach. At least I hope so!",

      "Content": "Of course prostate cancer is mutating to higher Gleason score...As cancer cells multiply, escape the capsule and create metastases they become more diversified, aggressive and poorly differentiated.. I had a PSA of approximately 3 before 10 years, yet only in 2015 I discovered that I had PC gleason 9 with a PSA of 5,6. Is it possible that I had Gleason score 9 ten years ago? Nop!! So, yes definitely as PC evolves the gleason score is mutating always to more poorly differentiated levels. I read an article that 50% of patients that delayed their surgery 6 months have had an increased gleason score compared with those who didn't delay.",

My Medonc and RO have told me its there job to keep me around for 10-15 years.

Some urologists claim that you shouldn't apply neoadjuvant therapy because you will not draw clear conclusions at the first post prostatectomy PSA but who can tell if the aggressive type 9 cancer wouldn't have metastized from the time of the biopsy until the surgery? Nobody!! Also, I am not sure what is the role of the hormone therapy in my 0,003 PSA: 1) The hormone therapy has killed some prostate cancer cells? 2) The hormone therapy has hypnotized the cancer cells? 3) The hormone therapy is helping the radiotherapy to be more effective? 4) The cancer cells will immediately wake up upon cessation of HT? If the PSA of 0,003 is negligible due to hormone therapy then why it has been steady almost immediately after prostatectomy? All these queries are driving me crazy every night..",

You were diagnosed with High Risk PC (G9) later followed by additional High Risk Surgical Pathology findings: (+) Margins and (+) lymph nodes. Your Urologist has treated your PC aggressively with Hormone Therapy (HT) treatments followed by radical prostatectomy (RP) and then Radiation 5 months later. Your current PSA levels are remarkably low and are considered \"Clinically Zero\" which is exactly where all of us Post PC Treatment Forum Brothers want to be. So Congratulations! You have been through the proverbial \"wringer\" and have emerged in good condition! Thus you are well positioned at the start of \"The Road to Cure;\" however, this is a rather long road and the finish line remains in the distant future. Following cessation of HT will provide better insight as to your actual status. I'm not a qualified medical expert but suggest that you and your Uro MD arrive at a reasonable PSA testing schedule. My suggestion is every 3-4 months. Be sure to have your PSA tested at the same lab using the same PSA Test Methodology each time. Only then can you compare results. The ultimate Goal is the 10 year mark. However, current thought seems to be: 5 years post op with no clinical rise in PSA suggests high likelihood of being cured. Discuss this with your MD as they are best qualified to provide the facts and probabilities. Meanwhile, be very proud of the fact that your PC has been treated aggressively and this has optimized your chances of complete cure. We all certainly hope so and are cheering for you to cross the finish line!!! Beware of the dreaded \"PSA Anxiety\" that rears its ugly head around the time each PSA test is scheduled! It is of no constructive use or value, so simply ignore it and move forward. You will receive a lot of support and feedback. Looking forward to more good results! MF Hi Michael and thank you very much for your analytic feedback, more than appreciated. Regarding your observation, in Europe we put the date first and then the month so by 2/11/2015 I meant 2nd of November 2015, therefore the commencement date of my IMRT radiotherapy was exactly 50 days upon prostatectomy - a very adjuvant radiotherapy. It's very clear to me that the steady nadir PSA of 0,003 doesn't mean anything especially considering that I am on complete androgen blockade but I am really curious why my very experienced urologist dared to even talk about cure at such a short notice.. Maybe he is optimistic due to my very aggressive treatment! I am taking PSA test every 3 months as per above results trend, again thank you very much for your support.",

Regarding your observation, in Europe we put the date first and then the month so by 2/11/2015 I meant 2nd of November 2015, therefore the commencement date of my IMRT radiotherapy was exactly 50 days upon prostatectomy - a very adjuvant radiotherapy. It's very clear to me that the steady nadir PSA of 0,003 doesn't mean anything especially considering that I am on complete androgen blockade but I am really curious why my very experienced urologist dared to even talk about cure at such a short notice.. Maybe he is optimistic due to my very aggressive treatment! I am taking PSA test every 3 months as per above results trend, again thank you very much for your support.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by HighlanderCFH Welcome aboard. Sorry to see your particular case, but delighted to see that things are going as well as possible so far. As Michael noted, the road to declaration of a cure is a long one -- but you do appear to be on that road. I'll be praying that there are no \"detours\" so that your PSA stays exactly where it is -- at zero. Good luck! Chuck Thank you for the warm welcome Chuck! I could not agree more with what you are saying, basically it takes many years until you can be able to draw some solid conclusions. At least I think that the steady PSA means that there is currently no distant occult metastasis and the treatment keeps the cancer under control, also that the radiation made some work because the PSA dropped from 0,02 to 0,003 in a few days. Maybe if the cancer returns it will not be aggressive and I can adapt a watchful waiting approach. At least I hope so!",

      "Content": "Guys, Thank you very much for your valuable help, really appreciated. What I didn't understand yet is whether it is 100% that I will have permanent ED, this is fixed for everybody or there are cases whereby an individual was healthy after 2 year of HT? So the question is still the same, should I consider that I am unable to make sex permanently or it depends on how my body will react? Or something else? As far as for the several treatments that you recommend, is this a one off treatment or I will have to make injections every time I want to make sex? If the latter is the case, then sorry but this kind of sex is really a nightmare Again, huge appreciation for your help!",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by Marve Just wanted to share good news. In August was dads last hormone shot. PSA was all that time 0.003. And now 5 months later it was still 0.003 �� Thank you God�� Do you know how fast does the level of testosterone recover? They didnt check it this time At the right track for cure if not already cured!!!My best wishes for crystal clean cure.. Very aggressive treatment for not so aggressive cancer! Congrats for the results though.. The hormone therapy deprivation depends on the dose of the hormone therapy, there are injections causing 1 year deprivation, 6 months, 3 months, 1 month, etc.. For example in my case, based on my urologist the hormone injection that he applied to me seized having any influence on 20/10/2017 so I am 3 months free of any hormone deprivation.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by RobLee My Urologist just told me at our last meeting that my testosterone would begin to return to normal one year after the end of HT... so for me, another 18 months from now. Testosterone will return back to normal after a certain period but this does not mean that part of your testosterone will not return immediately after hormone deprivation termination. Some of the testosterone recovers immediately, some part of the testosterone after a certain period and also there is a percentage of testosterone that never returns back to normal as the long term hormone deprivation therapy creates an irreversible damage to our testosterone. So for example in my case I have definitely recovered part of my testosterone since I am 3 month free of hormone deprivation and I don't expect to ever return back to normal with almost 2,5 years complete hormone blockade ( the more the duration of hormone deprivation the less testosterone will recover, I think that based on official researches after 3 years of hormone deprivation and depending on your age a big percentage is permanently destroyed) For example, - 20% back to normal - 30% castrate and expected to return back to normal after a lot of years - 50% Irreversibly destroyed",
