      "Content": "Very worried and upset about my dad. He was diagnosed with prostate cancer three years ago. He had a PSA level of 23 and gleason score of 7 (3+4). It had not spread. Was just in his prostrate and all scans came back negative. His treatment was 28 external radiation visits followed by Brachytherapy. The first psa test after the treatment took it down to 1. We were all happy and relieved. The following year it jumped to 3 which we were told was normal and then last year (May 2014) it had jumped to 7. This week he went for his annual blood tests and his PSA level came back 100. Exactly 100. We were all so confused. How could it jump 93 points in a year? Especially when the pattern was increasing 3-4 points every year. We thought for sure it was a mistake. I convinced him to go take the test again (four days later) and it came back exactly the same 100. What are the odds that it jumped 93 points in a year and it just so happens to be exactly 100? And if it has jumped that much, that roughly means it's been growing 8 points a month or 2 points a week and so why would the second test come back exactly the same? Does having a high PSA level like 100 automatically mean its metastasized or could it just still be in the prostate? I've researched for hours and hours and I can't find any examples of a PSA jump that high in a year. We obviously called and got an appointment with his urologist for June 2nd but I can't help but be so worried. Has anyone experienced or heard of a scenario similar to this? FYI - My dad is currently 75 years old.",

      "Content": "I was under the impression he was getting tested every six months but my mom said the Dr. had said once a year was ok. I'll ask her who saw the 7 number. I've grilled him with a list of 20+ questions to see if he's having any symptoms. Negative to everything. He feels great and is very energetic. He and mom are caretakers for my handicap brother (brain damage from being hit by drunk driver) which consumes their entire lives and has for 30+ years. Just praying this is a false alarm. I don't understand how it could jump 93 points in a year. I'm flying out to take him to the dr next week so I'll be asking the hard questions. Michele",
