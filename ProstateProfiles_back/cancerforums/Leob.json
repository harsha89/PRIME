      "Content": "Hi I was told last week that I have a hernia on my left side , and that I need to operate (already operated once). There is either the option of doing a laparoscopic operation or an open operation. I read that in both operation the hernia is fixed with a mesh. I was thinking of going through a laparoscopic surgery do to the fact that recovery is faster and less pain is involved. Although my psa has increased I hope that I will never be diagnosed with prostate cancer, but if I would need to remove the prostate in the future, I was wondering if there is any advantage in performing either a open or laparoscopic hernia surgery, in terms of difficulties concerning future prostate removal? Thanks in advance Leo",

      "Content": "Hello, I have an appointment with my urologist in 10 days to hear my 12 core biopsy results (hoping for the best). I want to make sure that I have asked all the necessary questions at this stage in order to decide on further action. I made the following list, have I missed anything? Concerning a 2nd opinion on biopsy results: I can be up graded or down graded or get a negative result instead of a positive one, so how the hell could I decide what then ? Thanks, Leo Positive Bioposy \u0095 What\u0092s my Gleason Grade? \u0095 How many cores are positive for PC and what is the % of cancer in each core? \u0095 What is the clinical stage of my PC (according to partin tables) \u0095 Is any kind of additional testing possible in order to confirm this diagnosis (is there a chance for a false positive result)? \u0095 Which treatment do you recommend and why? \u0095 What are the side effects of the proposed treatment? \u0095 What are my chances for recovery? \u0095 When should I start treatment or for how long can it be postponed? \u0095 How can I arrange a 2nd opinion for my biopsy slides? Negative Biopsy \u0095 Can this result be further confirmed by having a free PSA test and or coil MRI rectum test? \u0095 When should I have an additional PSA and DRE test? \u0095 Are additional biopsies required?",

No prostate cancer history in the family. During the past 10 years I asked my doctor sometimes to add the PSA test to my yearly blood test (maybe I shouldn\u0092t have ). The limits for this test are 0 to 4 so I was never alerted by the lab till the last test. Jun 2004- 0.62 March 2010-1.66 October 2011-2.79 Sept 2013- 5.11 I might have had sex before the last test which only after reading a bit in this forum found out that this may increase the PSA level (anyone know by how much?). I recently went for the first time to an Urologist, the DRE came out normal but anyhow he sent me to a prostate biopsy due to the increase in PSA. He told me that even if I repeat the test and the PSA decreases he would still send me to a biopsy. Due to the small chance of infection and other side effects, but mainly due to what the results if positive, may lead to, I haven\u0092t been sleeping for the past 2 weeks and can\u0092t decide if I should perform the biopsy? My main question is, if the biopsy results are positive do I have a better chance of recovery compared to if I just ignore my doctor\u0092s advice and find out later on, (performing a biopsy due to appearance of symptoms or problem in DRE test). Any advice would be helpful. Thanks Leo",

      "Content": "Hi, I received yesterday negative results on my 1st 12core biopsy. It seems that I have an inflammation on the left lobe. My Doctor whom is head of the Urology oncology Dept. in a large hospital. Recommended the following. Perform an additional PSA test in another 6 months. Following the results he might send me to a coil MRI test. I asked him what about a free PSA test?, he told me that from his experience there is no benefit in doing this test. He recommended that I have the PCA3 blood test instead but its not urgent. I asked him what about doing a saturation biopsy. He explained that the current 12 core biopsy samples 1/1000 of the prostate, so even if I would take 120 samples this would be statistically insignificant and increase very slightly the chances of identifying PCa therefore it is not worth running to have an additional biopsy so fast. I am aware that apart from doing a standard biopsy the only way to confirm PCa is to do a biopsy on the prostate after removing it, so I am asking myself if the chances of discovering PCa through a standard biopsy are so low why do it at all ?? I will probably at this point not ask for a 2nd opinion, just do the 2nd PSA test, don\u0092t really know if having the PCA3 would be beneficial? Any suggestions remarks would be appreciated?

Due to unrelated limb pain I had a full body bone scan which also came out negative. I also had a PCA3 urine test which came out negative. My urologist told me that he recommends only to have another PSA test in 2 years. After reacting with surprise he told me that I can have another test in 1 year. Any comments on this course of action for further checkups?. p.s After preforming the PCA 3 test which cost 400 euros (my Insurance didn\u0092t cover), I read in this forum that several members that were diagnosed with PC had a negative PCA3 result so this test looks pretty much a waste of money.
