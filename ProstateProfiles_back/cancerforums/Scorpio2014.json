      "Content": "Catheter worries! A robotic surgery is in my agenda. I have a consultation coming up in few day with a surgeon. I am T1C with GS-6 and 53 years old. I was told by my urologist and that surgery would be a better option for me. My current and the biggest fear right now (besides the side effects of the surgery off course) is dealing with a catheter. How hard is it to deal with? Is it a must to have after the surgery? How uncomfortable is to deal with it during at night to sleep with, taking shower etc? How can I make it easier on me? Thanks a lot in advance for your anticipated info and help.",

      "Content": "Does anybody have any experience using Clomid? Some search result indicates that low dosage of daily use of Clomid increase Testosterone level! The way it works is totally different than regular TRT. It's been almost a year since I had my surgery. I also have low Testosterone issues. That's why I have low libido problems too.The ED pills not working. My PSA level is 0.02. My doc wants to wait another year for TRT procedure to be make sure. My question is this: If I start using Clomid to raise my test levels and if it does, would it have any negative effects to my PSA level at all - since it works differently than regular TRT!?

      "Content": "Good info. Thank you very much. Originally Posted by dml I have used clomiphene in the past as part of testosterone replacement therapy. My doctor started me on TRT with a protocol similar to what bodybuilders might use. I would use testosterone, arimidex and tamoxifen for about 3 months, and then switch to HCG and clomiphene for a month. To be honest, while I loved the clomiphene, I didn't like using the TRT intermittently, so I've switched to a different protocol. The main side effect I saw from clomiphene was an increased volume of ejaculate, which made orgasms more fun, for me at least. Now that I don't have a prostate, and I'm on continuous TRT, I don't really have a need for clomiphene. But, there are some people for whom clomiphene is sufficient to raise T levels. I wasn't one of those people, due to the cause of my hypogonadism. If clomiphene does work for you, there is no difference in the end result. Clomiphene tells your body to produce more testosterone, if it is capable. Exogenous testosterone also increases T levels. The end effect is the same. In reality, the current saturation theories pretty much say that unless you have castrate levels of testosterone, neither endogenous or exogenous testosterone is going to increase PCA recurrence risk. But, the saturation theory, despite many studies to support it, is still a theory, and I don't think anyone considers the use of TRT to be completely risk free. I feel so much better on TRT that I decided it was a risk I was very willing to take. My surgeon and endocrinologist have previously used one-year post op as the earliest time to re-start TRT. Even then, it had to be done with undetectable PSAs using the ultra-sensitive assay, and there needed to be very unambiguously good post-op pathology reports. In my case, they allowed me to resume at 6 months and my last PSA was < 0.006. Good luck.",
