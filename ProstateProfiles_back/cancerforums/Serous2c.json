    "Content": "sequoiaranger, that's the source of the article -- it's in the Journal \"Nature Medicine,\" which is a very reputable medical journal. But all you can see online is the abstract. If you want to read the whole article, you can probably get it through interlibrary loan from your local library, or you can just stop at your hospital's library and run off a copy of it there. Keep in mind this is a laboratory test in which they deliberately damaged fibroblasts to measure the effect. The abstract doesn't tell us what type of chemo they used, and they don't tell us whether the concentration of the chemo was similar to what our bodies experience. In the lab they exaggerate conditions so they can see a clear effect. When I do chemo out here in the real world my doctor and nurses constantly remind me to stay hydrated to minimize the effect of the chemo on my normal cells. They remind me to avoid injury, too. Fibroblasts are active when your body needs to heal an injury. I think this is an interesting thing and it might help them develop a new approach to treating chemo-resistant cancers, but I really think it makes no difference to me at all as a current patient. It's the headline writers in the popular media who decided to sensationalize the story, not the scientists who did the work.",
