They all were about blood clots forming in the bladder and surrounding areas? and then trying to pass through urination. Many had to be hospitalized and had major problems... caths ...triple caths..etc. .....The post were not all that old either , so it was the newer rads...maybe lousy docs.....I didn`t keep the location to add here , and looked for it , but lost it all.....what can any of you say about the blood clot subject 5-10 years into RT? ...is it something that many of you are experiencing ?

      "Content": "hey JW ! Welcome .....yes ..BIG decision ....I`m close to your situation ....for me , radiation. It has been said by the experts that the cure rate is about the same as removal. Yes, with removal , you get a shot again with salvage rads.....but with radiation only, they radiate all around the gland somewhat (25 of my fractions) and now for the rest it is directed at the prostate ONLY.....The SE`s have beennothing for me to this point.....16 more fractions to go out of 45.......9 weeks, 5 days a week. If you have a good stream and no problems , I think rads with the HDR`s are the ticket.....I could`nt do the HDR`s because of possible negative SE`s due to my very weak stream. It`s a crap shoot ....but for me, the negative SE`s experienced by so many that have had theirs removed, turned me off. Continued leakage, shortened penis..and in many cases more radiation . Yes...radiation can have negatives too....but for me I`m amazed so far at the positive experience...best of luck to you and your decision !!.....David",

I have had a weak stream for years and was always told enlarged prostate etc. Now with PC and having the markers in Oct. and 45 rad treatments , like you , I`m seeing and thinking exactly what your going through. I told the Rad doc. about the weak stream and he said it \"won`t make it any better\". Did you have any problems before the rads like me? I`m on a 6 month Lupron shot now,that I was told would help the weak stream during this time (not yet -been 4 weeks now)...if it shrinks the prostate , I would think it would shut down my stream even more ....anyway , getting worried about all this since I care take my wife and can`t see doing all I need to do with a cath in for a month or more ....hang in there ...your lucky to have help at home",

Welcome to the forum!!....I had pretty much the same treatment as you will have....I had the 6 month Lupron shot and then 45 fractions of the tomotherapy....9 weeks 5 days a week....81 Grys.....I was quite worried about the radiation because for years I had a weak stream...and I figured it would make it worse etc. ....but all in all, it went smoothly with really no problems....I tried to go in with a full bladder although my RO didn`t seem to care about that much ....the only thing that they harped on was STAYING STILL and not moving on the slab during the fractions....I had no fatigue....it was all pretty much a non event ....at the time I welcomed the 45 trips to town 15 miles away and when I got there I was in and out in usually 20 minutes ...I am so happy I chose Radiation therapy and the Tomotheray proceedure. coming up on 2 years now ....regained 80% sexual function and my testosterone bounced back after 6 months...my urine stream is about the same as pre treatment ....I take a flomax daily and do fine.... .so....I`m hoping you will have a similar experience as I had ....just so easy with no down time ....Good luck ....peace .....David",

As far as my docs. both leaving it in routinely ,well, it`s sounding like they are just covering the possibility of me( and I guess all their patients) not being able to urinate over the weekend due to swelling. . In my case , the RO said 6 mo. Lupron is the protocol for my stats. So, this one shot is supposed to take care of that end of it. I`ve never had to use a cath. before , but if it meant the immediate post HDR`s side effects easier to handle , I`m all for it( me ,having a weak stream) . This has been bothering me for some time now , since most guys just go home without one ....I do notice that different docs. put the IGRT and HDR`s in different sequences ...not sure why .....in my case IGRT(25 sessions) first then 2 HDR`s 2 weeks apart ...then it`s all over . .........OK, thank you both very much !!",

My question is: ( and I posted this on another forum also)...after the HDR treatment, did those of you that have had it done go home with a cath. for 2-4 days? My Uro. and my second opinion Uro.( south Fl.) ...both said they DO leave a cath . in because of swelling of the prostate after the HDR boost. This seems to be contrary to the standard practice ....from researching the subject and others experience on the forums....so, anyone want to weigh in on this one ?? Thanks ...David........BTW ...both Uro`s said the combination of the IGRT and the 2 HDR`s is my best course of action.....just confused on the the cath. thing...I can decide on the HDR`s at the 5 week point of rads",

      "Content": "Hey Mark ....in the beginning of this last april ( Ft. Myers Fl.) , the direction was IGRT ...9 week ..45 treatments....nothing was mentioned to me about HDR`s. so IGRT was the recommended course of treatment with 6 mos. of Lupron......when I went to a second opinion Uro. ..HE brought up the HDR`s ....and got word to my RO that I was needing info on it as a possible combination treatment ....so I went back to RO and he kinda back peddled and explained it all ....and on my way out of his office , I asked him what he felt was the best way to go ...he said with the HDR`s. So, why didn`t he tell me about them first time around .....he`s done many of them and works with the second opinion Uro. ..so I think it will be the way I will go in Oct. as for IGRT.....It was first in line in the beginning and feel that he was just adding the HDR`s at the 5 week mark of IGRT`s . Made me feel like it was the way they always do it ...., but I will bring this subject back in the fall when I get into the works of it all....I`m curious too ... RO and Uro both think the HDR`s are my best hope of a kill........the urinary side effects worry me , but from the post on that subject from others, I`m feeling better about it all. Second Opinion Uro. said he wants me on some type of flo max or rapid flo when I get back in Oct. so, that will hopefully get me in better shape for the procedures...........David",

      "Content": "Thanks Mark for the detailed thoughts on my situation .....all makes sense...and maybe a good sequence. The Lupron shot is kicking in now after 6 weeks....many warm-hot flashes...feel warm & clammy for a few minutes. Glad I`m in NC (Hendersonville) and not sweating it out for the summer on Pine Is. Fl where we spend the winter....still wavering about the option of the HDR`s ....seems like it is the way to go , but afraid of not being able to piss( less than a fir stream now) with the high doses of rads blasting the prostate ....I am probably over thinking it all... Thanks again for your replies ...they have helped me a lot ! David",

Have 1 hormone shot and come back in 2-3 months to begin 9 weeks of 5 day a week beaming. He seems to think with the possibility of the cancer breaking out of the capsule at some point , that this is a good bet since it would get some of the surrounding areas. Going back to urologist Thurs. to see what he says and a second opinion next Monday with a new Urologist. In the fact gathering stage now , but so far the radiation sounded pretty promising . He said about 50-50 compared to RP and about 70% sucess rate after 5 years ....just trying to figure this out as we all have done and are doing. Any suggestions ?? my PSA started at 6.8 in Nov then after DRE , I had PSA the same day and it jumped to 10.....seemed odd it would jump that much?? ......David on Pine Island Fl.",

      "Content": "Thanks Sarg and Oshguy for the replies.....The radio. doc. said if removal of prostate after radiation was needed it would be a very difficult thing and I would have to go to Tampa for that ....none in the Ft Myers Cape Coral Fl. area able to do that? He did say little problem with ED and incont. with the radiation......was all for removal untill I spoke to him ....but going to get some more info Thurs. and next Monday from another surgeon that has the Da Vinchi on his list of accomplishments. It seemed like the radiologist seemed to d feel that if I had the RP I would probably be back for salvage Ra. later because with my numbers , it very well could have spread out of the capsule. He said with the new radiation computerized 360* machine it keeps the beam right on point and covers a small area around the prostate where it could have spread....anyone want to comment on this typw of therapy or anything else ?? Thanks .......BTW Oshguy.... 3 miles from Matlacha....finally quiet there . It has turned into a traffic nightmare in season and problem for hurricane evacuation because it`s the only way off Pine Island. I`m usually in NC for the summer by now , but stuck with this new problem......David",

We all went through it and it is normal....but get a grip ....facts are what are needed . My final PSA test was done on the day of a DRE....big mistake.....doc. didn`t say anything ...just get er done before such and such a date ....so....I went after the DRE came out 10.3 ....previous was 6.8....in the end ..I had a good amount of cancer and it needed to be treated, but I think that number was way high.....so....read ...get your facts straight ...don`t let anyone push you into any treatment early on.....and DO contact me if you would ever like to hear about the radiation choice I made .......good luck ....David",

Talked to Radiologist yesterday and he seemed to present all this nationally compiled stats that showed with my type and numbers , that the new radiation with the markers in the prostate and the computerized direct beam would probably be my best course of action. Have 1 hormone shot and come back in 2-3 months to begin 9 weeks of 5 day a week beaming. He seems to think with the possibility of the cancer breaking out of the capsule at some point , that this is a good bet since it would get some of the surrounding areas. Going back to urologist Thurs. to see what he says and a second opinion next Monday with a new Urologist. In the fact gathering stage now , but so far the radiation sounded pretty promising . He said about 50-50 compared to RP and about 70% sucess rate after 5 years ....just trying to figure this out as we all have done and are doing. Any suggestions ?? my PSA started at 6.8 in Nov then after DRE , I had PSA the same day and it jumped to 10.....seemed odd it would jump that much?? ......David on Pine Island Fl.",

      "Content": "After the initial cancer shock we all go through , I had to make the choice of treatment . My wife has dementia and I have no help at home , so the surgery sounded like I`d be out of commission for too long , plus the SE`s didn`t appeal to me. I decided on the traditional route with 45 fractions ..81 gys....fiduciary markers....IGRT (Tomotherapy).....6 month Lupron shot last june. PSA at that time was 10.2...and size of gland 43cm........at time of rads, PSA .04 and size at 33cm. I had the option of 2 HDR treatments at the 5 week mark of rads, but declined in fear of severe SE`s because of my very weak stream. So, I found 2 ladies here on Pine Island to sit with my wife and I was off to town(15 miles away) for 9 weeks .The fractions were 3 1/2 minutes radiating the gland and surrounding areas for the first 25....then 2 1/2 minutes for the final 20 fractions ,just the gland. The RO told me of the possible SE`s with radiation during the 9 weeks....I actually had better bm`s and no worse urinary problems. By week 7 , I was wondering why I was so worried .So, now completed last Tuesday and no SE`s. The Lupron is still an issue and was told it may take months to wear off. I did put on 21 lbs. But being 138 before the shot , I welcomed the extra weight ....I hope I can hold onto the lbs. because they helped with all the age wrinkles! I feel great !...no SE`s..yet. I hear that the rads are the \"gift that keep on giving\" so, who know what`s down the line? But , for me this has been a walk in the park ...a milk run ...too easy ....will it work?? ...stats say as well as surgery . Can`t believe how easy it all was . My team at 21st. Century in Cape Coral Fl. led by Dr Brown was great ! Can`t say enough about them !..........so....any of you guys out there weighing the facts ...please CONSIDER RADIATION....I want to thank all of my friends-cancer buds and buddetts on this forum for the support over the last year........wishing you all the best of holidays ....David",
