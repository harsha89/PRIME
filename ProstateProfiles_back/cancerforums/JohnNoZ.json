      "Content": "I am 47 years old and had my prostate out about 14 months ago. My psa before surgery was 4.1. My Gleason was 3+4. Bone scan was clean. Lymph nodes were clean. No positive margins. No growth into the outer lining. After surgery my PSA dropped to 0.02, but went up to 0.05 the following month. Six months in it was 0.07, and remained there for the next three-month test. Three months later (1 year after surgery) it was 0.11. I go in in a couple weeks for another test. I will obviously talk to my uralogist and consult an oncologist if it continues going up. If it is up, how long should I wait before looking at salvage radiation? Thanks for any thoughts.",

      "Content": "Hello, I had my prostate removed in December 2012. My PSA went down dramatically (from 4.1 to 0.02), but then went back up slightly, leveling off at about 0.07. In my last PSA test in December 2013 (one year after surgery), it went up to 1.1. I know that salvage radiation can help improve survival when PSA goes up, if you do it early, that is within 2 years of PSA rising again or prior to it reaching 1.0. Given the fact that my PSA never really vanished, what are your thoughts? Thanks, John",

      "Content": "Thank you very much for your thoughts. I expected that I should get to an oncologist. I do not recall the staging. The doctor could not detect the cancer by rectal exam and it was completely within the capsule. However, it was on both sides of the prostate. I believe that made it 2C. Again, there were no positive margins.",
