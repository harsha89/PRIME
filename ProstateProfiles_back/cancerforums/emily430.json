      "Content": "Hello! CancerForum's parent company, Internet Brands, also owns the website Urologists.org, and the content team there has asked if we could help them with a special project. They'd like to create \"Caregiver's Guides\" to help those supporting individuals diagnosed with Kidney & Bladder Cancers and Prostate Cancer (since those are the cancers related to urology). Since the members and moderators here on CancerForums are so well educated, it would be extremely helpful to the editors at Urologists.org to get some insight and tips, ideas, etc., from those with experience. If you feel like helping out, please comment on this thread with any insight, \"I wish I'd known...,\" advice, etc.--anything you think would help the Urologist.org editor to create a good, comprehensive piece. In turn, the editor will include links back to cancerforums and credit us with having contributed to the article, which will hopefully help spread the word about cancerforums and what a wonderful place it is for support. Thank you! Emily430, Community Manager",
