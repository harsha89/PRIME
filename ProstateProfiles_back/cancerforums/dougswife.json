      "Content": "Hi everyone, My husband was diagnosed with prostate cancer at age 45 in February of 2013. Gleason score 4+5=9 T2cN0L0 His underwent open radical prostatectomy with removal of seminal vesicles and surrounding structures in March 2013. His PSA at 3 and 6 months was 0.00. His last PSA done seven months after surgery jumped to 0.818 which indicated recurrence. He had a Lupron injection prior to surgery and another one last week after the PSA came back elevated. We meet with the radiation oncologist in a couple days. I am concerned about the jump in PSA so soon. Is there anyone out there diagnosed in their 40's with a high gleason score? Would like to hear someone elses experiences since most men are not in their forties when they are diagnosed. He has a strong family history of death from cancer in his family but they all seem to get it at a different primary site. Thanks for your help!",
