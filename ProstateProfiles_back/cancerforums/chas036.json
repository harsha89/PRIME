      "Content": "I had my surgery exactly one year ago at the University of Rochester, NY with Doc Jean Joseph with 1200+ surgeries. My final gleason was 6 and no positive margins. I was getting a full erection within two weeks of catheter removal, but I needed a lot of manual y visual stimulation to maintain it. It has been a year and I can still get a full erection without drugs, but I still need a lot of manual stimulation to keep it. Once penetration is achieved, I can go for hours without a problem, but once the stimulation stops, I loose the erection very fast. With repsect to orgasms, well, they are as itense as before my surgery, but then again, they are very different also. The one major problem I have now is that I ejeculate urine. Even if I empty my bladder before sex, I will still ejeculate urine. The funny thing is that when I ejeculate urine, it is with more force and intensity than when I ejeculated semen when I had my prostate. When I had my prostate, my ejeculation amounted to nothing more than a drible of semen, but now without my prostate, I can ejeculate urine like a fire hose with such force I can almost hit the cieling. Having the urine ejeculating through the tipe of my penis also gives my orgasm somewhat of the same feeling and sensation that I remember when I use to ejeculate semen, but maybe a little more intenes since the force of the urine leaving the penis seems to be greater then what I had with semen. The only problem with this is..... women don't like be ejeculated with urine. So I have to be real careful and pull out before orgasm and then throw a towel over my penis so I don't wet the bed. That does not do much fo the romance of the moment. Too bad I couldn't find a pill that would turn my urine milky white , then it would be just like old times. Isn't prostate surgery fun!!!!",

      "Content": "Mark,,,,I had my prostate out exactly one year ago and my experience is very similar to yours. Though I did not use your surgeon, I was lucky and had a surgeon who was very skilled and my incontinence only lasted about 3 months and now I only use a pad just to catch the occasional stress leak. I am exactly the same as you with ED. I was getting hard erections within two weeks after the catheter was removed, and like you, I need a lot more manual and visual stimulaton to get an erection, whereas before surgery, just a simple thought was enough. The only problem I seem to have now is that when i have an orgasm, I ejeculate urine. I ejeculate urine with more force now, than I ejeculated semen when I had my prostate. Isn't prostate cancer fun!!!! Too bad you can't take a pill to color your urine white :P",
