      "Content": "Just got the news this morning that my first post-op PSA was <.001. Nothing like an early Christmas present! I was struggling with fatigue up until about two weeks ago, but that has resolved itself and I'm back to normal in that regard. I'm still dealing with some incontinence when I laugh, cough, sneeze, bend over... or hear running water. It's not enough that a maximum pad can't handle, but I don't think I'm anywhere near close to going without one. I start with a fresh pad at night and am generally dry in the morning, though I get up occasionally once during the night. Nothing to report on the erection front, but I'm keeping my expectations in check with this and being patient.",

Everybody here has or is going through what you are, so I think you'll find lots of information and even more in terms of support and compassion. In the past few days I've gone back and read most of the historical posts just to better understand where I've been and what I can expect going forward... suggest you do the same. Everyone here is ready to help.",

      "Content": "Just found this forum and joined after browsing a bit. Here's my background... Turned 63 in July. I had always had miniscule PSA and never gave it any thought as it was just another thing they checked for after the blood draws. Had my annual in May and the doctor thought 2.1 was a bit high in comparisons to my past numbers of < 1, so he ordered another test in July. This one came back at 4.3 and off to the Urologist post-haste. The DRE was normal but he needed to be sure so I got a biopsy. Of the 12 cores, 2 were cancer on the right side with a Gleason 7 (4+3). After some research I decided to go the surgery route. I had da Vinci surgery last Monday, Oct 28, and according to the surgeon, all went well but... visual inspection of the prostate showed cancer on the left side that he said \"was trying to break through\". Okay. I just got out of the hospital yesterday after dealing with bright red urine for two days, then lightening to pink and finally back to normal Friday. I would have been home sooner but started getting severe bladder spasms that were really tough to deal with. The doc said \"Some guys tolerate a catheter better than others, and you're proof of that\". Now that I'm home I have a spasm every few hours, some severe and some not. I go back to the Urologist tomorrow morning to hopefully get the catheter out and to get the final biopsy results. I seriously doubt that the cancer spread, but knowing for sure will be good to hear. I'm not looking forward to incontinence, but I'm prepared for it and will deal with it as necessary. Same goes for ED, but I've had ED for the past 10 years; sometimes the pills work and sometimes they don't. All in all I'm glad that my doctor decided to do the follow-up PSA in July instead of waiting until next May, and I have no regrets about going the surgery route. I feel that you can only make the best decision for yourself and ride it to the end. Spirits are good, will be much better when the catheter comes out, and will be back to a societal normal soon.",
