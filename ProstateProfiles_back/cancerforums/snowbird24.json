      "Content": "A store here in Tampa FL called The Canadian Drugstore. They've been in business for 8 years in Florida and have 3 storefront offices but ship anywhere in the US. You can return anything you have a problem with for a refund. You do need a prescription, which is more secure than these online \"no RX needed\" placed. Very nice people. Also, you will do business with the same person every time, not some call center in India. NO PHONE NUMBERS PLEASE. THANK YOU.",
