      "Content": "Originally Posted by Otago No, it is not about money. There is a huge debate as to whether any PSA testing should be done, let alone many years younger. I don't recall reading why you had your psa taken at age 38, but I don't know of anyone suggesting those under age 40 get the test. Actually its not only about the cost of testing, but more about the cost of treating so many people who probably don't need treating. Indolent cases. The entire field of testing and treating is a mess that won't be solved until they develop some method of knowing which cases need treatment and which don't. The first company to figure that out will make billions. I only had it checked because I hard time peeing. Went to a Uro to get checked out, DRE showed some \"firmness\". He ordered a PSA test and that led to a biopsy. I am just thankful to have caught it when I did and to have had some kind of symptom. If I had waited, we would be having a very different conversation.",

      "Content": "Mods, if this is out of line please feel free to delete it. It is not my intention to offend anyone or anything like that. Sometimes a little humor helps. Alright, I've been deciding on whether or not I should post about this for several days. I understand some of you might not share my sense of humor about these kinds of things, but I have a feeling that most will . I want to share this because I think it might help some here and it is a funny story IMO. What I am about to share is 100% how it happened, I am not making this up, I probably couldn't if I tried. For those that might not know what Bimix is, I'll give a quick run down. It is a mix of two drugs that you self inject into the side your penis to give an erection. I know it sounds like the worst thing in the world to do this to yourself, but i can assure everyone that it is not as bad as it sounds and the results are OUTSTANDING! (for me at least). So here I am on a Friday, one month to the day after my open prostate surgery. My Dr. wanted to see me for a checkup, PSA test and to show me how to start with the Bimix injections. He wanted to make sure I knew how to inject and that I didn't have any reactions to the medicine. I went into the exam room with a pretty high degree of apprehension, I mean who really WANTS to stick a needle in the side of their penis. The nurse came in and did the routine stuff, drew some blood and left, saying the Dr. would see me in a few minutes. She assured me that it was not going to be as bad as I was making it out to be. So as I sat there and waited my mind was racing with the reality of what I was about to do. I've never been afraid of needles and after all the blood tests that one has to go through with my current situation, I am certainly getting used to it. But this was different. Sticking a needle in your penis is just not he same as your arm. After a bit the Dr. came in, asked me the usual questions, looked at my incision and deemed that I was healing up nicely. Then he said it was time for the injection He had me half leaning, half sitting on the exam table and asked me to drop my pants. Anyone who has been down the PCa road knows that humility and modesty are one the first things to go, I'll pretty much drop my pants anytime, anywhere for just about anyone these days (come to think of it, that's not much different than my pre-PCa days). So there I am in all my glory. The Dr. grabs the end of my penis and tells me \"you want to stretch it out as far as it will go, like this\" and proceeds to pin it to my upper thigh. At this point he has the injection in his other hand and shows me where and how to do it. Looking down I was in complete disbelief about what I was about to do. I was a shaking a little, but I just did it. After a small bit of resistance it went right in! I was shocked that I felt almost nothing, it honestly felt like a mosquito bite. I was like \"that's it?\" he told me that like most things in this journey the anticipation of the event is much worse than the reality, and I have to agree. Next he tells me to \"massage the medication into my penis\" at which point I raised one eyebrow and said jokingly \"so you want me to jerk off...in your exam room?\" Now my Dr. has no sense of humor at all and just responds with a stern look and says \"I'll be back to check on you in about 10 minutes\". So much fro trying to lighten the mood. I get it though, this guys spends his whole life looking at dudes schlongs and sticking his fingers in peoples rear ends, I don't blame him for being a little disconnected to it all. There I am \"massaging\" the medication. After a few minutes, low and behold my shriveled member starts to show signs of life again. This was a pretty emotional moment for me, I am only 38 and I hope to have a long and healthy sex life, so it was reassuring to see that things might work out after all. After about ten minutes the Dr. comes back in and asks \"so anything happening?\" my reply was to proudly put my hands on my hips and say \"judge for yourself Doc!\" He almost cracked a smile and told me \"good thing I only gave you half a dose, otherwise you probably would have needed to go to the ER\". He explained to me that if it lasts more than two hours to take a Sudafed (apparently it is an anti-boner medicine) and it that deos not work and if it lasts four hours to head right to the ER and tell them what's going on. This does not sound like a good time to me, so now I'm praying for this erection to go away. It\u0092s at this point that things get really funny. He tells me \u0093OK you\u0092re done for today\u0094 and sends me on my merry way. There I am, in running pants (poor choice on my part), in a huge crowded hospital in the middle of downtown Chicago, with \u0093something\u0094 in my pants that I really have no control over and that is pretty obvious. I felt like I was back in the 7th grade and had to stand up in front of the class to do a math problem on the blackboard. I walk out of his office and get on on an elevator\u0085\u0085of course it is packed with people, I\u0092m taking asses to elbows packed. There is no option of waiting for a less crowded one as they are ALL like this. I\u0092m on the 21st floor and we all squeeze in. I\u0092m doing all I can to hide what it is going on but of course I think everyone can see it. As we start descending the car stops at about the 15th floor, I\u0092m hoping some people get out, but nooooo more people cram into this thing. And here is where it gets good, this could only happen to me. A \u0093little person\u0094 (or what ever the PC term for a vertically challenged adult is these days) gets on and OF COURSE she stands right in front of me! I\u0092m thinking \u0093please don\u0092t turn around, please don\u0092t\u0092 turn around\u0094 as I am trying even harder not to poke her in the back of the head with my uncontrollable \u0093situation\u0094. Thankfully she got out a few floors later and I was able to relax just a bit. Being that it was now 1:30 and I had not eaten since 7:00am, I was starving so I grabbed a bit to eat at one of the food court places in the hospital and of course I run into one of my long time customers. In such a huge city, what are the chances. I've know this guy for a long time and coached him at ski camps that I run for years. Thankfully he did not notice anything (if he did he didn't let on). After that things were pretty calm. I got in my car for the drive home, the whole time hoping this thing would go away. At times I would think it was going away, only to find that it was not. I stopped at the drug store for some Sudafed, took one and went home and feel asleep for a few hours. When I woke up \u0093things\u0094 were back to normal and I had to wonder if it was all just a really crazy dream\u0085of course it was as real as the day is long. I have to say, on paper a 2 hour erection sounds like it might be fun, I can assure you it\u0092s not. There is a reason those things only last a short time. So that\u0092s how my weekend started.",

      "Content": "Mods, if this is out of line please feel free to delete it. It is not my intention to offend anyone or anything like that. Sometimes a little humor helps. Alright, I've been deciding on whether or not I should post about this for several days. I understand some of you might not share my sense of humor about these kinds of things, but I have a feeling that most will . I want to share this because I think it might help some here and it is a funny story IMO. What I am about to share is 100% how it happened, I am not making this up, I probably couldn't if I tried. For those that might not know what Bimix is, I'll give a quick run down. It is a mix of two drugs that you self inject into the side your penis to give an erection. I know it sounds like the worst thing in the world to do this to yourself, but i can assure everyone that it is not as bad as it sounds and the results are OUTSTANDING! (for me at least). So here I am on a Friday, one month to the day after my open prostate surgery. My Dr. wanted to see me for a checkup, PSA test and to show me how to start with the Bimix injections. He wanted to make sure I knew how to inject and that I didn't have any reactions to the medicine. I went into the exam room with a pretty high degree of apprehension, I mean who really WANTS to stick a needle in the side of their penis. The nurse came in and did the routine stuff, drew some blood and left, saying the Dr. would see me in a few minutes. She assured me that it was not going to be as bad as I was making it out to be. So as I sat there and waited my mind was racing with the reality of what I was about to do. I've never been afraid of needles and after all the blood tests that one has to go through with my current situation, I am certainly getting used to it. But this was different. Sticking a needle in your penis is just not he same as your arm. After a bit the Dr. came in, asked me the usual questions, looked at my incision and deemed that I was healing up nicely. Then he said it was time for the injection He had me half leaning, half sitting on the exam table and asked me to drop my pants. Anyone who has been down the PCa road knows that humility and modesty are one the first things to go, I'll pretty much drop my pants anytime, anywhere for just about anyone these days (come to think of it, that's not much different than my pre-PCa days). So there I am in all my glory. The Dr. grabs the end of my penis and tells me \"you want to stretch it out as far as it will go, like this\" and proceeds to pin it to my upper thigh. At this point he has the injection in his other hand and shows me where and how to do it. Looking down I was in complete disbelief about what I was about to do. I was a shaking a little, but I just did it. After a small bit of resistance it went right in! I was shocked that I felt almost nothing, it honestly felt like a mosquito bite. I was like \"that's it?\" he told me that like most things in this journey the anticipation of the event is much worse than the reality, and I have to agree. Next he tells me to \"massage the medication into my penis\" at which point I raised one eyebrow and said jokingly \"so you want me to jerk off...in your exam room?\" Now my Dr. has no sense of humor at all and just responds with a stern look and says \"I'll be back to check on you in about 10 minutes\". So much fro trying to lighten the mood. I get it though, this guys spends his whole life looking at dudes schlongs and sticking his fingers in peoples rear ends, I don't blame him for being a little disconnected to it all. There I am \"massaging\" the medication. After a few minutes, low and behold my shriveled member starts to show signs of life again. This was a pretty emotional moment for me, I am only 38 and I hope to have a long and healthy sex life, so it was reassuring to see that things might work out after all. After about ten minutes the Dr. comes back in and asks \"so anything happening?\" my reply was to proudly put my hands on my hips and say \"judge for yourself Doc!\" He almost cracked a smile and told me \"good thing I only gave you half a dose, otherwise you probably would have needed to go to the ER\". He explained to me that if it lasts more than two hours to take a Sudafed (apparently it is an anti-boner medicine) and it that deos not work and if it lasts four hours to head right to the ER and tell them what's going on. This does not sound like a good time to me, so now I'm praying for this erection to go away. It\u0092s at this point that things get really funny. He tells me \u0093OK you\u0092re done for today\u0094 and sends me on my merry way. There I am, in running pants (poor choice on my part), in a huge crowded hospital in the middle of downtown Chicago, with \u0093something\u0094 in my pants that I really have no control over and that is pretty obvious. I felt like I was back in the 7th grade and had to stand up in front of the class to do a math problem on the blackboard. I walk out of his office and get on on an elevator\u0085\u0085of course it is packed with people, I\u0092m taking asses to elbows packed. There is no option of waiting for a less crowded one as they are ALL like this. I\u0092m on the 21st floor and we all squeeze in. I\u0092m doing all I can to hide what it is going on but of course I think everyone can see it. As we start descending the car stops at about the 15th floor, I\u0092m hoping some people get out, but nooooo more people cram into this thing. And here is where it gets good, this could only happen to me. A \u0093little person\u0094 (or what ever the PC term for a vertically challenged adult is these days) gets on and OF COURSE she stands right in front of me! I\u0092m thinking \u0093please don\u0092t turn around, please don\u0092t\u0092 turn around\u0094 as I am trying even harder not to poke her in the back of the head with my uncontrollable \u0093situation\u0094. Thankfully she got out a few floors later and I was able to relax just a bit. Being that it was now 1:30 and I had not eaten since 7:00am, I was starving so I grabbed a bit to eat at one of the food court places in the hospital and of course I run into one of my long time customers. In such a huge city, what are the chances. I've know this guy for a long time and coached him at ski camps that I run for years. Thankfully he did not notice anything (if he did he didn't let on). After that things were pretty calm. I got in my car for the drive home, the whole time hoping this thing would go away. At times I would think it was going away, only to find that it was not. I stopped at the drug store for some Sudafed, took one and went home and feel asleep for a few hours. When I woke up \u0093things\u0094 were back to normal and I had to wonder if it was all just a really crazy dream\u0085of course it was as real as the day is long. I have to say, on paper a 2 hour erection sounds like it might be fun, I can assure you it\u0092s not. There is a reason those things only last a short time. So that\u0092s how my weekend started.",

      "Content": "Being newly diagnosed and having to tell my friends, family and co-workers I can understand, to make matters worse I just started a new, great job 2 months ago. My family has been great, my wife's sisters have been great. Friends, the couple true close friends that I have are great, they know me well enough to understand how my twisted brain and sense of humor works. Those friends who are not so close have pulled away a little bit. Most of this I feel is due to my age. Being only 38 and having friends of similar age, it's really hard for them to understand. Most of them have never had to deal with something like this, so I try to cut them some slack. Co-workers that I have told (pretty much 6-8 people in my dept) have been OK, they kinda just pretend nothing is wrong, but then again I don't really know these people yet. I think, as was mentioned before, that most people just don't know what to say. For many the word \"cancer\" conjurers up images of chemo patents and they think you are going to die. Men as a rule are very hesitant to talk to each other about health issues, so it's of no real surprise to me that people act a little \"funny\". For me, I am on a mission to get at least my small group of friends and family to start getting at least a PSA done early. If I had not had an issue with urinating and got a PSA test done, I would not have had a chance.",

I'm off to get the bone scan done in the morning and then later in the week I'll get the CT done. Then I should have more details. In the mean time I've been talking to a few friends of friends who gone down this road and asked them about their surgeons, if the had good results etc. It's a starting point at least for me figure out who I might want to work on me.

      "Content": "Hello everyone. Can't say that I'm happy to be here, but I am happy there is a site like this. I am 38 years old, pretty healthy, not overweight and had my first PSA test done May 15 along with a DRE. I went to see the Urologist because of difficulty urinating. PSA was 11.9 and Dr said he felt firmness on one side of the prostate. We decided a second PSA might be a good idea so after 3 weeks I had a second one done, this time PSA was 9.9 Scheduled a biopsy, which was done last Wednesday (7/3/13), still waiting on the results form that. I have pretty much accepted that with THAT high of a PSA, along with firmness of the prostate, that I have very high chance of PC. Unfortunately, I don't really get the warm fuzzy feeling with my Urologist, he is very distant and almost hesitant to answer my questions. He's an older guy, maybe late 60's and seems very set in his ways. I picked him because he was in my network and is close to home. If this turns out to be something, I will be searching for a Dr I feel more comfortable with, but in the meantime, I'll stick with him. At my age, it sounds like surgery will be the most likely recommendation, but I'm not convinced it will be the best. I do have two young children and am married. What I have trouble finding is info about men with PC at my age. I really don't have anyone I can talk to about this that can relate, my friends are all my age or younger and have never had to deal with anything like this. So for now, I guess I don't have any real questions, just need a place where i can talk a little and get advice. So any advise is appreciated. Also, if anyone is in the Chicago area and has reccomdations for good Dr's please let me know. Thanks JD",

I hope that is all it is, but in the mean time I am trying to learn as much as I can (which may or may not be a good thing). Through all of it I am trying to at least keep a sense of humor. I had a bit of fun grossing out all my younger friends with my horror stories of my latest Dr visits this past weekend.

It's healed, but so much of my training has always centered around the core that I am scared of a hernia or something. I guess the best thing is just to start slow and see how it goes. I think I will lay off the bike for awhile though.",

      "Content": "Ski season is almost here. However due to my surgery and dealing with all the BS, this has been the active summer I have ever had and I am in terrible shape for the up coming season. I am nearing 8 weeks post OP, at 90% continence, 1 pad a day and almost never leak (a tiny bit if I lift something with a full bladder). My surgeon has lifted the weight limit, but I am still a little nervous about lifting anything heavy and setting my self back. I plan on being on snow starting early December. I am a life long ski racer and have worked in the ski industry for almost 20 years. Not skiing is simply not an option. So for those who have been down this road before me, how hard can I start working out. Should I stay off the bike? How about running? I understand that everyone heals different, I'm just looking for some general experiences.",
