      "Content": "Hello, My dad was diagnosed with prostate cancer about a year ago. He had a radical prostatectomy but it had spread outside of the prostate. They thought they had got it all, but his PSA levels kept rising. Now he has been diagnosed with aggressive stage 4 cancer and they recommended radiation therapy and hormone replacement therapy. He is refusing both, as his father and uncle died of this disease and he refuses to deal with the side effects of the treatment. I am wondering how much time he might have left. I want him to see me get married, and for him to travel and see family and friends, but I have no idea if this is something likely to kill him in a few months or years. Any information would be helpful. Thank you!",

      "Content": "Thanks for the replies. He is 61. I have read that the average survival time is between 3-5 years, however I am assuming that is with treatment like hormone therapy which prolongs life. It seems hard to find an answer as to the average survival time for an aggressive stage 4 cancer without any treatment. I appreciate the support! I don't have much information because my dad doesn't tend to ask many questions at the doctors office and then he doesn't write or remember the answers to the ones he does ask. I'll see if I can go with him next time to get a better understanding of what's going to happen. A big concern for me is that I've heard bone cancer is very painful, and he is allergic to all opioids and many other medications.",
