      "Content": "Dear Jennifer, and all the rest of kind supportive people here. I am so glad i found this forum specifically about small cell. My 83 year old father was diagnosed with small cell after a year of being treated for normal prostate cancer as he refused to have biopsy done ( he is a hard headed man who does not listen and or trust doctors I am trying my best to offer him help and options that will give him quality of life as i know prognosis for small cell is not good. I am trying hard to keep it together as i am the only caregiver he has no one else. He has lost weight and is not good with eating healthy, his oncologist wants to start him on Jevtana and Carboplatin CHEMO. I know no one can make the decision for him but I want to be able to give him clear options. Anyone here knows or has experience with these kind of CHEMO ? any advice will be so appreciated and Jennifer please let me know how things are going with your dad. I am praying for both of us.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by Jennifer2 I will keep you in my prayers as we both are going through a similar situation. My dad is almost 74 with the small cell carcinoma. His PSA is almost undetectable but I know that doesn't matter as with the small cell, the PSA does not rise. Chemo is off of the table for my dad. He had it a year ago and although it did shrink the cancer, it nearly killed him. He was getting reoccurring infections from the stents they had placed so that he could urinate better. He was diagnosed a year ago and although we had high hopes for a few more years, that all changed when we found out he had small cell this past January. I know that his doctors are just trying to make him comfortable. They did mention that they could do some radiation to help with pain but he has not opted for that yet. He is now having terrible back pain which he thought was from years of working but I believe it is the cancer. We have an apt with his oncologist tomorrow so I hope to learn more then. I just hope that they can make my dad comfortable so that he can enjoy what time he has left. I don't want them to treat him like a guinea pig and do a bunch of different meds to further their studies. I just want him to be able enjoy life as best as he can and as most comfortably as he can. Dear Jennifer2, i am glad to have found you here. everyone keeps talking about giving him quality of life but even now before CHEMO he is miserable he has neck and back pain and takes percocet and it helps a little but when it wears off he is just miserable. did you say your dad had kidney stents ? thats what they put for my dad in his right kidney, it was vey hard at first but now he is not complaining how did you know he had an infection ? My dad is not a very cooperative patient he hates Doctors and does not trust them and as you said think they are using him as Guinny pig. I am so confused if i should guide him to try chemo or just tell him to leave it alone , but leaving it alone is not going to be easy if he is going to get worse and worse and more pain. it is so hard and i have no family support, my bother does not want to deal with this my mom is divorced from him since 30 years and not involved and i have no one else. You guys here are so helpful in atlas understanding what i am going through.... I can not thank you enough , please keep me posted about your dad, we are going on Friday to see his oncologist I am not even sure what for (((",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by Michael F Hi torehb! Very sorry about your father. I noticed that you have found Jennifer2 on The Forum and hope that she can provide some practical guidance. The two of you will soon become BFFs (Best forum Friends!). SCPC is rare - fortunately. However, it usually does not have an accompanying elevated PSA - unfortunately as this will offer no warning sign. As a non medical professional, I would ask his MD if your father should also be on some form of Androgen Deprivation Therapy (ADT) along with his combined Chemo regimen. I in no way doubt the MDs strategy, but you can always contact the nearest academic teaching institution's Dept of Urologic Oncology and inquire about available clinical trials. Similarly you can go online and check the websites: - National Cancer Institute - American Cancer Society - American Foundation for Urologic Disease The frank and open discussion to have with the MD is: - What is his overall physiologic health status (minus the SCPC)? - What is his realistic life expectancy? - How to best minimize pain? - At what point do the negative effects of chemotherapy exceed the potential benefits? And agree on a stopping point. Meanwhile, surround him with friends and family. Keep him active and get him outside as much as possible. Best wishes achieving optimal balance, comfort and enjoyment moving forward. MF Thank you all for your responses.... the doctor says that Chemo can improve his quality of life but after just watching him suffer through 5 sessions of Radiation and how horrible he feels i can not imagine how he will react to Chemo. He has no desire to do anything, not even what TV. He does not want to go our or do anything i try everyday but he just does not want to. I don't know if that is depression or his pain. I am worried and feel so helpless. The doctors keep saying they don't like to give any life expectancy time lines. I am trying to help him make the best decision knowing he will say he does not want to see anymore doctors but later when he will feel bad then he will ask me to take him. Any advice or experiences will be appreciated.",
