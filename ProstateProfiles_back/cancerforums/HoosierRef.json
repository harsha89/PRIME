    "Content": "But no choice...lol I had a 5.0 PSA 2 years ago when I was 47. Biopsy showed 1 of 12 cores positive, with a Gleason 6. With family history, I knew it was a matter of time. Chose to wait. PSA stayed in the 5 range, but another biospy 18 months showed it at a Gleason 7 3+4. I chose removal, which I had done 7/10/15 at University of Chicago. All went perfect. Pathology all came back perfect too. Still some slight urine drips, but that is better than I expected. Semi hard erections surprised me too, since it's only been 19 days. I'll wait til a month before asking for Cialis or the like. Lots of great info I learned on here...before and after my surgery. Thanks guys!",
