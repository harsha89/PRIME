      "Content": "Originally Posted by JustSlappy Here's what I know about proton beam: It is extremely expensive ($50,000-$150,000), though Medicaid does cover it. A lot of insurance companies don't. First, they'll surgically implant seeds in your prostate, which they will use to guide the proton beams. Then, you'll get radiated once a day for about 9 weeks. There are NO limits as to what you do during that 9-week period. And there's little if any discomfort during the therapy. The big advantages, to me, are that your chances of leakage are much lower than surgery, and your likelihood of ED is delayed (I've been told anywhere from 6 months to 5 years). The extent of ED is a big unknown for proton beam, which is too bad because it is, to me, a big reason to do it instead of surgery. Guys who have had it seem to swear by it. Unfortunately, there's hardly any good data available on the side effects. And there are none of the other standard surgery risks like, well, death or infection. And no catheter. The biggest disadvantages are that there's no follow-up pathology as there is with surgery, so your PSA test is the only way to know if you are cancer-free. There's also risk of rectal issues, since the tip of the rectum gets radiated in the process. A small percentage (5%, i think, or maybe even less) suffer serious rectal issues that require treatment while more folks suffer temporary stuff like constipation, etc. As with any radiation, there's the slight chance of secondary cancers, which usually develop 8-10 years later, if they develop at all. And, as with any radiation, it makes any prostate surgery difficult, if doable at all, later. Just curious if anyone here has direct experience. thanks Yes, I have direct experience with the proton beam therapy. Completed 44 sessions recently in Chicago. My PSA went from double digit before treatment to now 0.01. Main advantage of proton beam radiation vs Xray radiation is the way proton releases its energy in the tumor since it enters the body with extremely low energy to avoid any damage then when it reaches the target (tumor), it releases the full energy attacking the tumor. Once it is done, the energy essentially fizzles out whereas Xray enters the body thru good tissues into the tumor then comes out in the back again thru good tissues. Proton minimizes collateral damage to the rectum and bladder. Not only that each patient is inserted a balloon then filled with water to further protect the rectum plus the bladder must be full before proceeding to prevent damage to the bladder. If everything checks out, then they'll proceed with the proton beam which only lasts less than 2 minutes. For patient with imbedded prostate (prostate grown into the bladder or touching the bladder), a special pencil beam technique is used to precisely give proton beam to the prostate without any scatter. There are only 5 such pencil beam facilities in US, and one is in Chicago's Warrenville proton clinic. The other advantage of proton therapy is the virtual nonexistent side effects since a patient can continue to run, jog, swim, work, .... as if nothing had happened. Yes, cost is higher than robotic surgery, Xray radiation but most insurance covers this therapy. Only less than a handful of the insurers refuse coverage. Medicare covers it for sure. Proton beam treats all sort of tumors especially in kid where they are more sensitive than adults. It is effective in treating prostate, lung, breast, neck, sinus, throat, ocular (eye), head, brain, .... type of cancer. For those of you who are interested in finding out more of this proton beam treatment, the ProCure Proton Clinic in Warrenville, IL (next to Naperville) is having an Open House this Sat (11/2) from 9 to 2 where the public can tour the entire facilities including the star, the 3-story high cyclotron machine which generates the proton beam. Hope this helps.",

Most patients come in 50 mins before appt time then they have 10 mins to finish drinking their water. You wait 40 mins before you get in to change to get on the table. Once you are on the table, the therapist checks to make sure you are indeed full and also free of gas. If bladder is too full, you'll need to empty a bit. If not full enough, you need to drink a bit. If they detect gas, then it'll need to be sucked out before radiation can start. Typical patients on radiation are placed a strict diet to minimize gas. However, many smaller radiation clinics don't have such requirements.",
