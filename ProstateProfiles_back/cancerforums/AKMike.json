    "Content": "I had a robotic prostatectomy two years ago, and went through a series of PSA tests at increasing intervals for the first two years. This last time was a 6-month span. In all previous tests, the results came back <0.1, (less than 0.1) which I'm told is considered \"undetectable.\" This time it came back 0.1, without the \"less-than\" sign. My doctor said he wasn't sure if it was a mistake, but he gave me what he called an extra-sensitive test as a follow-up. He actually said he'd meant to do that this time anyway but the nurse didn't get his message. Anyway, the extra sensitive test came back 0.087. I was originally delighted to see it was still \"unedetectable\" on the old scale, but the doc says it really should be undetectable on this ultra sensitive scale. My question: Is anyone familiar with an extra sensitive test? Is it new? And what does it mean when the number is detectable but below 0.1, which I'd always thought was the standard for \"unedetectable.\" Thanks for your time.",
