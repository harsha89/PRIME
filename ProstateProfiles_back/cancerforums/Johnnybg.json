    "Content": "Hey guys, I guess we are all here for the same shitty diagnosis a dude can ever get. I\u0092m 59 yrs old and the saying use it or Lose doesn\u0092t ring true to me. My wife and I are having sex on almost a daily basis and it\u0092s a huge component in our relationship. This is my 3rd marriage but should have been my first. We\u0092ve been together 7 yrs and the sex is awesome and now this!! I\u0092m waiting on the MRI results but my question is has anyone had the surgery radical prostecomy and than others who have had just the radiation and hormones. My surgeon doesn\u0092t think mine is operable so he mentioned radiation with hormones. I need to know if this will effect my ability to have an erection or from what he told me the surgery is worse cuz they cut the nerves that produce an erection. I don\u0092t want to live as a woman with breasts and no working penis. I\u0092d rather be gone & I know some might think it\u0092s shallow but I need to know if I have a better chance at keeping my manhood and with which procedure. Can anyone share your exp with both treatments? Thanks John",
