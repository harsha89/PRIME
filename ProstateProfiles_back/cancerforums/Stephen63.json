      "Content": "Gina - The radiation oncologist asked that he get the colonoscopy. He had it done (with no problems) which would have been about 6 weeks post op. Unfortunately, we got nowhere with the phone calls back and forth to MD Anderson. We're almost to Houston and will finish the drive there tomorrow - we have an appointment with the radiation oncologist Tuesday morning. We were told that the radiologist was not going to order any scans at this time and that we could leave after the appointment. I don't understand why they are not having a bone scan done. I have two pages of questions and hope to have them all answered and the doctor's action plan as to what the future holds before we head back to IL.",

      "Content": "I had robotic prostatectomy in February 2015. 1 of 3 lymph nodes positive for metastases, extra capsular extension identified, Gleason 7 (4+3). My oncologist referred me to a radiation oncologist for adjuvant radiation therapy. My 7-week post-op PSA is 0.0. I've had no scans done as yet, and the radiation oncologist said he's not ordering any at this time. I'm not sure what the plan is . . . he said I didn't need to plan on staying for any length of time after my office visit which tells me he isn't planning any radiation. Not sure I'm going to make this 1,000 mile trip for an office visit. Would like to hear from others with similar findings as me about how they proceeded with treatment. The lymph node involvement has me extremely worried.

      "Content": "Thanks for the warm welcome and for sharing your stories! I'm actually Rhonda (Steve's wife) - he doesn't use a computer! : ) With the lymph node metastases, decided to go to MD Anderson in TX (sister and cousin both live north of Dallas - cousin is a patient at MD Anderson and insisted he go there). MD requested tissue from biopsy and surgery and upgraded diagnosis from a Gleason 7 (3+4) to a Gleason 7 (4+3) and also identified extra prostatic extension. Not good news, but better to know what you're dealing with than not. The oncologist then referred him to a radiation oncologist there at MD. He requested a colonoscopy (which has been done - 5 polyps removed and all negative) and a 7-week post op PSA which came back 0.0. Well, we're 1,000 miles away and having difficulty trying to explain to this radiation oncologist that it's a hardship to make a trip there if it's just for a consult. But, car would be packed in an hour if scans or radiation would begin. hms03049's post is informative - would be nice if the radiation doctor would just tell us that over the phone so we'd know how to plan. Letsdothis - again, sounds like a waiting period might be standard procedure . . . Again, thanks to all of you for the info and supportive comments!",
