      "Content": "my husband was 46 yrs old when he was diagnosed with stage IV prostate cancer spread to bones and lymph nodes with a PSA of 987! Yes, 987!!! he is seeing a prostate cancer specialist in Houston, not at MDA, but who is considered to be an expert in prostate cancer. We originally went to UAMS and were given 12-18 months! he started out with 9 months of chemo, adriamycin one week, taxotere the next, 6 weeks on 2 weeks off, PSA went down to .1, also treated with lupron, ketoconazole and hydrocortisone. All 12 biopsies were Gleason 8, 9 and 10's. Did 44 daily radiation treatments after chemo. pSA held for a few months then in October 2012 jumped back up to 346! he restarted chemo in October 2012 thru October 2013, PSA back down to 1.5, then started xtandi the middle of October 2013, been on it for 4 months now and PSA down to .1 but was really tired for the first 3 months of xtandi. He is finally starting to feel better! Not sure what to expect next just glad to still be in the fight. Also still on lupron, xgeva, hydrocortisone and Celebrex for joint pain. Is there anybody else who has been on xtandi and if so how long before it stops working?",
