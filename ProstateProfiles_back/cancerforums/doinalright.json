      "Content": "Thanks for the post guys. It truly does help to know people are experiencing the same thing (some what). Without sounding funny or ungrateful, but has anyone or someone ever heard of increased orgasm intensity since the surgery? The nurse is checking with the doctor because she never heard of that however mine are much much more intense and longer than before. I don't know if that is because of the healing taking place or even if it will subside in time but just like feedback if possible. Thanks again for the support.",

      "Content": "I had the robotic,nerve sparing,Prostatectomy on July 16th. After the removal of the catheter a week later I noticed a partial erection in the mornings. After reading so many posts on \"using it\" as soon and as often as you can to bring it back quicker, I talked to my doctor and he prescribed Viagra. Viagra seems to bring me to about 70% but far from the presurgery state that I was use to. As far as the \"dribbles\", well, they are with me everywhere I go. Since the catheter removal I have been able to sleep and sit without any leakage but as soon as I rise the gates open. As I type this I am waiting for a call back from my doctor as to whether he thinks I have a urinary track infection. It burns at the conclusion of my void and when I am sitting on the toilet. Guess I haven't been drinking as much water as I thought. If anyone remembers the stage that I am in now and can tell me kinda what to expect in the near future on the dribbling and the erections, I would greatly appreciate it. Doctors are great with numbers and averages but hearing from someone that has experienced it first hand seems to comfort me more.",

      "Content": "Thanks Dan, I have been doing the kegals (when I remember). Doctor said I was ahead of the game but sometimes it gets so frustrating changing pads all day. Does the urinating and the erections gradually get better or is it like wake up one day and \"hello there\"? I have no leaking when I cough or sneeze but just a dribble throughout the day. I am 46 years old and I am truly working hard at recovering. No pun intended. I am having a burning sensation after urinating and lab test came back \"no\" infections. So now I am worried about that. I have a call into the surgeon. Thanks for responding.",
