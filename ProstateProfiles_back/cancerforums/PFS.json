      "Content": "Hi all. I just got my diagnosis 2 days ago. I had a biopsy in Carson City Nevada and left for the season in Venice Florida the next day. I do not want to go back to Nevada for treatment. I do not have any resources here. I received a private reference for a Dr Joseph Bilik in Sarasota. I have an appointment with Dr Bilik tomorrow AM. I have tried to get an appointment a Moffitt, but I do not have a card for my new insurance yet (any day now) and they take 10 days to decide if they will take cash and another 2 to 6 weeks for an appointment. I am having a lot of anxiety here and want to know all treatment options. I am afraid of surgery because of impotency and incontinence. Any suggestions for treatment in Florida? My urologist in Nevada knows I will probably seek treatment elsewhere and was not very helpful on the phone call we had. Comparing my biopsy with others, it looks bad to me. Thoughts? I entered my results, but I don't know they will post with this. Thanks, PFS",
