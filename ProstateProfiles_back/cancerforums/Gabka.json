      "Content": "Hello there, my husband is 53 and has been diagnosed with prostate cancer in November of last year. Biopsy showed Gleason score of 7 (3+4) and we have opted for radical prostatectomy. The surgery was done on 21 February. He is recovering well, although he had bladder infection straight after surgery everything else seems to go well. He regained his continence nearly straight after catheter removal and is feeling ok. Straight after surgery our urologist said he is confident that everything went well and cancer was removed We went to see our urologist yesterday to see the pathology report of what they've taken out. He said that Gleason score of prostate was indeed 7 but it was 4+3 rather than 3+4 and whole one side of prostate was cancerous plus tumor was pressing on the wall of the prostate and it is not clear if it has broke the wall of it. So he is not sure if there was anything left behind. Lymph nodes seem ok. We are waiting for our post op PSA levels in june september and december... can't it be detected sooner?? Can anyone tell me what is likely outcome of this? Before surgery and after lot of reading I was quite calmed down with the fact that though it is gleason 7 it is 3+4 and the cancer hasn't left the prostate, I knew everything is going to be ok... but now I am just petrified and confused...",

      "Content": "Hello Chuck! Thank you so much for you reply. I have just e-mailed our surgeon for the pathology report and I hope he will reply soon so I can share it with you and hopefully get some sense of it. My husband is the positive one and I do all the worrying. It is so very hard to stay positive when all you can do is wait and your head can't shut down from all the thinking and worrying sick...",

      "Content": "hello Bill Thanks for your reply. Your news after surgery must have come as some shock to you same as relief that you made your decision to go ahead with the surgery. I am glad it turned out well for you! This not knowing and waiting is so hard! We were so positive before and after the surgery that everything is going to be good and surgery will sort it all out. It probably didn't help that after biopsy we had to wait for 5 months for the surgery due to many cancellations and that hospital cancelled all the surgeries of our previous urologist just day before we were scheduled so we had to be referred to someone else... I have just e-mailed to our urologist to come back to me with the details of the pathology report so I can put here more details so maybe someone can give me some answers. Thanks again for your support it means so much to me...",
