      "Content": "Hi everyone, I've kind of lost touch in recent weeks with the treatment and recovery and work filling may days up. I elected to have the sbrt radiation, 5 doses over 2 weeks. My doctor recommended that I take an additional 2 weeks off of work but I was going stir crazy. I WISH I HAD LISTENED TO HIM!! My insurance company wouldn't pay for the protective gel (15000) I guess I shouldn't have expected that for an old warn out truck driver lol. Anyway I guess time will tell if it worked. I forgot to ask the doc about when I'll take the next psa test, is there a certain waiting period? I'm scheduled for a follow-up on the 30 th. Thanks again to all of you (too many to name) for your advice and kind words of encouragement. To all those who are new to this \"ugly club\" listen to these men, they are experienced with this whole process. They have been an enormous help to me personally and I will always remember them with gratitude and respect. Thank you Mark",

      "Content": "Hi all, just was able to login now because I forgot my password. I'm using my laptop which fortunately remembers my password, but in order to change it I have to know it which I don.t lol! Usually I post from my phone but changed it and lost the password. Anyone know how to fix this? Thanks. I had my first PSA (end of Sept.) since my treatment (sbrt early april). It was 2.04. \"a little high\" according to the doc. He didn't volunteer it, as usual I had to drag it out of him. Wants to see me in 6 months, before retesting. I'm changing docs, new one is an oncologist/hematologist. I've been bruising for no reason and my blood tests came in a little low too. He doesn't think the SBRT would cause Leukemia because it only exposes a small area of bone marrow to the radiation. My PC physician said I have anemia. So I I'm hoping the new doc can shed some light it. Mark",

It had been so long so long since the diagnosis that I just didn't feel good about going to war with the insurance co.and delaying it any longer. The side affects were very uncomfortable and I should have taken another week off but I'm ok and things area almost back to normal. Thanks AS I will read those articles this weekend whenI get back. Thanks Rob I have been unsure of what to expect from the PSA. I'm just glad that I'm still able to work. Mark",

I looked up my previous tests, 12/26/14--3.79, 8/27/10--1.70, thanks for asking, I probably wouldn't have looked. I would like to thank all of you who have replied, I appreciate your kindness, and concern. Mark Originally Posted by HighlanderCFH Welcome to the forum. Were you intimate with your wife just before the second PSA test also? If not, then the second test would be the one to rely on. In general, before taking a PSA test, here are a few tips for the 48-72 hours before the blood is drawn: * DO NOT have any kind of sex * DO NOT ride a bike * DO NOT do any strenuous exercise * DO NOT let a physician perform a digital rectal exam All of the above activities place stress on the prostate & trigger extra PSA -- which gives a false reading. It would be best to have the PSA test prior to seeing a urologist so the results can already be available. The dribbling you refer to could be the result of BPH -- which is a benign enlargement of the prostate. BPH also can make a PSA reading be higher than normal. What is your age? As for the low free PSA reading -- anything under 15% is \"suggestive\" of prostate cancer. But it does NOT mean that you have it for sure. Only a biopsy can diagnose PC. Have you set up an appointment with the uro yet?",

      "Content": "PSA Confusion Hi, I'm new here and have a question about my PSA results. PSA of several weeks ago was 5.78 followed by Cipro. The new test was 4.40 with a free PSA of .35 at 8%. If the Cipro knocked it down why is the Free PSA so low or maybe it isn't? I may have been intimate with my wife the night before the first test but I'm not positive. I also struggle with dribbling, and impotence with pain in my crotch (dull ache). The 8% number seems to suggest cancer, so if there's anyone with a similar experience that could shed some light on it I would certainly appreciate your insight. My doctor is referring me to a urologist. ThankYou Sorry, I posted this in general forum by mistake",
