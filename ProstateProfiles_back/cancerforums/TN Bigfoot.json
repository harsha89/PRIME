      "Content": "Just found this forum and looking forward to the discussions. My situation: Age 59. BPH type symptoms for probably ~5 yrs. PSA history 1.7 (2011). 2.5 (2015) 4.2 2017. Referred to urologist. DRE negative but confirmed enlarged prostate. Second PSA comes Back at 3.49. After consultation, URO recommended biopsy since the rate of change is climbing. First reaction was panic/anxiety and \"I gotta know\". Scheduled biopsy for 8 days later however canceled after talking to URO to catch my breath. Want to decide on some additional term life before any possible diagnosis. I'm giving myself 2 months to resolve and move ahead. Heard all the pro's/cons of biopsy at this stage but for me, knowing if PCa is a reality is better than Being on hold. Is there any value in pushing for another PSA before biopsy? Would be ~3 months since last test. On the good side, this has made me take my health seriously. Dietary changes and exercise are progressing an blood pressure is lower than recent memory. Your comments are appreciated and God Bless",
