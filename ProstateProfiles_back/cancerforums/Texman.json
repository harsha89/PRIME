      "Content": "It seems I will be using a suprapubic catheter for many years to come. I am fairly active, and found that it has been difficult and uncomfortable to keep my leg bag secured. This idea came to me a couple days ago, and it works great. Just add some buttons to some sports compression shorts. It was very simple: 1) Buy some compression shorts (Walmat) 2) Put them on, and mark where button holes will go 3) Sew in some buttons. Put some backing behind the buttons to give more strength 4) Enjoy the comfort and ease. Youtube--> \"Suprapubic catheter compression shorts\"",
