      "Content": "This is an excellent question but difficult / controversial to answer. There are two reasons to do pelvic lymph node dissection (PLND). 1) to help with staging (i.e. to detect metastasis) in which case the patient may decide whether or not he would like the surgeon to continue. 2) it is potentially therapeutic (i.e. if there is microscopic metastasis to a few nodes and they are all removed this may result in a cure, however the data on this is somewhat conflicted. Here are some papers showing potential benefit: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2997840/ http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1950746/ http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=15540734 The reason not to do it is there is the potential for complications - primarily lympocele. Lympocele is usually minor and easily managed but rarely can cause significant chronic problems (e.g. lymphedema in the legs) As with many aspects of surgery, I imagine the incidence of sequelae depend in great part on the skill of the surgeon and the post-op clinical protocol employed. The literature shows a wide variation in reported incidence of lymphoceles. A study from University of Chicago (Orvieto et. al.) using post-op CT detected lymphoceles in 39 of 76 patients (51%) however only 6 of 76 (7.9%) were clinically symptomatic. On the other hand, a paper from Hopkins (Allaf et. al.) reported lymphocele in only 3 out of 4000 patients (<0.1%) Dr. Walsh addresses this issue in his book and explains that due to the potential benefit and low rate of complications (which are typically easily manageable when they due occur) it was made institutional policy at Johns Hopkins to perform lymph node dissection for all patients: \"one out of one hundred times, lymph nodes turn out to be positive in a patient in whom you would least expect it. Because we have found that these are also the exact patients who would benefit most from having these lymph nodes removed, we continue to do lymph node dissections in all patients. We are emboldened to do this because of the extremely low risk of complications associated with this, the ease with which a complete lymph node dissection can be performed in a short time, and the fact that more good can come from it than not.\" but Walsh also states that, given the declining rate of node positivity it is \"understandable\" for surgeons to omit dissection. Another Doctor with whom I consulted, Arieh Shalhav (Chief of Urology at University of Chicago -- where the one paper above came from reporting 7.9% incidence of clinically symptomatic lympocele) was adamant that I should have lymph node dissection because he said he had been \u201cburned too many times\u201d by apparently low risk patients whose finally pathology turns out significantly worse and told me that while \"annoying\" lympocele is easily managed. Dr. Burnett from Hopkins who did my surgery also stressed the potential benefit benefit and stated that open RRP facilitates a better job of PLND. My personal opinion is for a young healthy guy who is going to go through surgery the small incremental risk is negligible and well worth it for maximizing the possibility of cure.",

      "Content": "This is very puzzling / concerning in a couple respects... 1) I believe studies show better likelihood of cure when salvage is done at 0.2 than if you wait. 2) Moreover, C-11 PET choline scan is used to detect distant recurrence (bone or possibly lymph node mets) so if you wait to see something on that scan it is likely too late to cure with salvage radiation. I would ask Dr. Kwon to explain / answer each of these two concerns. If you want another opinion from probably the top expert in the world on handling potential recurrence contact Dr. d'Amico at Dana Farber. Perhaps he will even give you a 2nd opinion remotely.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by BigbirdPhila Many posters here recommend researching positive (or negative) surgical margin rates for evaluating a surgeon's skill. I would be particularly interested in researching their results with T1c cases, which is my current stage. I've tried many Google searches and several searches here in the PC Forum but am coming up with blanks. Can someone point me to where I can start researching published numbers for RALP surgeons? Are these kinds of numbers available only for \"big time\" surgeons who have tabulated their data and published a study? With a few exceptions you won't be able to find out a surgeon's margin rates without asking him/her. The exceptions are surgeons who have published their results in medical journals. When I was looking for a surgeon in 2013, I read as many of those journal papers as I could locate and I compiled my findings in a spreadsheet, which I have posted here as a Google Doc (please note that I have not updated this since 2013): https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets...kf2x9v15dm5LjY Although these are all high volume surgeons at top institutions the variability among their results is striking. Since you hope to find a local surgeon, you should just ask them for their results during a consultation appointment. Specifically I recommend you ask the following questions: \"What is your positive surgical margin rate for pathalogic stage T2 (stage pT2) patients?\" \"What is your positive surgical margin rate for pathalogic stage T3 (stage pT3) patients?\" Although you can also ask about their PSM rates by patients' clinical stage (cT1c in your case), this is actually NOT the best way to compare one surgeon to another because there can be great variability among clinical T1c patients based on other risk factors like Gleason score and PSA. For example, a clinical T1c patient who is G9 with a PSA of 20 is much more likely to turn out to have pathalogic stage pT3 or pT4 (where positive margins are hard to avoid) than you being clinical T1c G6 with PSA of only 4.5. Pathologic stage on the other hand provides a more apples-to-apples comparison. In particular, comparing only PSM rates for actual pT2 patients (who have organ confined disease / no extra-capsular extension, which is the best case scenario) and essentially any positive surgical margins that occur with such patents are iatrogenic (i.e. the surgeon nicking into the prostate capsule and leaving part of it -- including tumor -- inside the patient). Unfortunately because RP is so tricky this happens to the even the best surgeons sometimes (less than 2% of pT2 patients) but with most other surgeons it may occur with around 10% or more on the same type of pT2 patients that have organ confined disease. Any surgeon you interview should be able to readily and precisely answer these questions (and if they can't or won't that would be a big red flag). If you can't find a local doctor with results approaching the best (i.e. lowest) numbers in my spreadsheet -- particularly if their PSM rate for stage pT2 is much more than 2% (which is quite possible), then don't be afraid to travel to a surgeon who has published top results. All that said, since your stats are pretty low risk and you are 66 years old I would encourage you to strongly consider your other options like brachytherapy (but also only with a top practitioner), SBRT, or active surveillance. Although a top surgeon can maximize the likelihood of a good outcome, there is a real possibility of some significant / lingering side effects from the surgery.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by LILDOG Can nerve sparing cause psa to become detectable ( with ultra sensitve assay ) or rise after prostate surgery ? With any RP surgery there can be bits of prostate left behind, but yes this is probably more likely with nerve sparing because the surgeon is cutting much closer to the prostate to free the delicate web of nerves from its capsule and it is relatively common to \"nick\" the capsule. Any prostate left behind could be benign and/or malignant depending on where the tumor is located relative to any nicks through the capsule. When you have a positive surgical margin there is a much stronger suspicion that malignant cells were left behind. However, as explained in Dr. Walsh's book, this is not always the case because you can have false positive margins. As also explained in Walsh's book, even if some malignant cells were left behind at the margin, they may not actually survive the trauma of surgery. In particular, many believe that if the GS at the PSM is 3+3 those cells are less likely to survive than higher GS cells. As you know, the purpose of your periodic PSA test to look for indication of relatively high and increasing levels of PSA returning that would be suspicious for tumor re-growing. Bits of benign tissue can result in low but persistent / slowly increasing PSA levels. Donin et. al. describe this as \"insignificant biochemical recurrence\" (iBCR): \"A PSA >0.2 ng/mL may develop because of local, lymphatic, or systemic recurrent prostate cancer or may be because of the presence of residual benign prostate tissue. Differentiating between these etiologies in the early stages of recurrence is not possible using presently available diagnostic technology. We have previously reported that microscopic benign prostate tissue is often identified at the apical and bladder neck soft tissue margins during RP and speculated that these benign glands may contribute to measureable PSA associated with prolonged PSA doubling time (PSADT). We have previously reported that a postprostatectomy PSA >0.2 ng/mL in association with a PSADT >36 months is attributable to residual benign microscopic prostatic elements. Men fulfilling these criteria in the present study were classified as exhibiting iBCR likely because of benign prostatic tissue and therefore none of these men were offered salvage radiation therapy (SRT).\" see: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23706588 http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19406457",

      "Content": "Welcome K9, First, have you also had a DRE or just the PSAs? If you have not had a DRE you absolutely should have one. However even if the DRE and is normal, that is still no guarantee however, as most PC is diagnosed before it is palpable on DRE. Those PSA numbers are definitely high for your age (median PSA for 40-50 yr old men is only 0.7). This puts you well above the 90% percentile PSA level (1.5) and at much higher risk of death from aggressive PC by the age of 75. See http://www.mskcc.org/videos/psa-test...ssive-prostate. Also, assuming the readings were actually 12 months apart, your most recent PSA velocity of 2.0 - 1.6 = 0.4 ng/yr is above the 0.2 to 0.35 ng/yr thresholds that have previously been considered a red flag, however the value of PSA velocity for screening purposes is controversial with experts and studies conflicting and views changing over time. See E.g. (in order from most recent to oldest): http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/777868 http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23706588 http://www.cancer.gov/clinicaltrials...a-velocity2011 http://www.mskcc.org/pressroom/press...edict-prostate http://www.cancernetwork.com/article...rostate-cancer http://www.mc.uky.edu/publichealth/d...0_Catalona.pdf http://www.drcatalona.com/quest/quest_fall06_1.asp http://urology.jhu.edu/newsletter/pr..._cancer820.php A 2nd PSA to confirm the 2.0 value / .4 velocity and also check your % Free PSA may be a good idea. If you had sex, bicycled, or had the DRE prior to the blood draw, the 2.0 could have been artificially elevated. My first and only PSA was done this Jan after I turned 40 and came back 1.23 which is not alarmingly high and below the 2.5 threshold for my age, but I had an abnormal DRE that did turned out to be from PC. Although already relatively large (stage T2 palpable) tumor, fortunately it turned out to be non-aggressive Gleason 3+3. Good luck.",

      "Content": "Hi Marty, While the risk of recurrence does continue to increase with time even out past 15 years, the slope gradually levels off so the incremental risk with each year is less and less. The apex is the most common location for positive margins with organ confined (pT2) disease due to the nature of the anatomy. If you are going to have positive margins, apical are probably the best as several studies suggest that they pose lower risk of recurrence than positive margins in other locations. Out of curiosity, how many nodes did you have taken out?",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by gsteve Im leaning to da vinci for all the known reasons. Hi gsteve, What are those \"known reasons\" in your mind? The only clear advantage vs open is less blood loss and open has some advantages over robotic so it should come down to picking the surgeon who can offer you the best record of results and then leting him use whatever tools he uses. (I don't mean to sound like a broken record but I get the impression you missed what I said in the other thread and want to make sure you understand) I do agree with the others on the recovery process - with either open or robotic approach you'll probably feel great after 2 weeks, but you need to watch the lifting and other exertion or you risk a hernia. As far as the incision for open surgery, my doctor did everything through a only a single 3 inch incision that starts about 3 inches below my belly button and goes down from there. Because the muscle fibers run vertically they are not cut but just separated, which is by contrast to the circular trocars used for robotic (especially the one that needs to be enlarged to remove the intact specimen for pathology) that can cause more muscle trauma.",

      "Content": "I did extensive research on published outcomes -- not for robotic vs open per-se but for which specific surgeons had the best track record. I focused almost exclusively on oncological outcomes (surgical margin rates) vs continence or ED since both of those are less important than being cured and are also amenable to other therapies if necessary. The best surgical margin rates published were by open surgeons but a few robotic guys came pretty close. As far as continence my impression was little difference -- all good surgeons seemed to be 95%+ @ 1yr. ED is much more variable depending not only on the skill of the surgeon but on the patient's pre-op function, the extent of the disease, and how much risk the surgeon is willing to take to trading off nerve sparing vs. cancer control. I was told by the head of robotic surgery at Johns Hopkins that the only significant advantage to me from robotic vs open would be less blood loss. If you are interested, you can read my detailed account of my decision making process that I posted a couple weeks ago: http://www.cancerforums.net/threads/...t-op-(my-story) My #1 piece of advice to you would be to pick up Patrick Walsh's book (3rd ed. just updated). He invented nerve-sparing (anatomic) surgery, performed thousands of them, and ran the program at Hopkins for around 30 years. His book is excellent and addresses other treatments as well.",

      "Content": "Good advice from Otago. I don't know the typical rates of \"dying on the table\" in prostateectomy but I am sure they are very low. Although it is a very tricky operation to do well (i.e. actually get all the cancer out and preserve nerves and continence), I don't believe it is unusually risky for a relatively healthy patient. The main risk would be from general anesthesia, which can be avoided by having open surgery with regional (spinal) anesthesia, which is what I did even though I was young and healthy. Robotic or other laproscopic surgery require general anesthesia. My main concern would 1) making sure surgery is the right option and 2) be finding the absolute best surgeon you can, even if that means traveling to a center of excellence like Johns Hopkins.",

      "Content": "Good advice from Otago. I don't know the typical rates of \"dying on the table\" in prostateectomy but I am sure they are very low. Although it is a very tricky operation to do well (i.e. actually get all the cancer out and preserve nerves and continence), I don't believe it is unusually risky for a relatively healthy patient. The main risk would be from general anesthesia, which can be avoided by having open surgery with regional (spinal) anesthesia, which is what I did even though I was young and healthy. Robotic or other laproscopic surgery require general anesthesia. My main concern would 1) making sure surgery is the right option and 2) be finding the absolute best surgeon you can, even if that means traveling to a center of excellence like Johns Hopkins.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by ddayglo Anyway, he asked me how a negative margin could be a good indicator of the surgeon's expertise: Friend: \"The Dr takes out the entire prostate, right?\" Me: \"yes\" Unfortunately, no, often the surgeon often does not successfully take out the entire prostate. This is what happens when a patient with true organ-confined (stage pT2) disease ends up with a positive margin (see below). Originally Posted by ddayglo Friend: \"Then if the margin is positive it means that the cancer spread and negative means it was contained, right\" Me: \"right\" No. Again, many times posative margins actually occur despite the cancer being completely confined to the protate(no extra-prostatic extension) due to imperfect execution by the surgeon (see below). Originally Posted by ddayglo Friend: \"If he takes out the entire prostate, if the margin was positive, then it doesn't have anything to do with the surgeon's expertise, but more to do with the progression of the cancer, wouldn't it?\" I really didn't know how to answer him.... Advise appreciated. Thanks. Originally Posted by lLance ddayglo, I had the same question a while back. It was pointed out to me that if the surgeon missed getting all of it, there by leaving a positive margin that some how he was a bad surgeon. But my surgeon said that when doing the surgery they can't tell good tissue from bad. I get the impression that it is good guess work and luck. Short of actual biochemical recurrence, which unfortunately is very much a lagging indicator, positive surgical margin (PSM) rates are the best indicator of oncologic effectiveness (multiple studies show positive margins raise risk of eventual recurrence), so margins do matter! And there is substantial variation across surgeons - even among highly experienced surgeons operating on similar patients. While differences in pathological protocol (some labs having more false positives / false negatives based on how they process the specimen) may explain some variation, the best explanation for this is actual variation in surgical technique and skill. Given the same patient, some surgeons will be much more likely to achieve negative margins than others. I believe the best indicator of surgical skill is PSM rates for true pathologically organ-confined (stage pT2) disease. In this case the cancer was actually contained in the prostate so a PSM means the surgeon somehow managed to not remove the entire prostate! This happens to all surgeons sometimes but for the best surgeons the rate is less than 2% compared to 6%-10% for a good surgeon and much higher still for a average or worse surgeon. The most common causes for this are leaving bits of prostate tissue behind at the apex where it meets the pelvic floor muscles and the prostate has no capsule or inadvertently nicking into the capsule when dissecting away the nerve bundles or resecting the prostate out of the prostate bed. This is an iatrogenic (surgeon-caused) PSM. Both skill (including both steadiness of hand and judgement in discerning tissue planes) and technique (e.g. how aggressive the surgeon is in sparing nerves for a patient with given risk factors) influence this. For non-organ confined disease (stage pT3 / pT4) surgeon skill is again a factor. Despite extra-prostatic extension in many patients a great surgeon can still achieve negative margins 70-%-75% of the time by recognizing the EPE removing enough tissue to get all the cancer within the specimen removed and leave none behind in the prostate bed. I would be highly skeptical of any surgeon who denys this. If his PSM rates (if he will even give them to you) are significantly worse than world class, would he just try to claim that the world class surgeons who have consistently achieved <2% rates for pT2 patients have just gotten lucky for their thousands of cases? I'd tell him I'd take my chances with one of those \"incredibly lucky\" surgeons.",

      "Content": "Congrats on expecting the new baby Omegaman! Your post-op pathology is a bit of a mixed bag. Of course you'd rather not see EPE, but it looks like the surgeon was able to get that all out. The fact that 42 nodes were taken out and were all clear should give you a lot of comfort. The positive margins at the apex are undesirable, but this the most common location for PSM and they often turn out to be inconsequential especially small focal margins like yours. In fact, according to Epstein, depending on the way the specimen is processed (shave margin vs perpendicular margin) the apex is sometimes prone to false positive margins. If I were you I would want to know the specific Gleason score at the location of the PSM. If it is GS3+3, that is less of a concern for several reasons and might make me lean towards a wait-and-see approach instead of pursuing adjuvant radiation since a recent paper (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23706588) seems to suggest that local recurrences arising from GS3+3 tumors have 100% response rate to salvage radiation if PSA ever does start to rise, which may never happen.

I.e. \"what are your personal PSM rates for pathological stages pT2 and pT3 respectively?\" PSM rates refer to how often the surgeon takes out the prostate but somehow still fails to remove all the cancer. Ideally these rates should be no more than about 2% and 30% for pT2 and pT3 respectively, but you will find that they are often significantly higher even among otherwise good and highly experienced surgeons. You should also ask for his personal rates of return to continence (as well as how he defines continence -- no pads, one \"security\" pad, etc.) and return of sexual function.

      "Content": "Sorry about your diagnosis but welcome, Alpine . The first thing that should be clarified, in case it has not been made clear to you already, is that your stage T3 (clinical stage cT3, to be precise) indicates that your doctor believes the cancer is no longer contained only in the prostate but has already escaped to surrounding structures. This is called extraprostatic extension (EPE). If you had an MRI it likely was seen there but sometimes is determined from biopsy and/or DRE as well. The following link may help you understand your staging (you should look at the left hand column i.e. clinical stages). https://cancerstaging.org/references...stateSmall.pdf Nevertheless, the fact that there has been is no finding of distant metastasis on the bone scan is good news, so there is a still a chance of cure at this point. An important next step is to get a 2nd opinion on your biopsy from an expert (e.g. Johns Hopkins or Bostwick Labs). It is also important to know if your Gleason score is is 3+4 (primarily pattern 3) or 4+3 (primarily pattern 4), but either way you have a number of high risk features and definitely need treatment. Although you will not want to wait too long given your high risk factors, you should still be careful to expore all available options (some of which may require travel) to find the treatment that gives you the absolute best chance for cure. Besides just the choice of the treatment modality itself, with some options -- specifically surgery and Brachytherapy -- the chance of cure is also highly dependent on the skill and experience of the practitioner. The dependence of the experience of the practitioner is less of an issue with external beam radiation. While it is understandable that you may \"want this out\" (I am a surgery guy and that's how I felt), in your case surgery may really not be the best option as the chance of positive surgical margin (some cancer being left behind) is significant (about 30% or more even with the top surgeons in the world) and even with negative margin adjuvant radiation would probably still be recommended. The incidence and severity of side effects is much higher when radiation an surgery are combined then when either is done alone. If I were you I think I'd want to go get opinions from experts at some national centers of excellence for both high dose rate (HDR) Brachytherapy and low dose rate (LDR) Brachytherapy (i.e. seeds). Both of these allow higher and more uniform dosing within the prostate than external beam ration alone and in a high risk case like yours would likely be combined with external beam to provide treatment to the structures surrounding the prostate and possibly lymph nodes. If you have not done so already I would strongly recommend picking up Dr. Walsh's Guide to Surviving Prostate Cancer which explains many of these concepts and the various treatment options. Also, the Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center has a nomogram that is very helpful for predicting the probability of various pathology findings if you were to have surgery (even if that is not a modality you would actually choose): http://www.mskcc.org/nomograms/prostate/pre-op Finally, in your case it may be a good idea to begin hormone therapy ASAP to stop the progression while you are considering your options and awaiting treatment. In the case of radiation for high risk cases, neo-adjuvant hormone therapy is often indicated anyways to improve the effectiveness of the radiation by sensitizing the PC cells to radiation.",

      "Content": "My understanding is that PSMs occur frequently at the Apex because the prostate capsule ends in this area and there is no clear division between the gland and the striated sphincter (pelvic floor) muscle. Also according to Dr. Epstein the surgical pathology protocol employed (e.g. shave margin vs perpendicular margin) at the apex can result in false positive margins (artifact as you call it). As Dr. Walsh explains in his book there can be other reasons for false positive surgical margins (e.g. close margins were there were just a thin layer of benign cells over the tumor that get rubbed off from handling between excision and pathology). Capsular incision means that the surgeon inadvertently nicked into the prostate and if tumor was present in the area of the nick this can cause a positive margin even though the tumor was organ-confined (pT2). The term doctors use for this is iatrogenic cause. This happens occasionally to all surgeons but there is significant variation in frequency from the average to good to world class surgeons. The following papers provide more insights on nature and implications of PSMs: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17698141 http://www.archivesofpathology.org/d...65-133.10.1568 http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/arti...011-673021.pdf",

Crossover innervation of the one nerve is favored over compensation and hints that techniques that increase nerve volume at the expense of positive surgical margins may need careful introspection\" So the good news is that even if the nerves can only be spared on one side, over the long term potency rates still approach those for two-sided nerve sparing due to \"crossover innervation\", so it may not be worth the extra risk of a positive margin to attempt nerve sparing in an \"iffy\" case.",

Some (e.g. SBRT, HIFU, focal laser ablation) are potentially curative and others (e.g. hormone therapy, immune therapy) may at least provide anything from brief to indefinite durable remission.

      "Content": "The decisions of if and to what degree to spare the nerves should usually be made \"in-flight\" based on look and feel i.e. actual touch with the surgeons finger in the case of open RRP or by observing how the issue responds when poked and tugged with the robot. Any \"stickiness\" when teasing the nerves away from the prostate can be a sign of cancer having invaded the nerves. However, in the case of high risk features such as aggressive pathology, high-volume or finding of extraprostatic extension on biopsy or MRI, surgeons may sometimes decide up-front not to even attempt on one or both sides for fear of a positive margin. But it is not an all or nothing decision... There are also various \"grades\" of nerve sparing possible having to do with how close to the prostate the surgeon attempts to get when pealing off the neurovascular bundles. Lower risk disease allows the surgeon to get closer to the prostate and save more nerve while still keeping the chances of a positive surgical margin low. Here are two excellent papers on the topic to read and discuss with your surgeon: Correa JJ, Pow-Sang JM. Optimizing cancer control and functional outcomes following robotic prostatectomy. Cancer Control. 2010 Oct;17(4):233-44.: http://moffitt.org/File%20Library/Ma.../v17n4/233.pdf Tewari et al. Anatomical grades of nerve sparing: a risk-stratified approach to neural-hammock sparing during robot-assisted radical prostatectomy (RARP). BJU Int. 2011;108:984-992: http://www.centerforprostatecancer.o...20Tewari-1.pdf It does appear that your stats (primarily % cancer in the right cores) would support your surgeon's recommendation to not attempt nerve sparing on that side per many of the guidelines in the papers above. However a few questions I would have if I were you: Was my biopsy reading accurate in terns Gleason grades, percentages and PNI? (its hard for me to see how the primary grade of your overall Gleason score is a 4 based on the stats you listed for each core) What percent of the 95% 3+4 core was actually grade 4? Is there any evidence of EPE from biopsy or MRI? If you have not gotten an expert reading of your biopsy and had an MRI, you should discuss both with your doctor given the possible impact on the nerve sparing decision on one hand and risk of positive margins on the other.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by JMorris271 I do understand the need that a surgeon have the operation experiance but I don't know how to find the right surgeons to ask in the first place. I can't afford to go door to door and inquire about the number of procedures they have performed. I am reading Dr. Walsh's book which I find very good so far and am trying to become as informed as possible about PC and be able to ask the right questions and understand the answers in return. Even if I were to go to Duke or JH,, how do I know whom to start asking My problem is not about PC knowledge but rather how to find the right professional to help me. You would probably be in excellent hands with any of the experienced prostatectomy surgeons at Hopkins including Partin, Carter, Han, Schaeffer, Pavlovich and Bivalacqua. You can find their bios and contact info here: http://urology.jhu.edu/about/faculty.php But, as far as my own specific experience, I set up a consult with Dr Allaf, head of robotic surgery, who had personally responded to my initial email within a few hours. I was very impressed with him, his experience and outcome statistics. And when I asked him during the consult about the trade-offs of robotic vs. traditional open RRP he was very unbiased and went out of his way to arrange an impromptu consult with Dr. Burnett who was very gracious and also extremely impressive (3000+ surgeries under his belt with world class outcome statistics). I ultimately opted for open surgery with Dr. Burnett and I feel very fortunate because he ended up encountering some unexpected difficulties due to prior mesh hernia repair that doubled the time of my operation and that he later told me would probably have caused most surgeons (including some of his colleagues at Hopkins) to abort the procedure, but he stuck with me and I got an excellent outcome. He has been terrific ever since as well (much easier to contact and more responsive any any of my local doctors). Aside from the docs at Hopkins, Ash Tewari at Mount Sinai in NY City is a pioneering innovator who has published unrivaled outcome statistics and I have corresponded with a couple of guys who selected him and said that beyond his surgical prowess he really exceeded their expectations with his graciousness as well.",

Given I am an active and fit middle aged man with a very active sex life I am trying to appreciate just how much of a lifestyle change this will mean. Hi and welcome Bob, Depending on your detailed stats, you probably have multiple good options you should explore. Take your time (you can't / shouldn't have surgery for at least 6-8 weeks after biopsy) to talk to multiple doctors and consider all the treatment options (including both robotic and open surgery, external beam radiation, and LDR and HDR brachytherapy) . If you are inclined towards surgery, seek out the best surgeons, which may mean traveling. As Patrick Walsh, the father of nerve-sparing prostatectomy, wrote in his book, \"Radical Prostatectomy is a tricky operation, one of the most difficult in medicine\". To improve your chance of a good outcome you will want to find a surgeon who is both highly-experienced (1000+ surgeries) and highly-talented as evidenced by their personal outcome statistics -- first and foremost positive surgical margin (PSM) rates, which are the likelihood of them failing to get all the cancer out. PSM rates for patients with cancer that has not spread beyond the prostate in the hands of a good surgeon are 6%-8% but for the same patients in the hands of the very best surgeons they are below 2%. While the potential side effects of surgery are scary, assuming you are a candidate for nerve sparing, at your young age and in the hands of a skilled surgeon your long-term prospects are excellent! I am 40 and had open surgery by a \"virtuoso\" less than 10 weeks ago. I am now down to one pad per day, which sometimes stays dry; erections began to return at 6 weeks with Cialis and, as of this week, are good enough for sex.

Hi and welcome Bob, Depending on your detailed stats, you probably have multiple good options you should explore.

To improve your chance of a good outcome you will want to find a surgeon who is both highly-experienced (1000+ surgeries) and highly-talented as evidenced by their personal outcome statistics -- first and foremost positive surgical margin (PSM) rates, which are the likelihood of them failing to get all the cancer out. PSM rates for patients with cancer that has not spread beyond the prostate in the hands of a good surgeon are 6%-8% but for the same patients in the hands of the very best surgeons they are below 2%. While the potential side effects of surgery are scary, assuming you are a candidate for nerve sparing, at your young age and in the hands of a skilled surgeon your long-term prospects are excellent! I am 40 and had open surgery by a \"virtuoso\" less than 10 weeks ago.

      "Content": "Greetings Omegaman. Sorry you have to join our club. Based on your stats, your PC would be categorized as intermediate risk and it definitely needs to be treated. Still, you should take your time and consider all your options: robotic surgery, open surgery, LDR brachy (seeds), HDR brachy, external beam radiation (e.g. SBRT, IMRT). All have advantages and disadvantages. And you should talk to multiple doctors, including a medical oncologist who specializes in PC. A second opinion on your biopsy from an expert like Epstein or Bostwick would also be highly recommended ASAP. With surgery and brachy it is particularly critical that you seek out a practitioner who is BOTH highly experienced AND highly skilled as evidenced by their personal statistics (e.g. positive surgical margin rates for surgeons). This may mean traveling, but you only have one shot to get it right! Regarding the MRI being suspicions for capsular involvement this is particularly concerning. Although it is not factored in to the D'Amico risk stratification and the reliability of MRI for prostate cancer remains somewhat controversial, there is pretty good evidence that when an MRI shows extra capsular extension (ECE) that it is usually correct. While surgery can still be a effective in the setting of ECE, this may be a reason to consider brachytherapy (potentially in combination with external beam radiation) as your primary therapy instead of surgery. While if surgery fails you would still have radiation as salvage therapy, the side effect profile for salvage radiation is considerably worse than when you have it as primary. If you are inclined towards surgery, you should strongly consider open surgery, which some feel is better in cases of palpable (cT2) disease like yours and mine. See the following brief video by a world class doctor at Johns Hopkins who does both open and robotic procedures: Open or Robotic Prostate Cancer Surgery -- Which is Right for You? Regarding partial nerve sparing, with your risk factors the surgeon you talked with is on the right track with this, although, as explained below, \"approx 80-90%\" sounds like it may not be nearly conservative enough. Nerve sparing is done primarily by \"look and feel\". In open surgery they can palpate directly on the gland to feel for tumor near the edge. With robotic they can poke and tug the tissue and watch to see if it looks stiff or soft. In both open and robotic they observe how easily the NVB releases from the prostate (it should fall away easily with any \"stickiness\" being a red flag). But because this look and feel is not infallible for detecting all ECE, there have also been guidelines developed based on pre-op risk criteria to pre-plan how much nerve sparing is safe to attempt. E.g.: www.moffittcancercenter.com/CCJRoot/v17n4/pdf/233.pdf onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1464-410X.2011.10565.x/pdf It seems that your stats put you at high risk for nerve sparing by most of these guidelines and suggest that only minimal or no nerve sparing should be attempted on the right side. Because I had palpable tumor with perineural invasion I was very concerned about the possibility of ECE. This is one of the reasons I selected open surgery and because of the cT2, my surgeon decided before hand to only attempt partial (extra-fascial) nerve sparing (which he was able to do successfully) on the right side. I also elected to have an MRI with the mindset that if it was negative for ECE I would take that with a grain of salt but if it was suspicious for ECE I would probably want to skip any attempt at nerve sparing on the right side knowing that thanks to crossover innervation in the longer term potency for unilateral nerve sparing approaches that for bilateral (see Ahlering J Endourol. 2008) and that, in any event, ED is virtually always treatable through one modality or another. Here is a link to my detailed post on my decision process, which may be of interest to you: http://www.cancerforums.net/threads/...015#post191015 Finally, I would strongly recommend picking up a copy of Patrick Walsh's Guide to Surviving Prostate Cancer.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by JMorris271 I do understand the need that a surgeon have the operation experiance but I don't know how to find the right surgeons to ask in the first place. I can't afford to go door to door and inquire about the number of procedures they have performed. I am reading Dr. Walsh's book which I find very good so far and am trying to become as informed as possible about PC and be able to ask the right questions and understand the answers in return. Even if I were to go to Duke or JH,, how do I know whom to start asking My problem is not about PC knowledge but rather how to find the right professional to help me. You would probably be in excellent hands with any of the experienced prostatectomy surgeons at Hopkins including Partin, Carter, Han, Schaeffer, Pavlovich and Bivalacqua. You can find their bios and contact info here: http://urology.jhu.edu/about/faculty.php But, as far as my own specific experience, I set up a consult with Dr Allaf, head of robotic surgery, who had personally responded to my initial email within a few hours. I was very impressed with him, his experience and outcome statistics. And when I asked him during the consult about the trade-offs of robotic vs. traditional open RRP he was very unbiased and went out of his way to arrange an impromptu consult with Dr. Burnett who was very gracious and also extremely impressive (3000+ surgeries under his belt with world class outcome statistics). I ultimately opted for open surgery with Dr. Burnett and I feel very fortunate because he ended up encountering some unexpected difficulties due to prior mesh hernia repair that doubled the time of my operation and that he later told me would probably have caused most surgeons (including some of his colleagues at Hopkins) to abort the procedure, but he stuck with me and I got an excellent outcome. He has been terrific ever since as well (much easier to contact and more responsive any any of my local doctors). Aside from the docs at Hopkins, Ash Tewari at Mount Sinai in NY City is a pioneering innovator who has published unrivaled outcome statistics and I have corresponded with a couple of guys who selected him and said that beyond his surgical prowess he really exceeded their expectations with his graciousness as well.",

This is one of the reasons I selected open surgery and because of the cT2, my surgeon decided before hand to only attempt partial (extra-fascial) nerve sparing (which he was able to do successfully) on the right side. I also elected to have an MRI with the mindset that if it was negative for ECE I would take that with a grain of salt but if it was suspicious for ECE I would probably want to skip any attempt at nerve sparing on the right side knowing that thanks to crossover innervation in the longer term potency for unilateral nerve sparing approaches that for bilateral (see Ahlering J Endourol. 2008) and that, in any event, ED is virtually always treatable through one modality or another. Here is a link to my detailed post on my decision process, which may be of interest to you: http://www.cancerforums.net/threads/...015#post191015 Finally, I would strongly recommend picking up a copy of Patrick Walsh's Guide to Surviving Prostate Cancer.",

      "Content": "Part 4/4: Other surgeons I considered: Thomas Ahlering, UC Irvine: Dr. Ahlering is a heavily-published pioneer of RALP who has introduced several refinements of surgical approach and other innovations (e.g. transrectal cooling device to reduce operative trauma to nerves and urethral sphincter). He specializes exclusively in prostatectomy vs. other urologic surgeries and, as I understand it, limits his volume to one or two surgeries per day explicitly to avoid rushing / cutting corners but still has around 1300 under his belt. I really liked that he seems to be heavily focused on optimizing oncologic outcomes and had published PSM rates of 3.1% and 18% for pT2 and pT3 respectively for his 251st through 750th patients. Although he appeared to be one of the 2-3 most impressive RALP surgeons in the world, I pushed him down on my list because Irvine would have been a pretty long haul with no direct flights (not great for returning home post-op). Apparently he would have done a telephone consult, which would have been convenient, but I never needed to pursue. Ash Tewari, Cornell: Dr. Tewari is another heavily-published RALP pioneer known for driving improvements in surgical approach. He recently published PSM rates of 2.1% and 33% for pT2 and pT3 respectively for 209 patients using his latest surgical innovation (\u201cretro-apical technique\u201d). Although he also appeared to be one of the 2-3 most impressive RALP surgeons in the world, I pushed him down on my list because I was not too comfortable with the idea of leaving my wife to fend for herself in NYC while I was in the hospital. I never needed to pursue a consultation. Peter Scardino and James Eastham, Memorial Sloan-Kettering: I initially considered both doctors due to their excellent reputations and extensive experience with open RRP. However I was not too enthusiastic about having my surgery in New York and I found their published PSM rates on a series of 692 patients (5.3% and 24% for pT2 and pT3 respectively) to be significantly higher than those of other doctors on my list. Mani Menon, Vattikuti Institute; Vipul Patel, Global Robotics Institute Florida: I initially considered both doctors due to their extensive experience with RALP. Also Vattikuti was appealing because it would have been a very short trip for me. On the other hand I was not really comfortable with the high daily surgical volume (especially in the case of Patel, who I understand may do a half dozen or more). Ultimately I ruled out both because when I researched their surgical margin rates (i.e. anywhere from 4%- 10% for pT2 depending on which published series) I concluded they may not be any better than I could get at home. Robert Nadler, Northwestern: I included Dr. Nadler in my list because in 2010 he published PSM rates of 2.5% and 28% for pT2 and pT3 respectively for 95 patients using a modified RALP technique (i.e. staple ligation of dorsal venous complex). While these numbers are quite good, they are from a relatively small series. Also, a cursory search revealed a significant number of less-than-stellar patient reviews that made me extremely wary. I never pursued a consultation.",

      "Content": "Sorry to hear that the disease is present throughout much of the prostate, JD. Nevertheless, your stats only put you in the \"intermediate risk\" category. Your two PSAs actually straddle the breakpoint of the Partin tables so the likelihood of your lymph nodes being clean is somewhere between 91-96% assuming your clinical stage was cT2b or cT2c. If you opt for surgery, in the hands of a top surgeon your chance of negative margins is probably at least 80% or better (>90% for pT2 and >70% for pT3+ with about 50/50 chance of either). Talking to your friends is fine for a start, but I cannot stress enough the importance of finding a highly experienced surgeon with a proven track record of very low surgical margin rates. You only have one shot at this. You can certainly also explore other options (seeds, HDR, SBRT, etc.) that could also offer an excellent chance of cure with different side effect profiles compared to surgery. Good luck!",

      "Content": "Part 3/4: Surgeons with whom I consulted: Mohamad Allaf, John Hopkins: Being initially inclined towards RALP and being particularly impressed with his CV and long list of glowing patient testimonials I decided to contact Dr. Allaf who is Director of Robotic Surgery . I was pretty surprised to see that he and so many other physicians there, who are literally among the top handful in the world, would post their e-mail addresses on their Web pages, but I was even more surprised I when I received prompt personal and warm reply from Dr. Allaf promising to accommodate me when I would be in town. When we finally met a couple weeks later, Dr. Allaf exceeded my already high expectations. Not only was he very reassuring and informative giving an honest and unbiased perspective on RALP vs. open RRP but he also volunteered to arrange for me to meet with his colleague Arthur Burnett to discuss RRP while I was there. Regarding RALP he told me that while they have not published surgical margin rates for RALP (except for a cohort of high-risk patients), his rates were similar to those for open RRP at Hopkins (i.e. 2% or less for pT2) and the one real advantage over RRP for someone like me would really just be less blood loss. Although I ultimately decided on RRP, it was a fairly close call and had I chosen RALP I would have definitely wanted to go with Dr. Allaf. I would highly recommend him to anyone considering RALP. Arthur (Bud) Burnett, John Hopkins: Dr. Burnett\u2019s credentials are truly impressive. He is a leading researcher in neuro-urology responsible for the biochemistry behind Viagra and new drug and device therapies to speed nerve recovery after prostatectomy. As a surgeon Dr. Burnett has done over 2500 open prostatectomies achieving PSM rates below 2% for pT2 disease. He explained that due to my cT2a lesion he would dissect the nerves off the prostate capsule on the left side but would go wider (extra-fascial) on the right. He also said that in his opinion open surgery facilitates a better job of lymph node dissection, which he emphasized was potentially therapeutic in the event of higher grade disease on final pathology. He told me that for him the operation is \u201clike making a favorite pot of spaghetti\u201d and that he typically completes it in just around 1 hour minimizing blood loss. He also reassured me that he would be able to deal with the bilateral mesh hernia repair I had done just over a year ago. While all of this inspired extreme confidence, what really blew me away was, just like Dr. Allaf, how extremely humble, warm and accommodating Dr. Burnett was. At the end of our conversation he actually handed me his business card and told not to hesitate to contact him should I have further questions. I did email him on several occasions and each time he was extremely responsive and genial. I ultimately selected Dr. Burnett and got a great outcome despite some unexpected complications that many other surgeons many not have been able to deal with. The care he has continued to provide post-op has been just as great \u2013 he told me \u201cI\u2019m always here to serve you for as long as we are both around\u201d. I would whole-heartedly recommend him to anyone. I doubt you could find a more skilled, dedicated and compassionate doctor for RRP. Arieh Shalhav, University of Chicago: Arieh Shalhav is Chief of Urology at University of Chicago. In 2006 he and his predecessor as Chief, Charles Brendler, had published PSM rates of 1.7% and 25% for pT2 and pT3 respectively for a series of 996 patients having open RRP performed by Brendler between 1994 and 2004 and even more remarkable rates of only 1% and 10% for pT2 and pT3 disease toward the end of that series reflecting a number of refinements in surgical technique. I knew that Brendler was now retired, but was very interested in whether others there were carrying on his work with similar results. While I was disappointed to learn that the entire faculty had abandoned Brendler\u2019s technique in favor of RALP, my discussion with Dr. Shalhav (who, despite a scheduling snafu, scrubbed out of surgery to talk to me for nearly an hour) was well worth it. Dr. Shalhav has done over 1000 RALP procedures and described some of the key nuances in detail. He provided some very helpful insights on nerve sparing and the trade-off between preserving nerves and avoiding positive margins admitting that there are often close calls that present a \u201cvery lonely moment for the surgeon\u201d and that for this reason a patient should be explicit about his personal values / level of risk aversion regarding curing disease vs. preserving potency. He was adamant that, despite having biopsy GS of 3+3, I should still have lymph node dissection because he had been \u201cburned too many times\u201d by apparently low risk patients whose final pathology turns out significantly worse and because lymphocele is unlikely and, while \u201cannoying\u201d, easily managed. Dr. Shalhav is also huge proponent of lifestyle and other changes (e.g. diet, exercise, daily aspirin) to reduce PCa reoccurrence as well as to avoid cardiovascular morbidity and mortality so as to actually realize the benefits of PCa cure. With the understandably myopic focus most newly-diagnosed men have on short-term action plans, I think it\u2019s great that he emphasizes these important long-term, big-picture issues. I really liked Dr. Shalhav and would recommend him to anyone considering RALP. William Catalona, Northwestern: Dr. Catalona is somewhat of a living legend having pioneered PSA testing and having performed over 6500 prostatectomies. At 70 years old he is still doing 2 surgeries per day and is proud of taking on high risk cases turned away by other leading surgeons. He\u2019s definitely an old-school doctor. Of the six surgeons I met, he is only one to personally give me a very through physical (stethoscope and all). After my physical he ushered me to his office to walk me through my biopsy report and his own impressions and spent over an hour talking with me patiently answering questions and even drawing diagrams to explain his points. Like the Hopkins doctors and Dr. Shalhav, Dr. Catalona also advocates lymph node dissection as potentially curative. But he is extremely opinionated regarding the superiority of RRP over RALP and basically argues that the latter is a threat to public health having significantly increased risks with absolutely no advantages vs. RRP. While I thought he made some valid points regarding RALP (some of which affirmed my own preference for open surgery) I felt he was overly dogmatic in this area potentially to the detriment of some patients for whom RALP \u2013 so long as it is performed by a top surgeon \u2013 may be an excellent choice. Dr. Catalona is also very big on imaging (e.g. CT scans and chest x-rays) that did not seem necessary to me as a low-risk and otherwise healthy patient. I felt his biggest quirk was that, while he claimed that his surgical margin rates were as good as anyone I would find, he would not give me any hard numbers. Apparently he believes the rates claimed by many others are misleading / unrealistic due to variations in surgical technique, pathological protocol, etc. While I recognize this could be true, at the end of the day I was just not comfortable selecting a surgeon who would not give me some hard numbers. Nevertheless, on balance I found this consultation extremely informative and would encourage anyone interested in RRP in the Midwest to consider Dr. Catalona.",

      "Content": "Part 2/4: I had my surgery on Tues, May 28 under spinal anesthesia. As it turned out Dr. Burnett encountered unexpectedly severe difficulties from my prior mesh hernia repair that he said might have caused most surgeons to abort the operation. He said many of the normal tissue planes were unrecognizable / stuck together like glue and he had to rely more on his experience and memory of the anatomy than what he could actually see to navigate through it. This caused the operation to take him longer than usual so I had some additional intraoperative blood loss and also had a lot of bloody drainage postoperatively apparently due to the additional tissue trauma. But Burnett was optimistic afterwards that he had been successful having done complete nerve sparing on the left and partial on the right as originally planned and removing 11 normal looking lymph nodes. While I did not need a transfusion during the surgery, by the next morning my blood count had dropped to the point where I did. Other than that however, I felt very good (probably thanks in part to the regional anesthesia) and I did a lot of walking. I may have actually overdone the walking because the second night I had a lot more bloody drainage and by the next morning I needed another transfusion. Due to the complications, I ended up staying three nights instead of the typical one or two but it really was not too bad as everyone (doctors, nurses, nurses aids, nutrition staff) at Hopkins were excellent. Also one advantage of the extended stay was that I was able to receive in-person my final pathology report, which was perfect (GS 3+3, organ-confined tumor, negative margins)! Our trip home was needlessly long and tiring. I had changed our original tickets to 5:00 PM, which was the latest direct flight on AirTran to Milwaukee, but with waiting to be discharged, fighting rush hour traffic to DCA and returning the rental car we did not get to the ticket counter until 4:40. They gave us our boarding passes and got me a wheelchair so we could mostly bypass the long Friday eve lines out of Washington and I would have assumed they would have called ahead to the tell the gate we were coming, but when we got to the gate at 4:52 they turned us away citing their policy to close the doors at 10 minutes to departure! Ordinarily this would just have been an annoying hassle, but in this case having to travel with a catheter and a couple surgical drain tubes still in, being anemic, exhausted and at risk for blood clots I was pretty concerned. I was in a wheel chair, still had the patient bracelet on my wrist and a fresh dressing on my hand from the IV that was just pulled out but they just scoffed at me and refused to let me board even though the plane was sitting right there. In fact, the \"customer service\" guy at the counter got indigent with me for giving him a hard time when he was \"just trying to do his job\". I really didn't have the energy to put up much of an argument (and it probably wouldn't have mattered) so we ended up having to come home through Atlanta with a couple hour lay-over and didn't drag ourselves in the door at home until midnight Friday. Since getting home I\u0092ve been doing great. The first weekend I took the mild narcotics that were prescribed and took it pretty easy but Saturday morning I did manage to get out of the house to watch my son play soccer. Although my wife had FMLA approved for five weeks, she went back to work one week post-op. The first day she was gone, much to her chagrin, I got on my tractor (catheter and all) and cut the lawn. My catheter and surgical drains were removed on June 7 (10 days). The next day I was back in the coach\u0092s box for two soccer games. Continence is of course a gradual process but I\u0092m dry at night and mostly while sitting. Burnett called me last night and said he expects this to improve dramatically over the next 2-3 weeks. I have been working from home but will probably go into the office next week. I have a follow up with my local urologist in about four weeks for post-op PSA and to discuss rehab. Dr. Burnett put me on Irbesartan (Avapro) to speed nerve recovery and given my age and prior good function I\u0092m hoping Cialis (at most) may be sufficient but I'll cross that bridge when I come to it!",

      "Content": "Thanks for the welcome and well-wishes. I agree it may not be necessary to go with a \"big name\" surgeon per-se. In fact, it is important to note that I found some really mediocre surgical margin rates published by some \"big name\" docs / institutions that I didn't even mention in my original post - so you can't rely on \"big name\" in and of itself. First of all, I think you want someone with lots of experience (at least several hundred, especially for RALP) and who still does it regularly (1+ per week). Then I'd ask them to quantify their outcomes - in particular positive margin rates. You want to know their separate rates for pT2 patients and pT3 patients. Don't settle for an \"overall\" margin rate, as this is meaningless without knowing their patient mix. Ideally you also want to know their patient mix in terms of p-stage and/or c-stage (i.e. are they operating on many higher-risk patients?). Many doctors (e.g. Patel, Menon) seem to be operating on 80-90% pT2 patients. There may well be many lesser-known surgeons out there with great outcome metrics, the problem is you won't know who they are until you get a consult with them and ask these questions. For this reason it was easiest for me to just do a literature search for published metrics, but then you get mostly \"big names\". Finally while, to Dr. Catalonia's point, PSM rates may be somewhat of a flawed metric, still it is virtually only objective metric we really have available (there are also recurrence rates but those are even harder to get due to the lag time). If surgeon \"A\" has 2% PSM rate on a large series of pT2 patients and surgeon \"B\" at another institution with different surgical technique and pathology protocol has 7% PSM rate on a large series of pT2 patients, then, all other things equal, I'd be more conformable with surgeon \"A\" knowing that the advantage could be overstated but is still more likely to be in his favor than surgeon \"B\".",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by Fairwind Surgeons who limit (or try to limit) there practices to G6 and low-risk G7 patients while turning away G8, 9 & 10 patients are certain to have fewer Positive Surgical Margins than surgeons who are willing to take a shot at curing those in the high-risk group....So by cherry-picking the customer base they can make themselves look very good indeed.. Fairwind, I don't know whether your final pathology was organ-confined (pT2), but what you say about a surgeon who treats more higher-GS cases having a higher PSM rate is definitely true for overall PSM rate because a higher proportion of his patients will turn out to be non-organ confined (pT3 / pT4) and therefore much more prone to positive margins. In principle the PSM rate for pT2 (not to be confused with cT2 - clinical organ confined) should be less sensitive to this effect because when a PSM occurs with pT2 it involves some sort of iatrogenic cause (e.g. nicking the prostate capsule, or not getting all the prostate dissected away from the striated sphincter at the apex), which is why this should be a better metric. Still, I know this is not entirely true. The folks at Hopkins recently published PSM rate of 5.7% for 247 high risk pT2 patients undergoing RRP, which is 4x higher than their 1.3% PSM rate for all 10446 patients undergoing RRP between 1993 and 2006. At least one explanation I can imagine, is that high risk patients are more likely to have higher percentage of cancer in the prostate so any iatrogenic nick is more likely to hit tumor than benign prostate cells.",

      "Content": "I've been lurking here for last couple months and have found the information very helpful. Now that I have a successful surgery behind me, I thought I'd de-cloak and share my experience / some of what I\u2019ve learned. This will be somewhat of a lengthy post but I hope that it will be helpful to others. I\u2019ll start at the beginning as I\u2019d like to raise awareness of the way that I, thankfully, did come to be diagnosed but also quite easily could not have been... I turned 40 in November and went in for a physical expecting DRE and PSA tests. My father was diagnosed with aggressive (GS 9) PCa in his mid-80s and a colleague of mine was diagnosed at 40, so this was really on my radar. I was surprised when my internist recommended against screening citing the latest USPSTF and ACP recommendations. After doing some research, I eventually decided to go in for a free screening at the Medical College Urology clinic. I figured I was simply taking the high side of caution and fully expected everything to be normal but at least obtain a baseline PSA for future comparison. I was a little surprised when the nurse detected a \u201csubtle nodule\u201d on DRE but she did not seem too concerned, telling me she would pass it on to my internist but \u201cthat may just be the way your prostate is\u201d. So when I eventually received the PSA result of 1.23 (which for my age is higher than average but still with the \u201cnormal\u201d range) I figured I was in the clear for the time being and put it out of my mind. Well, I was pretty surprised two months later (early March) to be contacted by my internist asking me to come in to discuss the results. When I went in he repeated the DRE (which I wish he would have just done at my physical in the first place) and remarked that he wouldn\u2019t really describe the nodule as subtle. He told me I could either come back to see him and repeat the PSA in three months and/or go see a urologist. After sensing his level of concern I decided on the latter and by the time the Urology consult came around I already knew from my own research (which told me that abnormal DRE is 30%-50% predictive of PCa) that I wanted a biopsy. I actually ended up seeing a very talented physician\u2019s assistant in Urology who confirmed the DRE finding (he described it as a \u201cregion of induration\u201d affecting the mid right lobe) and that a biopsy was indicated, which he would also perform. The biopsy was a piece of cake. He gave me a local and I didn\u2019t feel any further pain during or afterwards. When the biopsy was done he actually told me, perhaps from what the ultrasound looked like, that he would be surprised if it was positive. However when he called me a couple days later (March 28th) I found out that unfortunately that was the case: 2 positive cores one right-mid (10%) and one right-apex (20%) both GS 3+3 but with PNI in the apex. So then the period of worry and uncertainty really began. I got appointments with a couple of top local urologists but I had to twist in the wind for nearly two weeks before seeing them. Knowing from my PSA and Gleason score that I was a relatively low risk patient certainly made it easier and fortunately there were great resources like this forum and Patrick Walsh\u2019s book available but still the diagnosis and the decision process would be major weight on my shoulders for the next several weeks. At my age and with a wife and young children I felt the stakes were exceptionally high and knowing the one-shot nature of prostatectomy I wanted to do everything possible to absolutely maximize the chance of a good oncologic outcome. When they finally came around, the consults with both of the local surgeons were very informative and reassuring in that they confirmed my good prognosis. Both were doing exclusively RALP. One was fellowship trained at City of Hope and has around 900 RALP procedures under his belt the other had switched from open to robotic several years ago and had done about 400 RALP. However I was not really satisfied by the 6% to 10% positive surgical margin rates they cited for the best case scenario of pathologic organ-confined (pT2) disease. I was also not really comfortable with their proposals (insistence in one case) to omit lymph node dissection based on my low-grade biopsy since I knew that something like 30% of the time the GS is upgraded at final pathology. One thing I really appreciated about the second doctor was his encouragement, without any prompting by me, to consider traveling to a national center of excellence (he threw out Mayo as an example) if that would make me more comfortable. The way he put it was that although I had an excellent chance of a positive outcome in his or any competent surgeon\u2019s hands, in the unlikely event of an imperfect outcome I would not want to second guess whether I should have gone somewhere else. This affirmed what I was already thinking from having read Walsh\u2019s book and the experiences of many people here so I decided to broaden my search for a surgeon. From Walsh\u2019s book and other accounts I\u2019d seen, the Johns Hopkins Brady Urological Institute was at the top of my list and as luck (or perhaps Divine providence) would have it, I already had business travel scheduled to the Baltimore area near the end of April. I also considered a handful of other doctors / institutions (see notes in post parts 3-4 below) based my research (primarily published surgical margin rates). Ultimately I decided to have open RRP done by Arthur (Bud) Burnett at Hopkins. My key deciding factors for RRP over RALP were as follows... Although on the surface RALP appeared attractive, the closer I looked its actual benefits over RRP for me being young, healthy and not overweight seemed pretty minimal: Less blood loss (due to the pressurization of abdomen) Possibly it might have made it easier to work around my prior hernia repairOn the other hand, I felt there were several significant disadvantages to RALP vs. RRP: Lack of tactile feedback. While most RALP surgeons will say they can compensate by using the 30x magnified 3D vision to watch how the tissues respond as they tug and poke them, at least one doctor who does both (Schaeffer at Hopkins) recommends open surgery for palpable tumors like I had. RALP requires general anesthesia, which brings its own risks and complications (at a minimum longer perioperative recovery time). I really preferred regional. RALP is arguably more invasive than RRP due to five separate incisions (one of which needs to be significantly enlarged to remove the specimen) and violation of the peritoneal space. Potential for robotic failure or malfunction. Although I\u2019m told the rate is only like 0.5% and all of the institutions I considered would probably have a spare available, from my own background in medical device safety I\u2019ve seen enough device-related adverse events to be wary of unnecessarily introducing complex technology into the loop without a sufficiently compelling benefit. I also decided to have an endorectal MRI as was recommended by the second local urologist to plan nerve sparing even though the first said it had no value. I figured it would be another data point that I would take with a grain of salt if it looked good (I still wanted, at most, partial nerve sparing on the right given my palpable lesion and PNI) but take seriously if it suggested possible extra capsular extension in which case I may want to pre-decide on unilateral nerve sparing vs. leaving it to an inflight decision. I\u2019ve had other MRIs before but never one with this particular coil which the radiologist positioned himself after performing a DRE. That was the worst part and it really was not that bad. The study took about an hour with contrast agent administered at the end. I got the results a couple days later and, although I tried to take them with a grain of salt, I was very pleased. A lesion was imaged in the right mid and apex but not the most inferior apex at the urethral sphincter (which is very prone to positive margins). The lesion did not the typical diffusion-weighted features of aggressive high grade PCa. No evidence of ECE, neurovascular bundle involvement, seminal vesicle involvement or lymphadenopathy.",

      "Content": "Part 3/4: Surgeons with whom I consulted: Mohamad Allaf, John Hopkins: Being initially inclined towards RALP and being particularly impressed with his CV and long list of glowing patient testimonials I decided to contact Dr. Allaf who is Director of Robotic Surgery . I was pretty surprised to see that he and so many other physicians there, who are literally among the top handful in the world, would post their e-mail addresses on their Web pages, but I was even more surprised I when I received prompt personal and warm reply from Dr. Allaf promising to accommodate me when I would be in town. When we finally met a couple weeks later, Dr. Allaf exceeded my already high expectations. Not only was he very reassuring and informative giving an honest and unbiased perspective on RALP vs. open RRP but he also volunteered to arrange for me to meet with his colleague Arthur Burnett to discuss RRP while I was there. Regarding RALP he told me that while they have not published surgical margin rates for RALP (except for a cohort of high-risk patients), his rates were similar to those for open RRP at Hopkins (i.e. 2% or less for pT2) and the one real advantage over RRP for someone like me would really just be less blood loss. Although I ultimately decided on RRP, it was a fairly close call and had I chosen RALP I would have definitely wanted to go with Dr. Allaf. I would highly recommend him to anyone considering RALP. Arthur (Bud) Burnett, John Hopkins: Dr. Burnett\u2019s credentials are truly impressive. He is a leading researcher in neuro-urology responsible for the biochemistry behind Viagra and new drug and device therapies to speed nerve recovery after prostatectomy. As a surgeon Dr. Burnett has done over 2500 open prostatectomies achieving PSM rates below 2% for pT2 disease. He explained that due to my cT2a lesion he would dissect the nerves off the prostate capsule on the left side but would go wider (extra-fascial) on the right. He also said that in his opinion open surgery facilitates a better job of lymph node dissection, which he emphasized was potentially therapeutic in the event of higher grade disease on final pathology. He told me that for him the operation is \u201clike making a favorite pot of spaghetti\u201d and that he typically completes it in just around 1 hour minimizing blood loss. He also reassured me that he would be able to deal with the bilateral mesh hernia repair I had done just over a year ago. While all of this inspired extreme confidence, what really blew me away was, just like Dr. Allaf, how extremely humble, warm and accommodating Dr. Burnett was. At the end of our conversation he actually handed me his business card and told not to hesitate to contact him should I have further questions. I did email him on several occasions and each time he was extremely responsive and genial. I ultimately selected Dr. Burnett and got a great outcome despite some unexpected complications that many other surgeons many not have been able to deal with. The care he has continued to provide post-op has been just as great \u2013 he told me \u201cI\u2019m always here to serve you for as long as we are both around\u201d. I would whole-heartedly recommend him to anyone. I doubt you could find a more skilled, dedicated and compassionate doctor for RRP. Arieh Shalhav, University of Chicago: Arieh Shalhav is Chief of Urology at University of Chicago. In 2006 he and his predecessor as Chief, Charles Brendler, had published PSM rates of 1.7% and 25% for pT2 and pT3 respectively for a series of 996 patients having open RRP performed by Brendler between 1994 and 2004 and even more remarkable rates of only 1% and 10% for pT2 and pT3 disease toward the end of that series reflecting a number of refinements in surgical technique. I knew that Brendler was now retired, but was very interested in whether others there were carrying on his work with similar results. While I was disappointed to learn that the entire faculty had abandoned Brendler\u2019s technique in favor of RALP, my discussion with Dr. Shalhav (who, despite a scheduling snafu, scrubbed out of surgery to talk to me for nearly an hour) was well worth it. Dr. Shalhav has done over 1000 RALP procedures and described some of the key nuances in detail. He provided some very helpful insights on nerve sparing and the trade-off between preserving nerves and avoiding positive margins admitting that there are often close calls that present a \u201cvery lonely moment for the surgeon\u201d and that for this reason a patient should be explicit about his personal values / level of risk aversion regarding curing disease vs. preserving potency. He was adamant that, despite having biopsy GS of 3+3, I should still have lymph node dissection because he had been \u201cburned too many times\u201d by apparently low risk patients whose final pathology turns out significantly worse and because lymphocele is unlikely and, while \u201cannoying\u201d, easily managed. Dr. Shalhav is also huge proponent of lifestyle and other changes (e.g. diet, exercise, daily aspirin) to reduce PCa reoccurrence as well as to avoid cardiovascular morbidity and mortality so as to actually realize the benefits of PCa cure. With the understandably myopic focus most newly-diagnosed men have on short-term action plans, I think it\u2019s great that he emphasizes these important long-term, big-picture issues. I really liked Dr. Shalhav and would recommend him to anyone considering RALP. William Catalona, Northwestern: Dr. Catalona is somewhat of a living legend having pioneered PSA testing and having performed over 6500 prostatectomies. At 70 years old he is still doing 2 surgeries per day and is proud of taking on high risk cases turned away by other leading surgeons. He\u2019s definitely an old-school doctor. Of the six surgeons I met, he is only one to personally give me a very through physical (stethoscope and all). After my physical he ushered me to his office to walk me through my biopsy report and his own impressions and spent over an hour talking with me patiently answering questions and even drawing diagrams to explain his points. Like the Hopkins doctors and Dr. Shalhav, Dr. Catalona also advocates lymph node dissection as potentially curative. But he is extremely opinionated regarding the superiority of RRP over RALP and basically argues that the latter is a threat to public health having significantly increased risks with absolutely no advantages vs. RRP. While I thought he made some valid points regarding RALP (some of which affirmed my own preference for open surgery) I felt he was overly dogmatic in this area potentially to the detriment of some patients for whom RALP \u2013 so long as it is performed by a top surgeon \u2013 may be an excellent choice. Dr. Catalona is also very big on imaging (e.g. CT scans and chest x-rays) that did not seem necessary to me as a low-risk and otherwise healthy patient. I felt his biggest quirk was that, while he claimed that his surgical margin rates were as good as anyone I would find, he would not give me any hard numbers. Apparently he believes the rates claimed by many others are misleading / unrealistic due to variations in surgical technique, pathological protocol, etc. While I recognize this could be true, at the end of the day I was just not comfortable selecting a surgeon who would not give me some hard numbers. Nevertheless, on balance I found this consultation extremely informative and would encourage anyone interested in RRP in the Midwest to consider Dr. Catalona.",

      "Content": "Part 4/4: Other surgeons I considered: Thomas Ahlering, UC Irvine: Dr. Ahlering is a heavily-published pioneer of RALP who has introduced several refinements of surgical approach and other innovations (e.g. transrectal cooling device to reduce operative trauma to nerves and urethral sphincter). He specializes exclusively in prostatectomy vs. other urologic surgeries and, as I understand it, limits his volume to one or two surgeries per day explicitly to avoid rushing / cutting corners but still has around 1300 under his belt. I really liked that he seems to be heavily focused on optimizing oncologic outcomes and had published PSM rates of 3.1% and 18% for pT2 and pT3 respectively for his 251st through 750th patients. Although he appeared to be one of the 2-3 most impressive RALP surgeons in the world, I pushed him down on my list because Irvine would have been a pretty long haul with no direct flights (not great for returning home post-op). Apparently he would have done a telephone consult, which would have been convenient, but I never needed to pursue. Ash Tewari, Cornell: Dr. Tewari is another heavily-published RALP pioneer known for driving improvements in surgical approach. He recently published PSM rates of 2.1% and 33% for pT2 and pT3 respectively for 209 patients using his latest surgical innovation (\u201cretro-apical technique\u201d). Although he also appeared to be one of the 2-3 most impressive RALP surgeons in the world, I pushed him down on my list because I was not too comfortable with the idea of leaving my wife to fend for herself in NYC while I was in the hospital. I never needed to pursue a consultation. Peter Scardino and James Eastham, Memorial Sloan-Kettering: I initially considered both doctors due to their excellent reputations and extensive experience with open RRP. However I was not too enthusiastic about having my surgery in New York and I found their published PSM rates on a series of 692 patients (5.3% and 24% for pT2 and pT3 respectively) to be significantly higher than those of other doctors on my list. Mani Menon, Vattikuti Institute; Vipul Patel, Global Robotics Institute Florida: I initially considered both doctors due to their extensive experience with RALP. Also Vattikuti was appealing because it would have been a very short trip for me. On the other hand I was not really comfortable with the high daily surgical volume (especially in the case of Patel, who I understand may do a half dozen or more). Ultimately I ruled out both because when I researched their surgical margin rates (i.e. anywhere from 4%- 10% for pT2 depending on which published series) I concluded they may not be any better than I could get at home. Robert Nadler, Northwestern: I included Dr. Nadler in my list because in 2010 he published PSM rates of 2.5% and 28% for pT2 and pT3 respectively for 95 patients using a modified RALP technique (i.e. staple ligation of dorsal venous complex). While these numbers are quite good, they are from a relatively small series. Also, a cursory search revealed a significant number of less-than-stellar patient reviews that made me extremely wary. I never pursued a consultation.",

      "Content": "I've been lurking here for last couple months and have found the information very helpful. Now that I have a successful surgery behind me, I thought I'd de-cloak and share my experience / some of what I\u2019ve learned. This will be somewhat of a lengthy post but I hope that it will be helpful to others. I\u2019ll start at the beginning as I\u2019d like to raise awareness of the way that I, thankfully, did come to be diagnosed but also quite easily could not have been... I turned 40 in November and went in for a physical expecting DRE and PSA tests. My father was diagnosed with aggressive (GS 9) PCa in his mid-80s and a colleague of mine was diagnosed at 40, so this was really on my radar. I was surprised when my internist recommended against screening citing the latest USPSTF and ACP recommendations. After doing some research, I eventually decided to go in for a free screening at the Medical College Urology clinic. I figured I was simply taking the high side of caution and fully expected everything to be normal but at least obtain a baseline PSA for future comparison. I was a little surprised when the nurse detected a \u201csubtle nodule\u201d on DRE but she did not seem too concerned, telling me she would pass it on to my internist but \u201cthat may just be the way your prostate is\u201d. So when I eventually received the PSA result of 1.23 (which for my age is higher than average but still with the \u201cnormal\u201d range) I figured I was in the clear for the time being and put it out of my mind. Well, I was pretty surprised two months later (early March) to be contacted by my internist asking me to come in to discuss the results. When I went in he repeated the DRE (which I wish he would have just done at my physical in the first place) and remarked that he wouldn\u2019t really describe the nodule as subtle. He told me I could either come back to see him and repeat the PSA in three months and/or go see a urologist. After sensing his level of concern I decided on the latter and by the time the Urology consult came around I already knew from my own research (which told me that abnormal DRE is 30%-50% predictive of PCa) that I wanted a biopsy. I actually ended up seeing a very talented physician\u2019s assistant in Urology who confirmed the DRE finding (he described it as a \u201cregion of induration\u201d affecting the mid right lobe) and that a biopsy was indicated, which he would also perform. The biopsy was a piece of cake. He gave me a local and I didn\u2019t feel any further pain during or afterwards. When the biopsy was done he actually told me, perhaps from what the ultrasound looked like, that he would be surprised if it was positive. However when he called me a couple days later (March 28th) I found out that unfortunately that was the case: 2 positive cores one right-mid (10%) and one right-apex (20%) both GS 3+3 but with PNI in the apex. So then the period of worry and uncertainty really began. I got appointments with a couple of top local urologists but I had to twist in the wind for nearly two weeks before seeing them. Knowing from my PSA and Gleason score that I was a relatively low risk patient certainly made it easier and fortunately there were great resources like this forum and Patrick Walsh\u2019s book available but still the diagnosis and the decision process would be major weight on my shoulders for the next several weeks. At my age and with a wife and young children I felt the stakes were exceptionally high and knowing the one-shot nature of prostatectomy I wanted to do everything possible to absolutely maximize the chance of a good oncologic outcome. When they finally came around, the consults with both of the local surgeons were very informative and reassuring in that they confirmed my good prognosis. Both were doing exclusively RALP. One was fellowship trained at City of Hope and has around 900 RALP procedures under his belt the other had switched from open to robotic several years ago and had done about 400 RALP. However I was not really satisfied by the 6% to 10% positive surgical margin rates they cited for the best case scenario of pathologic organ-confined (pT2) disease. I was also not really comfortable with their proposals (insistence in one case) to omit lymph node dissection based on my low-grade biopsy since I knew that something like 30% of the time the GS is upgraded at final pathology. One thing I really appreciated about the second doctor was his encouragement, without any prompting by me, to consider traveling to a national center of excellence (he threw out Mayo as an example) if that would make me more comfortable. The way he put it was that although I had an excellent chance of a positive outcome in his or any competent surgeon\u2019s hands, in the unlikely event of an imperfect outcome I would not want to second guess whether I should have gone somewhere else. This affirmed what I was already thinking from having read Walsh\u2019s book and the experiences of many people here so I decided to broaden my search for a surgeon. From Walsh\u2019s book and other accounts I\u2019d seen, the Johns Hopkins Brady Urological Institute was at the top of my list and as luck (or perhaps Divine providence) would have it, I already had business travel scheduled to the Baltimore area near the end of April. I also considered a handful of other doctors / institutions (see notes in post parts 3-4 below) based my research (primarily published surgical margin rates). Ultimately I decided to have open RRP done by Arthur (Bud) Burnett at Hopkins. My key deciding factors for RRP over RALP were as follows... Although on the surface RALP appeared attractive, the closer I looked its actual benefits over RRP for me being young, healthy and not overweight seemed pretty minimal: Less blood loss (due to the pressurization of abdomen) Possibly it might have made it easier to work around my prior hernia repairOn the other hand, I felt there were several significant disadvantages to RALP vs. RRP: Lack of tactile feedback. While most RALP surgeons will say they can compensate by using the 30x magnified 3D vision to watch how the tissues respond as they tug and poke them, at least one doctor who does both (Schaeffer at Hopkins) recommends open surgery for palpable tumors like I had. RALP requires general anesthesia, which brings its own risks and complications (at a minimum longer perioperative recovery time). I really preferred regional. RALP is arguably more invasive than RRP due to five separate incisions (one of which needs to be significantly enlarged to remove the specimen) and violation of the peritoneal space. Potential for robotic failure or malfunction. Although I\u2019m told the rate is only like 0.5% and all of the institutions I considered would probably have a spare available, from my own background in medical device safety I\u2019ve seen enough device-related adverse events to be wary of unnecessarily introducing complex technology into the loop without a sufficiently compelling benefit. I also decided to have an endorectal MRI as was recommended by the second local urologist to plan nerve sparing even though the first said it had no value. I figured it would be another data point that I would take with a grain of salt if it looked good (I still wanted, at most, partial nerve sparing on the right given my palpable lesion and PNI) but take seriously if it suggested possible extra capsular extension in which case I may want to pre-decide on unilateral nerve sparing vs. leaving it to an inflight decision. I\u2019ve had other MRIs before but never one with this particular coil which the radiologist positioned himself after performing a DRE. That was the worst part and it really was not that bad. The study took about an hour with contrast agent administered at the end. I got the results a couple days later and, although I tried to take them with a grain of salt, I was very pleased. A lesion was imaged in the right mid and apex but not the most inferior apex at the urethral sphincter (which is very prone to positive margins). The lesion did not the typical diffusion-weighted features of aggressive high grade PCa. No evidence of ECE, neurovascular bundle involvement, seminal vesicle involvement or lymphadenopathy.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by Fairwind Welcome to the other side njs... Very, very few of us can travel around the country visiting with world renowned doctors and institutions before we make our treatment decisions.. I recognize it is not feasible for everyone to travel, but really what I did could be for feasible many. First I did research from home and prioritized a top few choices. With Hopkins I was lucky to have a pre-existing business trip to Washington, but if I had not already been out there it would have been well worth a $200 coach ticket for a day or overnight trip if necessary. Chicago was a short drive in the car and I had both consults there the same day. Guys only have one chance to do this, so they shouldn't dismiss it out of hand if they are not satisfied with their local options. Who I picked for the surgery was one of the few things in my control. I would've liked nothing better than if the local docs I saw first would have told me their PSM rates were ~2% for pT2 but when they said 6-10% I just felt it was worth the modest expense and inconvenience to travel to reduce the likelihood of having disease left behind by 3-5 fold. Given how it played out, I'm very happy I had someone as talented and experienced as Burnett or I might have been closed right back up with my prostate still intact! All that said, I recognize many people will not be willing or able to go through all the research and multiple consults. That is why I wanted to share everything I did so others could have the benefit without reinventing the wheel. Originally Posted by Fairwind In your first post, you used the term \"Successful Surgery\" when you are 2 weeks post surgery..And with your G-6 cancer, you like 90% of the men with similar numbers as yours enjoy \"Successful Surgery\", their PC cured never to return..There are three key milestones you must pass first..The 8 week PSA test comes back undetectable, the two year test comes back the same way as does the five year test....THEN you can break out the Champagne and we will all drink a rousing toast to your good fortune..But until then, sure, ride along with us and help the new guys, terrified and afraid, unsure what awaits them on this unsure journey... Point well taken, Fairwind. It may be splitting hairs, but I view the surgery as \"successful\" because Burnett got me through it okay (which turned out to be no mean feat) and delivered negative margins, which is really all a surgeon can do oncologically. I know the journey is far from over but with organ confined GS6 on the final pathology I feel very optimistic and extremely fortunate.",

      "Content": "Part 2/4: I had my surgery on Tues, May 28 under spinal anesthesia. As it turned out Dr. Burnett encountered unexpectedly severe difficulties from my prior mesh hernia repair that he said might have caused most surgeons to abort the operation. He said many of the normal tissue planes were unrecognizable / stuck together like glue and he had to rely more on his experience and memory of the anatomy than what he could actually see to navigate through it. This caused the operation to take him longer than usual so I had some additional intraoperative blood loss and also had a lot of bloody drainage postoperatively apparently due to the additional tissue trauma. But Burnett was optimistic afterwards that he had been successful having done complete nerve sparing on the left and partial on the right as originally planned and removing 11 normal looking lymph nodes. While I did not need a transfusion during the surgery, by the next morning my blood count had dropped to the point where I did. Other than that however, I felt very good (probably thanks in part to the regional anesthesia) and I did a lot of walking. I may have actually overdone the walking because the second night I had a lot more bloody drainage and by the next morning I needed another transfusion. Due to the complications, I ended up staying three nights instead of the typical one or two but it really was not too bad as everyone (doctors, nurses, nurses aids, nutrition staff) at Hopkins were excellent. Also one advantage of the extended stay was that I was able to receive in-person my final pathology report, which was perfect (GS 3+3, organ-confined tumor, negative margins)! Our trip home was needlessly long and tiring. I had changed our original tickets to 5:00 PM, which was the latest direct flight on AirTran to Milwaukee, but with waiting to be discharged, fighting rush hour traffic to DCA and returning the rental car we did not get to the ticket counter until 4:40. They gave us our boarding passes and got me a wheelchair so we could mostly bypass the long Friday eve lines out of Washington and I would have assumed they would have called ahead to the tell the gate we were coming, but when we got to the gate at 4:52 they turned us away citing their policy to close the doors at 10 minutes to departure! Ordinarily this would just have been an annoying hassle, but in this case having to travel with a catheter and a couple surgical drain tubes still in, being anemic, exhausted and at risk for blood clots I was pretty concerned. I was in a wheel chair, still had the patient bracelet on my wrist and a fresh dressing on my hand from the IV that was just pulled out but they just scoffed at me and refused to let me board even though the plane was sitting right there. In fact, the \"customer service\" guy at the counter got indigent with me for giving him a hard time when he was \"just trying to do his job\". I really didn't have the energy to put up much of an argument (and it probably wouldn't have mattered) so we ended up having to come home through Atlanta with a couple hour lay-over and didn't drag ourselves in the door at home until midnight Friday. Since getting home I\u0092ve been doing great. The first weekend I took the mild narcotics that were prescribed and took it pretty easy but Saturday morning I did manage to get out of the house to watch my son play soccer. Although my wife had FMLA approved for five weeks, she went back to work one week post-op. The first day she was gone, much to her chagrin, I got on my tractor (catheter and all) and cut the lawn. My catheter and surgical drains were removed on June 7 (10 days). The next day I was back in the coach\u0092s box for two soccer games. Continence is of course a gradual process but I\u0092m dry at night and mostly while sitting. Burnett called me last night and said he expects this to improve dramatically over the next 2-3 weeks. I have been working from home but will probably go into the office next week. I have a follow up with my local urologist in about four weeks for post-op PSA and to discuss rehab. Dr. Burnett put me on Irbesartan (Avapro) to speed nerve recovery and given my age and prior good function I\u0092m hoping Cialis (at most) may be sufficient but I'll cross that bridge when I come to it!",

      "Content": "Thanks for the welcome and well-wishes. I agree it may not be necessary to go with a \"big name\" surgeon per-se. In fact, it is important to note that I found some really mediocre surgical margin rates published by some \"big name\" docs / institutions that I didn't even mention in my original post - so you can't rely on \"big name\" in and of itself. First of all, I think you want someone with lots of experience (at least several hundred, especially for RALP) and who still does it regularly (1+ per week). Then I'd ask them to quantify their outcomes - in particular positive margin rates. You want to know their separate rates for pT2 patients and pT3 patients. Don't settle for an \"overall\" margin rate, as this is meaningless without knowing their patient mix. Ideally you also want to know their patient mix in terms of p-stage and/or c-stage (i.e. are they operating on many higher-risk patients?). Many doctors (e.g. Patel, Menon) seem to be operating on 80-90% pT2 patients. There may well be many lesser-known surgeons out there with great outcome metrics, the problem is you won't know who they are until you get a consult with them and ask these questions. For this reason it was easiest for me to just do a literature search for published metrics, but then you get mostly \"big names\". Finally while, to Dr. Catalonia's point, PSM rates may be somewhat of a flawed metric, still it is virtually only objective metric we really have available (there are also recurrence rates but those are even harder to get due to the lag time). If surgeon \"A\" has 2% PSM rate on a large series of pT2 patients and surgeon \"B\" at another institution with different surgical technique and pathology protocol has 7% PSM rate on a large series of pT2 patients, then, all other things equal, I'd be more conformable with surgeon \"A\" knowing that the advantage could be overstated but is still more likely to be in his favor than surgeon \"B\".",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by Fairwind Welcome to the other side njs... Very, very few of us can travel around the country visiting with world renowned doctors and institutions before we make our treatment decisions.. I recognize it is not feasible for everyone to travel, but really what I did could be for feasible many. First I did research from home and prioritized a top few choices. With Hopkins I was lucky to have a pre-existing business trip to Washington, but if I had not already been out there it would have been well worth a $200 coach ticket for a day or overnight trip if necessary. Chicago was a short drive in the car and I had both consults there the same day. Guys only have one chance to do this, so they shouldn't dismiss it out of hand if they are not satisfied with their local options. Who I picked for the surgery was one of the few things in my control. I would've liked nothing better than if the local docs I saw first would have told me their PSM rates were ~2% for pT2 but when they said 6-10% I just felt it was worth the modest expense and inconvenience to travel to reduce the likelihood of having disease left behind by 3-5 fold. Given how it played out, I'm very happy I had someone as talented and experienced as Burnett or I might have been closed right back up with my prostate still intact! All that said, I recognize many people will not be willing or able to go through all the research and multiple consults. That is why I wanted to share everything I did so others could have the benefit without reinventing the wheel. Originally Posted by Fairwind In your first post, you used the term \"Successful Surgery\" when you are 2 weeks post surgery..And with your G-6 cancer, you like 90% of the men with similar numbers as yours enjoy \"Successful Surgery\", their PC cured never to return..There are three key milestones you must pass first..The 8 week PSA test comes back undetectable, the two year test comes back the same way as does the five year test....THEN you can break out the Champagne and we will all drink a rousing toast to your good fortune..But until then, sure, ride along with us and help the new guys, terrified and afraid, unsure what awaits them on this unsure journey... Point well taken, Fairwind. It may be splitting hairs, but I view the surgery as \"successful\" because Burnett got me through it okay (which turned out to be no mean feat) and delivered negative margins, which is really all a surgeon can do oncologically. I know the journey is far from over but with organ confined GS6 on the final pathology I feel very optimistic and extremely fortunate.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by Fairwind Surgeons who limit (or try to limit) there practices to G6 and low-risk G7 patients while turning away G8, 9 & 10 patients are certain to have fewer Positive Surgical Margins than surgeons who are willing to take a shot at curing those in the high-risk group....So by cherry-picking the customer base they can make themselves look very good indeed.. Fairwind, I don't know whether your final pathology was organ-confined (pT2), but what you say about a surgeon who treats more higher-GS cases having a higher PSM rate is definitely true for overall PSM rate because a higher proportion of his patients will turn out to be non-organ confined (pT3 / pT4) and therefore much more prone to positive margins. In principle the PSM rate for pT2 (not to be confused with cT2 - clinical organ confined) should be less sensitive to this effect because when a PSM occurs with pT2 it involves some sort of iatrogenic cause (e.g. nicking the prostate capsule, or not getting all the prostate dissected away from the striated sphincter at the apex), which is why this should be a better metric. Still, I know this is not entirely true. The folks at Hopkins recently published PSM rate of 5.7% for 247 high risk pT2 patients undergoing RRP, which is 4x higher than their 1.3% PSM rate for all 10446 patients undergoing RRP between 1993 and 2006. At least one explanation I can imagine, is that high risk patients are more likely to have higher percentage of cancer in the prostate so any iatrogenic nick is more likely to hit tumor than benign prostate cells.",

      "Content": "LILDOG, I'm just checking in from a one-year hiatus but I remember discussing your situation before I checked out a year ago. I know you were quite concerned at the time and from your posts over the last year it appears that this situation has continued to cause you significant anxiety... Originally Posted by LILDOG At what psa level is salvage radiation advised ? Does insurance usually pay when a patient is not at the recurrence level ( 0.2 and rising ) ? Is salvage radiation advised with such low levels of psa even 0.055 to keep from overtreating a patient ? The ASTRO and AUA joint guideline for radiation therapy after prostatectomy (http://www.auanet.org/common/pdf/edu...statectomy.pdf) recommends that clinicians define biochemical recurrence (BCR) as a detectable or rising PSA value after surgery that is ≥ 0.2 ng/ml with a second confirmatory level ≥ 0.2 ng/ml. Moreover some doctors believe that even levels of ≥ 0.2 ng/ml are not worrisome if the PSA doubling time is very long. Donin et. al. describe \"insignificant biochemical recurrence\" (iBCR) hypothetically due to bits of benign prostate tissue being left behind: \"A PSA >0.2 ng/mL may develop because of local, lymphatic, or systemic recurrent prostate cancer or may be because of the presence of residual benign prostate tissue. Differentiating between these etiologies in the early stages of recurrence is not possible using presently available diagnostic technology. We have previously reported that microscopic benign prostate tissue is often identified at the apical and bladder neck soft tissue margins during RP and speculated that these benign glands may contribute to measureable PSA associated with prolonged PSA doubling time (PSADT). We have previously reported that a postprostatectomy PSA >0.2 ng/mL in association with a PSADT >36 months is attributable to residual benign microscopic prostatic elements. Men fulfilling these criteria in the present study were classified as exhibiting iBCR likely because of benign prostatic tissue and therefore none of these men were offered salvage radiation therapy (SRT).\" see: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23706588 http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19406457 At this point your PSA is still not close to 0.2 ng/l. Also, although the three readings from the same lab of 0.042 , 0.047 and 0.055 suggest an upward trend, the absolute differences of 0.005 and 0.008 are very small and we don't know how much of that could simply be random measurement noise so extrapolating a doubling time from these 3 readings may not be very reliable. On the other hand, if your 0.030 PSA from over a year ago was also from this same lab, then that may be a bit more useful and would suggest a doubling time of a just little over one year. Still, IMO there is no need to panic at this point given your low level relative to 0.2 criteria and that IIRC, despite your overall GS of 3+4 the actual GS at the location of your PSM was only 3+3 so, if you eventually do have a significant BCR that warrants salvage radiation, I would think you could take comfort in the result from Donin that radiation was successful in 100% of GS 3+3 patients.",

      "Content": "I did have both nerves spared but since I was cT2 the sparing was only partial (extrafascial) on the side with the tumor. I know that a few guys are able to have sex sooner than 9 weeks, but from what I've seen mine was still a pretty quick recovery. Of course most guys are older than me. I expected it to take some time. The one thing that surprised me was the venous leakage issue. My theory is this was pre-existing before the surgery but was not sufficient to cause ED when my nerves were fully functioning. But now while my nerves are still recovering the natural chemical response is not sufficient to overcome this baseline leakage hence the need for a ring / upright posture. It was very reassuring when I tried Edex to see that with a strong chemical response the venous leakage poses no problem whatsoever (i.e. rock hard with no ring and regardless of posture). Hopefully in 6 months or so after nerves have recovered more fully I'll get that type of response without injections. I am taking Irbesartan (Avapro) 300 mg daily. My surgeon published a small open label study last year showing fairly compelling apparent benefit for protecting nerves / speeding their recovery post RRP. It is safe and cheep (this is a generic blood pressure medicine) so I have nothing to lose.",

      "Content": "Welcome Israel. I assume you have had a DRE and it was normal. That's good and along with your negative biopsy and relatively low PSA level (albeit high for your age and rising) means advanced stage PC is unlikely. Those PSA levels are high for your age and the increase in the last year is concerning if the 3.9 level is to be believed. If you had sex, bicycled, or had the DRE prior to the blood draw, that could cause the level to be artificially elevated. Infection is a common cause of elevated PSA you may want to try another course of antibiotics for a longer time than 10 days and repeat the PSA. Another good next step to ask your doctor about given your negative biopsy would be the PCA3 (Prostate Cancer Antigen 3) urine test. Good luck.",

That is the right thing to do to stack the odds in your favor. In parallel you may want to consider lining up more appointments with additional experts. I talked to six top surgeons and gleaned something useful from every consult. In your case you should be talking with surgeons, radiation oncologists and medical oncologists who specialize in PC. It would be helpful if you could share your additional stats (PSA, clinical stage, % of positive tissue in cores). Good luck.",

Even aggressive PC is potentially curable and at a minimum likely to be able to be controlled for a long time while new treatments continue to emerge. I am not familiar with the trial, but I know that there was significant interest a decade ago in \"neoadjuvant\" hormonal therapy to \"down-stage\" high-risk cancer prior to surgeries, but I don't think a clear benefit was ever demonstrated in longer term follow up. More recently however I know there is renewed interest in neoadjuvant hormonal and chemo therapy especially in combination with some potentially promising results (see links below). I think its wise for your husband to try such a trial. I would probably do the same thing. http://www.ascopost.com/issues/june-...te-cancer.aspx http://www.hindawi.com/journals/cherp/2013/386809/ http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23158077 http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18554663 http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23249358 http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22214417 http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17355369 http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18308112 http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19755998",

      "Content": "Welcome Israel. I assume you have had a DRE and it was normal. That's good and along with your negative biopsy and relatively low PSA level (albeit high for your age and rising) means advanced stage PC is unlikely. Those PSA levels are high for your age and the increase in the last year is concerning if the 3.9 level is to be believed. If you had sex, bicycled, or had the DRE prior to the blood draw, that could cause the level to be artificially elevated. Infection is a common cause of elevated PSA you may want to try another course of antibiotics for a longer time than 10 days and repeat the PSA. Another good next step to ask your doctor about given your negative biopsy would be the PCA3 (Prostate Cancer Antigen 3) urine test. Good luck.",

      "Content": "I had a follow-up appointment with my local urologist yesterday, which was exactly 21 weeks post-op, so I thought I'd post a brief update... This time my PSA was actually undetectable (i.e. <0.01) vs. the 0.01 with no less than sign (which I still suspect may have been a transcription error) that I got at 6 weeks. I really didn't have anxiety about this given my post-op pathology, but it was nice to see a true undetectable this time. I asked my urologist why the ultrasensitive test and he said that the lab has standardized on only doing this one assay for efficiency. He says he doesn't want to check it again for one year. On the continence front, I ditched the pads a couple weeks ago. I may have an occasional very small leak if I move a certain way or sneeze and I do tend to leak a bit while sitting around in the eve perhaps from fatigue or relaxation but mostly I am doing pretty well. A while back I cut way back on the Kegels (which I think I may have been overdoing for a while) but made a better effort to trying to walk a couple miles almost every day, which I think has helped. Then one weekend I figured I would just skip the pad and did pretty well. After a couple such weekends I was confident enough to start going to the office without the pads and have been fine. In terms of ED, this also continues to gradually improve. I have been having sex successfully with Cialis and constriction band since 9 weeks post-op. My erections without Cialis are slowly improving and I find that need less Cialis for sex. Despite that success, I did also decide about a month ago to try Edex injections and found them to be a good option when I want 100% high quality result without having to use the constriction band or restrict positions to an upright posture. I'm doing this about half the time now as an alternative to the Cialis and am very pleased.",

Finally, I would highly recommend obtaining a copy of Dr. Patrick Walsh's Guide to Surviving Prostate Cancer, which does a great job of explaining these and other topics and I found to be invaluable.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by September The doctor seemed like radiation would be done, no mention of waiting around for the PSA at 3 mts. It does make me wonder. I have the path report and I will look at it more in depth. Some I can understand, some I cannot. How bad is this? Anyone else been thru this with radiation. Is this what is called salvage? Hi September. Your husband's final pathology is a mixed bag. The SV invasion and Gleason score upgrade are disappointing but the negative margins and lymph nodes are still excellent news. Salvage Radiation Therapy (SRT) refers to radiation initiated only after a PSA recurrence is observed following surgery. On the other hand, radiation that is initiated shortly after surgery without waiting for PSA to rise is called Adjuvant Radiation Therapy (ART). There is strong evidence that for high risk patients like your husband both ART and SRT improve cancer control compared to surgery alone. This seems especially true when radiation is combined with a period of androgen deprivation therapy (ADT). For example, here is an article about ART for men like your husband: http://prostatecancerinfolink.net/20...ostate-cancer/ It is less clear whether ART is more effective than SRT, but there does appear to be some evidence of that E.g.: Postoperative radiotherapy after radical prostatectomy for high-risk prostate cancer: long-term results of a randomised controlled trial (EORTC trial 22911) Adjuvant Radiotherapy for Pathological T3N0M0 Prostate Cancer Significantly Reduces Risk of Metastases and Improves Survival: Long-Term Followup of a Randomized Clinical Trial Adjuvant Radiotherapy Following Radical Prostatectomy Improves Long-Term Biochemical Control with Few Late Side Effects In August the AUA and ASTRO issued a joint guideline on ART and SRT after prostatectomy. Here are a couple excerpts: Guideline Statement 2. Patients with adverse pathologic findings including seminal vesicle invasion, positive surgical margins, and extraprostatic extension should be informed that adjuvant radiotherapy, compared to radical prostatectomy only, reduces the risk of biochemical (PSA) recurrence, local recurrence, and clinical progression of cancer. They should also be informed that the impact of adjuvant radiotherapy on subsequent metastases and overall survival is less clear; one of two randomized controlled trials that addressed these outcomes indicated a benefit but the other trial did not demonstrate a benefit. However, the other trial was not powered to test the benefit regarding metastases and overall survival. (Clinical Principle) Guideline Statement 3. Physicians should offer adjuvant radiotherapy to patients with adverse pathologic findings at prostatectomy including seminal vesicle invasion, positive surgical margins, or extraprostatic extension because of demonstrated reductions in biochemical recurrence, local recurrence, and clinical progression. (Standard; Evidence Strength: Grade A)... ART vs. SRT. One of the most pressing clinical questions regarding the care of the post-RP patient is whether it is better to administer RT before evidence of recurrence \u0096 RT as adjuvant therapy \u0096 or to wait until recurrence manifests and then administer RT as salvage therapy. It is acknowledged that the use of ART may involve irradiation of some patients who never would have had recurrent cancer, thus exposing them unnecessarily to the risks, toxicity, and quality of life impact of RT. Waiting to administer RT as a salvage therapy limits its use to patients with recurrence but, particularly in patients with high-risk disease, could be less effective and could allow the progression to metastatic disease... When this literature is examined as a whole, it appears that ART patients generally have better outcomes compared to SRT patients. For example, ART study arms generally report lower rates of biochemical recurrence and metastatic recurrence than do SRT study arms at similar post-RP follow-up durations. Patterns with regard to cancer-specific survival and overall survival are less clear because few ART studies reported these outcomes. Overall, the interpretation that ART leads to superior outcomes is difficult to make with certainty in the absence of randomization and given that SRT studies focus only on patients who have already relapsed, making direct comparisons with ART studies problematic. ART and SRT studies also differ across numerous factors, any of which potentially confound interpretation. These include differences in patient characteristics (e.g., ART patients generally have more adverse pathological profiles), RT protocols (e.g., SRT studies often used higher RT doses than ART studies), failure definitions, follow-up durations, and in other key factors. In addition, most of the published literature reports findings from the use of older RT techniques (e.g., EBRT protocols), making it unclear whether newer techniques might result in fewer apparent differences between ART and SRT outcomes. Given these issues, the Panel concluded that it is not possible from the available evidence to address the question of the superiority of ART vs. SRT. A recent propensity score-matched, multi-institutional analysis has attempted to address this issue, reporting no difference in biochemical recurrence-free survival rates at 60 months between pT3N0 patients administered RT adjuvantly compared to those observed and treated with early SRT (with PSA ≤ 0.5 ng/ml).36 In this analysis, however, the follow-up duration for the observed group was considerably shorter (median 30 months) than the follow-up duration for the ART group (median 67 months). Currently, two RCTs are actively accruing patients to address this important question \u0096 the RADICALS trial (MRC PR10, NCIC PR13) and the RAVES trial (TROG 08.03; see more detailed discussion in Research Needs and Future Directions).",

This seems especially true when radiation is combined with a period of androgen deprivation therapy (ADT). For example, here is an article about ART for men like your husband: http://prostatecancerinfolink.net/20...ostate-cancer/ It is less clear whether ART is more effective than SRT, but there does appear to be some evidence of that E.g.: Postoperative radiotherapy after radical prostatectomy for high-risk prostate cancer: long-term results of a randomised controlled trial (EORTC trial 22911) Adjuvant Radiotherapy for Pathological T3N0M0 Prostate Cancer Significantly Reduces Risk of Metastases and Improves Survival: Long-Term Followup of a Randomized Clinical Trial Adjuvant Radiotherapy Following Radical Prostatectomy Improves Long-Term Biochemical Control with Few Late Side Effects In August the AUA and ASTRO issued a joint guideline on ART and SRT after prostatectomy. Here are a couple excerpts: Guideline Statement 2. Patients with adverse pathologic findings including seminal vesicle invasion, positive surgical margins, and extraprostatic extension should be informed that adjuvant radiotherapy, compared to radical prostatectomy only, reduces the risk of biochemical (PSA) recurrence, local recurrence, and clinical progression of cancer. They should also be informed that the impact of adjuvant radiotherapy on subsequent metastases and overall survival is less clear; one of two randomized controlled trials that addressed these outcomes indicated a benefit but the other trial did not demonstrate a benefit. However, the other trial was not powered to test the benefit regarding metastases and overall survival. (Clinical Principle) Guideline Statement 3. Physicians should offer adjuvant radiotherapy to patients with adverse pathologic findings at prostatectomy including seminal vesicle invasion, positive surgical margins, or extraprostatic extension because of demonstrated reductions in biochemical recurrence, local recurrence, and clinical progression. (Standard; Evidence Strength: Grade A)... ART vs. SRT. One of the most pressing clinical questions regarding the care of the post-RP patient is whether it is better to administer RT before evidence of recurrence \u0096 RT as adjuvant therapy \u0096 or to wait until recurrence manifests and then administer RT as salvage therapy. It is acknowledged that the use of ART may involve irradiation of some patients who never would have had recurrent cancer, thus exposing them unnecessarily to the risks, toxicity, and quality of life impact of RT. Waiting to administer RT as a salvage therapy limits its use to patients with recurrence but, particularly in patients with high-risk disease, could be less effective and could allow the progression to metastatic disease... When this literature is examined as a whole, it appears that ART patients generally have better outcomes compared to SRT patients. For example, ART study arms generally report lower rates of biochemical recurrence and metastatic recurrence than do SRT study arms at similar post-RP follow-up durations. Patterns with regard to cancer-specific survival and overall survival are less clear because few ART studies reported these outcomes. Overall, the interpretation that ART leads to superior outcomes is difficult to make with certainty in the absence of randomization and given that SRT studies focus only on patients who have already relapsed, making direct comparisons with ART studies problematic. ART and SRT studies also differ across numerous factors, any of which potentially confound interpretation. These include differences in patient characteristics (e.g., ART patients generally have more adverse pathological profiles), RT protocols (e.g., SRT studies often used higher RT doses than ART studies), failure definitions, follow-up durations, and in other key factors. In addition, most of the published literature reports findings from the use of older RT techniques (e.g., EBRT protocols), making it unclear whether newer techniques might result in fewer apparent differences between ART and SRT outcomes. Given these issues, the Panel concluded that it is not possible from the available evidence to address the question of the superiority of ART vs. SRT. A recent propensity score-matched, multi-institutional analysis has attempted to address this issue, reporting no difference in biochemical recurrence-free survival rates at 60 months between pT3N0 patients administered RT adjuvantly compared to those observed and treated with early SRT (with PSA ≤ 0.5 ng/ml).36 In this analysis, however, the follow-up duration for the observed group was considerably shorter (median 30 months) than the follow-up duration for the ART group (median 67 months). Currently, two RCTs are actively accruing patients to address this important question \u0096 the RADICALS trial (MRC PR10, NCIC PR13) and the RAVES trial (TROG 08.03; see more detailed discussion in Research Needs and Future Directions).",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by hopper Hello This is my first post. Age 59. PSA of 4.7 on 9/14/2014, PSA of 6.3 on 11/12/2014. Urologist performed DRE and said slightly enlarged but was fairly confident that nothing would be found in a biopsy. Biopsy performed on 12/16/2014. 12 samples, 5 benign 7 positive with the highest being 3+4=7 in 2 cores. the rest were 3+3=6. Cancer seems to be confined to prostate. Negative bone scan. He suggested RP but also gave me a brochure to Cyberknife (SBRT). I did a lot of reading and decided to go with the Cyberknife until I had my appointment to talk with the Oncologist. The Dr. said he was surprised that I would consider it over surgery considering my age and my cancer being considered of medium risk. He also said that he would want to do HT for about a year. The HT was nothing I had considered. I read up on the side effects and I talked with the wife and grown Daughter and they both said I was moody enough and depressed enough already(which is true) to have the HT. I called the Dr. and asked if I could do the SBRT without the HT. He said I could but strongly advised against it. I thought OK I will have the surgery. I then talked to my Urologist and told him this and he didn't understand why the oncologist would not want me to do it without the HT saying that the cancer was on the low side of medium risk. He also said he would do the surgery without the HT. BTW both DR.s have very good reputations and several awards in their fields and I researched them both and found no bad reviews. Sorry for the babbling but just going a bit nuts trying to decide which way to go. So if anyone has any comments I would sure appreciate it Sorry about your diagnosis but welcome, hopper. It is fairly common to use neoadjuvant hormone therapy prior to radiation to sensitize the cancer cells to the radiation and make it more effective, but I've never heard of having to do it for a year. There is not generally considered to be a similar benefit to neoadjuvant HT prior to surgery, so that makes sense. SBRT and surgery both seem like potentially good options for you although SBRT is newer and does not have the same long term results available. Surgery provides more conclusive data on your disease state, which may give peace of mind, but the outcomes with surgery are MUCH more dependent on the skill and experience of the specific practitioner than they are with external beam radiation. Prostatectomy is any extremely delicate and challenging procedure -- even when done roboticly. It takes many hundreds (some studies suggest well over 1000) surgeries for a surgeon to optimize his technique. And experience is necessary but not sufficient. The few best surgeons in the world seem to have a unique talent that allows them to significantly outperform by objective measures most other equally experienced surgeons. A key such measure of effectiveness in achieving cure through surgery is the positive surgical margin (PSM) rate, which is a measure of how often the surgeon leaves some cancer behind. In particular I recommend you look at a surgeon's PSM rate for pathological organ-confined (pT2) disease. As shown in the following a spreadsheet, world-class PSM rates for pT2 patients are <2% but many other well-known and highly-experienced surgeons actually have PSM rates several times higher than that: http://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/...it?usp=sharing So I'd encourage you to ask your urologist for his personal stats. And how you ask the questions is very important so that you can compare apples-to-apples. Specifically you should ask: \"What is your positive surgical margin rate for pathalogic stage T2 (stage pT2) patients?\" \"What is your positive surgical margin rate for pathalogic stage T3 (stage pT3) patients?\" If the answers are significantly higher than 2% and 35% respectively (particularly if the PSM rate for stage pT2 is much more than 2%), then you can probably significantly improve your chances by going elsewhere. And many guys travel for this procedure, so don't let that deter you -- you only get one shot at this! Have you considered low dose rate Brachytherapy (i.e. seeds)? It is a simple procedure with low side effects and high effectiveness since it allows higher and more uniform dosing throughout the prostate compared to external beam radiation. However a downside, like surgery, is that the effectiveness is more sensitive to the skill of the individual practitioner. If you have not done so already I would strongly recommend picking up Dr. Walsh's Guide to Surviving Prostate Cancer which explains many of these concepts and the various treatment options.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by September Hello - It is w/ deep regret that I have to be here. No offense. Hubby has been dx w/ Pca. It's not good. I have been reading and researching myself. Hubby doesn't surf the web. I will fill in the information I have on hand as soon as I figure out how to do it. Hubby goes faithfully to his doctor yearly. He is 60. His Dad had Pca at 60 also. He did not die from it. Psa was 5.3. Up from last year of 3.1. Saw urilogist, he did biopsy. Six out of twelve spots were positive. All scans came back good. Appt. today with uroligist. He is referring him to the specialist to see if he is a candidate for surgery via robotic. Grade was HIGH End. Staging T1C. Gleason 4+4. Bilateral. I bought the Walsh book today. Scared out of my gord. How bad is this? Lay it on me. Hello September. Sorry about your husband's diagnosis, but welcome. You will find lots of help and advice here. Its normal to feel like you do but try to just take a deep breath. While Gleason 8 is aggressive PC and puts you husband in the high-risk category but the big piture considering his other statistics (stage T1c and 5.3 PSA) provide plenty of hope... According to the Memorial Sloan-Kettering pre-treatment nomogram your husband has a 63% chance of organ-confined disease. Specifically it says that he has a 67% chance of no extra capsular extension, a 92% chance of no Seminal Vesicle Invasion and a 96% chance of no lymph node involvement. The Partin Tables predict very similar numbers. The MSK nomogram also predicts that at 10 years following successful surgery he has an 85% chance of no detectable disease and a 98% chance of not having died of PC. So I would view that as excellent news. But the key point here is successful surgery, which is less common that you may think. In the best case scenario of disease confined to the prostate (\"horses have not left the barn\"), most good surgeons will still have about an 8% or higher chance of leaving some of it behind (a positive surgical margin or \"PSM\"). But there are a handfull of top surgeons (e.g. many at Johns Hopkins, Ash Tewari at Cornell, Tomas Ahlering at UC Irvine) who can offer your husband PSM rates of 2% or below. If you consider surgery I would strongly urge you to seek out these top surgeons. You only get on shot at this. There are also other viable treatments (brachytherapy and/or external beam radiation with adjuvant hormone blockade) that can offer a good chance of cure. Reading the Walsh book is a great start to understanding his disease and options. If you have more questions we are here to help. Good luck!",

It is optional because, while there is evidence that early adjuvant radiation offers modest benefits vs. later salvage radiation, the patient may elect to forego it and its side effects and only do radiation as salvage therapy if and when there is actual evidence of local recurrence.

Scared out of my gord. How bad is this? Lay it on me. Hello September. Sorry about your husband's diagnosis, but welcome. You will find lots of help and advice here. Its normal to feel like you do but try to just take a deep breath. While Gleason 8 is aggressive PC and puts you husband in the high-risk category but the big piture considering his other statistics (stage T1c and 5.3 PSA) provide plenty of hope... According to the Memorial Sloan-Kettering pre-treatment nomogram your husband has a 63% chance of organ-confined disease. Specifically it says that he has a 67% chance of no extra capsular extension, a 92% chance of no Seminal Vesicle Invasion and a 96% chance of no lymph node involvement. The Partin Tables predict very similar numbers. The MSK nomogram also predicts that at 10 years following successful surgery he has an 85% chance of no detectable disease and a 98% chance of not having died of PC. So I would view that as excellent news. But the key point here is successful surgery, which is less common that you may think. In the best case scenario of disease confined to the prostate (\"horses have not left the barn\"), most good surgeons will still have about an 8% or higher chance of leaving some of it behind (a positive surgical margin or \"PSM\"). But there are a handfull of top surgeons (e.g. many at Johns Hopkins, Ash Tewari at Cornell, Tomas Ahlering at UC Irvine) who can offer your husband PSM rates of 2% or below. If you consider surgery I would strongly urge you to seek out these top surgeons. You only get on shot at this. There are also other viable treatments (brachytherapy and/or external beam radiation with adjuvant hormone blockade) that can offer a good chance of cure. Reading the Walsh book is a great start to understanding his disease and options. If you have more questions we are here to help. Good luck!",

Scared out of my gord. How bad is this? Lay it on me. Hello September. Sorry about your husband's diagnosis, but welcome. You will find lots of help and advice here. Its normal to feel like you do but try to just take a deep breath. While Gleason 8 is aggressive PC and puts you husband in the high-risk category but the big piture considering his other statistics (stage T1c and 5.3 PSA) provide plenty of hope... According to the Memorial Sloan-Kettering pre-treatment nomogram your husband has a 63% chance of organ-confined disease. Specifically it says that he has a 67% chance of no extra capsular extension, a 92% chance of no Seminal Vesicle Invasion and a 96% chance of no lymph node involvement. The Partin Tables predict very similar numbers. The MSK nomogram also predicts that at 10 years following successful surgery he has an 85% chance of no detectable disease and a 98% chance of not having died of PC. So I would view that as excellent news. But the key point here is successful surgery, which is less common that you may think. In the best case scenario of disease confined to the prostate (\"horses have not left the barn\"), most good surgeons will still have about an 8% or higher chance of leaving some of it behind (a positive surgical margin or \"PSM\"). But there are a handfull of top surgeons (e.g. many at Johns Hopkins, Ash Tewari at Cornell, Tomas Ahlering at UC Irvine) who can offer your husband PSM rates of 2% or below. If you consider surgery I would strongly urge you to seek out these top surgeons. You only get on shot at this. There are also other viable treatments (brachytherapy and/or external beam radiation with adjuvant hormone blockade) that can offer a good chance of cure. Reading the Walsh book is a great start to understanding his disease and options. If you have more questions we are here to help. Good luck!",

      "Content": "Sorry to hear about the positive margin, but PSMs at the apex are fairly common and it is good news that it is only GS3+3. This does not indicate aggressive cancer. To be clear, the report does not mean that there is any uncertainty about the PSM -- they are certain that there was a 3mm long PSM. The uncertainty is only whether the PSM was caused by the cancer growing outside the prostate or by the surgeon cutting into the prostate. Unlike most of the prostate, at the apex there is no capsule clearly separating the prostate from extra-prostatic tissue (in this case the striated sphincter muscles). Studies show that the specific Gleason score of the tumor at the PSM location predicts likelihood of recurrence. PSMs that were only GS3+3 are less likely to cause recurrence (presumably because the GS3+3 is more likely to die off in the aftermath of the surgery). Moreover, studies show that, even if it does eventually result in a recurrence, GS3+3 is virtually always curable by salvage radiation.",

Negative surgical margins are GOOD. This means the pathologist saw no evidence of cancer left behind in the prostate bed (which is called a positive margin). Men with negative margins are less likely to have PSA recurrence after surgery (and therefore to need potential radiation therapy in the first place) compared to men with positive margins. However when men with negative margins do experience PSA recurrence, radiation therapy is less likely to be effective (compared to men with positive margins) because with negative margins the the cancer is is less likely to be recurring locally in the prostate bed where it can be cured by radiation therapy.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by jimmie webb should radiation be done when psa reading is 0.20 or before 0.20 . my cancer is recurring after 22 year. Hi and welcome, Jimmie. Why do you think your cancer is recurring? As Chuck indicated, it would be helpful to have your stats from surgery (final Gleason score, pathologic stage, margin status, etc.) and PSA history. From your question on PSA, I assume it is rising but not yet at 0.2, which, to answer you question, is the lowest level at which consideration of salvage radiation is recommended according to the latest joint guidance from the American Urological Association and the American Society for Radiation Oncology (see http://www.auanet.org/common/pdf/edu...statectomy.pdf). And if the only indication of potential recurrence is a modest PSA rise after 22 long years, there are other possible explanations for PSA rising besides cancer recurrence, so don't panic!

The following papers talk about the concept of insignificant biochemical recurrence (iBCR) potentially due to bits of benign prostate tissue: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23706588 http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19406457 I have the first one (Donin et. al.) and can email to you if you like but here is an excerpt: \"A PSA >0.2 ng/mL may develop because of local, lymphatic, or systemic recurrent prostate cancer or may be because of the presence of residual benign prostate tissue. Differentiating between these etiologies in the early stages of recurrence is not possible using presently available diagnostic technology. We have previously reported that microscopic benign prostate tissue is often identified at the apical and bladder neck soft tissue margins during RP and speculated that these benign glands may contribute to measureable PSA associated with prolonged PSA doubling time (PSADT). We have previously reported that a postprostatectomy PSA >0.2 ng/mL in association with a PSADT >36 months is attributable to residual benign microscopic prostatic elements. Men fulfilling these criteria in the present study were classified as exhibiting iBCR likely because of benign prostatic tissue and therefore none of these men were offered salvage radiation therapy (SRT).\"",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by 35coupe I've read this term (1/1000) before. What does 1/1000 mean. Does it mean with each core that is taken there is only a chance of hitting the cancer 1 in 1000. No, it doesn't work that way. The chance of hitting the cancer depends mostly on the percentage of prostate that contains cancer. For example, if the tumor is 10% of the prostate, then a single core has around 10% chance (actually a little more because the core has length vs being a single point) of hitting tumor or about a 90% chance of missing. But a 2nd core has another more-or-less independent 10% chance of hitting the cancer. For cancer involving 10% of the prostate the chances of all 12 cores missing tumor (false negative) would be 0.9 ^12 = 28% or about a 72% chance of finding it.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by Shenanigans Seen my surgeon Friday. I really like him. Had a 830 appointment and was there till almost 11. I had a lot of questions an he was very patient with me. I didn't realize how long I had been there and told him how sorry I was his reply was \" Don't worry about the time, this is about you.\" He gave me his cell number and said if I had any other questions to call him. LOL I had planned to have my surgery in three weeks. His schedule was full. Looked at me and said, \" How about this coming Wednesday. Took a couple of deep breaths and said yes. This Monday I will see the anesthesiologist to be cleared for surgery and If cleared then Wed. morning will have my surgery. Lots to do in a very short time. Belated welcome to the forum, Shenanigans. It sounds like you've found a very good surgeon at least in terms of compassion and accessibility. Mine was the same way and it is great. However, looking at your prior posts it appears you were just diagnosed on Oct 15 so I presume the biopsy was done only 2-3 weeks ago? If so, you really should be waiting another few week (maybe that's what you meant by originally wanting to have it done in about 3 weeks). You really want to wait at least 6 weeks, ideally 8 to let the inflammation from the biopsy subside. The inflammation you still have at this time can seriously compromise the nerve sparing (increasing risk of ED or positive margins) and/or resecting the prostate cleanly off the rectum without tearing the rectum or nicking the prostate capsule (which is thin as tissue paper) and leaving cancer behind. I believe you said you picked up Walsh's book, he does a good job explaining this (see pg 26. In general, but especially for you as a low risk GS6 there is no need to rush. If your surgeon is busy in 3-4 weeks, then put it off for 6 or 8 or 10 or 12 if necessary. As compassionate and accommodating as your surgeon appears to be, I'm sure he won't mind if you reconsider the timing (and if he does mind, that would be a red flag). BTW, did you ask him for his personal outcome statistics particularly positive margin rates for pT2 and pT3 cases?",

      "Content": "Today I am 10 weeks post-op and I wanted to give a breif update (for details of my surgery see my initial post here: http://www.cancerforums.net/threads/...015#post191015) In terms of continence, while there is still day-to-day variability, I am now down to a single pad most days (sometimes barely needed) and none at night. I leaked badly the first week and then had significant progress the next two weeks and then plateaued at 3-4 pads per day for the next several weeks. At the suggestion of my local uro I began biofeedback PT at six weeks and although I have not done many of the suggested exercises besides Kegals and stretching I had a burst of improvement the last couple weeks. I\u2019m not sure how much of this is attributable to the biofeedback, Kegals, walking, normal healing, or whatever, but in any event I\u2019m very pleased with how its progressed. On the potency front, I starting to see some partial but encouraging response at 6 weeks when I started 10mg Cialis q3d. I found things worked much better when standing or using a constriction ring. The response improved rapidly over the last couple weeks and this past weekend with 20mg Cialis and using a constriction band I had an excellent result and some great sex! So the nerves are suddenly really coming around. I'm sure my relative youth and good health have a lot to do with it, but I still think this rapid recovery is somewhat remarkable especially given that the nerve sparing on the right side was only partial due to the palpable tumor on that side. I have to think that the 300mg Irbesartan I am taking daily since my operation has played a significant role in this. For those who recently had or soon will be having RP, this is something to consider with seemingly very little downside:http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23030689 As upright posture / constriction ring have a marked effect, it seems that some venous leakage is part of the picture for me. From what I have read it sounds like venous leakage is a irreversible condition but one that would be unusual to manifest as a side effect of RP so soon post-op -- especially in patient having successful nerve sparing and doing rehab. So I am hoping it may be a relatively slight condition that actually existed pre-operatively and that will not be sufficient to cause problems once the nerves and blood supply fully recover. My surgeon says this venous leakage is does not portend negatively for me and he expects a return to my preoperative performance over the long term.",
