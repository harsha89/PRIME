Had brachytherapy in Jan 2012, with PSA of 4.01. The concerning thing is that my liver enzymes were elevated, and the Dr wants me to see a hematologist. I was thinking after hanging up with the Doc, that the nurse never asked me about my current medications. Since my last physical, I've been taking daily Rapaflo 8mg for urinary issues. I've read that it can in rare instances causes elevated levels. The 2nd think is that I had a margarita the night before my tests. I didn't think anything about since I was told not to eat or drink anything after midnight. I've also read that alcohol takes about 24 hours to process through the body. Anyone else have any thoughts on whether these might be the culprits ? thanks",

I originally thought I would go the DaVinci prostatectomy, and then started looking favorably toward brachytherapy (seeds). I was back and forth several times, before deciding on brachy. I had also considered using Dattoli, and contacted them. They were very informative, and spent quite a bit of time on the phone with me , and answering emails with questions as they came up. I was advised that my insurance would cover it, but it would be considered \"out of network\". Ultimately, I decided to go with a radiation oncologist locally that had very good success rates and a great reputation. I decided against the travel, which would have been quite lengthy for me. My implant was done almost 2 years ago, and my PSA is now down to .32 and my docs and I pretty happy with that. Very little in the way of side effects, too. I'm happy with my decision.",

      "Content": "Robert, Good luck on your brachy procedure. I had mine done on Jan 18, 2011 and had 87 Palladium 103 seeds inserted @ UTMC, in Knoxville, Tn. I was 45 at the time of treatment, rather young for a PCa diagnosis. I was a G7 (3+4), with 2 cores positive out of 16 with low volume in those 2 cores. My initial PSA was 3.7. Luckily, my urologist laid out all the treatment options on the table...but clearly preferred surgery. That was no surprise. However, after doing much research and talking with several people who had elected brachytherapy, I decided that was the treatment that I wanted to go with. I just didn't like the surgery option, and the side effects of E/D and possible incontinence. I was told that both would probably improve, but could not be guaranteed. The procedure itself was no big deal, was sent home with a variety of meds and a cathether for 2 days. As with most, was very glad to get the catheter out. Some mild soreness, but nothing major. As the radiation effects intensified, I had some urinary/bowel issues about 3/4 weeks out, and had to increase my FloMax dosage to 2 pills a day. At my 3 month checkup, PSA had fallen to 2.2, and the side effects were starting to diminish. I recently had my 6 month checkup, and PSA was down to 1.6 ! Definitely heading in the right direction. At this point, I have very little in the way of side effects to speak about. Looking toward my next appointment to see where PSA is at the 9 month mark. I'm glad I chose this treatment option, and hopefully it will be a long term success.",
