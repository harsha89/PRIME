      "Content": "Hello I'm new here. Last June (2017) my Dr ran a PSA test which came back as 4.4 He referred me to a urologist. He did an exam and said my prostate was a little enlarged and wanted to keep an eye on things. To get to the point, my last PSA test came back a 9.6 (September 2017) and I had a biopsy done which came back as a Gleason score of 6. My Dr talked with about different options available. I was inclined at first to do the active monitoring. After discussing with my family about what I was planning on doing, we all agreed that surgery would be a better choice due to the high percentage of the cancer being cured. I have been reading a lot about different opinions about what action to take. I believe I made the right choice to have surgery but still wonder if I have done the right thing. My surgery is scheduled in April, so I still have a few weeks to change my mind. Any advise would be greatly appreciated.",

      "Content": "Thank you for all the advice. I'm 63 yo, generally in good health and was diagnosed with PC 9/12/17. The findings were: 12 cores were taken, 6 left and 6 right. L1 3+3=6, L2 3+3=6 and R6 3+3=6. All 3 that came back positive had 10% tumor involvement My PSA reading were:12/16 6.3, 3/17 7.3, 6/17 8.1 and 9/17 9.6. All my health care is provided by the VA. The VA have referred me to Eastern Maine Medical Center Urologic Surgery of Maine here in Bangor, ME. The doctor that will perform the surgery has had very successful results and specializes in treating PCa, so I'm very comfortable with his skills. After many long hours of research and discussions with my family, I decided to have radical prostatectomy as we all felt this treatment had a very high chance of curing me of cancer. I felt that if I waited and monitored, the likelihood of the cancer could spread in 10-15 years. I don't want to be in my 70's and fighting cancer. Again thank you for all the advice and I'll keep everyone up to date as things move along.",
