      "Content": "My husband is 44 years old. He had a da Vinci prostatectomy on Nov. 15. He had a psa of 11.3 prior to surgery. His Gleason score is 7 (3+4), Involving 20% of prostate. CT and bone scan prior to surgery indicated no metastatic disease. However, path report now shows left peripheral margin is involved and 1 of 9 lymph nodes is positive for carcinoma (doctor says it is microscopic). Seminal vesicles, bladder margin,and right peripheral margin are all negative. Doctor has recommended whole pelvic radiation beginning in 4 months. He will retest psa in 3 months (1 month before radiation) and if still high will also use ADT intermittently. So, my research so far indicates that because this is in his nodes, he will not be cured, but can be treated. Lots of \"poor prognosis\" language, but yet before today I thought we would get past this and be able to move forward - we had a pretty positive outlook. Tonight we don't feel so positive, but we are still trying to digest this news. We are also just confused and scared. Thanks for any thoughts you have.",

      "Content": "Thank you all for responding. Our surgeon is an experienced Urologic Oncologist. We took everyone's advice before surgery that the surgeon/oncologist was as important, if not more so, than the treatment chosen. I can't find the post-op PSA on the path report but will ask at our follow up appointment.",
