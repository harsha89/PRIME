That a lot\u2026 Were your instructed to take NSAID\u2019s to help with the inflammation? My urologist is a surgeon. He is the one that told me about the inflammation and the problems that sometimes occurs separating the nerve bundle from the prostrate. I will just have to wait until I hear from Dr Patel about the suspicious ECE finding as well as the inflammation. Mikla, May I ask why you choose Dr. Tewari over Dr. Patel if you are some much closer? I\u2019m not looking forward to the drive home of two hours after surgery.",

      "Content": "Thanks for the welcome Highlander. I just received my results from NIH this morning. The Biopsy 18 cores 12 cores on Right side where the MRI showed the lesions 6 cores on Left The 12 cores on Right all Gleason 7 4+3 from 40 to 95% involvement. 6 core on the left all benign. MRI Impression: There is a lesion in the right apical-base peripheral zone, which is positive on the T2W MRI, ADC maps of DW MRI, DCE MRI, making it highly likely for prostate cancer. This lesion has capsular irregularity, broad capsular base, which can be suspicious for an ECE. CT and wholebody Nuclear scans negative.",

      "Content": "I meet with a second surgeon yesterday about having an RALP. When I told him I had a 30 core fusion biopsy at NIH last month he said that having saturation biopsy\u0092s causes more stress on the gland and increases inflammation. The increased inflammation then cause the nerve bundles to bond with the prostate more, making separation more difficult with the need to sometimes cut some of the nerves. The surgeon suggested waiting at least 10 weeks before having surgery and take a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) like Motrin 4 times a day for a few weeks. Has anyone had surgery after a saturation biopsy, if so what was your experience and what were you told by the Surgeon? On a second Note: I had a TRUS at the doctors office. 3 cores came back positive 3+3 3+3 3+4 The cores were reread at NIH and came back all 3+3\u0092s Second opinions do count\u0085 So do Fusion Biopsy\u0092s I had a 3T MRI with a rectum coil and a Fusion Biopsy 3 months after my first. The MRI showed 3 spots they wanted to target during the Fusion Biopsy plus the standard 12 cores. My latest results came back with a 4+3 on one of the cores. I haven\u0092t receive my copy of the report yet so I don\u0092t know all the details of the report. There is a lot of research showing that the TRUS biopsy results are not that accurate and in my case that sure was true.",

      "Content": "Thanks for the reply's guys. After my first biopsy and the Gleason 7 (3+4) results. I went to see Dr Patel at Florida Hospital in Celebration. I live about 2 hours away. At that time I told him I wanted to wait until I had a chance to be evaluated by NIH. After my new fusion biopsy and the different result from the first one, He and his team wanted a copy of all my current test results as well as the MRI images. Now I'm just waiting until my file is reviewed. I was told he may want to wait 10 weeks or he may want to do surgery ASAP. It depends on his reading of the results. Dr Patel and his team have now done over 7000 of these Prostatectomy's, So, I'll do as he suggests. While I'm waiting I plan on getting some opinions on Radiation Treatments as an option.",
