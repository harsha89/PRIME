      "Content": "Am interested in getting some specific information on whether I am a candidate for focal therapy (laser ablation of a lesion on my prostate). PIRADS 5, Lesion 16x7mm, possibly peri-neural invasion, no evidence of departure from prostate (negative CT-Scan and negative bone scan). Biopsy results confirm presence of Ca, Gleason 7 (3+4, 10%). Not clear to me if presence of peri-neural invasion affects my ability to resort to focal therapy. Any comments?",
