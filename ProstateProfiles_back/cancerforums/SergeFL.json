Decision making is very hard due to so much information available. \"Fortunately\" for me my dad went through treatment (BT/ER/HT) 8 years ago and shared his personal experience, including emotional part of PC diagnose. I believe it is very important to find someone you really trust and not just pushing its own agenda, business or bias point of view. Then study and get as much info from books, forums and support groups because every bit of information you get during learning curve will help you in the end to make best educated choice for treatment, recovery and future life.",

      "Content": "Thank you for all replies and valuable inputs. Based on biopsy results and Polaris report I am qualified for active surveillance. However, I have number of concerns before choosing AS for now: First, as you may know random TRUS biopsy is only 30% accurate and will miss 70% of cancers. To combat this uncertainty I plan on doing 3t MRI in June plus another PCA and Free PCA testing to have better understanding where I stand. Once I have this information my next step, if I have additional areas of concern, is to do MRI-Fusing biopsy for 20 cores. It is still 80% accurate, but it is better then 30% of random biopsy. As my urologist mentioned the only reason why he found cancer, because he aimed in the area of firmness discovered during DRE. Second, the location of tumor and how close it is to prostate wall. The urologist told me that he can not say where exactly the tumor is. What worries me is the procentage of core with cancer (8%). If the tumor is really small how he can fill it during DRE unless it is very close or touching the prostate wall. The other possibility if biopsy sampled the side of tumor and the actual tumor is much higher volume but deeper in prostate. If tumor is deeper in prostate then AS is very good option for now. However, if it is \"touching\" prostate wall then it is completely different situation and it moves me to intermediate risk group (regardless of low Gleason score) that require treatment withing one year period. This is the reason why I am trying to get information about best treatment options, as well AS. I met two radiation oncologists. Both offer IGRT. One RO uses KV CBCT (without fiducial markers). This is the same clinic that treated my father. And other RO uses IGRT but with fiducial markers. Not sure what guide system they use. Surgery is concern to me because of tumor location: Left Medial Apex. As I learned from one of the book I read, this specific area has higher possibility of leaving positive margin due to close proximity to urethra. I will consider all these treatment options once I have better understanding of current state of cancer. Right now I am looking toward AS.",

      "Content": "I am wondering if someone had any experience with this type of treatment? https://www.floridahospitalcancer.com/radiation-campaign Urologic Cancer MRI-guided Nerve-sparing HDR Brachytherapy MRI-guided nerve-sparing HDR brachytherapy is used for a wide range of prostate-cancer stages. It is a minimally invasive outpatient procedure where catheters are temporarily placed into the patient\u0092s prostate. Radiation is then delivered internally through catheters. The treatment significantly limits radiation to the bladder or rectum beyond what is achievable with other external radiation treatments. After completion of treatment, the catheters are removed. Patients go home the same day. MRI-guided focal HDR Brachytherapy Prostate cancer will recur for approximately 20-30 percent of patients that have received radiation therapy. To combat this, Florida Hospital offers MRI-guided focal HDR brachytherapy. This treatment is a minimally invasive outpatient procedure that focuses treatment on the tumor while sparing the surrounding organs and reduces the risk of side effects. Florida Hospital is the only hospital in the state that offers this life-saving treatment. SpaceOAR SpaceOAR is a temporary, injectable non-toxic biodegradable gel that protects the rectum during radiation treatment for prostate cancer. The gel is placed prior to starting radiation treatment and significantly reduces the radiation dose to the rectum. The body naturally absorbs it over several weeks after completion of treatment. SpaceOAR is the first and only prostate-cancer spacing device to receive clearance from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). No other rectum-sparing hydrogels are currently available in the United States.",

It is a minimally invasive outpatient procedure where catheters are temporarily placed into the patient\u0092s prostate. Radiation is then delivered internally through catheters. The treatment significantly limits radiation to the bladder or rectum beyond what is achievable with other external radiation treatments. After completion of treatment, the catheters are removed. Patients go home the same day. MRI-guided focal HDR Brachytherapy Prostate cancer will recur for approximately 20-30 percent of patients that have received radiation therapy. To combat this, Florida Hospital offers MRI-guided focal HDR brachytherapy.
