      "Content": "In the summer of 2010, on the advice of a urologist in Ohio (where I was then living) I took external beam radiation therapy, without a prostatectomy, for Gleason # 7 (3+4) prostate cancer. From the fall of 2010 to January 2013 my PSA score has gone from .02 to .9, though I am otherwise symptom-free. I have moved to New York State. My urologist here has ordered a bone scan, abdominal scan, cystoscopy and prostate biopsy within the last two months, none of which find detectable cancer. The New York State urologist interprets all of this to mean that the 2010 radiation probably destroyed the cancer in the prostate but that some of the cancer had already escaped the prostate and I now have sub-microscopic cancer in my body. He says that although there is no scientific proof that starting hormone therapy immediately would extend my life, the consensus of \"expert opinion\" is that it is better to start immediately, which is his recommendation. For a second opinion I went to the Cleveland Clinic where I saw a medical oncologist and a urologist specializing in robotic-assisted surgery. These two doctors essentially agreed with one another in disagreeing with the New York State doctor. They said that it is still possible that the PSA is rise is being caused by something other than cancer, that my PSA might still \"bounce\" down, that if I do have cancer it might still be in the prostate, and that even if I do have cancer that has spread because there is no evidence that starting hormone therapy earlier leads to longer survival and because the therapy has such bad addition effects, it would not be a good idea to start the therapy now. They advise frequent PSA testing and perhaps an MRI (as opposed to the cat scan I just had) if the PSA goes over 1.5. I am not sure how to choose between two sets of such conflicting advice. Of course I would be happier if the Cleveland advice is correct, but I am looking for what's correct, not what makes me happy right now. Are there any good suggestions out there? Thanks. Bob46",
