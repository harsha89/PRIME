Even if this one were to purchase a robot, they would be far, far beneath the learning curve. A surgeon must perform a minimum of 300 operations to be fully competent with \"Mr. da Vinci.\" I would guess the same would apply to laproscopic surgery. Yes, travel to a facility with a robot is an option. They have lots of experience here with the laproscopic surgery. If a truly open surgery is not being considered, I'd kind of tend to prefer the robot to a laproscopic device. Can you point me to any evidence backing up your preference? A place like Mayo Clinic, Johns Hopkins, Anderson, etc., would be the place to go. Not a practical option as I am in Canada and our insurance won't cover US hospitals unless treatment is unavailable here.

Not sure about the EBR but in the case of brachytherapy one thing you have to be careful about is the nearby rectal tissue. Even if you don't experience any rectal bleeding, that tissue is still damaged. If they do a colonoscopy later on, they must not take any samples from that area because it won't heal properly.",

      "Content": "Thanks for the quick reply! The centre in Vancouver where I would get the brachytherapy done has 20 years of data for low risk patients and 10 years on medium risk patients like me, the overall outcome is very similar to surgery according to what I've been told by the local urology clinic. My major concerns (if I understand things correctly) are that surgery has more options to go if cancer recurs and also has the ability to physically analyze the prostate and have a look-see internally. The reduced risks for everything else with the brachytherapy are very attractive though.",

      "Content": "Thanks again for the replies. Chuck, I thought 35 cc was the top end of the normal range for a man my age, or at least that's what I recall being told. At any rate, 42 is well within the limits for brachy. If the BPH is from the cancer, won't it stop growing once the cancer gets nuked? I'm getting lots of info, processing is another matter. Initial info dump here is handled through a \"Nurse Navigator\", whose job is to provide guidance and help throughout the process. I've of course been doing my own research, part of which involves getting in a dialog here. Discussing this with you guys I hope will help the process. As far as docs, my guy is the head of Urology for the local health region. He is widely respected. So far I only had a brief meeting with him before the biopsy but I liked him a lot.

One of three other docs in his group that specialize in prostate surgery would do the honours if I chose that route. Brachytherapy would be done as I said before at the Vancouver Prostate Centre which is well-respected and has published some of the most detailed results on the procedures due to extensive data collection there. Not sure I have so much leeway in interviewing and choosing docs as you do in the US.",

      "Content": "Thanks again for the replies. Chuck, I thought 35 cc was the top end of the normal range for a man my age, or at least that's what I recall being told. At any rate, 42 is well within the limits for brachy. If the BPH is from the cancer, won't it stop growing once the cancer gets nuked? I'm getting lots of info, processing is another matter. Initial info dump here is handled through a \"Nurse Navigator\", whose job is to provide guidance and help throughout the process. I've of course been doing my own research, part of which involves getting in a dialog here. Discussing this with you guys I hope will help the process. As far as docs, my guy is the head of Urology for the local health region. He is widely respected. So far I only had a brief meeting with him before the biopsy but I liked him a lot. I have another meeting with him tomorrow. However, he wouldn't do either the surgery or the brachytherapy.

      "Content": "Thanks for the quick reply! The centre in Vancouver where I would get the brachytherapy done has 20 years of data for low risk patients and 10 years on medium risk patients like me, the overall outcome is very similar to surgery according to what I've been told by the local urology clinic. My major concerns (if I understand things correctly) are that surgery has more options to go if cancer recurs and also has the ability to physically analyze the prostate and have a look-see internally. The reduced risks for everything else with the brachytherapy are very attractive though.",

      "Content": "Hi, just signed up. I was recently diagnosed and am trying to decide between brachytherapy and surgery. I've been told I'm a good candidate for either but I'm leaning towards the radiation. FWIW I'm 52. Had three PSA tests in 2 months ranging from 5.8 to 7.4. Gleason score was 6 in three sites on the right side, 3+4 in two sites on the left, clear at the left apex. Clinical stage is T1c, prostate size is around 42 cc. Ultra-sound showed nothing abnormal other than the enlarged gland. I'm urinating a little slower than I did when I was younger but no serious trouble. I'm otherwise healthy, fit and very active in a variety of sports. Happily married with grown kids. Kind of confused by what I'm reading here - is surgery generally preferred if you are younger? I'm guessing with the Gleason 7 on the left side the best I could hope for is single nerve sparing, correct? Anyone have any advice on which way I should go? I was looking for some sort of decision-aiding tool online but it's all pretty fuzzy. The engineer in me is looking for a straightforward answer I'm not likely to get but I still have to ask.",

As Jim said, you should be getting a DRE as part of your general checkups along with the PSA. I understand your feelings on history - my grandfather, father and all three uncles on that side have had this disease, and now it's my turn. My GP didn't send me to a urologist until my PSA went over 4. We caught it early enough but to be frank it could have been earlier. Some proactive behaviour on your part is not unwarranted.",

      "Content": "When they measure by ultrasound, it is volume in cc (cubic centimetre). There is no way to directly measure the weight during the biopsy AFAIK. The Mayo says 1 cc = 1 g, so prostate tissue has a specific density close to 1 (weighs the same as water for a given volume). I was told the normal range goes up to 35 cc. It is common for the prostate to become enlarged as you age. At 57 cc you are not huge but it may limit your options somewhat. That is around the limit for brachytherapy, so if you opt for that treatment you may be asked to undergo a few months of hormone therapy to shrink it. I don't think that size matters for surgery.",

On the off chance you're not, I'm told by my oncologist that being in shape is the #1 thing you can do to lower your risk of cancer, in fact some 50% lower. It is also the best thing to lower your risk of many other diseases. Should you still contract something nasty, being fit gives you your best chance of surviving surgery or other treatments. Plus, I just enjoy being active. I'm a multi-sport rec athlete and I love it.",

In addition I read the posts and learn a lot and am inspired by the courage I find here from other going through the same thing. I hope that you get good news from the bone scan and understand your frustration with the notifications. If the news is bad, then my understanding is the same as the info you already have - there is not much point in risking surgery to remove the prostate when the disease has already spread. They would move to a different treatment regimen in that case. However, you can get a second opinion on this, even in Canada.",

Also, however, be advised that the side effects are there for BOTH types of treatment. Incontinence and ED can be a major problem immediately after the surgery, but tend to get much better as time goes on. Conversely, these side effects also can happen with EBR (not sure about brachy), but at a later time. In addition, I've seen bowel movement problems also listed as a SE with EBR whereas it is almost never a problem after surgery. Incontinence is almost never an issue with brachytherapy (< 1%), in fact it is the opposite problem. The prostate swells from the radiation and restricts flow. Most patients (90%) recover to baseline (ie, peeing as good as they did before) within a year. I have been quite fortunate in that regard, the symptoms have been there but very manageable so far nearly 3 weeks out from the procedure. As this time is supposed to be close to the peak for these symptoms, I am quite confident I will be in that 90%. Frankly I could even live with it as is, it's a little inconvenient but not a huge deal. I don't even wake up in the night to pee. ED for radiation happens down the line, not immediately. For men of Kens' age assuming no current problems, the odds of ED from brachytherapy 5 years out is around 15%, and the odds of ED just from the normal aging process is also around 15% for a total of 30. These are better odds than surgery. For men with low or low-intermediate risk cancer such as Kens or myself, the odds of a \"chemical cure\" (PSA goes to near 0 and never rises again) is around 90% and the odds of a practical cure (PSA rises a little bit but no further treatment warranted) is 94-96%.

      "Content": "As jnight said, they should do a second PSA test just to make sure before doing a biopsy. Even if there is cancer, it is very unlikely to have progressed to the point where there are physical symptoms with a PSA under 10, the night sweats are unlikely to be associated with prostate cancer. The frequent urination is probably due to the enlarged prostate. My understanding is that an enlarged prostate is not a symptom of cancer although it is possible to have cancer at the same time as an enlarged prostate. See here for more info. I understand that the wait for a biopsy is frustrating, however it is most probably not that urgent. The progression of PC in most men is very slow, you have time to get these tests done and in the case that it is cancer, you will likely have time to do research and consider treatment options carefully. Take all this advice with a grain of salt, I am not a doctor. I don't even play one on TV. However, I was in a similar situation to your husband with an enlarged prostate and PSA around 7. In my case it turned out to be cancer but it may well not be in his.",

      "Content": "As jnight said, they should do a second PSA test just to make sure before doing a biopsy. Even if there is cancer, it is very unlikely to have progressed to the point where there are physical symptoms with a PSA under 10, the night sweats are unlikely to be associated with prostate cancer. The frequent urination is probably due to the enlarged prostate. My understanding is that an enlarged prostate is not a symptom of cancer although it is possible to have cancer at the same time as an enlarged prostate. See here for more info. I understand that the wait for a biopsy is frustrating, however it is most probably not that urgent. The progression of PC in most men is very slow, you have time to get these tests done and in the case that it is cancer, you will likely have time to do research and consider treatment options carefully. Take all this advice with a grain of salt, I am not a doctor. I don't even play one on TV. However, I was in a similar situation to your husband with an enlarged prostate and PSA around 7. In my case it turned out to be cancer but it may well not be in his.",

      "Content": "Hormone therapy in conjunction with brachytherapy is usually done in order to reduce the size of the prostate. Depending on the facility they can do brachytherapy without hormone therapy with a prostate size as big as 60 cc but they prefer it to be under 50 cc. The doctors should have a good idea of the size of your prostate from the ultrasound that is done in conjunction with the biopsy. If you are a candidate for brachy, the radiation oncologist will do another ultrasound for the purposes of planning the seed implants, and at that time they will make the final decision about go/no go based on prostate size and I'm sure other factors. There is a difference in the way they measure between the two ultrasounds. AFAIK brachytherapy is a good fit for candidates with low or low-intermediate risk cancer. Low means all 3 of the main indicators are low, ie your PSA is under 10, your Gleason is 6, your stage is T1. If one of those three is at the next level you may still be a candidate, for example I was Gleason 7 (3+4) and still OK with PSA 7 and stage T1C (detected by biopsy). I am not sure about the HDR brachytherapy Walnut mentioned, where high-dose seeds are inserted and then removed. My doctors never brought up the issue, and I was very confident with the LDR brachytherapy offered at BCCA in Vancouver so I did not push it. I'm not sure it is recommended for everyone, I would have to do more research.",

      "Content": "Like you, I had a recommendation from my urologist which I appreciated. We are very similar people - younger (50s) and still very active in sports. He said if it were him, he'd choose brachytherapy partly because of the incontinence issues with surgery which are difficult to deal with in high impact sports like running. I then had a doctor friend of mine do a little research for me and he made the same recommendation. He said that it was clear that the results for brachytherapy are getting better and better over the years, so it is important to look at newer data. My own research supported this, some of the internet searches came up with stuff from the 90s or early 2000s which heavily leaned towards surgery, but if you look at data in the last 10 years or so brachytherapy looks like a very solid option. I would be concerned about the doctor saying that surgery is an option after brachytherapy. My understanding is that it is much riskier than surgery without radiation and not often done. I made my choice on the assumption that it would not be a likely salvage option.",

The main side effects have to do with erectile disfunction and urination. If you elect surgery, you will lose the ability to have an erection immediately. It may come back over some time. The overall odds are about 50%. If you can have nerve-sparing surgery the odds go up. A skilled experienced surgeon increases your odds. Even if regained, there is a good chance it won't be the same. With surgery, you will be incontinent for some time. Most men recover within a year but some have continued problems. If you elect radiation, you may lose erections over time. Odds of this happening in the first 5 years is around 30%. With radiation incontinence is not the issue but rather blockage. Most men recover within a year but there are a few months of peeing poorly, waking up in the night. There is a lot of variation in side effects. There are a lot of confusing stats around.

      "Content": "From my Movember news feed: Mo Bros and Mo Sistas, your funds have directly led to a prostate cancer research breakthrough. Showing the significant impact Movember donations are having on the lives of men. Because of the Mo community we are changing the face of men\u0092s health. The Movember Foundation is proud to report that the findings from this funded research project will have considerable implications for men around the world navigating through their prostate cancer treatment journey. This research, lead by Professor Robert Bristow of the Princess Margaret Cancer Centre in Toronto, has discovered that men have a genetic \u0093fingerprint\u0094 within their cancer cells that will basically tell them whether or not the cells have escaped the prostate gland. This means that patients who have aggressive prostate cancer have a unique genetic fingerprint, and knowing this will now allow doctors to build a more tailored treatment plan for men with prostate cancer, and intensify therapy for those who need it. This personalised medicine approach will improve cure rates in patients with aggressive prostate cancer but also allow doctors to not over treat patients who do not have aggressive prostate cancer. Canadian researchers will work with other countries to validate the test over the next two to three years in a larger, more diverse group of patients to ensure it will successfully work in hospitals worldwide. If validated, this new test for prostate cancer can be turned around in three days and will inform doctors which patients will need more or less invasive treatments. This research proves the considerable impact that Movember funds are having, the results of which are benefitting hundreds of thousands of men and their families around the world.",

In addition, I've seen bowel movement problems also listed as a SE with EBR whereas it is almost never a problem after surgery.

For men of Kens' age assuming no current problems, the odds of ED from brachytherapy 5 years out is around 15%, and the odds of ED just from the normal aging process is also around 15% for a total of 30. These are better odds than surgery. For men with low or low-intermediate risk cancer such as Kens or myself, the odds of a \"chemical cure\" (PSA goes to near 0 and never rises again) is around 90% and the odds of a practical cure (PSA rises a little bit but no further treatment warranted) is 94-96%.

Also, however, be advised that the side effects are there for BOTH types of treatment. Incontinence and ED can be a major problem immediately after the surgery, but tend to get much better as time goes on. Conversely, these side effects also can happen with EBR (not sure about brachy), but at a later time. In addition, I've seen bowel movement problems also listed as a SE with EBR whereas it is almost never a problem after surgery. Incontinence is almost never an issue with brachytherapy (< 1%), in fact it is the opposite problem. The prostate swells from the radiation and restricts flow. Most patients (90%) recover to baseline (ie, peeing as good as they did before) within a year. I have been quite fortunate in that regard, the symptoms have been there but very manageable so far nearly 3 weeks out from the procedure. As this time is supposed to be close to the peak for these symptoms, I am quite confident I will be in that 90%. Frankly I could even live with it as is, it's a little inconvenient but not a huge deal. I don't even wake up in the night to pee. ED for radiation happens down the line, not immediately. For men of Kens' age assuming no current problems, the odds of ED from brachytherapy 5 years out is around 15%, and the odds of ED just from the normal aging process is also around 15% for a total of 30. These are better odds than surgery. For men with low or low-intermediate risk cancer such as Kens or myself, the odds of a \"chemical cure\" (PSA goes to near 0 and never rises again) is around 90% and the odds of a practical cure (PSA rises a little bit but no further treatment warranted) is 94-96%. These numbers are for 10 years out from treatment. The attraction to surgery is, as already mentioned, the option of radiation as salvage treatment and also the peace of mind knowing the thing is out and analyzed.",

You don't need to make a decision for months, if not longer. Of the various options Chuck mentioned, external beam radiation is pretty unlikely for you. Both my urologist and my radiation oncologist said they prefer brachytherapy unless there is a reason for EBR, which doesn't seem the case for you. Being that you are so young the doctors may advise treatment despite the low risk. But active surveilance is an option you should consider. If you opt for treatment, please take the time to consider both brachytherapy and surgery. They are both equally effective at curing the disease for patients in your situation, as I understand the current statistics. Of course talk to your doctors, we are all just amateurs here. Good luck, and take care!",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by Arthro92 If the uro didn't see any nodes and the prostate was small, with a 5.5 PSA that was only tested on July 9th, do you think that is a good sign that there's no PC? I don't think you can take that as a sign one way or the other. The latest PSA test I had before biopsy was 5.5, my prostate looked fine from the ultrasound although somewhat enlarged (42 cc), but there was still cancer. Unfortunately all you can do is wait for the results.",

      "Content": "All treatments do not have the same side effects. Some are similar but with different odds. Some are different. The main side effects have to do with erectile disfunction and urination. If you elect surgery, you will lose the ability to have an erection immediately. It may come back over some time. The overall odds are about 50%. If you can have nerve-sparing surgery the odds go up. A skilled experienced surgeon increases your odds. Even if regained, there is a good chance it won't be the same. With surgery, you will be incontinent for some time. Most men recover within a year but some have continued problems. If you elect radiation, you may lose erections over time. Odds of this happening in the first 5 years is around 30%. With radiation incontinence is not the issue but rather blockage. Most men recover within a year but there are a few months of peeing poorly, waking up in the night. There is a lot of variation in side effects. There are a lot of confusing stats around. Best to take your time and understand them before proceeding.",

      "Content": "Please be aware that with a Gleason 6 in only two cores, you should be in no rush at all to determine your course of treatment. Take your time, do your research. You don't need to make a decision for months, if not longer. Of the various options Chuck mentioned, external beam radiation is pretty unlikely for you. Both my urologist and my radiation oncologist said they prefer brachytherapy unless there is a reason for EBR, which doesn't seem the case for you. Being that you are so young the doctors may advise treatment despite the low risk. But active surveilance is an option you should consider. If you opt for treatment, please take the time to consider both brachytherapy and surgery. They are both equally effective at curing the disease for patients in your situation, as I understand the current statistics. Of course talk to your doctors, we are all just amateurs here. Good luck, and take care!",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by Michael F Brachytherapy: I've no experience in this area and refer you to other posts. Advantages appear to be: 1) Fairly minimally invasive 2) a fairly quick procedure, 3) fairly rapid physical recovery 4) Minimal risk of long term incontinence and/or ED Possible disadvantages may be: 1) The prostate is still intact. Even if brachytherapy knocks out the existing adenocarcinoma, can a new round of PC occur several years down the road? Is subsequent RP still an option in the event of recurrence? 2) List of \"precautions\" is somewhat alarming! What are the chances that it can cause new malignancies in the prostate or surrounding tissues? 3) Not sure of the 1/2 life of the radioisotope(s) used but sense that one is technically \"radioactive\" for a fairly long time. The OP seems to have a similar diagnosis to mine, I had Gleason 3+4 on one side of the prostate and 3+3 on the other with 5/6 sites positive. According to my various docs, the cure rate for surgery and brachy for me was pretty much identical at around 94-96%. Downsides to brachy are that you limit your choices for salvage treatments in that surgery to remove the prostate is very tricky. With surgery you can always radiate, but with radiation you (generally) can't add surgery later, although of course there are other options. There's also the mental side of things where many people just want the damn thing out of their bodies, or alternately feel uncomfortable with radiation. I don't mean to discount those feelings - as the docs say surgery/brachy is basically a coin toss for people with my diagnosis, those are as good reasons as any to decide. Upsides to brachy: 1. No issues with incontinence, or at least a very low chance (<1%). The flipside of that is that the prostate swells and restricts flow, treatable for most with FloMax and subsiding within 1 year for most (90%). 2. Less chance of ED. According to my docs, at the 5 year mark I have a 15% chance of ED due to brachy, and another 15% due to other factors, ie would have occurred anyway. This is versus a close to 100% chance of immediate ED after surgery, with a roughly 50% chance of recovery within 2 years. Now that 50% number varies a lot with person and the surgeon and all, but overall I believe your chances are better with brachy. 3. Minimally invasive and less risky surgery. In and out of hospital in 6 hours, only 45 minutes of that on the table. Walking same day. Continent same day. Could have gone to work the next day except it was the weekend, so back to work 3 days later. Perineum was a little tender, but not so much that I couldn't sit. No bicycle rides for a month or so. I was back to running and having sex within 2 weeks. The seeds used have a very short half-life. You have to avoid extended contact with small children or pregnant women for the first 3-4 months (hugs ok, lap sits no). After 1 year you are minimally radioactive, after 2 years you are clean for all intents and purposes.",
