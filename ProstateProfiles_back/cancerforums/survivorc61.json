      "Content": "Hello all, Although perhaps many of you have had these post-op, these is for those with upcoming surgery to make your life just a little easier dealing with that catheter. If you google the name you will find it for sale on a lot of websites for about $10. It's a sticky patch that is stuck to your upper thigh after surgery. The catheter is inserted into it and it's held stable. So any pull is going to be on the patch and not your penis (ouch). It also swivels so depending how you are sitting/lying it will direct the catheter in the right direction. It is waterproof and only comes off with alcohol upon catheter removal. Why not ask your doc if he uses it. If not ask him if he will and buy one. Or put it on after you get home to make your life easier. I had my foley in for 12 days. This little patchAttachment 869 made a big difference.",
