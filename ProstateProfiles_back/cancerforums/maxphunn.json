One was the Patient Controlled Analgesia (PCA) pump, the other was Spinal Anesthesia. They were both explained to me and I was given a small pamphlet on each. I was also told that they would ask me what I wanted on the day of the operation. I have read some pros and cons for each, but I don't care for the idea of something else hanging from me (PCA) after the operation. Nor do I like the idea of a needle in the spine.

With the positive margins and high PSA, I was expecting SRT or HT plus SRT was in my future.

Fortunately your lymph nodes and seminal vesicles were apparently not involved. I don't know how that actually causes your body to produce the PSA, but apparently it does. Here is a good article on extraprostatic extension http://www.harvardprostateknowledge....-prostatectomy ... The author states that 10-20% of RP patients have positive margins. I think you're handling it pretty well. You knew there would be radiation afterwards, and this is why. Similar situation for me. I too see my RO next week, and I have been afraid that my PSA might start to climb but have been lucky so far. You will pull thru this just fine. There are a few of us T3 guys here and they're all still posting. Keep your spirits up and remember that none of this is abnormal. If anything, the fact that your PSA has already begun to rise will likely mean that you will probably need to begin radiation sooner rather than later. Good luck!",

He suggested I start thinking about radiation treatments, adjuvant or salvage. He said it is too early to decide, but I should start my research. My first post op PSA test will be in about 6 weeks from now (about 9 weeks post op). So I would like to hear from others that have faced this decision and learn from them about their choice and expieriences. Many thanks to the members that take the time to post all the helpful info on this forum. It is much appreciated.",
