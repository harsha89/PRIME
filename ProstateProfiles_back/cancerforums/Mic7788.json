      "Content": "Hi, I am age 41 and dad with PC. I had a PSA level of 7.5 back in 2015 and with a Kidney stone during a health check. Urologist treated the stone and was removed in March 2016 I had another health screening in Nov 2016 and the PSA was 5.2. A follow up review on April 2017 with my urologist on my stone and I told my urologist that my PSA is at 5.2. She suggested to run a PSA again and the result was 6.4 and fPSA ratio was 0.07 and suggested me to go for MRI and a biopsy. I decided to go with that as I read most you will opt for biopsy for PC. I hope to be on the right path.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by MichiganMan16 Mic. Yes, you are on the correct path. Your PSA is high for your age. Bit of a concern there. Did your urologist treat you with any anti-biotics to rule out infections? Also your free PSA number would indicate further investigation is necessary. Sounds like u have a urologist who is paying attention. Keep us posted, we are here to help. Good luck, MM MM, I wasn't given any anti-botics.",

      "Content": "Hi MF, I had DRE with 4 GP including my Uro and all negative however I remember one GP mentioned prostate is slightly big. The URO focus the Kidney stone back in 2015. I guess she is not so concern about the PSA initially because of my age? Only is when I told her PSA remain at 5.2 and she then looked into it. Btw how accurate is this fPSA?",
