      "Content": "I ve gotten screened over the last few years and everything was fine.I ve developed urinary symptoms over the past year and last year had blood in my semen that went away so i didnt think much about it since my DRE/psa test were normal the previous 3 years.Now every since my exam ive had pain in that area between my anus n scrutum with an increase in symptoms, im hoping its psychosomatic. Im scheduled to see a urologist may 8.Dr google claims that its a 50% chance that its cancer.Has anyone had the new biomarker test using urine before getting a biopsy.or mri any suggestions on my approach or just follow dr. s protocol. im worried stiff that i ve had for 2 or 3 years and it just wasnt showing up on screening.",

      "Content": "Hey chuck thx for the reply........im 54 yrs old,,,,,2016 was .7 2018 2.0 2019 .8....used a different lab in 2017 so i dont have that year for my psa reading....My gp felt the nodule but said my prostate didnt feel enlarged........I was hoping that some kind of infection might have been the cause...but my urine was clear......im concerned that i ignored my urine issues increase in frequency,slight burn on occasion,blood in semen that went away slight dribbling,and now ever since my DRE i ve had pain in my area between my anus and scrotum.......feels like i need to pee all the time.....and now ive got an aggressive form of it that was missed up until this year........surely i couldnt be that unlucky...If by chance i ve had it for 3 years could it be in my pelvic bones and hip...my hip joints have been sore but i figured it was just getting older........",
