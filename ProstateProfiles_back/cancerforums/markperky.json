      "Content": "Hi guys and girls Sorry not been on for a while. My wife Tracey has been given the all clear with her breast cancer. Unfortunately I went to The Christie cancer hospital in Manchester to see my doctor and have been given the news that my cancer is back, very aggressive and have been told I will be lucky to stay alive for 6 years. I start chemotherapy in 10 weeks time. I am having hormone therapy also. The cancer is in my lymph nodes and showing on scans. Not in my bones yet! I am gutted but positive. My first thought is to prove the medical people wrong. I think I might have been a bit foolish thinking that the operation would cure me., but as my doctor said with a Gleeson 9 there was a good chance the cancer would return, but he did not think it would return this quick. So here I am at 12.20 am UK time listening to Bruce Springsteen and chilling, worrying and doing all the things I should not. At the end of the day when I am on my own I can't stop thinking about what I have been told. I am tearful and scared as I want to see my 2 boys have families but I am also a realist. I don't know what else to write.",

      "Content": "Hi guys I went to see my surgeon yesterday for an update after my RP removal. It turns out my Gleeson score from the biopsies went up to 9/10 . The cancer was in all my prostate not half. The cancer was also in my nymph glands. No cancer was outside and they are confident they got it all. I will be having a PSA test in 3 months time. My McMillan nurse has told me the cancer will come back but when nobody knows. When this happens I will be put on hormone treatment and possibly more. Bit of a shock but life goes on. I hope all my friends on here are well and I will post again soon. Mark",

I was diagnosed June 26th 2015 and my life has been turned upside down in a few weeks. I was due for open surgery yesterday 18th August 2015 but this was cancelled last Friday due to my Diabetes sugars being too high.

As you can tell I am not the luckiest person (Ha Ha) I am just after a bit of advise as to how long is the recovery period after Radical surgery? This is my first operation ever and I am nervous as you can probably tell. Any help would be gladly received. Thank you Mark",

      "Content": "Hi everybody After getting good advise on this forum I insisted on a PSA test after 5 weeks post op and the reading was 0.2. I went to see my GP and he told me he wants me to have another 1st December 2015 I still have a bit of incontinence but that is going slowly. I forgot in my original post that they also removed my nerve sacks. Sounds weird but this has affected me a bit mentally as I cannot get an erection at all at 54 years old. I also find it hard to talk to my medical team about it and if it will come back on its own or with pills etc. I would be grateful if someone can advise me on this delicate subject. Mark",
