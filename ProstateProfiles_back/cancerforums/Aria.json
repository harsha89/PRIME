      "Content": "Originally Posted by Alex prostate cancer Hi all, just wanted to know if anyone else suffers with back pain? I always suffer with this prior and since diagnosis (in 2011) at the moment orignal PSA 900 now 32. Had another MRI but not had results yet. The oncologist examined me last week and thinks that it is no more that Muscular. My husband had bad back pain but his urologist prescribed 5 mg cialis for urinary problems. That seemed to have eased his back pain.",

      "Content": "My husband was just diagnosed with prostate cancer . I'm not familiar with all the terms as yet but I will tell you what I know. He is 40 and and has some urinary and Ed problems. Slighty overweight but already working on that and close to target. The primary care doctor found his psa to be elevated to 4.5. Testosterone levels were very low which are keeping him exhausted. He was referred to a urologist for a dre another psa and a 12 core biopsy. (the urologist prescribed cialis which helped his bph symptoms) Insurance nightmare....shudder. (side question has anyone used alldaypharmacy.com to purchase generic Cialis in the USA?) The second psa was slightly lower but the biopsy came back with 5 of the 12 cores showing adenocarcinoma ranging from 6% in one core to 100% in another. His Gleason score in all the positive cores was 3+3(6). The urologist did not state he felt a tumor and he scribbled t1c stage II on the partial biopsy report. He had first written t2 but scratched it out. The primary care doctor said he had written t2a on the copy sent to his office. Prior to receiving any test results being returned my husband had already decided he had pc and wanted it out via da-Vinci . No MRI offered or any other tests that would ease our minds. I just feel something isn't right. Long story short this is a nightmare. 40 is young and I know all the potential side effects were not explained. We have another appt next week to talk with this urologist but we have already scheduled a second opinion as well as the first surgical consult. Is there really such a rush? Are there any conditions that can mimic cancer cells in a biopsy? Should he ask for a do over on the biopsy but with another lab? What would you guys do? I am so sorry I'm rambling our world just imploded.",

      "Content": "Thanks, so much for the quick replies! We are panicking. I will pick up the book today. Thanks , Aria Originally Posted by Fairwind John's advise was excellent as usual...One SLOW DOWN...With Gleason 6, there is no hurry. Pick up a copy of Patrick Walsh's book (Guide to surviving prostate cancer, 3rd edition) and read it. With surgery, it all depends on the skill of the surgeon (and luck) as to the results achieved and side-effects endured. Same with radiation, really...Today, many Radiation Oncologists are combining seed implants along with beam radiation, a one-two punch that is VERY effective. Some doctors are adding Hormone Therapy to the radiation and getting even better results... So you have lots of options to sort out. Surgery might be one of them but don't rush into it before you have a complete understanding about what is going on. Read the book I recommended to get a solid background about what your are facing before you make a treatment decision..Be warned, the doctors will all push the product they are selling... I have used alldaychemist for various drugs including Cialis without any problems. But others have had problems. You might want to pay using a pre-paid, disposable credit card..Most of the problems occurred earlier before they switched to secure servers.. There is always a chance that Customs will seize your order..If that happens, ADC will usually replace the \"lost\" shipment..",
