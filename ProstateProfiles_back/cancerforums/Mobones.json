    "Content": "Just diagnosed yesterday with 4 3+3, 4 3+4, and 3 4+3 out of 12. I'm 61 and only hours into reading up. Still need to go get my scans before scheduled consultations with rad and surgery people. Like your story Powder. Right now, for some reason, radiation seems to be how I'm thinking, not even sure why, and may be my choice, condition and experts permitting. I've been associated with cannabis for a long long time, read many stories about it's medical accomplishments beforehand and have some young friends here in NJ that actually get the buds from their new medical supplier in Colorado and have the machine or means to turn it into the oil for benefits other than PC. One of them is actually a personal trainer for a well known professional athlete, not that it matters here. They smoke it with electronic cigarettes of some sort which I'm already using instead of the regs. I'm also diabetic and know of the Lyrica and such too. Think I may have to give your treatment a shot while waiting on and in conjunction with whatever conventional treatment I decide on. Used to be a Medic in the service many years ago and there's only a small number of doctors that earn my trust anyway so I'm open to what your prescribing just as well. Appreciate the time you took to update your status and may just take you up on that email for details on technique. For all you other guys that are still reading, I have an Uncle I haven't talked to yet that had the seeds implanted years back and seems to be fine. I asked my urologist about the seeds or beans as I call them and he told me he's not recommending them any longer due to recent problems somehow developing with them. Anybody have any info on this? Thanks Again for everybody's input, I'm sure you'll be hearing more from me as days go by.",
