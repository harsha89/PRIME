      "Content": "I recently had a prostate biopsy & was diagnosed with prostate cancer. Seems I'm in a gray area & looking for thoughts or suggestions from those with experience in this not so fun \"CLUB\"! My PSA had slowly risen in the past few years, so when it got to 4.7 in Dec 2015 my primary Dr referred me to a urologist. First thing he did was repeat the PSA test, which came back 5.1. Then he did the biopsy Feb 19 2016. 1 week later I started having chills & fever & ended up in the hospital for 3 days with an infection from the biopsy! NOT FUN! Anyway, here are my results that were done by Bostwick Labs: Out of the 12 samples, 3 came back as Gleason 3+3=6 2 of them had 5% involvement of the tissue (located Right Lat Mid & Left Lat Apex) But the 3rd had 60% involvement of the tissue (located Right Lat Apex) The urologist went over all options from Active Surveillance to Radiation, to Da Vinci surgery, to HIFU, ETC. My initial thought was to do active surveillance, but according to guidelines it may not be right since I have 3 positive plus with one being over 60% involved. My urologist suggested doing genetic testing, which we did. That result came back as LOW RISK (which states there would be a 72% chance that the cancer would be contained in the prostate if it were removed) BUT THE DR WAS HOPING IT WOULD SAY VERY LOW RISK INSTEAD SO THAT STILL PUTS ME IN A GRAY AREA. The dr is saying if I wanted to do Active Surveillance, he would suggest a repeat biopsy in 4 months. But 1 month after having the biopsy done, I am still not feeling good & he thinks I have a lingering infection. awaiting urine culture done today, which will put my on a 60 day antibiotic prescription. He says since I had an infection the 1st time, I am prone to those now & he would expect that to happen on future biopsies! He's also going to see if I can get a 3T MRI done at Methodist Hosp in Houston. But I have a spinal cord stimulator & he's not sure if they can even do one with that device in me! He also recommended that I go for a consult with the radiologist, if so I think I should go to one at MD ANDERSON. One last thing of importance I should mention, my brother who is 4 years older was diagnosed with PCa with Gleason 7 & did do radiation. He's almost 1 year out & says PSA is great. So after reading all this, if anyone has any advice on their opinion of doing AS versus radiation, please share! Also if there's anyone who's had issues with infections from the biopsies, or knows if they can do the 3T MRI with a spinal cord stimulator, let me know! MD ANDERSON experiences/reviews? So glad to have found this group, appreciating your wisdom & experience!",

I know everyone says to make sure to get the TOP KNOTCH doctors, but how do I know who that may be? I do want to hear more about the surgery versus radiation. My brother had radiation & is fine now, but I do worry about side effects later too! I always thought if you got prostate cancer, you just don't worry about it & do nothing! I've learned a lot once you're diagnosed, that's a real eye opener! Thank you!",
