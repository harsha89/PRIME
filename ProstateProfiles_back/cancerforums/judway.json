      "Content": "I had prostate cancer back in 2006 and had the radiation treatment as well as hormone treatment. My lowest PSA was 0.179. It stayed about the same until May 2012 when it had risen to 0.66. It continued rising and reached 1.21 in May 2013. It looked like the PC was coming back. It got me somewhat scared so I started taking Prostate 5LX. The PSA then came down to 0.941 in February 2014 and further down to 0.905 in May 2014. Good News. I suspect the high PSA readings were the result of prostate enlargement. I will talk to my doctor next November to discuss it. Wayne",
