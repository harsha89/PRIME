      "Content": "Good Morning, My husband's urologist/surgeon is urging surgery/RT sooner than later in my husband's case. His urologist has gone on vacation for two weeks, and in the meantime, husband plans to start a two week course of antibiotics hoping to lower his PSA. He asked the urologist about it in an email but didn't get an answer. Husband is assuming urologist didn't order antibiotics because on DRE there was no tenderness or mushiness and no lumps/bumps. But I'm wondering what is accomplished if he lowers his PSA at this point? I suspect it's a measure of denial at work but I surely do not know. (I hesitate to ask him directly because 1) he IS a medical professional and 2) I don't want to sound like I'm challenging his professional opinion. ) The urologist has already said, \"...if PSA is rising due to more aggressive cancer, then we are in the window period of treatment that could affect a cure. If we wait and the PSA goes to 20 or 25, we may be too late.\" As you can see in my signature, it is rising rather quickly. He (my husband, not the urologist) is also opining that a second opinion for his stats is not warranted. If anyone has thoughts on that, I would appreciate any comments. Thank you for any thoughts. I appreciate what I've learned from all of you; I've spent hours reading on this forum.",
