      "Content": "Highlander, thanks for the response. I was not clear on why they did not suggest surgery. Yes, I read a number of topics on this forum and realize that radiation is sort of \"one chance\" thing. We'll try to figure out how to get a second opinion. Do you know if it's true that the radiation therapy can't be done if the prostate is \"large\" or if the patient has cystostomy?",

      "Content": "Hello, Disclaimer: sorry for any English clumsiness, it's not my native language. My father, 62, who lives in Russia, was recently diagnosed with prostate cancer. They staged it T3NxM0. Gleason 3x4 in the left lobe (with perivascular and perineural invasion - I am not exactly sure what that means and not even sure I am translating the terms right). Gleason 3x3 in the right lobe. The doctors did not suggest prostatectomy, they said hormone therapy and radiation is the way to go. The hormone therapy is done with Eligard, dosage is 22.5 mg, they said one shot is good for three months. (They also suggested orchiectomy insted of Eligard, but father refused that) Now, I would expect that they would start the radiation immediately, but during the visit this week they said that his prostate is too large at the moment to start the radiation treatment (it is 63.7 cm3) and he needs to come again in two months when the hormone therapy will hopefully have its effect and the prostate will be smaller. Oh, my father also has cystostomy at the moment (the whole thing started with him having acute urinary retention), they said that he needs to have that removed first before the radiation starts. Questions: Does all of this look like a reasonable course of treatment? I am specifically worried about the delay of the radiation therapy. My understanding is that T3 is when the cancer cells are about to be able to start growing outside of prostate so distant metastasis is a huge risk. Does hormone therapy reduce that risk by itself? Is this reasonable that prostateectomy was not an option? Thanks for any advice, this all is very devastating. I am specifically worried that after doctors told my father \"come in two months\" he got some sense of security and relaxed, but I feel it may be false security. UPDATE: PSA was measured once, in October, it was 30. He never measured it before. Bad, I know. Especially given that my father's father also had prostate cancer.",
