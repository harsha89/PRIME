      "Content": "I agree with Robyn, go ahead with your surgery and get it over with~~then you'll feel better. It's probably just stress-induced, unless you're having fever & chills. Drink some tea or even hot water with lemon, if you don't like tea. Try not to think (yea right!) about the surgery, go for a long walk or to a movie to take your mind off it. Good luck tomorrow, it'll be over before you know it! Best wishes, as always, Jean",
