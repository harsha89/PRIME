    "Content": "Greetings, This seems like a good place to start. March 1 I went to see my new doctor for a physical and update my PSA number. It had been 3 yrs since I had seen a doctor. Historically my psa has been low for my age however during my DRA the doctor felt a nodule on my prostate. That psa was 3.7 with blood detected in my urine. I was referred to a urologist/surgeon for a DRA and a more detail psa test that would indicate what percentage was free and bound. The next psa was 3.07 and the percentage of free was 19.9%. The doctor recommended a biopsy, CT scan, and a cystoscopy. The ct scan was good, the pics of the bladder were good (seeing the inside of my bladder in living color was cool) I was horribly scared of the biopsy and dreaded the day. All this was done in one clinic visit. For a guy who has his wife field dress his deer I thought for sure I would be passed out before I got my shoes off. The doc numbed the area with lidocaine came back about 10min later, I tried to negotiate an 8 core instead of 12 core but to no avail. To my surprise the pain was no more than a light prick, all 12 shots. I couldn\u2019t believe it! I had blood draws that hurt more. Of course later that day I started bleeding hard and wound up in ER and spend the next 2 days in the hospital as a precaution. My wife and I went back to see the doc regarding the biopsy results. My Gleason score was 7 with cancer found in 4 of the 14 cores. The doc says I have a slow growing cancer and as best as they can tell it is confined to the prostate. (the horse is still in the barn) He went through the various options and said I should consider what I would like to do for treatment. He conveyed no sense of urgency but told me I shouldn\u2019t wait any longer that 6 months either. He recommends a prostatectomy. So here I am at 60 yr old planning on being a cancer survivor looking to see what others are going through. As a first step I want to connect with those who have already begun this journey hoping to learn and be well informed on what lies ahead and what decission to make. Thanks.",
