      "Content": "(Stands up) Hello. My name is Mike and I have PC. My story started in May with my routine physical. I recall how well the physical went and how I joked with the doctor about getting my oil change and getting ready for the second half. After a couple of days I went to my online chart to check my blood work to mainly see how my vitamin D deficiency was doing and my world stopped. My PSA nearly tripled in one year. I knew immediately. To make a 3 month story short, my biopsy basically shows that the left lobe of my prostate is junk. The 4x3 apex core is disheartening. My footer below has my numbers. I am really trying to find a way to justify having Brachy, but I just don't know that I can. (Any thoughts on this are welcomed) I have had surgeries on my hand and my back so I am not scared of surgery. In fact, I COULD NOT WAIT to have the microdiscectomy on my back two years ago. I was smiling from ear to ear as I was going under. I went from the most intense pain and being bed bound to walking out of the hospital in the same day. (Anyone contemplating having this surgery because of sciatica, just do it!) But here I am staring at a surgery date of September 28th knowing that when I wake up, things will be different. The thought of incontinence and impotence weighs heavily on this single guy (no kids). As much as I wanted that back surgery is how much I don't want this RRP. I have been lurking here for some time now, but now feel compelled to post. I have seen how the \"newbies\" are welcomed from this club and I hope to obtain some good juju from you all.

      "Content": "(Stands up) Hello. My name is Mike and I have PC. My story started in May with my routine physical. I recall how well the physical went and how I joked with the doctor about getting my oil change and getting ready for the second half. After a couple of days I went to my online chart to check my blood work to mainly see how my vitamin D deficiency was doing and my world stopped. My PSA nearly tripled in one year. I knew immediately. To make a 3 month story short, my biopsy basically shows that the left lobe of my prostate is junk. The 4x3 apex core is disheartening. My footer below has my numbers. I am really trying to find a way to justify having Brachy, but I just don't know that I can. (Any thoughts on this are welcomed) I have had surgeries on my hand and my back so I am not scared of surgery. In fact, I COULD NOT WAIT to have the microdiscectomy on my back two years ago. I was smiling from ear to ear as I was going under. I went from the most intense pain and being bed bound to walking out of the hospital in the same day. (Anyone contemplating having this surgery because of sciatica, just do it!) But here I am staring at a surgery date of September 28th knowing that when I wake up, things will be different. The thought of incontinence and impotence weighs heavily on this single guy (no kids). As much as I wanted that back surgery is how much I don't want this RRP. I have been lurking here for some time now, but now feel compelled to post. I have seen how the \"newbies\" are welcomed from this club and I hope to obtain some good juju from you all.

      "Content": "Hi All. Update on where I am after having Brachy back in January of 2017. My PSA was down to .28 last month after a steady decline and the Urologist is very happy. My 15 month bout of buring urination disappeared on Friday, April 6th and has not returned. Frequency has improved somewhat. I still go 3 times a night, but I can live with that considering. I don't think I will ever be getting off FloMax. So anyway, the Uro doesn't want to see me again for a year. He told me to go ahead and cancel my appointment I have in August with my Rad Onc. I am going to still go and also thank him for all he has done. Dr. Stephens is an awesome Rad Onc and person. He's compassionate / empathtic and made time for phone calls late in the evening to just talk and settle my mind at times. He went above and beyond. So...I guess I am in the Brachy zero-club for now.

      "Content": "Originally Posted by Michael F Congrats Mike! Great update! Question: With what frequency will you continue to monitor your PSA? It will be interesting to follow it down to its nadir (if not already there). No doubt that the \"Club Zero Nadir Subcommittee \" has accepted your application. Glad you are doing well! You (Low) & SubDenis (High) are our resident Brachytherapy Poster Boys! Best wishes! MF He said once a year now. You do make a good point. We don't really know if I am at nadir, but I don't think it can go too much lower given it is Brachy. I still have my appointment with my Rad Onc in August that I have kept and it does include a PSA test. I will go ahead and get that PSA test. That will make it 9 months until the next scheduled visit with the Uro. I'm sure I could get one with a little prodding of my General Practicioner at the end of the year. Thank you!!",

      "Content": "Welp, After being told by the Uro in May that he didn't need to see me again for a year, I kept what I thought would be my last appointment with my RadOnc this week. My uro had told me to go ahead and cancel the appointment, but I didn't. It was supposed to be a happy visit where I tell him major burning issues from the Brachy had finally gone away, thank him for his compassion and being a wonderful doc. But that pesky PSA test... While it isn't that much, my PSA reading rose from .28 to .30, it brought back a lot of the anxiety that I thought I had left behind. He said exactly what I thought he would. Another PSA in 3 months and see what it says. A few notes: - .02 is apparently right at the limit of margin of error for the test. So who's to say the .30 isn't a .28 (.32 if the glass is half empty). OR...that the previous .28 wasn't really a .30? - I am 19 months out from initial treatment and this is pretty much right at the median (18 months) when people experiance a PSA bounce. (The first time I have actually fell in a preferred spot on a bell curve relating to this stupid disease.) The later the rise, the higher chance of a failure according to the research paper he gave me. The paper shows the the median to first rise for those that experience failure is around 33 months as I recall. I don't have it in front of me. - If it is indeed the starting of a true bounce, data exists that suggests that those that bounce have better chance for long term outcome. Anyway, he said he wouldn't get too concerned over it and that he is confident it will eventually come down. He OK'd me an open order for more PSA tests and said he knows I'm a numbers guy and if I want more data points, I can get them if it would help ease my mind by knowing what they are. Hello, anxiety.",

I am also scheduled for them to go in and take a look inside the bladder to make sure a seed hasn't migrated.",

      "Content": "Just wanted to give my update. I had my first post Brachy PSA a few weeks back. It was down to 0.45. The Radonc seemed very pleased with this. He stated that this was a very good sign. With that said, he was a bit disappointed in the level of side-effects. ME TOO, Doc! Still on the Flo-Max, Vesicare and Mirabegron. In retrospect, I have come some way from the drip drip drip and the pain that came with it. It seems to be a thing of the past. Things are a bit confused \"down there\" between the front end and the rear end. I usually have a pinch and a deep burn in both ends as I void. Sometimes urination leads to needing to do the other too. If I am in bed or a recliner for any longer than 30 minutes, I need to go to the restroom within a minute or two of standing up. Drinking or touching water can instantly turn on \"I gotta go\" mode. I'm my own frat house practical joke. So that is it for now. I get another PSA in 6 months unless the urologist wants to go three month increments. I will see him in 2 months. Oh...wood is still pretty good. I do have a script for Cialis that the RadOnc thinks may help side effects in general. Will need to go back through some of the other posts to find a reputable Canadian Pharm since the Insurance won't cover it. Wish everyone the best on their journey! -Mike",

      "Content": "Hello. It's been quite some time since I have posted. Some may recall the inability I had to pull the trigger on surgery to remove my prostate and I canceled at the last moment. I took some grief for that. Afterward I really went into the tank for a couple more months. (I found a fast way to lose weight. Stress.) After asking (begging) for an MRI to see if anything could show up to help me make a decision, I had one. It revealed what appeared to be a 2mm extension. After talking with the uro and radoc at the Cleveland Clinic, I was told what I already knew through research and previous discussions with these two highly regarded doctors at the clinic. There was no difinitive study that showed that surgery or brachytherapy had any better outcome probability than the other for my situation. The radonc told me that he was confident that he could cover the area of my extention knowing where it was located. My urologist implied he too could probably get the extension, but he didn't instill the confidence in me as the radonc. He also said there was approximately a 30% chance of needing radiation at somepoint after surgery. I weighed all of this, read some quality of life studies and, rightfully or wrongfully, came to the decision to have the brachytherapy even at age 51. I didn't want to chance the negatives of both surgery and radiaion. I understood the chances of secondary cancers later, but I am not too scared of that boogie man as I had a real one in front of me right now. So on 1/31/2017 I had brachytherapy consisting of 90 seeds. (On a strange note, I had a psa performed before the procedure and my psa was the lowest it had been in the previous 9 months at 3.07) My radonc said that the procedure went near perfectly in his opinion (graded it better than 95%) as my prostate didn't move during the procedure as some do. He gives me a 90% chance of psa cure based on my numbers and how the procedure went. I am now 48 days out. Currently the sex department is OK sans the lack of ejaculate, but that is a given either way. My only problem is the chronic annoyance of frequent low volume urination that is a little painful to start a flow. While I expected this issue for a little while, it is quite worse than what could be considered in the normal portion of the bell curve. Sometimes I go about 20 times during the day and about 5 times during the night. I started on Flomax imediately after procedure, but the docotor noticed that on my quality control CT scan in Feb, my bladder was remarkably empty. He prescribed DITROPAN XL believeing my issue is a very aggrivated bladder. The new med hasn't helped too much and I go to a urologist tomorrow to see if there is something else we can do. I do have a couple of questions to anyone in the Brachy group. Did this happen to you? Did it finally subside? Did you ever get a slight pinching feeling where it felt like you might have leaked, but nothing was there? I usally get this phontom pee sensation about 20 minutes after each urination. Thank you for your time.",

When people get their post RP pathology report, does the report determine or estimate in someway how many millimeters of margin might have been left? If so / or you know your own if this has happened to you, can you share what your margins were? I haven't really found anywhere that says what a typical surgical margin's size is. I know it can be surgeon specific, but I am really curious. Thank you.",

      "Content": "Hello. Patience is more than a virtue here. It is an absolute necessity. I only had Brachy in January of 2017. For me personally, I was having to get up about 8 times a night and would go at least 20-25 times a day. The frequency got a little better so slowly that there isn't an \"ah-ha moment\". There isn't even an \"ah-ha\" month. I don't even notice until I reflect back months. As of this writing I still go 3-4 times a night. I will gladly accept that right now. I can't be off FloMax. If I forget to take it, I pay for it in that it is very difficult to get a flow going. I also take 2 bladder anti-spasm meds. KNOCK ON WOOD, the burning with urination has been absent since last Friday. This is the longest it has ever stayed away. That is 15 months of burning at least 20 times a day. Depending on my activity (more like inactivity), I easily still can go 15 times. If I lie down more than 20-25 minutes, I have to go as soon as I stand up. Doesn't matter the volume, I just have to go. Same if I wash my haddns or drink water if its been 20-25 minutes since the last time. Some sort of reflex action. My urologist and radiation oncologist are optimistic that things will get back closer to normal some day. They say it could be tomorrow...it could be 2 more years. There are some that never experience an issue....some that have it for a few months....and then there are guys like me on the bad end of the Bell Curve. Your dad has had been subjected to radiation twice now - External and Brachy. The patience of Job is needed here.",
