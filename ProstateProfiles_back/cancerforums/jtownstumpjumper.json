      "Content": "I've never seen much discussion on this on this forum but my surgeon placed me on an anti-depressant called Imipramine at 5 weeks....It's known to be used for strengthening bladder/sphincter muscles as to why he wanted me on it, not for depression.....this drug is used with children who have a problem of bed wetting. When I was placed on it I was still needing maybe 4-5 Depends per day. I stayed on it for 7 weeks. When I came off it I was only needing about 1 pad per day and I am now 14 weeks post DaVinci and still using about 1 pad per day....only leakage comes with exertion, stretching, lifting, bending. There are some side effects with the drug that I experienced but I do feel it was beneficial to my leakage.",

I'm not referring to ED issues, erections, using Cialis or Viagra but simply has anyone found any significant help in improving this thing of shrinkage...I've used the vacuum pumps for exercising the blood vessels but it doesn't take long for it to return to it's comfortable state. I see supplements that are advertised thru GNC stores and similar health stores....does anyone try these products and achieve any results.......Just trying to find this little guy some help.",
