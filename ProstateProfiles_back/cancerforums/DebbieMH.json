He went in for a bone scan Friday. The urologist said that he has advanced prostate cancer. That he didn't need to do a biopsy because his PSA was so high. The bone scan hasn't come back yet. He has no symptoms ... and is only 61 years old. Is that true ... a PSA that high actually means cancer, period?",

We are going to the doctor today to discuss his bone scan results and to just sit down and find out what he really is facing. Last Thursday when we were there, we didn't quite hear everything, I'm sure - total shock! I am going to ask the Urologist to refer him to MD Anderson.
