      "Content": "Originally Posted by Another Don't be too hard on them. Any anti inflammatory influence may effect PSA modestly. It is a very valid caution. In my denial and delay phase I manipulated my PSA with diet and supplements. It made no difference in the progression of my cancer. Once I stopped it rebounded right back to the curve upward overtaking any losses. The time I lost avoiding treatment put me at higher risk for recurrence. Early detection early treatment is the best chance to cure your cancer, any cancer, imo. The drug company's product monograph (the detailed information about the drug) states: Drug-Laboratory Tests Interactions Treatment with alfuzosin hydrochloride for up to 12 months produced no clinically significant changes in urinalysis, the routine biochemical and hematologic tests as well as in prostate specific antigen (PSA). Also, this small study from 2009 may be the source of the warning: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19462822It reported that it DID see an effect, but the effect was to lower the PSA only in the group with BENIGN conditions. It had no lowering effect in the group with cancer, whose PSA was \"significantly increased\". Since 1.7 is about where it was a year ago, and long way from 4.0, I'm not going to stress about the velocity for now. I have it checked every 3 mos, so we'll see what happens.",

      "Content": "Thanks, chiguy. I had seen the 2nd link already. I updated my original post to say the websites are MayoClinic.org and Drugs.com, not WebMD, which says nothing about affecting PSA. I double-checked with my doctor who stated rather brusquely that in his opinion it had no effect on PSA and had no idea why Mayo Clinic said it did. It bothers me that such reputable sites as these may have false information on them. It makes you wonder what other info may be wrong. Anyways, I'm not going to look a gift horse in the mouth, and just enjoy the holidays!",

      "Content": "My PSA has been rising at an alarming (to me) rate - see below. 3 months ago it spiked to 2.7. At that time, my doctor switched me from FloMax to Afluzosin. He said Afluzosin did not affect PSA levels. After 3 mos. my PSA fell back to where it had been before the spike, and I was greatly relieved. However I see on MayoClinic and Drugs.com the same blurb: \"Alfuzosin may affect the results of the prostate specific antigen (PSA) test, which may be used to detect prostate cancer. Make sure you tell all of your doctors that you are using alfuzosin.\" So now I'm confused. I tried Googling to find more info, specifically just how much it may affect PSA but can find nothing, not even studies that say it affects PSA. Does anyone have any info on the subject? 11/05/2018 1.7 LabCorp (on Afluzosin 3 mos.) 08/13/2018 2.7 LabCorp (on FloMax 3 mos.) 06/04/2018 1.82 MedPace 05/09/2018 1.9 LabCorp 01/04/2018 1.6 LabCorp 10/20/2017 2.2 LabCorp (re-tested to compare w/Quest) 10/09/2017 1.9 Quest 10/13/2015 1.3 LabCorp 10/07/2013 1.1 LabCorp 02/02/2008 0.9 LabCorp 07/27/2007 0.9 LabCorp 06/06/2006 0.8 LabCorp 06/12/2003 0.9 Dr. Kaplan - In Office Lab",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by Another I am not questioning a couple of small studies. I'm am advising against a view that undermines Mayo's credibility. It would be nice for Mayo (and Drugs.com) to have provided some reference and/or provide some means to send feedback so that more info could be obtained. Just putting up a hazy blurb, which Drugs.com repeats ( or maybe the Mayo is repeating Drugs.com?) , doesn't provide any guidance to me, my doctor, or the public in general.",
