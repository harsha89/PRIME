      "Content": "Like other have said research your area for the best urologist with PC experience. At times it will be hard but keep a positive attitude. There are many good treatments out there, so try to keep positive. Once you find the right urologist he should start you with a CT scan and Bone scan to find if the cancer has spread outside the prostate. Next they should set up a biopsy. I keep a log. My wife goes to all the appointments with me so if I don't hear something she does. We write down questions before appointments so we don't forget to ask them at the appointments. Find out if the Urologist has a support group. Both my Urologist and Oncologist have monthly meetings we've found them helpful,not only for support but also for information on treatments and financial aide when you qualify. Prayers.",

      "Content": "Hello Rob, I did 6 cycles of Dosetaxel starting January 13, 2016. I got tired for a couple days the first cycle. This increased the second and third cycle. After the 3rd cycle I had some nausea and My hair started to fall out. I don't know when it started but by the third cycle food lost its taste and almost everything had a metallic taste. I started to feel better the weekend before the forth cycle started. After the fourth cycle I lost all my hair, eyelashes eyebrows leg hair arm hair all of it. I had nausea for the first 5 day and never really got over the tired feeling. By the fifth cycle I had started to get Neuropathy in both feet. I Got sick for about 7 days very little appetite and was given two more pills to stop the nausea. The last cycle the sick feeling lasts 10 days. Each cycle consisted of Benadryl, Zophran, flush with Saline, Dosetaxel flush with saline. They finished with a Neulasta Onpro. The last Infussion date was May 4, 2016. My hair started to grow back the beginning of August. I was on 5mg of Prednisone twice a day the entire 18 weeks",

I have remained Active but I retired at 60, in 2014. I work part time at a ski resort year round 20 to 30 hours a week and slightly more in the winter. Through all my treatments I still worked. I try to schedule Dr appointment and treatments on my days off. I walk 9000 step average every day (4 Miles). Chemo was the hardest treatment I had to date but I still managed to work all but 9 of my schedule days through my 18 week treatment. I try to stay positive and I believe that work has helped. I can't say I felt like working every day, but I did work. I knew if I was just sitting around I would dwell on the negative and feel worse. I took it as if I could make it till break and if I didn't feel better I'd go home. If I made it to break I'd say you can get to lunch, and so on. I'm 20 months since diagnosis. I road track a sports car 5 to 7 weekends a year, and travel an equal number of weekends to NASCAR and IMSA events. In all I feel good. I wish you and your father luck. Stay positive.

When my PSA started rising again after a brief pause below 1, it went to 16.4 last year, resulting in a flurry of treatments. January saw 30 cycles of External focused beam radiation. This showed no improvement and infact my PSA doubled in the 3 months after that. I was diagnosed with Hormone Refactory (resistant) Metastatic Cancer. Shortly after this and had 3 cycle of Provenge which finished in August. After the second treatment I started Xtandi. I am on the 4 month of Xtandi and starting Xgeva to limit and reduce bone lose and high blood calcium. My PSA dropped after 60 days to 2.4 but after 120 days it has not changed and remains at 2.4.

      "Content": "My journey starts like this. I'm currently 63, in October of 2015 I went to the hospital because I was having some chest pain and pressure in the center of my chest. I was admitted to the hospital and the test started. I had a CT scan, Stress test, Eco-cardiogram, finally a catheterization. So after 2 days of tests the cardiologist come to my room and tells me I passed all the test with the exception of a slight enlargement in my left ventricle after the stress test which may be normal for some one my age. She goes on to say there is no reason for the chest pain and she suggested I'm having an anxiety attack, etc. Oh by the way we are giving you a prescription for another CT scan because your CT scan show you have 3 enlarged lymph node in your chest. I went to my family doctor the following Monday to talk about the CT scan. They did a full Physical which showed I also had a slightly enlarged Prostate. I asked them to do a PSA. The results came back at 187. 5 days later I had a full body CT scan, and bone scan, and 4 days after that a Biopsey of the prostate showed 10 out of 12 positive,and the 3 chest lymph nodes tested positive as well. As a side note the Lymph node in my chest were 30mm in dia, 35mm X 25MM, and 18mm in dia., I wondered if there was a problem or I was having an anxiety attack. My diagnosis came back as stage 4 Prostate cancer with an 8 Gleason score. The CT scan showed a total of 20 possible tumors. My Bone scan showed cancer like lesions in my sternum and pubic bone In November 2015 I got my first shot of Lupron coupled with Casodex (Bicalutamide). After 1 Months I was started on Dosataxel (Taxotere) at a high dosage based of the number of tumors 100Mg. This was reduce to 75Mg on the 5th and 6th treatment when I started to have neuropathy in my feet. I lost all my hair, eyelashes, eyebrows, body hair, and after the 4th, 5th and 6th treatment was sick 10 or more days days. 4 weeks after the treatment ended all the toenails on my right foot fell off. 2 weeks later the toenails on my left foot fell off. My three month appoint showed My PSA at .22, which I felt at the time made everything worth while. My CT scan showed a reduction in my prostate of 25% 10 lymph nodes were under 1 cm. A tumor on my sternum did not show up on the new bone scan. 2 nodules one in each lung were gone. Tumors on my Pubic Symphus was unchanged as well as a tumor on the pubic bone. At 6 months My PSA 1.44. At 8 Months 3.5. At 10 Months 4.9. My doctors decided it would be helpful to treat the prostate and pubic bone with pinpoint external beam radiation, 30 consecutive treatments. This resulted in the the prostate returning to normal size and texture. There was no change to the pubic bone area. 30 days after the treatment My PSA was 6.9 a new CT and Bone scan showed a increase in a tumor size on my right kidney and a new tumor on my lower right femur. The day I went to discuss the test results and possible treatment option (16 days after the CT& Bone scan) my PSA was 9.62. Tuesday I went to sign treatment releases for Provenge, My PSA is 12.63. The Oncologist asked me to stop taking the Bicalutamide today. He says I may have reached a point where this may be having a negative effect on the cancer cells. The new treatment plan has me completing a course of Provenge (3 cycles) then immediately going on the Xtandi after the Provenge is completed. He said I will never be able to stop the Lupron injections. My current diagnosis is Metastatic Castrate-resistant, hormone refactory, prostate cancer. So the question is what should I expect for the Provenge treatment? Should I be concerned? Has anyone had any experience with this combination of treatments?",

      "Content": "My journey starts like this. I'm currently 63, in October of 2015 I went to the hospital because I was having some chest pain and pressure in the center of my chest. I was admitted to the hospital and the test started. I had a CT scan, Stress test, Eco-cardiogram, finally a catheterization. So after 2 days of tests the cardiologist come to my room and tells me I passed all the test with the exception of a slight enlargement in my left ventricle after the stress test which may be normal for some one my age. She goes on to say there is no reason for the chest pain and she suggested I'm having an anxiety attack, etc. Oh by the way we are giving you a prescription for another CT scan because your CT scan show you have 3 enlarged lymph node in your chest. I went to my family doctor the following Monday to talk about the CT scan. They did a full Physical which showed I also had a slightly enlarged Prostate. I asked them to do a PSA. The results came back at 187. 5 days later I had a full body CT scan, and bone scan, and 4 days after that a Biopsey of the prostate showed 10 out of 12 positive,and the 3 chest lymph nodes tested positive as well. As a side note the Lymph node in my chest were 30mm in dia, 35mm X 25MM, and 18mm in dia., I wondered if there was a problem or I was having an anxiety attack. My diagnosis came back as stage 4 Prostate cancer with an 8 Gleason score. The CT scan showed a total of 20 possible tumors. My Bone scan showed cancer like lesions in my sternum and pubic bone In November 2015 I got my first shot of Lupron coupled with Casodex (Bicalutamide). After 1 Months I was started on Dosataxel (Taxotere) at a high dosage based of the number of tumors 100Mg. This was reduce to 75Mg on the 5th and 6th treatment when I started to have neuropathy in my feet. I lost all my hair, eyelashes, eyebrows, body hair, and after the 4th, 5th and 6th treatment was sick 10 or more days days. 4 weeks after the treatment ended all the toenails on my right foot fell off. 2 weeks later the toenails on my left foot fell off. My three month appoint showed My PSA at .22, which I felt at the time made everything worth while. My CT scan showed a reduction in my prostate of 25% 10 lymph nodes were under 1 cm. A tumor on my sternum did not show up on the new bone scan. 2 nodules one in each lung were gone. Tumors on my Pubic Symphus was unchanged as well as a tumor on the pubic bone. At 6 months My PSA 1.44. At 8 Months 3.5. At 10 Months 4.9. My doctors decided it would be helpful to treat the prostate and pubic bone with pinpoint external beam radiation, 30 consecutive treatments. This resulted in the the prostate returning to normal size and texture. There was no change to the pubic bone area. 30 days after the treatment My PSA was 6.9 a new CT and Bone scan showed a increase in a tumor size on my right kidney and a new tumor on my lower right femur. The day I went to discuss the test results and possible treatment option (16 days after the CT& Bone scan) my PSA was 9.62. Tuesday I went to sign treatment releases for Provenge, My PSA is 12.63. The Oncologist asked me to stop taking the Bicalutamide today. He says I may have reached a point where this may be having a negative effect on the cancer cells. The new treatment plan has me completing a course of Provenge (3 cycles) then immediately going on the Xtandi after the Provenge is completed. He said I will never be able to stop the Lupron injections. My current diagnosis is Metastatic Castrate-resistant, hormone refactory, prostate cancer. So the question is what should I expect for the Provenge treatment? Should I be concerned? Has anyone had any experience with this combination of treatments?",

      "Content": "Still hoping for some type of reply to how others may have done on Provenge, (Sipuleucel-T) I found some info on survival but little else. My health insurance has approved the treatment but refused the followup Xtandi (enzalutamide). Reason was they don't believe I have enough documented data to support the diagnosis of C-RMPC.",
