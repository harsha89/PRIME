      "Content": "So if my PSA is .07 now, would these two digits have to climb to .99 and then .1 to be considered recurrent? Met with 2 oncologists, one said wait for more tests to establish a clear trend, the other to fire up the nukes now. Another person told me that the increased PSA is from benign prostrate tissue left behind on nerve endings? With the old exam I would still be considered undetected.",

Dr. Ritter from Carbone Cancer at UW Madison. He wanted to see an additional test before proceeding. He would radiate at higher level for shorter period than other oncologist. Jim, does Medicare pay full amount?",
