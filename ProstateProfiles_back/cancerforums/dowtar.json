      "Content": "I am 61YOA. Yes, I have seen a urologist. As noted, my PSA went from 2.4 in April, 2013 to 4.8 in August 2014. My urologist performed a second PSA and it was 4.4 in September. I went to the urologist in September. He did a DRE and said the prostate was normal, although large (not enlarged, just large). He questioned whether the August PSA test was accurate. I had done everything you are not supposed to do before the August PSA (sex, extensive bike riding, etc.), so he did a second blood test. I also had no symptoms. The urologist told me to live a celibate, quiet life for a week and then he did another blood test, which resulted in a PSA of 4.4. His nurse then called and said that because my PSA went from 2.6 to 4.4 over a year, he wanted to do a biopsy. I'm scheduled for a biopsy on Monday. So, everything the urologist has done so far has been logical and reasonable. I was not referred to this doctor. I chose this urologist because (1) his office is in an affluent, older area of DFW, (2) he has been selected two years in a row as one of the \"Best Urology Doctors\" in the Dallas area by Dallas Magazine, (Dallas Magazine is \"the\" monthly magazine geared to the Dallas-Fort Worth Metroplex) and (3) he does DaVinci surgery. Unfortunately, I don't really have a feel for the guy.",
