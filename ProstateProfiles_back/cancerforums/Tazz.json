      "Content": "I'm 48, about to be 49 in May. I've recently been diagnosed with stage T1C cancer of my prostate. Had to pathology reports from the same biopsy. One stated only 1 sample was positive of the 12 with a gleason of 3+4=7. The other, 3 samples were positive with all 3 gleason scores of 3=3=6. Which one do you use and/or believe? Did the do-diligence of getting 4 opinions from 4 surgeons in my PA area including my urologist who reviewed my PSA's and performed the original biopsy. So, who do you trust? How do you find out which one is the best? Which one does the best at nerve-sparing? Which one has the least complications? Which one will do the best job to #1, get rid of all the cancer, #2, prohibit me from becoming incontinent, #3, prohibit me from having ED? I am so stressed over all of this that I just want someone to tell me who the best surgeon is that will give me the best outcome at the best hospital w/out having my wife and family travel far nor myself. I am tooooo young for this and still want to see my kids graduate from High School, College, and see them get married and have kids of their own so I can enjoy being a grandpa. Stressed and worried to death, Tazz",
