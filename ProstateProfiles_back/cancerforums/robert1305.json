      "Content": "Had to be referred to a consultant after my Gp found that my prostate had become significantly enlarged since my last examination 6 months ago The consultant did an internal examination before he did the biopsy, the result was he said that he didn't want to do the biopsy because my prostate was so enlarged and had an irregular surface on the right hand side and a very large tumor on the left hand side, and in his expert opinion I did have prostate cancer. He did say that if I insisted he would do the biopsy and start me on chemo, treatment, but due to the fact that I was 79 it would be better to adopt a wait and see approach and let him examine me every 6 months, and make a a decision if my PSA rose above the 11.6 it was now. In fact he did say that he would wait until my PSA reached 25/30 before he intervened What I would like to know has anyone else waited and if so what was the outcome. The main thing that worries me is the damn thing spreading. If I dont have a biopsy how does he know what kind of cancer I have. Apart from a feeling of some pressure in my back passage and a dull nagging ache in my pelvis I feel fine. Regards Bob",
