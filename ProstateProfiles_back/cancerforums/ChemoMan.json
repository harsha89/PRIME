      "Content": "If Chemo is not going to cure him, then why do it? Chemo is often give in late stage cancer as a palliative measure...for instance a tumour could by pressing on a nerve or vital organ cause serious pain and chemo is given to shrink the tumour and relieve the symptoms. This is the usual reason chemo is given the other is that the relatives or the patient push the doctor in doing Chemo against the doctor's judgement in the vain hope of a cure...mind you any cancer can spontaneously go into remission but that is rare event. These are the 2 main reasons doctors do chemo in terminal cancers. Two other things to remember...doctor are human. This means they make mistakes and like the rest of the population of doctors contains a few bad apples. The last thing to remember is in Question and Answer format Q.... What do you call a medical student who came last in his class ? A.... Doctor ! Caveat Emptor",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by warriorsfan Hello. I'm immensely scared because I found a hard small lump on my right testicle and the whole testicle is bigger than my left one. i also have a very tiny lump on my left one. I also have a big lump near my right testicle and i dont know what it is. I researched all this and it all leads to testicular cancer. I'm only 1 and I'm scared as heck. I dont know how to ask my mom or dad to go to the doctor to get checked out because it's embarrassing but im so scared. Please help. Does it sound like testicular cancer? Hi. little lumps around the testicles are pretty normal and it is also normal to have one testicle larger than the other. If this continues to worry you then a trip to the doctors is in order. Speak to your parents about making that appointment. Good luck",

It is so for all cancers as tissue pathology is essential . As sure as the Sun rises Zak a tissue biopsy must be taken. You might as well get used to the idea and toughen up a bit otherwise forget everything and live your life as if nothing is wrong. Fighting cancer demands courage to make decisions which are inherently risky and prone to failure but the reward of life extended is worth it in my opinion. Zak you are new here. The PSA testing stuff is old hat and has been done to death. People have strong opinions and have posted them, so read the threads then give it a rest. The thing that you need to do is take into account the feelings of the other members here so pay attention to what Chuck said in his post.

Your wife is right. To talk to someone with cancer about their disease is really too much for most to bear. Your story is a common one that has been told here many times. The other thing is that a lot of people really don't care after all why should they care about someone they hardly know? This is probably the reason no one responded to your poster. It hurts more when friends or family don't bother to call but as we say around here cancer always finds out who your real friends are, one of the silver linings to the dark cloud that is cancer. Anyway welcome to our international forum and good luck",

Seems like all responses are from fellow prostate cancer patients. It would be nice to get a urologists opinion sometimes, or to be able to ask a urologist a specific question. This is a patients forum so you have come to the wrong place for a professional opinion. We would not encourage \"doctors\" giving advice here anyway that is not our mission. If you want professional advice stop being a cheapskate and pay for it !",

I have not experienced it personally so could you be so kind as to describe what you mean by \"jumping around\"? I want to provide accurate feedback to the Support Team. Thanks again, kermica K when you first get to the forum you see a whole list of stickies. As you attempt to scroll down the forum the page automatically jumps to the unstuck threads. It does not scroll smoothly but jumps past the last of the stickies and takes you straight to the members threads. I tried everything to get a smooth scroll but nothing worked. it only seems to be affecting the PC forum.",

If the intent is to keep the population uninformed via a diagnostic test that has led to a 44% decline in PC deaths since 1992, then let's do away altogether with diagnostic testing. X-ray machines ?

Getting castrated will probably do nothing to take your frustration away after all the primary driver of sex in us is not our genitals but our brain. You may want to have your testosterone levels checked and I also think the suggestion of therapy by fast eddie is a good one. I know its hard getting good help in the bush so a trip to a city maybe in order as well. Hang in there and don't give up I am sure there is a solution somewhere. Cheers",

Among the drugs he had home I found Zytiga 120 abiraterone acetate 250 mg tablet and Lupron depot-3 Month 22.5 mg. This drugs are quite expensive what should I do with them? Is there any possibility of getting back some of the money spent on this drugs? Hi Please return then to the pharmacy. It is illegal to sell them on plus it is dangerous to do so for many reasons.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by cy7 History from August 2010, aged 54 years. After Blood Tests, MRI, Transrectal biopsy, cystoscopy, bone scan etc. Diagnosis: PSA: 050810: 8.1 Gleason Score 9 (4+5), with cancer in 15 of the 18 tissue cores, ductal adenocarcinoma present, peri neural invasion present, extra prostatic extention identified. Prostate volume was 71cc. Stage 3a/b Prostate Cancer (second opinion) Seminal vesicles, lymph nodes and bone scan clear. I was advised that surgery would not be a good idea, as there would be positive margins, and the risk of incontinence, and impotence almost 100%. I said I would prefer Quality of life over quantity. Started hormone (Cyproterone ... 100 to 300 mg daily) therapy August to November 2010 After 3 months Hormone Therapy, into hospital for 3 days HDR Brachytherapy (Nov 2010), then 25 treatments of External Beam Radiation (Dec 2010/January 2011) \u2026. 66.25 Gy (or 83 Gy, some confusion) of Radiation, (20.25 Gy HDR brachytherapy and 46 Gy EBR) Subsequent PSA readings: 060411: 0.49 (Oncologist said I was in remission) 250811: 0.63 061011: 0.75 (6 month *1.5) 040412: 1.6 (6 month *2.1 \u2026.. 12 month * 3.25) 191012: 2.7 (6 month * 1.68 \u2026.. 12 month * 3.60) \u2026.. Urologist said it appear the cancer has metastasized. 090413: 6.5 (6 month *2.4 \u2026.. 12 month *4) \u2026\u2026 both urologist and Oncologist said it is indicative of Metastatic prostate cancer) Due for another PSA in October 2013, and as of April 2013, Bone Scans and MRI are clear. I have resisted hormone therapy, expect for the original 3 months, which was to reduce size of prostate to avoid damage to surround organs. I sort help from alternate therapies in conjunction with the medical approach, taking Selenium, zinc, Pawpaw leaf extract, Cranberry, Chromium, Bio-Curcumin, Lipoec etc. Recently in desperation, after 4 successive 6 monthly rises in PSA, and doubling time currently just over 4 months, I have started taking Baking Soda/Maple Syrup mix. I am no great believer in alternate therapy, but the medical approach from here on does not excite me much either. I am currently in good health. Some bladder irritation, but Bladder and Bowel not a problem, and sexual function fine. Sometime use Cialis or Alprostadil injections. Live on a farm and still work well, ride horses etc. A long an overly detailed post I know, but no point in telling half the story. Don't know if it is helpful to anyone, but I am open to any suggestions. Feel free to shift this post to the appropriate thread. I am getting a little lost on the site. Regards, Jim Hi Jim Moving this to the prostate cancer forum for you Good luck",

My question I still suffer with stomach aches and pains and back ache ( although had the back X rayed and told no cancer there ) does anyone know if cancer can still spread even with a low PSA. Thanks guys. Joe Hi You have what we in the lymphoma forum call \"the noise\". This is the little voice in your head that says \"cancer\" every time you feel something out of the ordinary. It gets loudest at around two years after treatment. Chances are you are suffering longterm side effects from the chemo. That stuff is really toxic and quite capable of producing those symptoms. As always if you are really concerned you should talk it over with your doctor. Chances are that something else could be at play and a doctor can investigate that for you. Congratulations on achieving NED...long may it last",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by goodlife307 My newly diagnosed G9 husband (age 59) has decided to go the new early chemo route before surgery. He just had his second infusion the other day. Back in January, before the DX, we noticed that he had a large hard lump under his skin on the top of his thigh. It was about 6 inches below his hip bone. With all of the the trauma of the diagnosis we kind of forgot about it. Then after his first round of chemo we have noticed that it has almost completely disappeared. While some might say this is good, I am worried that this might be a metastasis. His MRI did show two nodes as suspicious in the pelvic region but his bone scan was clean. We asked the oncologist about it the other day and he said without doing a biopsy it's hard to know what it is and that it would not change our current course of treatment. He wants hubby to do CT scans after the next round of chemo. My question to all of you is have you ever heard of anything like this relating to PC? Or could it be another type of cancer? If it is prostate cancer, I would think that this would take surgery off the table, meaning that it is now systematic. (Just entered my signature today; hope it shows up) Any insights would be much appreciated!!! Lymphoma acts like that. Could be that hubby has lymphoma as well. Best to talk to his doctors rather than us",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by corvus917 So, after having to readmit my 80 year old father into the hospital twice in a month due to dehydration, weakness in the legs and back pain, we had him take a PSA test and a CT scan and an ultrasound. The results of the test was a PSA of 300, and the scans indicated that the prostate had a volume of 81 CCs, and there were calcifications and growths on the spine, which would suggest metastasis. Our doctor told our father the results of the tests, but we chose not to tell him that we thought it was cancer. My mother and I just told him that he needed a biopsy. Thing is that he refused to have a biopsy, since he hates hospitals (calls them places where \"people go to die\") and said that he \"didn't want them to find anything else wrong with me\", and he just wanted to leave. Now he's home two days later, and we're taking care of him, but we don't know how to tell him what is wrong with him. We thought he figured it out himself, but it seems that he's oblivious to what's wrong with him. He's too frail for chemo or radiotherapy, it's a struggle to get him to eat or drink anything even with appetite stimulants, and he can't even stand on his own. We haven't seen an oncologist yet, and we don't know how long he has left. I don't know what to do. I think that maybe your Father knows more than you think he does. I would leave the cancer diagnosis and reporting it to Dad to the oncologist. At the end of the day your Fathers wishes need to be respected and given the information you have provided I doubt whether Dad having full knowledge of his health status makes any difference. No need to burst his bubble if that is what keeps him sane. Don't fret over this. every second now is precious so make the most of it . Enjoy Dads company and go out of your way to make him laugh and feel at ease. Good luck",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by MarkVA For most of my life, I've always been active and worked out. I learned (hard way lol) that its not good idea during treatment ... especially anything that is core related (hint - you'll be peeing every 3 1/2 minutes ... no kidding ... from the additional irritation to the area). But now that we've put some time and distance ... what are your experiences, advice, and medical feedback. I've been told to \"give myself a break and take it easy\". I get that. But it's hard for me as I am sure many. I really don't enjoy working out - I just like the results and free endorphin high (lol). BUT - if I'm going to do it .. then I'm going to do it, and push myself. I don't know if its the radiation or Lupron side effects ... but I'm achy in varying places (achy .. not pain). I was in great shape before - so I know its not respite during treatment. I find more I work out (or harder) .... less I seem to ache post workouts. I had to lay off for week due to travel ... and I seemed to ache more. What I don't want to do and am afraid of ... is work out too intensely or often. Listening to doc and nurse (take it easy, etc) I simply do 30 minutes of circuit/station training: weights, row machine and treadmill (I hate running - especially since Army .. so I just fast walk at incline) ... aside from rowing I stay away from core-isolating exercises (kettle bells, etc). My THR maintains about 130 +/- ... I'm not running marathons or a sprinter ... so that's fine with me. What do you all do? Thoughts? Am I overdoing it - or ok? Thanks!!!!! Well as long as you listen to your body you can knock yourself out. Repeated studies have shown that A hard workout on a regular basis together with adequate sleep and a healthy diet is the best recipe for a prolonged remission. Good luck",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by Otago Well, I hope I can see the actual study instead of only the abstract. The abstract said \" When adjusted for age and prostate weight, ASI men still had a greater probability of having GS 7 or greater PCa \" But the world prostate cancer statistics you refer to only include diagnosed cases and/or death rates from PCa, potentially leaving out a large number of the men in this study who, but for death from other causes, might never be diagnosed or have died from prostate cancer. I don't know the details, but screening for PCa in Japan is far lower. Thus naturally you'll have much lower incidence of PCa being reported. It may be that Russian and Japanese rates of screening are roughly comparable. Rates of new diagnosed cases per 100,000 (back in 2002) were similar in both Russia and Japan. http://www.gapminder.org/world/#$majorMode=chart$is;shi=t;ly=2003;lb=f;il=t;fs=11 ;al=30;stl=t;st=t;nsl=t;se=t$wst;tts=C$ts;sp=6;ti= 2002$zpv;v=0$inc_x;mmid=XCOORDS;iid=phAwcNAVuyj1ji MAkmq1iMg;by=ind$inc_y;mmid=YCOORDS;iid=phAwcNAVuy j3qX39HWaQjEg;by=ind$inc_s;uniValue=8.21;iid=phAwc NAVuyj2vXUZJKI0XHA;by=ind$inc_c;uniValue=255;gid=C ATID0;by=grp$map_x;scale=log;dataMin=377;dataMax=7 5860$map_y;scale=lin;dataMin=-2.3805;dataMax=135$map_s;sma=49;smi=2.65$cd;bd=0$i nds=i110_t002002,,,,;i184_t002002,,,, And in this chart, you can also compare. http://cebp.aacrjournals.org/content...3/F3.large.jpg Interesting. Lots of factors involved. I'd like to see the entire study with the details. It may be that genetics or especially the lifestyle of Japanese men forestalls their PCa from advancing to the point of obvious symptoms (diagnosis) or death. Gleason 6's and 7's may not advance so rapidly in those who have lived and eaten differently for their entire life. Of question is whether Western men, changing their diets after age 50, or after diagnosis will make a significant change in progression. I've completely altered my diet for over 7 years now but have no great faith it will do much more than perhaps delay my genetics. Thus far, no positive biopsy, but PSA still poking along at 3.5 to 3.8 (with some worrying leaps up here and there). That is why I watch and wonder about these types of reports. How come Japanese men can have considerable rates of PCa ongoing, yet have a mortality rate half of ours. Obesity rates are lower in Japan and they eat more fish would seem the obvious reasons to me I heard a leading Australian oncologist talking about risk factors recently and the reporter brought up the issue of fermented and red meats and the oncologist basically brushed it off saying that the biggest risk factor for most men is obesity. Also heard that by the age of 80, roughly 80% of men have prostate cancer but most are indolent",
