To tell the truth I really didn't want to think about any prostate worries until it was testing time again which was coming up in November. Still going to MSK every 6 months. Happy to say I'm still a Zero Club member... for now anyway. To anyone new here reading this the info and opinions here on this forum are indispensable I think. Do your own research. use this forum as a place to help you get thru issues we all face and have faced with PCa. Best to all who arrive here. JD",

The PA said ...It is not unusual to see blood in the urine for several weeks following surgery and that I was correct that it is due to a scab coming off of the internal incision site. I should increase my fluid intake until I no longer see blood or little particles in my urine... I just needed conformation about what I was seeing as I was peeing.",

      "Content": "Hi ibero48, I went to Sloan and was very pleased with the team there. With my particular case I was a good candidate for several options. Brachytherapy (seeds); radiation; surgery or irreversible electroporation( that involves the use of small needles to deliver an electrical current to small, localized prostate tumors) Even though we are all affected by PCa everyone must make their own decision on how best to treat their particular case. In my opinion the best way to arrive at a decision is speak with your physician, read Patrick Walsh's Surviving Prostate Cancer lll edition and stay connected to this forum. If you want to speak with me send me a private post and I'd be happy to share what my experience was at MSK. I went with the \"robot\" for surgery.",

It's just been 4 weeks since surgery so that was really nice and to know that the feeling is still there and that the plumbing seems to be working OK. That coupled with continence during the day and night except a sneeze/cough might bring out a drop or two (and yeah a little bit of beer and I'm leaking a little too) , I'm not complaining...still have some specks of internal scab mixed in the urine...",

After all the last operation I had was when I was 5 yo and got ether for anesthesia.

He has been inspired and made to feel much more comfortable about his upcoming surgery due to your great comments and stories. I go on this site as well and read everything. I have learned so much. Well we will be leaving for Sloan Kettering on Tuesday and then the surgery is Wed. I think we are prepared with supplies, meds, etc. I may need your support as well as the caregiver looking for advice. Thanks again to a great group!!!",

      "Content": "Well it's been sometime now waiting, reading, learning and directly speaking with fellow PCa brothers some right here from this forum and others...thanks guys . I'm about to really start the journey to the other side of this malady in about 72 hours from today. I'm actually pretty calm considering what's about to take place. After all the last operation I had was when I was 5 yo and got ether for anesthesia. So even though I am an RN and have worked in hospitals and healthcare facilities for many years I was always on the other side of the fence. It was always the other guy getting stuff done. I know I've done my due diligence and have prepared as much as possible and now it's time to be secure in the decisions I've made with my beautiful wife right by my side every step of the way. So wish me luck fellows and I'll be happy to discuss the outcomes when I'm up and \"running\" again.",

      "Content": "Systematic review and meta-analysis published by BMJ September 5, 2018 https://doi.org/10.1136/bmj.k3519 Conclusions At best, screening for prostate cancer leads to a small reduction in disease-specific mortality over 10 years but has does not affect overall mortality. Clinicians and patients considering PSA based screening need to weigh these benefits against the potential short and long term harms of screening, including complications from biopsies and subsequent treatment, as well as the risk of overdiagnosis and overtreatment After all is said and done I decided to be tested, weighed my options and took action never to look back.",

      "Content": "Yes PCA Spouse. I followed my PSA increasing for years prior to 2015 also because my father had PCa and at the time I was a healthcare professional so I was very aware. When the velocity of my PSA increased I decided I needed to be proactive and to start looking at my options. My Uro at the time wanted to watch and wait but that approach did not suit me. With the help of this forum and my own research I decided to go to MSK. Happy I did.",

I'm a patient @ MSK in NYC. the Surgeon I am working with has done 350 RP Davinci surgeries. The electroporation (only the \"4\" of the tumor is treated) is a pretty new technology and even though it is FDA approved there is still no long term studies done. The Surgeon said that's what he would choose but he likes to be on the cutting edge so to speak Not so crazy about the radiation route. Any suggestions would be helpful. Thanks.",

      "Content": "Thanks all for writing Yes Track Record makes sense. Like Dr Patrick Walsh says : even if a new tx was found today it would take 10-15 yrs to see if it worked. The IE just does the spot shown on the MRI-US. Then at 6 months another MRI-US Bx is done and repeat tx can be done if something else is found or surgery or radiation at any point. Not all that adventurous and really not too interested in being a pioneer, however with the IE treatment all options remain on the table. Of course I don't like the idea that if in 6 months after tx the Bx shows another spot so then Im still dealing with the PCa. Yes I don't know if 350 RPs are enough to get out of the learning curve...Dr Walsh says more than 300 is a good answer. What do I tell the surgeon about changing to someone else with more surgeries under his belt? My surgeon is at MSK so that says something about his skill I think. But. How does one find the percentage of successful surgeries a surgeon has done? Thanks a lot for all the info",

When the velocity of my PSA increased I decided I needed to be proactive and to start looking at my options. My Uro at the time wanted to watch and wait but that approach did not suit me. With the help of this forum and my own research I decided to go to MSK. Happy I did.",

      "Content": "Thanks all for writing Yes Track Record makes sense. Like Dr Patrick Walsh says : even if a new tx was found today it would take 10-15 yrs to see if it worked. The IE just does the spot shown on the MRI-US. Then at 6 months another MRI-US Bx is done and repeat tx can be done if something else is found or surgery or radiation at any point. Not all that adventurous and really not too interested in being a pioneer, however with the IE treatment all options remain on the table. Of course I don't like the idea that if in 6 months after tx the Bx shows another spot so then Im still dealing with the PCa. Yes I don't know if 350 RPs are enough to get out of the learning curve...Dr Walsh says more than 300 is a good answer. What do I tell the surgeon about changing to someone else with more surgeries under his belt? My surgeon is at MSK so that says something about his skill I think. But. How does one find the percentage of successful surgeries a surgeon has done? Thanks a lot for all the info",

      "Content": "I'd never join a club that would have me as member but I will now. 63 yo; recent Dx of T1c; 3+4 gleason;had MRI-US guided Bx; I'm a good candidate for all of the above. I'm a patient @ MSK in NYC. the Surgeon I am working with has done 350 RP Davinci surgeries. The electroporation (only the \"4\" of the tumor is treated) is a pretty new technology and even though it is FDA approved there is still no long term studies done. The Surgeon said that's what he would choose but he likes to be on the cutting edge so to speak Not so crazy about the radiation route. Any suggestions would be helpful. Thanks.",

If I was having trouble getting Viagra from BC/BS I was referred by MSK to inquire Jan Drugs in Canada.
