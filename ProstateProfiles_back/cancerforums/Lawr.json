They did not really spend a lot of energy in telling me that I need to move gently. I was out of the third morning after surgery: had surgery on a Monday morning and was walking out of the hospital on Thursday morning. I took it kind of easy with the catheter in because I thought I was going to knock it out. But since then, I've only a little pain around that area where they went through above my belly button. One thing that I notice is that I have more of control over my urination in the early hours before eleven or twelve in the day, then I begin to have no control. I just leak and leak and leak. I noticed a feeling in the morning that I interpreted as fullness and, upon acting on it, discovered that sure enough, my bladder was full. I made it to the toilet okay and had a normal pee. However, in the afternoons, as soon as I get active, my control is gone. I no longer get any indication that I am full, probably because I am leaking like a sieve. I can't get that full feeling because I am not filling up. I'll try taking it easy to see if that helps. I have to go to the doctor tomorrow morning and had hoped to walk (about 3kms round trip), but I'll drive instead, and take it easy the rest of the day for a week or so to see if that helps. thanks for the advice guys.",

      "Content": "I just thought I'd check in from Ireland. I come here because, though there is a Health Service Executive (HSE)-sponsored forum for people with prostate cancer, no one speaks openly about it on that site. I tried to talk about my cancer to sufferers on Boards.ie, but I was, first, sanctioned for asking for 'advice', even though I never asked for advice, and second, censored--they actually changed what I had written to suit their rules. I couldn't believe it. I even said in my response to their censoring that I had been censored, and they took it out. Erased it. The 'advice' I had asked for was an invitation for anyone who had undergone a radical prostatectomy to offer up their experiences, and I asked if anyone had had experience of my surgeon, Mr. Garrett, at UHG. I was told I couldn't talk about specific doctors, nor could I ask for advice. I wrote back to say I hadn't asked for advice, but asked for people to share their experiences. If I choose to make decisions that were partially based on other's experiences, that was not anyone else's decision, but mine. Anyway, unbelievable to be censored like that. I have quit that forum altogether. Anyway, that's why I come here. To be honest, I can only talk about this stuff for so long, then I'd rather talk about anything but this. Today, I just want to say that it is five days since my surgery--keyhole laproscopy. The surgeon and his team thought it went well, and I was out of hospital on Thursday morning--three days; not bad. I still have a tube coming out of my penis and staples in my belly, which I get out next Thursday, five days from today. I have to wear these anti-embolism stockings that go up to the top of my thighs for another six weeks, and I have to give myself shots of blood thinner into the fatty tissue in my belly for another 24 days. I don't know yet about what was in the meat that they took out of me or about my margins or any of that. I am mostly focused on the soreness of my belly and my paranoia about accidentally pulling out my catheter. On the first point, passing food is pretty painful and the double-dose of Senacot has proven its worth, as I mistakenly took a normal dose and found out how much pressure bowel movements put on that section of belly that they tore into. On the latter point, my trip home from Galway to Limerick was pretty trying. I had stopped in a shop to try on some oversized, baggy track pants, and all went well, but somewhere along the line, the tube from the leg bag had pulled away from the catheter. I didn't even feel it happen. I just felt wetness, checked and freaked a bit. Later that day, I felt the tug on the catheter as the tube got snagged on the inside of my pants, and again, awakened that night by a tug as the tube got ensnared in the duvet and sheet. Needless to say, knowing that the integrity of the stitching of my urethra to the sphincter of my bladder was partially reliant on the security of the catheter, I became hyper-vigilant and frustrated. I realised, after digging, that when they gave me a leg bag, they gave me straps for the bag, but not for my thigh. I can't tape the tube to my leg because of the stockings. Yesterday, my wife finally came up with the idea of using the tops of her hold-up nylon stockings. Last night was the first time I've slept even remotely well since the operation. That's it so far. Most of my time is spent trying to figure out if it is okay to eat what I'm eating and how much of it I can eat without causing myself grief later. Half the time, too, I don't know what is normal, so I am wondering if it is okay that something is itchy or if a stitch in my belly is normal or not. Also, since I can't lift heavy things, I can't work on my bicycle because it's hanging up, and its too heavy for my wife to bring down for me. That is frustrating. Learn from this guys who've not yet had surgery: position everything now that you'll want to play with while recovering so that you don't have to lift it after the surgery. I am converting an old mountain bike (2003 Trek 800 ST) to a commuter, with 700C wheels, fenders, cantilever brakes, drop bars and 9 speed Tiagra's. I think it will be pretty hot when it's done, and I can't wait to ride it. Unfortunately, all I can do right now is read or go for a walk. I had been doing lots of sit ups in the months leading up to the surgery, so I really am very able for a relatively long walk (c. 3 kms or so), even though I am only five days out of surgery. Again, lesson for anyone thinking of doing the surgery. Hope all of you all are well. Best, L",

      "Content": "Hello. Beginning this journey seven years ago, I am only recently diagnosed with prostate cancer last month, just after turning 57 years of age. I was convinced that it was nothing because they couldn't find anything with that baseball bat they twice shoved up my butt, but an MRI showed a 'shadow', and a perineal finally procedure produced the goods: 3+4 in the 2 cores taken from my prostate's left anterior, 50% found in one core, 30% in the other, and 3+4 in 3 out of 4 cores taken from the left mid region, 50%, 50% and a little over 5%. High-grade PIN is present in that left mid region, as well as in both the left and right posterior region. To me, surgery seems to be the way to go, but I haven't asked my surgeon yet about whether he will do the nerve-sparing surgery. If he can't or won't, ...well, I don't know. Life doesn't look very attractive if he can't. Leave it at that. What I am having difficulty with is the location of the cancerous cells. I see many here use terms like base, apex and middle. My pathology report, possibly because I am in Europe, uses the terms anterior, middle and posterior. I have also seen the terms transitional, central and peripheral zones. I am assuming that the anterior is all of the prostate that is in front of the urethra, facing out toward my belly button. I believe that this corresponds to the transitional region, but am not sure. I assume that the middle section is what lies directly behind the urethra, corresponding to the central zone, and the posterior is what butts up against the colon, at the back of the prostate, corresponding to the peripheral zone. The base, mid and apex seem, in contrast, to slice the prostate in three: top (up against the bladder), middle and bottom (where the urethra comes out). Maybe that distinction is an over-simplification. I guess what I'm concerned about is where my cancer is and where the nerves are that the nerve-sparing surgery is supposed to avoid? I have read that cancer in the anterior and mid regions occurs much less frequently than it does in the posterior/peripheral/apex regions. Nonetheless, here I am with cancer in these less than usual spots and high-grade PINs in the posterior portion where cancer usually presents. Does anyone know where the nerves to be spared are located in this confusing geo-textual prostate?",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by Bravehardon I would assume seven years ago your DRE seemed normal, and same for your PSA. I am surprised your doctor kept you as a patient if you went seven years without a full physical. You may have had prostate cancer for six years or three years. You can't fault your doctor if you went seven years between physicals. B I am not sure why you thought I went seven years without a full physical. I went to my doctor seven years ago and asked for a full physical, including a check for any prostate problems, as I knew that I should have this done once hitting 50 years of age. He did, and then we did another the following year and discovered a rise in the PSA. He did a digital check not too long later, the results of which was his monitoring of my PSAs. I suppose after three years of rising PSAs, he decided to recommend me for a biopsy. But it took another four years to discover the cancer.",

      "Content": "Thanks all for your input here. I see that my experience is not that unsual. I just seems like such a long time for cancer to be festering inside of you, even though you are doing all you can to detect it if it is there. My surgeon says that one of the reasons it was so difficult to find was that it was nearer anterior and mid sections rather than the posterior, which is more accessible by transrectal procedures and where cancer seems to more commonly occur. It was only after the MRI located a lesion in the left middle, where it is least common for tumors to form, and a biopsy was taken via the perineal method that the cancer was discovered. Thanks again.",
