      "Content": "Thanks all for your comments. We do not have prior PSA results and do not have access to them. My husband cannot recall the name or location of the test, he knows its been a few years, we just moved, he went to a new GP for an annual physical who referred him to a local URO for new test and biopsy, this Thursday we will get the results. I've decided not to fret about prior tests its not constructive. Friday morning regardless of results he will call UCLA for an appt to get on board with them going forward. Thanks for all these forums I've now know about PCa then I thought possible, I'm sure all of you know much more and feel the same. That said, knowledge is power.",

      "Content": "I'm back with good news, my husband's biopsy was negative. Reading this forum and doing other online research, I felt confident it would be, i know its easy for me to say, it wasn't me facing the possibility of cancer. I disliked his URO's first telling him he had a high probability of aggressive cancer, then not answering my husband's simple questions during each appointment, barely explaining each procedure. After getting the negative biopsy results, he told him to make a new appointment in six months for a new PSA. Good news he will go to UCLA for future tests, we will have more confidence in future tests and review there, whatever the future brings. Thank you very much all of you who participate in this forum, each post large or small makes this forum the great forum it is.",

      "Content": "Hello I\u0092m asking on behalf of my husband (71 yrs old). January, he had a routine physical, his PSA was 9.34, he was referred to a local urologist, his 4kscore test showed his PSA at 7.65 and his 4K score was 42%. He does not recall previous test numbers, for that reason believes they were in a normal range but can\u0092t recall the year he had his last test nor does he have access to any previous tests. His urologist thinks he may have an aggressive form of cancer because his number rose fast, I think that assumption may be incorrect as he doesn\u0092t know his last test date or the exact number. Yesterday he had a biopsy, this Thursday (3/1) we will get the results. Right now we know his biopsy may show cancer, or it may not. Regardless of its results we want to transfer his testing and care to UCLA as we are within an hour\u0092s drive and know they have highly rated experts. If its cancer, we want to pursue the best treatment plan, if not we want to determine why his PSA numbers are high. Question, do you agree with our plan to move to UCLA now, if so, should we request at our next meeting with the local urologist he forward the test results to UCLA? Should we call today to make a UCLA appointment to get a head start in our plan? Finally, does anyone here have a name of UCLA urologist they\u0092d recommend? Thanks in advance for any advice given to us.",
