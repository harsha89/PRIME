      "Content": "UPDATE..... Doctor (urologist) spent about half an hour with my love. He asked first if he had any questions and said they would start with those. My man pulled out the questions I had prepared for him and the doctor started completing it for him. When he got most of the way down the first page he commented on how much he liked what I did and asked if he had another copy with him that they could keep on hand. He did (I sent him well prepared lol). As for the discussion... Doctor said I have to offer you surgery and radiation but my best suggestion is Active Surveillance (answered prayer). He commented that it was unlikely for the cancer to spread. Where I asked about the genetic testing he wrote (I think.. doing the best I can with his writing) PTEN/ERG Promack -- very low risk catagory. He is a stage T1c... core was 12% cancerous. Prostate is 60 gms (not sure what it is suppose to be as I was thinking before he said 60 cc). He noted his last PSA was 5.5 (which must have been off bloodwork we don't have a copy of). My guy goes in July for bloodwork and then to his GP in August. October 26th he goes back to Uro and is to get PSA a week before. Thank you for all for your information and for calming my nerves as I waited for the news.",

      "Content": "Hey Chuck... it worked this time. Thanks for your help Tomorrow is the day my love meets with his urologist to discuss treatment options (which I feel we already pretty much know). I'm sending him with his pages of questions including asking for Prolaris test and paperwork for John Hopkins second opinion. He has finally agreed to ask his brother to sit in with him and doctor and he is taking a mini recorder with him hoping he can record it. Prayers please for clarity and for calmness for me while I wait to hear from him. His appointment is 10:45. I'm praying for AS but not too sure doc will support it. He is 69 (closer to 70)...PSA was 4.5 April 2016 and 4.85 October 2016... was told at last appt when C bomb was dropped there was cancer in 1 of 12 cores and on a scale of 1-10 it was a 6 (we now know 6 isn't an awful thing thanks to the internet).",
