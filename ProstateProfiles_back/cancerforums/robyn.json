      "Content": "OUr current recommendation is to have a mapping biopsy (takes 60-80 cores, under general anesthesia) first, and if the cancer is confined to one or two small areas and not near vital structures, then it will be treated w/ spot radiation or cryo. We really hadn't considered this before until this particular surgeon told us \"we are vastly overtreating prostate cancer\" and that given my husband's numbers (G6, psa 4.5, 5% of one core), surgery or seeds are overkill. Interesting perspective between surgery/seeds and WW. Robyn",

      "Content": "With your mild symtoms, I'd say that there shouldn't be a problem at all. This could even be from stress/anxiety or allergies. If your temp stays down and you otherwise feel fine, you should be ready for surgery tomorrow. For today, take Vit C and go about your business, get enough rest, drink fluids, esp. water and OJ. One doc I talked w/ years ago would prescribe wearing either a neck warmer or turtleneck to bed when his patients had a sore throat--this really does help, b/c it warms your throat and so makes that area less hospitable to viruses and bacteria--too hot for them to live/multiply. If you are not worse tomorrow, then go on in for surgery, altho definitely let the staff know about your symptoms when you get there. It does happen that patients cancel surgery at the last minute, so don't worry about that part. I hope things go well for you tomorrow--speedy healing! Robyn",
