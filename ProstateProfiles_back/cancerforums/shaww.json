I just returned from a trip and set off the alarms in every airport full-body scanner I went through (i.e., Denver, Chicago, Dayton, Portland, Or.), which required that I be subjected to full body pat downs by TSA's agents each time. What's amazing is that over 60% of my body lit up and I have no idea why, nor does TSA. It's unlikely that it was caused by my radiation levels since I finished my rad treatments nearly 4 years. I'm Stage 4 (lots of bone mets) and the only drugs I'm on are Lupron (3-month injections) and Xgeva (monthly) Any ideas? yes.... and it would piss me off so damn bad it was not even funny. the fix???.... TSA precheck was the best money ive ever spent..... end of problem",

Our grand daughter adds a color picture to bring him joy. I think all the staff is looking forward to the bags of gifts as much as Steve is. Maybe this can start something from all you caregivers and familys out there It is the things people say and do that heals us as much or more than medical science. That is just so darn sweet of her!!

I'm glad you found a hospital where you got good care. I'm new to this, my husband just started hormone therapy this week. I am learning about blood levels. Are they going to give him spot radiation for the tumors on his bones? Take care and keep us informed. Good luck to both of you too, ChiliDog. Hang in there....",

It seems to be a little inconsistent, which is why I thought infection. Maybe I should try the cranberry juice or a cranberry supplement. Just wanted to see if it was going on with others. Thanks for the input. hey there... if you think you have a UTI.... go in and have them check your pee. If not treated it will move from your bladder to your kidneys...and then you are in a real world of hurt. The longer you wait the harder it is to treat. Its painful to pee... the pee will go from coldly to bloody and you will experience incontinence.",
