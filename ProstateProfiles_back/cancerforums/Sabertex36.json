Also, I saw some posts asking about the catheter removal process and I can confirm that it is not a big deal. No pain, just an unusual sensation that is over very quickly. While I was there, URO received path report. He came straight over to share preliminary info. We scheduled a follow up for a full review as he had not had time to study all the aspects. Here is what he shared today: Specimen margins all negative! He started with this because during surgery, he found a small cancer thread that had come out of the prostate next to the bladder. He had a pathologist included in the surgery team so he took more tissue three times during the procedure to be sure we got to negative margins. From that point on he removed all fat and as much surrounding tissue as possible. However, he was able to completely spare all nerves and all muscles required for continence. Other than this thread, no other cancer had extended into surrounding fat or tissue. Lymph nodes: all negative Gleason: was not upgraded! It remains 3+4. Seminal vesicles all negative. Now the bad news. Positive margins on the prostate organ. Perineal invasion detected. While this information is not a pristine report, based on what I had already heard from my surgeon/URO after the procedure, I was very happy and I feel like there is a good chance for a full cure!! I understand that radiation may still be required. However, today my wife (who has been by my side every step of the way) and I will celebrate our early victories!! Please provide insights that you believe I should pursue with the full follow up meeting scheduled for next week. Thanks again for your help.",

In the case of a biopsy decision, the risk (of seeding additional disease) is very low and the reward (knowledge about your health) is very high. All questions are good!

      "Content": "Ok... I like to cover the good news first. In two days, I will be 21 days past the RALP and my continence is above 95%. I only had to wear a pad for two days after the removal of the foley!! Bowel movements are now very regular and comfortable. Soreness around incisions completely gone. My next PSA test is scheduled 12 weeks out from surgery. If someone hadn\u0092t told me there was a problem, I wouldn\u0092t know there was a problem. However, you can now see the full details from the final pathology written report below in my signature. It was a challenge to accept that my URO (who is also my surgeon) was recommending HT and SRT immediately after the October PSA test regardless of the PSA score. While the surgical margins were negative, (no invasion detected in any of the surrounding fat) the invasion of the bladder neck caused him to want to make certain that we \u0093knock it all out in the early stages\u0094. He said the length of time on HT will be determined by my PSA score in October. My URO has referred me to an RO with outstanding credentials. I plan to meet with the RO in the next 30 days to get recommendations and opinions direct from the horses mouth. Still, if I am in the ZERO club in October...? My URO\u0092s response to that question is that he has seen an improved long term cure rate in cases like mine with immediate HT and SRT. I have followed his advice to this point but only after my own research and I still feel that the right decisions were made to have the surgery. Given the knowledge I have provided, I am looking to the Forum for thoughts and advice about the next steps... Wait and watch PSA? Radiation regardless or based on PSA or uPSA? Radiation and HT? Looking forward to hearing your thoughts... Thanks",

      "Content": "Djin - LVI is positive. Plan to wait until October for PSA because my URO recommended waiting 3-4 months (aligned with Protoman info) for healing. He said that even though I am not suffering some of the side effects, it does not mean that I\u0092m healed internally. So, his recommendation is to do PSA or uPSA in early October and then move forward. But, in his mind, even at <.01 he will recommend HT and SRT. He thinks the action of HT/SRT will be the best chance to eliminate the risk of a cell or two that might have escaped the surgery. He also believes that those cells will be weakest as soon as I heal from the surgery. The thought he is proposing is that you should not wait until cancer cells begin to grow again. Attach again while they are weak. Protoman\u0092s advice was wait for PSA results then act after a rise (assuming a very low starting uPSA score). Any other thoughts?",

      "Content": "Thanks guys for the feedback. I plan to get an earlier appointment with the URO RO to get answers to the questions posed in the earlier comments. I like the idea of two uPSA tests to get the baseline set. Just for confirmation, at this point I am neither opposed nor supportive of moving forward with HT/SRT. I am looking for the RIGHT answer. In my opinion, the best answers are based on data points so getting a couple from uPSA tests is a good start. Thanks again for the help in getting a \u0093clear path\u0094 aligned in my head.",

      "Content": "First post to any Forum, so please excuse or inform me of mistakes. Just looking for a place to share and get feedback. I donÂ\u2019t know how to put all the data into the bottom of the post so will just start with that: Currently 55 years old 2012 PSA 3 2014 PSA 3.5 2016 PSA 6 2016 Biopsy - 12 cores - all negative 2017 PSA 8 2018 PSA 9 2018 MRI - Prostate volume 33c, Lesion involving anterior central gland. Peripheral zone - no lesions. Seminal vesicles normal. Extracapsular extension: Lesion broadly involves the fibromuscular Strong. Extra prosthetic extension is not excluded based on slight bulging. 2018 MRI-Funsion Ultrasound-Guided Biopsy - 5 Areas - Right and left lateral and medial cores all benign - 7 cores taken directly from legion identified. 2 cores positive. Gleason (3+4)=7. 5% and 10%. No perineural of Lymphovascular invasion identified. Got the news on May 19th in phone call from URO. Very emotional. Most of my paternal family has died from some kind of cancer. Father and Sister died within 90 days of each other in 2006. (Pancreatic and Ovarian). I have been tested every 3 years since then for every kind of cancer that has a test. All clear but the PSA. Didn\u2019t know what to feel. Did tests to know, now struggling with that knowledge... On May 24th, had in person meeting with URO. He displayed confidence that this cancer was curable! (Obviously, no gaurantee but he stated some comforting statistics.). He discussed multiple options. Everything from surgery to radiation to focal therapy. He asked us (my wife went with me to the meeting) not to make any decisions yet. Just let emotions settle down and set up another office visit for May 10th. That is where it sits today... MODERATOR'S NOTE: In his latest post, Sabertex had the following correction to make regarding this initial post: *****In my original post, I mistakenly made reference to two dates in May. Both dates were in April. ***** Emotions still spiral up and down... My mother is still alive and we have three kids. Two kids are grown up and married and the third is on his last year of college. At this moment, only my wife knows about the diagnosis. I didn\u2019t want to share the bad news with everyone else without being able to say \u201cbut this is the plan\u201d. While the URO gave many options, he said his recommendation was surgery because he thought it was the best possibilty for a cure. He also mentioned the need to understand if the cancer was outside of the capsule. He said if there was external cancer that the location of the cancer was covered by some fatty tissue and because it was early detection, he could probably get anything outside. He spent more than an hour drawing pictures of my prostate, the location of the cancer, the ability to spare nerve bundles with significant margins, etc... He has performed the surgery more than 800 times. In the meantime... I have cancer and am desperately in need of information and data. I found this forum in a Google Search and it appears very active. I am hopeful that the group will chime in with suggestions, thoughts, opinions and data that will help me in considerations. Thanks.",

      "Content": "First post to any Forum, so please excuse or inform me of mistakes. Just looking for a place to share and get feedback. I donÂ\u2019t know how to put all the data into the bottom of the post so will just start with that: Currently 55 years old 2012 PSA 3 2014 PSA 3.5 2016 PSA 6 2016 Biopsy - 12 cores - all negative 2017 PSA 8 2018 PSA 9 2018 MRI - Prostate volume 33c, Lesion involving anterior central gland. Peripheral zone - no lesions. Seminal vesicles normal. Extracapsular extension: Lesion broadly involves the fibromuscular Strong. Extra prosthetic extension is not excluded based on slight bulging. 2018 MRI-Funsion Ultrasound-Guided Biopsy - 5 Areas - Right and left lateral and medial cores all benign - 7 cores taken directly from legion identified. 2 cores positive. Gleason (3+4)=7. 5% and 10%. No perineural of Lymphovascular invasion identified. Got the news on May 19th in phone call from URO. Very emotional. Most of my paternal family has died from some kind of cancer. Father and Sister died within 90 days of each other in 2006. (Pancreatic and Ovarian). I have been tested every 3 years since then for every kind of cancer that has a test. All clear but the PSA. Didn\u2019t know what to feel. Did tests to know, now struggling with that knowledge... On May 24th, had in person meeting with URO. He displayed confidence that this cancer was curable! (Obviously, no gaurantee but he stated some comforting statistics.). He discussed multiple options. Everything from surgery to radiation to focal therapy. He asked us (my wife went with me to the meeting) not to make any decisions yet. Just let emotions settle down and set up another office visit for May 10th. That is where it sits today... MODERATOR'S NOTE: In his latest post, Sabertex had the following correction to make regarding this initial post: *****In my original post, I mistakenly made reference to two dates in May. Both dates were in April. ***** Emotions still spiral up and down... My mother is still alive and we have three kids. Two kids are grown up and married and the third is on his last year of college. At this moment, only my wife knows about the diagnosis. I didn\u2019t want to share the bad news with everyone else without being able to say \u201cbut this is the plan\u201d. While the URO gave many options, he said his recommendation was surgery because he thought it was the best possibilty for a cure. He also mentioned the need to understand if the cancer was outside of the capsule. He said if there was external cancer that the location of the cancer was covered by some fatty tissue and because it was early detection, he could probably get anything outside. He spent more than an hour drawing pictures of my prostate, the location of the cancer, the ability to spare nerve bundles with significant margins, etc... He has performed the surgery more than 800 times. In the meantime... I have cancer and am desperately in need of information and data. I found this forum in a Google Search and it appears very active. I am hopeful that the group will chime in with suggestions, thoughts, opinions and data that will help me in considerations.

During that time I have read the latest version of Dr. Walsh\u0092s book, consulted 2 additional surgeons, and consulted 2 RO specialists. I was surprised by the range of recommendations, and the conviction with which they were delivered, from what seemed to be very knowledgeable sources. For me, at 55 years of age and excellent health, I have decided on RALP. I am working with a top surgeon in the area who performs several of these a week. He even gave me a list of names to contact from recent procedures. His process sounds very much like I expected. In for the procedure on June 14, expect 1 day in hospital with check out the next day. Return to Dr office 7 days later for catheter removal and review of pathology. Thanks again for all the support. Looking forward to the next phase of this Journey to ZERO!",

      "Content": "Bholmes, Welcome to the Forum. Like me, I am sure you will find both valuable information and outstanding support from the Forum Brothers. As you can see in my signature (info at the bottom) I am an example of a member with initial negative Biopsy only to follow with different information later. As referred to earlier, there could be several non-cancer related items that have impacted your PSA. At least one additional PSA test might show a continued dropping trend. In my opinion, that is at least worth a conversation with your Urologist. Second, if I could get insurance coverage for an MRI before the biopsy, I would do the MRI first. That would allow for a more informed approach to the biopsy and could lead to more accurate results in a shorter cycle time. (ie you don\u0092t do the first biopsy only to discover that you will need to wait some time period and then have another MRI Guided biopsy). The biopsy itself was just not really a big deal in my case. The first one was done with me awake and the second was done under general anesthesia because the lesion was in the anterior of my prostate. So, biopsy is not a challenge, dealing with uncertainty is a challenge. My advice is to stay engaged. If the first biopsy is negative, don\u0092t give up on PSA testing! Stay the course and continue testing. If it keeps going up you have to find out why. It may be Cancer, but it could be something much easier. Keep us informed and I wish you all the best! I hope you never join the PC club and just use the Forum to get needed info.",

      "Content": "Bholmes, Welcome to the Forum. Like me, I am sure you will find both valuable information and outstanding support from the Forum Brothers. As you can see in my signature (info at the bottom) I am an example of a member with initial negative Biopsy only to follow with different information later. As referred to earlier, there could be several non-cancer related items that have impacted your PSA. At least one additional PSA test might show a continued dropping trend. In my opinion, that is at least worth a conversation with your Urologist. Second, if I could get insurance coverage for an MRI before the biopsy, I would do the MRI first. That would allow for a more informed approach to the biopsy and could lead to more accurate results in a shorter cycle time. (ie you don\u0092t do the first biopsy only to discover that you will need to wait some time period and then have another MRI Guided biopsy). The biopsy itself was just not really a big deal in my case. The first one was done with me awake and the second was done under general anesthesia because the lesion was in the anterior of my prostate. So, biopsy is not a challenge, dealing with uncertainty is a challenge. My advice is to stay engaged. If the first biopsy is negative, don\u0092t give up on PSA testing! Stay the course and continue testing. If it keeps going up you have to find out why. It may be Cancer, but it could be something much easier. Keep us informed and I wish you all the best! I hope you never join the PC club and just use the Forum to get needed info.",
