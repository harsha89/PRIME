      "Content": "Hello Readers, I am posting for the first time on this forum, and I believe outreach, in the form of sharing experiences, can be helpful to others. I'm beginning my fifth year of treatment and survivorship, after being diagnosed in 2013. As with most fellows, I had experienced a lifetime of perfect health, up to that point in time. A visit to the clinic resulted in some dire news ... a PSA reading of 138. After follow-up tests ... MRIs, a bone scan, CT scans, and a lung biopsy, it was also determined that my prostate cancer had infiltrated both of my lungs. Needless to say, my treatments began immediately! Initial ADT shots brought my PSA down to single digits within the first month. That gave me a lot of hope and determination! From there, continued ADT shots brought my PSA down into the low decimal range. I hope my experience will encourage others who are just starting out on ADT hormone shots, after a diagnosis of prostate cancer. Within a few months, I joined the first wave of fellows who were treated with what has been nicknamed \"the early chemo plan\" in the summer of 2014. I was thankful that a new, proactive approach to treating advanced cases emerged, following the release of clinical studies which showed an advantage to pursuing \"early\" chemotherapy infusions. I was able to navigate successfully through a series of TAXOTERE chemotherapy treatments ... six treatments, every three weeks, over the course of 18 months. To boost my immune system, I also received NEULASTA injections. During this time, my PSA continued to drop, bit by bit, with each subsequent chemo treatment. My experience has left me an advocate for the importance of considering the \"early chemo\" plan for cases like mine. Since then, several friends of mine have also pursued this treatment approach. After my chemotherapy treatments were finished, my oncologist recommended that I start on ZYTIGA ... one of the newer breakthrough medications that has emerged in the past few years for the treatments of advanced prostate cancer. The combination of chemotherapy treatments, followed by ZYTIGA, has resulted in my PSA remaining in the lower decimal range. My medical team is comprised of my original urologist, my primary oncologist, and a specialized urology oncologist at Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota. They consult together on my case, share test results, and confer together as a team. I appreciate their teamwork approach. I want to encourage other readers who have received a diagnosis of prostate cancer with my story today. I have remained active since my diagnosis --- I exercise throughout the week, I continue to work full-time, I work on volunteer projects, I pursue my usual hobbies, and attend social events. I believe that staying ACTIVE ... physically and mentally ... is important to anyone facing a cancer diagnosis. Ironically, since my diagnosis, other friends of mine have been diagnosed with prostate cancer. These friends of mine are from every chapter of my life ... hometown friends, college friends, church friends, work colleagues, and community friends. I have formed a \"bond of brotherhood\" with each one of them and we support and encourage each other, through and through. One life lesson I have learned, since my diagnosis, that I would like to share with others. I believe there is no substitute for the importance of family, friends, and faith, in whatever form that takes for each individual, is essential in \"facing forward\" as one's treatments continue. While a cancer diagnosis might now be a chapter in your life's story, as it is in mine ... that doesn't mean that a cancer diagnosis should become the title of your BOOK OF LIFE. Words to encourage you ... words to support you ... words to reflect upon ... This past fall, I participated in a couple of 5K distance cancer charity events ... with hundreds of other survivors and supporters ... something that might not have seemed like a possibility on that day I heard the news of my diagnosis. Some months ago, there came a day when I realized I had lived through well over 1,000 sunrises and sunsets since \"diagnosis day\" ... right now, I'm looking forward to celebrating my fifth Thanksgiving, Christmas, and New Year's Day since I was diagnosed. I hope that something in my story will encourage other \"Brothers In The Battle\" who stand alongside me ... along with their family and friends. Friendship, camaraderie, fellowship, \"Cyclone\" ~ Iowa State University",

      "Content": "Hello ~ I have been on 3 forms of ADT shots --- first LUPRON, then FIRMAGON, and currently --- ZOLADEX. My oncologist began to see \"spikes and flares\" in my PSA and felt that we might be able to attain greater control of my PSA by trying different forms of ADT shots --- I've been on ZOLADEX shots for quite a few months now. In my case, the ZOLADEX suppressed the testosterone level to a higher degree, which resulted in more suppression of the PSA levels, in my particular case. If you continue to have problems with ZOLADEX, your oncologist should be able to advise you on trying the other forms of ADT shots such as FIRMAGON or LUPRON. I was able to transition from one to another, over time, as each of these shots \"expired\" --- Something that many doctors fail to do --- when going in for your usual lab draws to test PSA levels, occasionally ask for a simple testosterone level test --- no matter what form of ADT shot you might be on (LUPRON, FIRMAGON, ZOLADEX) --- you want to make sure your testosterone level is suppressed to a high degree, in the interest of suppressing PSA to the greatest extent possible. Let us know how you are faring ~ since I am also on ZOLADEX, I wanted to reach out with a response to you today. Sent with my best, \"Cyclone\" Team Fan ~ Iowa State University",

      "Content": "Hello StiffUpperLip, I'm sorry to hear about your dad's diagnosis. As you can tell, this is a supportive website, with many threads that can help advise you and lend you some support. Each case is different, of course. Make certain that your dad seeks out the expertise of an oncologist who specializes in cancer cases with complexities. I'm starting my fifth year of treatment and survivorship, since being diagnosed with advanced prostate cancer back in 2013. I remember thinking, \"This is serious. Will I even live to see Christmas?\" I was in my 40s when I was diagnosed --- and the prostate cancer had already spread into both of my lungs, which was sobering news, of course. What happened from there? Treatments started immediately --- and that's what started giving me determination --- and most importantly --- HOPE. I started on ADT hormone shots --- in my case, LUPRON. After one month, my PSA dropped down from over 100 down to single digits. It REALLY encouraged me. ADT hormone shots, such as LUPRON, FIRMAGON, or ZOLADEX can really help bring down the PSA --- those shots will attack all the hormone SENSITIVE cancer cells. In my case, once we got the ADT shots started --- then, with my oncologist's encouragement, I started a series of chemotherapy treatments --- in my case, the chemotherapy used was TAXOTERE --- I had six infusions, given 3 weeks apart, for a total of 18 weeks. The chemo is able to attack many of the stubborn, resistant cancer cells. Your dad's oncologist will advise him on this --- and whether a series of chemo treatments would help him. I can honestly say they helped me a great deal --- and they knocked my PSA levels down to low decimal numbers. That was three full years ago now ... so that is why I share my \"chemo story\" with others. Since then, other friends of mine who have been diagnosed with prostate cancer have also pursued chemo treatments --- and it has helped each one of them. There are also several new breakthrough medications which can help your dad. There are treatments such as PROVENGE, XOFIGO, XTANDI, and ZYTIGA. These have emerged in the past few years. In my case, after my chemo infusions were over, my oncologist recommended that we try ZYTIGA, to help manage and even suppress my PSA levels. That was 28 months ago --- and I'm still taking ZYTIGA. It has helped keep my PSA suppressed for over two years. I'm thankful for these breakthrough treatments and medications which have helped me and other \"brothers in the battle\" who stand alongside me. I hope something in my story is helpful and encouraging to you and your father. Seek out an expert --- explore the options --- ask questions --- and don't discredit the potential benefits of these newer treatments and medications. I faced a tough diagnosis and I am now looking forward to celebrating my fifth Thanksgiving, Christmas, and New Year's Day since my treatments began. A message of hope, from across the miles, \"Cyclone\" Team Fan ~ Iowa State University",
