      "Content": "I had 8 biopsies in 6 years. My PSA reached 12.1. My last 6 biopsies had at least 15 samples each, the very last one, Dec. 14, 2005, being a \"saturation\" biopsy of 29 samples. Finally, cancer was found in 2 of the 29 samples, only 0.5% had cancer. Gleason is 3+3=6, T1C. I'm scheduled for Da Vinci robot surgery March 13th. A few years ago 3 biopsies had Free PSA around 10%, not good. I'm glad to hear that someone else has had so many biopsies.",
