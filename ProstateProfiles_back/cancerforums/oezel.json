      "Content": "Oh, yes, he is a great man. PD Dr. Lars Budaus. The night before the OP, he visited me in my room and gave me info about the procedure. I am a kind of man who doesn't take things serious and I was fooling, I asked him \"How do you cut it?\" He said, \"vertical\" \"Is it not possible to cut it horizantal?\" \"No, I will cut you vertical and if you want it horizantal, you should find another doctor!\" Then he said that he was going to remove the lymph nodes too and when he saw the shadow in my face he continued \"I dont leave it to chance, before the pathalogy, nobody knows if they are invaded or not, they should be removed and sent to pathalogy. So if you want to keep your lymph nodes, you should find another doctor!\" Then I said \"No, Sir! You are the boss!\" The next day, he visited me with his assistant Paula and told me that everything went fine. The only problem he had was that my pelvic area was very narrow and it gave him a hard time. I asked them \"Is my penis going to be shorter now?\" They were laughing to hell and said \" Bladder is a very elastical organ, so if you pull your penis hard enough it will come to its original length!\" Of course these were not serious, only jokes but you all know how helpful they were. At the end, as I was leaving the hospital, I remember, I said to him: \"You are not Mr. Budaus, you are Zeus!\" Now, on the 19th of December I hope to be sitting in front of him in Hamburg. I trust him very much and I think this is the halfway in recovery.",

      "Content": "Thanks a lot for your reply. You made me feel better, I appreciate it. The thing is I always thought the prostate glands which are taken away with the prostate during the OP, would secrete this jelly-like colorless fluid when someone is sexually excited. (Not the orgasm) This is what I am living. Anyway, I was thinking I knew a lot about such matters, but as you see, I had no idea about the Cowper's glands. Thank you again. I'll go on sharing my experiences.",

      "Content": "Hi everyone. I am 61 years old and I was diagnosed cancer in december 2013 in Martini clinic, Hamburg-Germany. (1 positive in 12 cores, Gleason score 3+3=6, stage T1c) First I was advised for active watching and did it but as everybody here knows, it's not that easy to live together with the unwanted guest in the body, I decided for RP. Had it in May 2014. Nerves were spared and the pathology report said that the cancer was confined to prostate and everything, including the lymph knots were negative. August 2013 PSA :0.003 undedectable November 2013 PSA : 0.003 undedectable. I have a few questions I would like to ask, if I may... No incontinence, minor drops from time to time and I'm not using pads. But, now I wake up every 2,5 - 3 hours at night to visit the WC. Is my bladder smaller now or is there another reason? (I should say it's a wonderful feeling to pee like a young man AGAIN!) At the 6th month some action started down there but till now I didn't have an erection enough for a sexual relation, but I am very hopeful about it. I was told that I would have dry orgasms but to my surprise I am ejeculating urine and it's like the water out of the firehose which is very unpleasant. And lastly, anytime I am getting excited, a kind of jelly-like fluid is wetting my penis, like the prostate excitement fluid we all used to have in good old days! It makes me afraid but still my PSA reports are undedectable. I am really confused. I did not use any kind of medicine after the operation, not even an aspirin. I am from Turkey and as English is not my native language, please excuse me for my mistakes. At the moment I am in Turkey and on the 19th of December I will visit my doctor and surgeon in Hamburg to ask all these questions. I know experience is very important and we should all share it. I wish that everything goes good with you all.",
