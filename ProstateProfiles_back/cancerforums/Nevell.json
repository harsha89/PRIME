    "Content": "Stevie,... I had my prostate removed Friday, April 24th. Almost a moth ago,... I thought I was mentally prepared for this recovery but I was wrong. I was a Gleason 8 (4+4), before the surgery, and a 5+3, afterwards. They took 21 Lymphnoids, and also my right neurovascular bundle. I am only 52 and facing ED the rest of my life, but that is a different story. Right now, my peeing is out of control. I chose to wear the Depends diapers because the have a more secure fit around my legs. I do my Kagels, but its like its not even working. I change depends, 3-4 times a day, 2 at night, and I take shower 3 times a day also. I can't feel when I am ready to pee, but I can feel it coming out. I also notice I pee when I stand up, or make quick movements. I gotta be honest, it is really messing with my head. Week 4, and I am peeing on my self everyday all day sucks, but I can only hope it gets better, and I gotta admit, its better than that catheter. My stomach is still sore, I walk around and do little chores around the house. I am a big man, 6-2 312lbs. BP is good and CHL. My appetite came back, but I am still scared to push myself. Before my surgery I was an avid golfer,... I shot a 77 two days before my surgery, Right now I am scared to even touch a golf club,.. . Anyways, hang in there, you are not alone, and after writing this post I feel better! #ISURVIVEDCANCER",
