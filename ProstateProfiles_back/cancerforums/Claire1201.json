      "Content": "Just wanted to share with you my husband just had da Vinci surgery today (posting while he sleeps in hospital bed) and he is 44. His PSA was 2.14 and biopsy 2 of 14 were positive, Gleason six. It took him quite a few weeks to recover from the biopsy as well. I know how you must be feeling. Im 31 and we struggled with knowing we would never have kids (the procedures are too expensive) but he has three wonderful girls of his own. I wish you the best.",
