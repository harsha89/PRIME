      "Content": "Hi - 62 yr old healthy - diagnosed stage T3, Gleason score 7. Urologist says prostatectomy. I have a severe anxiety disorder - the idea of a catheter and incontinence is repellant to me. He says without sx I will be dead in 10 years - I don't have a problem with that and think 72 would be a full life - both my parents died at 60. My real problem is my family and friends pushing for sx and possible radiotherapy after. I am not a coward - how do I explain to them what I know my gut feeling is saying - which is to let go and enjoy what I have left ? cheers to all of you, Mattie/",
