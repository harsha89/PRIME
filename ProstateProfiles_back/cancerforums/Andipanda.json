    "Content": "First off, thank you for sharing your experiences! My dad has had prostrate issues cor many years. But in February was experiencing leg edema. His GP ran some blood work and found a psa over 100. Referred dad to urologist who started injections to lower testosterone. Psa not effected, and edema got worse referred to oncologist. Ct showed provable mets to bone but none in organs. Bone biopsy showed prostrate ca in bone marrow. Dad the. Went into renal failure, hospitalized three weeks. Came out of that but VERY weak. Dad now in nursing home trying to get some strength back. He has been on zytiga for 2 months. Psa is constantly rising now has psa of 586. Anemia but ok iron levels, so tired... We are repeating ct scan next week. On ologist says there is another new hormonal med to try. Daddy is not in pain but with his psa rising and his energy so low... Is remission even possible ? Dad wants me to decide what to do. When to stop.. I know we wont pursue chemo. He wouldnt survive that... How long does he have ? Is it better to continue the fight ? So confusing i adore my dad but he is so weak isnt happy, and wants to know thinfs his doctors cant or wont tell him..... Any thoughts?",
