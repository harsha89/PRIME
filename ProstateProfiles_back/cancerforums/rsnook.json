      "Content": "I had robotic laparoscopy surgery on 2 Oct and had prostate removed, cancer was confined to prostate so supposedly good thing!!!??!?!? On 14 Oct catheter was taken out, and that was such a good feeling............ So here is my issue, Since then I have been doing these kegel exercises, and wearing depends, I know it has only been three weeks, but I am going thru 4-5 depends a day. I am not leaking,, it is more just like the catheter, just comes out. I am trying to find out from others if you had the same thing in the beginning, ,and when does it start to get a little better? I am very active, for example we had our Veteran's Day Parade on the 8th of Nov, and I was not sure I was going to make it without a stain on my uniform. Thank you",
