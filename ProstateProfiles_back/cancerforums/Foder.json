      "Content": "If I may chime in here, (6 months late, I know), I've been noticing little dark specks in my urine lately, yet my surgery was 17 months ago. I only see them occasionally, and there is always only one \"flake\", sometimes accompanied by a couple of very tiny grains about the size of a grain of pepper. The main one looks about the size of a small tea leaf when wet. They sit on the bottom, they don't float. The rest of the urine is plain pale yellow. Tonight I managed to fish one out with a rubber siphon, and squirted it on to a white paper towel. Close up, it just looks black, But when I smeared it, it looked more or less dark greenish/brown, or something like that. No pain, no burning, nothing else in the urine. It's always clear and pale. Tomorrow I'm seeing my GP but until a urine sample can be tested I was just wondering if anybody has any thoughts on what this might possible be.",

My sexual rehabilitation and recovery from erectile dysfunction has been one hell of a journey for me, and I did it all with the help of a very caring and understanding doctor here in Brisbane. Michael Gillman is a good man.. G'day, Jim. I just now found this post and as you mentioned Dr Gillman, I was interested. I have just been directed to him by a friend, and today made an appointment for a consultation. I've watched his video and he strikes me as a very switched-on, competent Doctor. I've tried to find \"reviews\" of his practice, and your endorsement certainly gives me more confidence in him. Thanks.",
