      "Content": "Greetings fellow travelers. So a \"routine\" PSA (9.49) in June began the process, which has involved an MRI, biopsy (Gleason 4+3), procedural delays, and my first Lupron shot in November. I am now about a third of the way through a course of 26 high-intensity IMRT treatments, having selected that as my primary therapy. (I still have a prostate, sporting three calypso beacons, although it is slowly being fried.) Here's my question: I know that my urologist is going to want to keep me on Lupron for a while. Why? I know there is \"some data\" that shows people who continue ADT after radiation live longer, but I am skeptical. What is the theory of action? No one says Lupron kills the cancer. My radiation oncologist is highly confident that his ray gun is going to destroy any cancer in the prostate bed. He also characterized the information supporting the value of continued ADT as highly uncertain. This may be a situation where I prioritize near term quality of life over some dubious promise of a longer life. Foolish move?",

I especially appreciate Another\u0092s recommendation not to try to \u0093outthink\u0094 prostate cancer. While I am clearly guilty of that, I would submit that that is really all we mere humans have. I can leave the thinking to the doctors and medical researchers or I can be an active participant. So here comes more denial: Doing my own review of the literature, I find the research that I believe drives current guidelines. The logic is all based on five-year survival rates. Patients with high-risk PCa who are on ADT for 2 years have a higher 5-year survival rate than those on ADT for six months. Well duh! They have had less time for the cancer to rebound. The way I understand it, ADT is just a timeout. It stops the clock in the progression of the disease\u0097until it doesn\u0092t. According to the research, it doesn\u0092t seem to matter whether you use your timeout all at once or intermittently. (EAU Guidelines) In other words, I can endure the side effects of ADT now or later\u0097it doesn\u0092t seem to matter. Furthermore, the studies driving the guidelines are necessarily based on data from older treatment regimens. Some feel that new RT regimes change the equation: \u0093Adding ADT to modern dose-escalated RT was not associated with improved survival for patients with favorable intermediate-risk prostate cancer.\u0094 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27191936 Add to the equation the negative effects on quality of life, the increased risk of diabetes, osteoporosis, and maybe heart disease from ADT, and the analysis seems to tip the other way. Here\u0092s the nub. (literally) One of the benefits of radiation over surgery (at least at my risk level) is that radiation spares your erection\u0097but only for a while. After six months, so I read, it starts going south. Do I really want to decline my last shot at a sex life for a dubious promise of a few more months on the back end of my life?",
