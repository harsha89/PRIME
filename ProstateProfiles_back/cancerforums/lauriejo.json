      "Content": "My husband was treated with HIFU on September 25 in Nassau, The Bahamas by Dr. Scionti. The treatment took approximately 4 hours and another couple hours for him to come around from the anesthesia. We were back in our hotel room by 3 pm. and out and about by 5 p.m. We went for a long walk and we really did go out to dinner that night and even slow danced outside by the marina. He wasn't 100%, but definitely not in the shape I have seen him in after other surgeries. Dr. Scionti feels confident that he zapped all the cancer cells, but stayed clear of the nerve bundles which are so important for continence and potency. The HIFU staff was professional, caring and very competent. The only drawbacks I can see is the fact that it cost $25000 out of pocket, and that we had to travel to Nassau for the treatment. Although, we did get a good deal on the hotel at Atlantis by booking through HIFU International. We plan on submitting the itemized bill to our Insurance company and I will keep you all posted on the outcome of reimbursement.",

      "Content": "My husband was treated with HIFU on September 25 in Nassau, The Bahamas by Dr. Scionti. The treatment took approximately 4 hours and another couple hours for him to come around from the anesthesia. We were back in our hotel room by 3 pm. and out and about by 5 p.m. We went for a long walk and we really did go out to dinner that night and even slow danced outside by the marina. He wasn't 100%, but definitely not in the shape I have seen him in after other surgeries. Dr. Scionti feels confident that he zapped all the cancer cells, but stayed clear of the nerve bundles which are so important for continence and potency. The HIFU staff was professional, caring and very competent. The only drawbacks I can see is the fact that it cost $25000 out of pocket, and that we had to travel to Nassau for the treatment. Although, we did get a good deal on the hotel at Atlantis by booking through HIFU International. We plan on submitting the itemized bill to our Insurance company and I will keep you all posted on the outcome of reimbursement.",

      "Content": "My husband was treated with HIFU on September 25 in Nassau, The Bahamas by Dr. Scionti. The treatment took approximately 4 hours and another couple hours for him to come around from the anesthesia. We were back in our hotel room by 3 pm. and out and about by 5 p.m. We went for a long walk and we really did go out to dinner that night and even slow danced outside by the marina. He wasn't 100%, but definitely not in the shape I have seen him in after other surgeries. Dr. Scionti feels confident that he zapped all the cancer cells, but stayed clear of the nerve bundles which are so important for continence and potency. The HIFU staff was professional, caring and very competent. The only drawbacks I can see is the fact that it cost $25000 out of pocket, and that we had to travel to Nassau for the treatment. Although, we did get a good deal on the hotel at Atlantis by booking through HIFU International. We plan on submitting the itemized bill to our Insurance company and I will keep you all posted on the outcome of reimbursement.",

      "Content": "My husband was treated with HIFU on September 25 in Nassau, The Bahamas by Dr. Scionti. The treatment took approximately 4 hours and another couple hours for him to come around from the anesthesia. We were back in our hotel room by 3 pm. and out and about by 5 p.m. We went for a long walk and we really did go out to dinner that night and even slow danced outside by the marina. He wasn't 100%, but definitely not in the shape I have seen him in after other surgeries. Dr. Scionti feels confident that he zapped all the cancer cells, but stayed clear of the nerve bundles which are so important for continence and potency. The HIFU staff was professional, caring and very competent. The only drawbacks I can see is the fact that it cost $25000 out of pocket, and that we had to travel to Nassau for the treatment. Although, we did get a good deal on the hotel at Atlantis by booking through HIFU International. We plan on submitting the itemized bill to our Insurance company and I will keep you all posted on the outcome of reimbursement.",

      "Content": "My husband was treated with HIFU on September 25 in Nassau, The Bahamas by Dr. Scionti. The treatment took approximately 4 hours and another couple hours for him to come around from the anesthesia. We were back in our hotel room by 3 pm. and out and about by 5 p.m. We went for a long walk and we really did go out to dinner that night and even slow danced outside by the marina. He wasn't 100%, but definitely not in the shape I have seen him in after other surgeries. Dr. Scionti feels confident that he zapped all the cancer cells, but stayed clear of the nerve bundles which are so important for continence and potency. The HIFU staff was professional, caring and very competent. The only drawbacks I can see is the fact that it cost $25000 out of pocket, and that we had to travel to Nassau for the treatment.

      "Content": "My husband was treated with HIFU on September 25 in Nassau, The Bahamas by Dr. Scionti. The treatment took approximately 4 hours and another couple hours for him to come around from the anesthesia. We were back in our hotel room by 3 pm. and out and about by 5 p.m. We went for a long walk and we really did go out to dinner that night and even slow danced outside by the marina. He wasn't 100%, but definitely not in the shape I have seen him in after other surgeries. Dr. Scionti feels confident that he zapped all the cancer cells, but stayed clear of the nerve bundles which are so important for continence and potency. The HIFU staff was professional, caring and very competent. The only drawbacks I can see is the fact that it cost $25000 out of pocket, and that we had to travel to Nassau for the treatment. Although, we did get a good deal on the hotel at Atlantis by booking through HIFU International. We plan on submitting the itemized bill to our Insurance company and I will keep you all posted on the outcome of reimbursement.",
