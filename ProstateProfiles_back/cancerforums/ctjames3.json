      "Content": "Well, I had my robotic surgery on yesterday. Trying to get used to the catheter as well as the soreness from the incision. Doctor was very positive as far as success of surgery. The only time I ever had a catheter before was for knee surgery and that came off after a day. The idea of this bag going with me every step is taking some getting used too. Any advice on best way or best place {bed or chair} to sleep would be welcomed. Thanks",

      "Content": "My name is Carlton, 65 year old Afro American recently diagnosed with PC, Gleason score 7, 3+4 clinical stage t1c, with PIN 2 at left mid and right mid. I was diagnosed earlier this month and have Davinci surgery scheduled for the 19th of this month. I've been reading on here for the last two weeks and i am really glad i found this place. My PSA had for the last three years been in the 3,6 range and this year went up tp 4.7, and after a script of Cipro for six weeks the subsequent PSA was 5.3. I was not prepared for that at all. I also suffer from long term low testosterone and was looking to get replacement therapy via implants. Obviously, that is on the back burner for now. I am just hoping the surgery takes care of the problem but if not, reading on here is helping me prepare for whatever happens. So thanks to all of you, you've made it easy for me to say, new member in the club.",

      "Content": "Hi, I had surgery last thursday and had the catheter taken out yesterday. It took me about 2 days to get used to carrying that bag around and the constant but minor discomfort of having it in in the first place. That said, it is really no big deal. My bigger deal is dealing with and working on incontinence, which unlike the catheter is not going away without some work. I would really try to focus on post catheter, because that is where the rest of your life is. Take care and best of luck.",
