    "Content": "Hello. I am new to this forum: I am 75 and in pretty good health. Have had a sudden increase in my PSA level which led to a 3-D MRI which led to a score indicating I might have cancer. I have been scheduled for a biopsy in about five weeks. This seems too long to wait. My Urologist said prostate cancer is slow growing, so if I have it the delay is an acceptable risk. I think it is too long to wait. I am in need of people's experience, thoughts and guidance on this matter? Thank you. OUMike",
