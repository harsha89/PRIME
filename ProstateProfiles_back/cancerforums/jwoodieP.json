      "Content": "I am just completing four months of HT and eight weeks of RT, and I am trying to understand the therapeutic benefits of continuing HT for the next year or so. As it has been explained to me, HT shrinks/starves PC cells and makes them more susceptible to RT. Assuming the RT has been \"successful\" (PSA=0), what benefit would further HT produce? Or is it simply a precautionary palliative measure? Thanks for any info you can provide.",

      "Content": "Hello, I am new to this forum and appreciate all the support and sharing of information and experiences. I seem to be an anomaly (so the docs tell me) in that, over the past ten years, my PSA has risen from 12 to 60 (3 yr doubling time) with five negative saturation needle biopsies. My doc finally performed a TURP biopsy (no BPH) a month ago and found a small G 3+4 on one of five chips. (I am still having urgency problems from that procedure.) I have had clear CT and Bone scans, but a possible complication is that I was prescribed Proscar for two years to see if it would bring my PSA down: I subsequently discovered that Proscar can result in more aggressive PC. I am now faced with a decision on treatment with little or no guidance from the docs: \"It is your decision.\" Even extensive research on my part has not yielded a clearer picture on how best to deal with my anomalous situation. Anyone with a similar experience or thoughts on treatment options? I am 65 years old and otherwise in good health.",

      "Content": "Thanks for the info. I always seems to fall into an intermediate category (G4+3, possible extension, clear scans) with no clear treatment direction. I am doing OK with HT/RT, but concerned about long term complications. Also, I haven't been able to get any explanations of how/why my specific treatment regimen has been determined, other than \"that's just the way we do it.\" I am wary of medicine practiced by statistics instead of individual diagnoses.",
