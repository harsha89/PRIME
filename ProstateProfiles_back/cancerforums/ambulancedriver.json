    "Content": "HIFU by ambulancedriver on Thu Oct 24, 2013 05:06 PM Quote | Reply Hi all, Vitals: Hudson Valley, NY, 73 years old, PSA 5.0, Gleason 7, 12-core biopsy, 4 cores 3/3, 1 core 3/4, 7 cores benign. CT & Bone Scans negative. Urologist believes cancer is confined to the prostate. Tomorrow 10/25 I go to Nassau, Bahamas. HIFU is scheduled for 10/26, to be performed by Dr. Suarez. I'm hoping for good things. I believe HIFU is the way to go in my situation, but as we all know it's pricey. Best of luck to all.",
