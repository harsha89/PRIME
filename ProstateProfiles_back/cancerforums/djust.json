      "Content": "Thanks guys. I will pick up the Dr Scholz book also. I am hoping I can make it 5 years on AS then I should be on the cusp of retiring, it looks like the odds are favorable for that unless my PSA continues to rise to to a level that makes me take another turn. Only leaning towards surgery because if anything is missed radiation can be used at that time to do the clean up job, but from what I understand radiation that fails does not allow surgery afterwards, which I think is just because of the damage the radiation does but not sure yet. I did come across a part of DR. Walsh's book that says if your on the younger healthier side and have more than 10 years of life expectancy then you should be thinking about getting rid of it now. But that is a little contradictory of many views on AS. I am going to at least wait on the next biopsy which should come by the fall and if it doesn't find anything worse than the last time, take it from there. Repeat biopsy's increases the odds something else being found if it's there or confirm that maybe Gleason 6 is all that's there which would keep me on the track I'm on. More than likely at some point I am going to have to get it taken care of and I can't find a lot info on how good the Dr's are around here.",

      "Content": "When the time comes for the next biopsy I am going to ask again about an MRI guided one. I asked URO about it right after the first biopsy and he said they usually do that with patients that have a rising PSA but the first biopsy found nothing. He explained it in a way that made it seem like if we don't find anything with the first biopsy the second one will be MRI guided so I am going to ask for it anyway the next time.",

      "Content": "I was diagnosed last summer with PC and am currently on AS. Just had my 2nd PSA test in my 3 month intervals of getting tested under the AS regiment. Again my PSA made what seems like another significant jump of .7 to PSA level of 6. I know next summer I am looking at another Biopsy which might or might not come back with something different from the first time. My cancer that they found is not aggressive yet and may never be and most of the time i'm ok with just waiting for the next test and hoping that before I have to do something about it a better treatment will come along. But I go through spells where it's all I think about, and then times where I feel comfortable with my decision to trust my URO and just keep keeping on. My wife has had more trouble with the AS decision than I have but fully supports any decisions that I make knowing that any decision affects us both. I am in the middle of Dr. Walsh book and am very grateful to the advise I have read on here about the book, it is calming and alarming at the same time but I am in this eyes wide open and don't want to hide from any of the realities that we will almost certainly face at some time in the future. I have started trying to look for good prostate surgeons in my area and all I can come up with are just the basic canned reviews like buying a car somewhere, I live in the middle of Oklahoma the closest best surgeons appear to be in Houston. My URO said whenever I'm ready and the time is right he will get with an RO he works closely with and we can come up with a plan whether it be surgery or radiation. So far I really like my URO he hasn't sugar coated anything and has not pushed me in one direction or another and believes AS is what I should be doing so I am following his advise for now. This forum has been invaluable to me so far and I typed all this out for some advice on how to go about finding the right surgeon, or if there is anyone on here that has had good or bad experiences in my area I would like to hear about them here or in private whatever you feel most comfortable with. Thanks",
