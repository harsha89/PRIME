      "Content": "My husband wants another PSA test. I am so frustrated by this. His numbers have increased for last 5 years, doubling in past year. They have consistently increased. Dr felt a \"scaly\" patch on exam. His brother passed from this disease. He said he wants another PSA test, preferably from another lab, even if he has to pay for it. I can't understand his reasoning. Just get the darn biopsy. No matter what the PSA test result is, the dr told him to get a biopsy and also told him he suspects CA. My husband said the dr said that to \"cover himself\" which is crazy. The dr would only tell him and document that he suggested a biopsy, not give him his feeling on whether or not it is cancer to cover himself. My personal opinion is that he's in a bit of denial and only listening to those telling him that they had biopsies and were fine. He doesn't understand that just because he has no other symptoms that it doesn't mean he doesn't have cancer, just that it could be in an early stage. Any suggestions on this? Would another PSA test really be so different? Would it matter? Thank you. \"A frustrated wife\"~~~",

I didn't see anything in particular regarding this, so anyone who would like to jump in please do so. We're aware that he'll probably want small light meals (soups) etc, but wondering if there is anything you'd like to add. Although tests and dr appts are scheduled for Jan with hopefully surgery late Jan-early Feb, he'd like a jump start on eating healthier in regards to prostate health. We know the surgeon will give him all the info he needs in regards to pre-post surgery, but asking for those who went before us is very beneficial. A side note...he is in very good, if not excellent health with this prostate cancer being the exception. He was on cholesteral meds for years but tried to keep his numbers down on his own. Lost weight, eats very healthy, but it's a hereditary disease and his numbers climbed up and he was told today to go back on it. Other than that, he is perfect weight. He does like dairy, which he's cut down on (yogurts, cottage cheese, regular cheeses) to every other day. Rarely red meat (had lasagna last month). Otherwise lots of fish, chicken, salads, fruits and veggies. Hardly any sweets. Thank you for any info you care to share.",

We understand it could take a year or so for him to have feelings and erections again. However, he has no idea how the men on this board are achieving orgasm without an erection. He takes 100mg of Sildenafil 3x a week. He says that he wakes up around 4 am with a slight erection on the mornings after he takes the drug (he takes it mid day). But it\u0092s semi hard, doesn\u0092t last, and although he tries to self stimulate he loses it quickly. He hasn\u0092t gotten any \u0093twinges\u0094 for lack of a better word. He\u0092s baffled on how to orgasm without getting hard. Anyone have advice, words of experience? Thank you",

      "Content": "My husband has asked me to give you a complete update on his RALP surgery to help all of you facing this. This site offered invaluable information to us and it\u0092s our turn to give back. My husband\u0092s brother passed away fro PC (12 years ago) at age 57. My husband is turning 65. His PSA numbers were starting to rise and doubled in a year. This past Sept they were a 4. We went to an Urologist who suggested a BX stating he strongly suspected PC. BX late Oct and results in Nov showed cancer in 3 of the 12 cores at the base. Gleason score 3+3,3+4, and 4+4. My husband was only interested in surgery. He did research the radiation, but was clearly onboard with RALP surgery. In Jan he had the bone scan and CT scan all negative. Second opinion in late Jan followed by MRI and surgery was set for March 9th. Surgery went as planned. Dr stated that the cancer was contained to the prostate, margins clear, lymph nodes clear, and it was nerve sparing on both sides He was very sore and needed Tylenol about once or twice a day for about 4 days. He was able to sleep in bed and first 2 nights was fitful but after that was able to sleep on his side which allowed for a more restful night. Took stool softeners and laxatives as prescribed. Bowel movement in 3 days and back to normal now, but he does take the Colace 2x a day still Catheter wasn\u0092t too much of an issue for him. Never got sore but used Vaseline. It was taken out on day 6. He called the small bag Mr Foley Jr and the larger night bag Mr Foley Sr. He was very nervous to get it taken out but said it was \u0093nothing at all\u0094. Best thing to report so far is that he has absolutely no incontinence. None. Not a dribble. He\u0092s on day 3 The only painful time was when they removed the drain from his side the day after surgery. He said it was a weird feeling and not pleasant. It lasted 5 seconds but listening to him you would think it lasted an hour. I was there. I don\u0092t even think it was 5 seconds. My husband was thrilled to say goodbye to Mr Foley Jr and Sr! Like all of you, he hopes and prays that Mr Woody makes a return appearance without much difficulty! If anyone has any questions please don\u0092t hesitate to ask. Like we said, this site and the men who share their experiences helped us so very much. We\u0092d like to give back too.",

He seems patient and so far we like his bedside manner and the way he deals with us. Have any of you used local surgeons that haven't performed thousands of surgeries? Our local surgeon (who is chief of staff at the center) told us he has performed \"hundreds\" since 2009, but as another forum member pointed out, over an 8 year span that really isn't a lot. Just curious as to your thoughts. My husband's Gleason score was an 8. 3 cores of 12 were cancerous. One a 6, one a 7, one an 8. CT scans and bone scans being performed this week.

My husband doesn't think he used the term \"make no mistake\" as I thought he did. He can't remember exact wording, but it was after I told him I really thought he was going to suggest waiting that he made \"a comment\" in regards that this probably is cancer and he would not wait on having a biopsy. As for the re-scheduling it's not possible. First opening is late Oct. Next available late Nov. He performs biopsies one day every other week. We will go for second (and possibly third) opinions at larger city hospitals. MUSC is 2 hours away.",

Thank you His surgery went very well. Dr took lymph nodes out because the cancer was a more aggressive type but he was confident that it was contained to prostate. We will know definitively when path report comes back He told my husband the next morning that he did spare the nerves. So far he\u0092s had stomach pain due to incisions and is up walking around the house as instructed by dr. He did have his first BM but not a great one and is really ready to go again!

      "Content": "Well, not a club my husband wants to be a part of, but here we (probably) are. This is all new to us. I've been reading this forum like crazy last few days and ordered a book that was suggested here as well. Here's our story: Husband is 64. His brother died from Prostate cancer which was detected at age 50 (passed age 57). My husband's PSA has gradually increased last few years. from 1.5, 2, 3. The dr had him come back in 6 months after the reading of 3 and it jumped now to 4. She referred him to a Urologist. We weren't worried, just concerned and figured the Urologist would probably do a wait and see. Maybe redo the PSA in 6 months. We went to the appt and we liked the dr very much. He was very matter of fact. He did an exam and told him that the right area felt scaly. He said in all of his years practicing he could usually feel a lump and did not feel that with him. Of course, cancer could be on the underside. Anyway, he suggested a biopsy. He said insurances don't cover MRI's (true, ours doesn't, I checked). I told him I thought we could wait a little and he looked at us and said, \"make no mistake, you have cancer. It's now getting a biopsy so it's caught at an early stage before progression\". We stumbled out of there (after he nicely made small talk about his daughter and where she was going to college). Anyone I mention his name to says he's great. Found out he's Chief of Staff at our hospital. Which isn't the greatest hospital...I'm a couple of hours from larger hospital but he is well respected so for now we'll have biopsy with him. It's scheduled late Oct. I will come back after results are in and go from there. I appreciate the willingness I am seeing in so many of you to help us newbies out. I am researching different treatments and getting second opinions. Also read on the sticky about sending path results to be read by John Hopkins. All of this will be researched in depth as the weeks go on. One quick question: We have a family wedding that we have to drive 9 hours to only 3 days after biopsy. Surgical nurse told us no problem but drs nurse said absolutely no sitting for that long and no driving. Opinions please? We might have to postpone biopsy 2 weeks. Your opinion on that as well is great appreciated. Again, thank you.",

Dr felt cancer is contained, that bone scan is precautionary. He said we have plenty of time to make decisions, but not to wait longer than 6 months. CT scan will cost $1000. The hospital hasn't notified us cost of bone scan. In January, our costs will be substantially reduced. He wants to wait. What is your honest opinion? What would you do?",

In that case, as you pointed out, waiting till Jan for the scans, f/u and 2nd opinion would be ok. I am sure you all experienced something similar in that this is your new normal. Trying to educate ourselves and make smart prudent decisions. Your help is so appreciated.",

      "Content": "I will add his history to my signature so all info is present. His Gleason was 6. (3+3) 7 (3+4) 8 (4+4) All tests, follow ups and 2nd opinions rescheduled for early-mid Jan. Although a price tag can't be put on one's life, the difference in waiting till early-mid Jan is $14,000. Surgery, which is route he is most likely going with, can't be performed until late Dec at the earliest. Therefore, waiting the additional 4-6 weeks for surgery is most likely not going to make a tremendous difference. His PSA scores were going up last 4-5 years. Dec 2015 was a 2. Feb 2017 they were 3 and Sept 1st they were a 4. The numbers doubled in a year plus his brother died from PC at age 58. Diagnosed at age 50. No one knows any info on him in regards to PSA numbers, how diagnosed, etc since his wife has passed as well. My husband is 64 and in excellent health and on no medications. Excellent weight as well. No problems with biopsy. Again, thank you for all responses.",
