      "Content": "Hello everyone, It's been a hell of a first week of the new year for me and my family as we just found out on Jan 4 that my father has prostate cancer. I am a pediatrician myself and it's tough wearing several hats right now. I have to focus on my work and give my patients excellent care while staying strong for my father and myself. I have cried numerous times but I know better not to dwell on emotions considering the journey ahead. I am trying to read as much as I can but will greatly appreciate your support and experience. My father is 68 years old and is an incurable optimist to the point of being in denial sometimes. His only symptom is occasional back pain which he claims is from strain. I am worried that he has been hiding this for years and that he may have metastasis. He swears that he has no urinary symptoms. His profile: Total PSA 43 ( we are black by the way), Adenocarcinoma Gleason 3 +3 in 5 of 10. Path report says there is no perineural invasion. U/S and DRE was normal. PSA was 11 in 2013 and biopsy then was read as BPH and chronic prostatitis. Increased to 22 in 2014 and a repeat biopsy was recommended. His stubborn self refused to follow up with this and I couldn't make him as we live on different continents. I finally visited him last month and dragged him to the urologist's office and the PSA was 43. Latest biopsy is what I have described above. We are preparing for the MRI and bone scan this week. Please, are there any forum members with such high PSAs and no extraprostatic extension or metastasis . Anyone with metastasis and no urinary symptoms first. I am looking for any glimmer of hope right now while we anxiously wait for the MRI and bone scan. Thank you! \" The Lord is my strength\"",
