When was your last psa and what was it? What was your Gleason score? Obviously, you should see a doctor, because you shouldn't have blood in your semen, especially if it is persistent. The blood is coming from somewhere. As far as PC, it is usually very slow to develop and you would have rising PSA long before it caused symptoms like blood in your urine.",

      "Content": "The surgery removes the smooth muscle tissue that acts as the urinary sphincter for men. We have a second set of muscles that can act as a sphincter, but for many men, they are not sufficiently developed to function satisfactorily. The sphincter that was removed was controlled by the autonomic nervous system, meaning that we don't have to think about it, and thinking about it doesn't make any difference. Since this sphincter works automatically, we don't have much reason to work the other set of muscles. The pelvic floor muscles that act as a sphincter after surgery are normal muscles under our conscious control. You need to train them to work properly, and you can do so with the Kegel exercises. It may take a little while to get them to work properly for this purpose. Don't give up, it will come.",

      "Content": "Hi McCloud, As a prominent RO told me, if it takes that long (in your case seven years) for the PSA to rise, how aggressive can that cancer possibly be? It is true that most of the time when the PSA rises to .03 it is likely to reach BCR. But that doesn't mean that .03 or .06 is BCR. Think of it as a risk factor. It is not inevitable, just likely. I would find a good RO and see what he or she tells you. Nothing about your numbers suggests that you're in any trouble. Let us know how it works out.",
