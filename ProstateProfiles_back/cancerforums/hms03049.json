      "Content": "I'm assuming it appears to be prostate cancer since this page covers that topic. I used the US News and World Reports survey to select my hospital. My treatment and recovery went very well. I can not say enough about Beth Israel Deaconess in Boston. It is a Harvard Med teaching hospital. The surgeons were Doctor P Chang and Doctor Wagner. With around 1000 De Vinci prostate surgeries to date they are very good and highly recommended. They have patient from all over the world. I had a family member treated by Doctor Samuel Ballon and Stanford Medical Center and definitely recommend him or any referral he may give. As I see it your steps would be: Get a biopsy and pathology report from somewhere near where you live. Select a hospital where you want your procedure and schedule a consultation, also have your pathology samples sent there for a second opinion.",

      "Content": "Hello Goodlife, Dr Walsh's writing on HT use is the current thinking but it must be taken in context. HT can be used in several settings such as: - concurrent with radiation therapy that is the primary treatment or adjuvant or salvage radiation after surgery when treating what is believed to be local disease. - to control the disease once it becomes systemic. It is this second setting that Dr Walsh is referring to. The argument is do we use HT to keep the PSA value low and accept the heavy side effects for what could be years, or do we delay HT until the disease is systemic and there are Mets. If the time to the end phase and death is the same, he argues, why not skip the long period of side effects from early HT? If I'm reading your husbands signature right and the nodes detected by MRI are within the prostate and not bone or elsewhere, you fall into a completely different category. With G9 PC the chance of re-occurrence by 5 years, even with primary and salvage treatment can be in the range of 45% to 75% which are not great odds. Some doctors and several trials are trying HT or HT + Chemo pre-surgery to improve these odds for G8-G10 patients. The initial data suggests there is merit to this approach. If this is the case for your husband then his doctor is being very aggressive and is at the the cutting edge of today's PC treatment. Some on this site often suggest \"throwing everything at the PC including the kitchen sink\" right from the beginning. This sounds like the path your doctor is taking. I started my journey 7/13, at that time I did not see this aggressive approach in the literature, by the time I did see it I had already had my RALP. I'm doing fine so far but would have gone down the path of HT+Chemo pre-surgery had I known it was an option. Best wishes",

      "Content": "Yes, that is them. I used 2 pkgs and 1 of the mediums. 172 total. I still have most of the mediums left so I used 140. The catheter tube is about 3/16\" OD and goes from the penis to the bag. The bag has a connector so you can disconnect it to replace it. The bags come in various sizes. I used the large one I left the hospital with from start to finish. It has a cap on it so you can empty it into the toilet. With the garter I could get sweat pants over it with no problem for the trip home from the hospital and to go out of the house. They make a leg bag, it is smaller so you could wear slacks over it. Where the tube goes into the penis gets sore and infection is a risk. They will give ointment for this. You will see blood cots and other stuff in the bag and the urine may be red at times. All of this is normal. I went to the office on day 8 (the day after the catheter was out) for a couple of hours and we went out to an old Inn for Thanksgiving the next day. On the following Monday I (day 13) was back at work from around 9:30 to 4 or 5PM. I had a cushion when I was at the computer but found I did better standing at a lab bench. I was not embarrassed to ask for a hand if I had to move anything over 10 lbs. By week 3 I was back to full time but I have a lot of flexibility. I could set, walk around, stand or just leave if I wanted to. Key for you is to stay hydrated, nourished, get plenty of rest, and get up for a short shuffle around the house.",

      "Content": "Yes, that is them. I used 2 pkgs and 1 of the mediums. 172 total. I still have most of the mediums left so I used 140. The catheter tube is about 3/16\" OD and goes from the penis to the bag. The bag has a connector so you can disconnect it to replace it. The bags come in various sizes. I used the large one I left the hospital with from start to finish. It has a cap on it so you can empty it into the toilet. With the garter I could get sweat pants over it with no problem for the trip home from the hospital and to go out of the house. They make a leg bag, it is smaller so you could wear slacks over it. Where the tube goes into the penis gets sore and infection is a risk. They will give ointment for this. You will see blood cots and other stuff in the bag and the urine may be red at times. All of this is normal. I went to the office on day 8 (the day after the catheter was out) for a couple of hours and we went out to an old Inn for Thanksgiving the next day. On the following Monday I (day 13) was back at work from around 9:30 to 4 or 5PM. I had a cushion when I was at the computer but found I did better standing at a lab bench. I was not embarrassed to ask for a hand if I had to move anything over 10 lbs. By week 3 I was back to full time but I have a lot of flexibility. I could set, walk around, stand or just leave if I wanted to. Key for you is to stay hydrated, nourished, get plenty of rest, and get up for a short shuffle around the house.",

      "Content": "You should be fine. The hard week will be the first due to the catheter. Every several hours it has the be emptied. The bed or sofa are both fine. You will want to get up and walk around the house very hour to avoid clots. The regular toilet is all you need, with the catheter #1 is taken care of and you'll be lucky to have a BM before day 3 or 4. They will prescribe a stool softener like Colace or similar, be sure to take it just as they say. Stock up on non diet jello, Gatorade, maybe Ensure. Something like Gatorade will keep your electrolytes balanced, keep you hydrated, and get you some sugar for energy should you not feel like getting up and fixing something to eat. Until your bowls start working you are not going to be eating Hot Pockets and the like. You will want a low residual diet, no whole gains, seeds, nuts, raw veggies, etc. Get off the narcotics like Percocet because it causes constipation to continue. NO alcohol while on narcotics. While on Percocet make sure you do not leave the stove on and go to sleep. Take care not to snag the catheter on anything, it doesn't take a lot to pull it out. Keep the bag lower that the bladder so nothing runs back into you. I suggest buying a garter belt to hold the bag. They are on Amazon or at a local med supply. It is much more comfortable than the tape to the leg set you leave the hospital with. Also loose fitting sweat or basket ball pants are handy when going out. Realize they actually cut the urethra to remove the prostate and reattach it to the bladder (Yikes!). This is mostly why they say take it easy and no lifting. It is also why they say no straining on the toilet. There is nothing like a blast like a tee shirt cannon from the rear due to too much fiber before the system is starting to move again or too much Colace. You can do some real damage, and it hurts. Once the catheter is out you will be over the hump and able to go shopping, drop in on friends, go out to dinner, etc. Do not drive if still on narcotics. You will need a soft cushion to set on for the first 3-4 weeks, hard surfaces, bar stools, bicycles, etc are out. You are better off with Depends pads you put in your briefs than the one piece underwear. The heavy ones will hold a full bladder and not leak. They fit in your pocket, and you do not need to get undressed to yank it out and put in a new one.",

While on Percocet make sure you do not leave the stove on and go to sleep. Take care not to snag the catheter on anything, it doesn't take a lot to pull it out. Keep the bag lower that the bladder so nothing runs back into you. I suggest buying a garter belt to hold the bag. They are on Amazon or at a local med supply. It is much more comfortable than the tape to the leg set you leave the hospital with. Also loose fitting sweat or basket ball pants are handy when going out. Realize they actually cut the urethra to remove the prostate and reattach it to the bladder (Yikes!). This is mostly why they say take it easy and no lifting. It is also why they say no straining on the toilet. There is nothing like a blast like a tee shirt cannon from the rear due to too much fiber before the system is starting to move again or too much Colace. You can do some real damage, and it hurts. Once the catheter is out you will be over the hump and able to go shopping, drop in on friends, go out to dinner, etc. Do not drive if still on narcotics. You will need a soft cushion to set on for the first 3-4 weeks, hard surfaces, bar stools, bicycles, etc are out. You are better off with Depends pads you put in your briefs than the one piece underwear. The heavy ones will hold a full bladder and not leak. They fit in your pocket, and you do not need to get undressed to yank it out and put in a new one.",

When in bed I unhooked the garter and laid the bag on the floor, you can not keep in strapped to your leg because it must be down hill from the bladder. Pratoman's idea of putting it in a bucket is a good one. Beats laying it on the floor and when you get up to go empty it you don't have to put it back on your leg, just grab the bucket handle and go.",

      "Content": "Yes, that is them. I used 2 pkgs and 1 of the mediums. 172 total. I still have most of the mediums left so I used 140. The catheter tube is about 3/16\" OD and goes from the penis to the bag. The bag has a connector so you can disconnect it to replace it. The bags come in various sizes. I used the large one I left the hospital with from start to finish. It has a cap on it so you can empty it into the toilet. With the garter I could get sweat pants over it with no problem for the trip home from the hospital and to go out of the house. They make a leg bag, it is smaller so you could wear slacks over it. Where the tube goes into the penis gets sore and infection is a risk. They will give ointment for this. You will see blood cots and other stuff in the bag and the urine may be red at times. All of this is normal. I went to the office on day 8 (the day after the catheter was out) for a couple of hours and we went out to an old Inn for Thanksgiving the next day. On the following Monday I (day 13) was back at work from around 9:30 to 4 or 5PM. I had a cushion when I was at the computer but found I did better standing at a lab bench. I was not embarrassed to ask for a hand if I had to move anything over 10 lbs. By week 3 I was back to full time but I have a lot of flexibility. I could set, walk around, stand or just leave if I wanted to. Key for you is to stay hydrated, nourished, get plenty of rest, and get up for a short shuffle around the house.",

They gave me a low residual diet to follow and it really helped. The diet is everything I normally wouldn't eat like white bread and processed foods. No nuts, whole grains, fruit with seeds, etc. If it is healthy, don't eat it. It is their policy to have patients stay on their normal diet until they report a problem.

      "Content": "Hello Mary, Given his numbers there is a lot of reason for optimism. One of the top 5 centers for robotic-assisted laparoscopic radical prostatectomy (RALP) is John Hopkins in Baltimore. If you are coming from the south it is an extra hour, but I sure wouldn't drive past it to get to DC. My experience: I chose to drive 1.5 hours to Boston for my procedure, I was discharged at 3PM the following day and it turn into over a three hour drive home in worst than typical Boston rush hour traffic. Setting wasn't too bad but the pot holes and stop and go portion was painful. They actually cut the urethra and re-attach it to the bladder, also the wall of the rectum is thinned to some extent. A really hard stop or collision could do some serious damage. I would not do 3 hours again. I returned to the hospital 7 days later to have my catheter removed. The day the catheter was removed I was driving, spent some time at the office and felt pretty good. I was off narcotics and only taking Tylenol. My next appointment was 3 months later for the follow up. I called my GP to order my blood test which was done in a local lab, the visit with the surgeon was a 15 to 20 minute office discussion. For my 6 and 9 month I had the local PSA test results sent to him and we had a short telephone call to discuss the results. The hospital had a on-line \"Patient Site\" where I could see all my labs, Doctor reports, and communicate via secure e-mail. For the few questions I had he or his PA answered my e-mail within hours. I selected a hospital highly ranked by US News and World reports for \"patient outcomes\" as \"significantly better than expected\". Outcomes relate to infections, lung and heart issues, and other such problems and not cancer cure rates. My surgical team had to have completed over 300 procedures, period. They had over 1000. Others have written the importance of having over 200-300 procedures. There are several studies that demonstrate why. Here are some numbers from a study titled \"The learning curve for reducing complications of robotic-assisted laparoscopic radical prostatectomy by a single surgeon\": Blood transfusion incidence was 8%, 4%, 2% and 0% in Groups I, II, III and IV, respectively. Complication rates were 18%, 12%, 18% and 0% in Groups I, II, III and IV, respectively. Major complications (grade III-IV) were 6%, 2%, 4% and 0% in Groups I, II, III and IV, respectively. The groups were 1-50, 51-100,101-150, and 151-200 procedures. You can search nih dot gov for the title or 21050363 to see the report abstract. It's short and easy to read. This is only one of many with the same finding. I would find a good surgeon within 2 hours of home or less, or plan on staying near the medical center for the week. The Stay America, Embassy Suites, or others often offer special weekly rates for patients for comfortable suites. The American Cancer Society and others arrange stays in various properties including private homes at very low rates to free in some areas. I wish you well.",

I have been on Lupron since Nov/14 and get my first IMRT this Thursday. While I'm completely active I feel the effects of HT daily. It's the impact to motivation and a short cardio \"hump\" (a pinch of short breath and higher heart rate) to get pass when I go from idle to active. Once moving I'm fine. Like others I notice that while I've stepped up my weight lifting I've had to reduce the weights with time. The jury is out on cardiac issues but it seems to me living like this for 2-3 years has to take a toll in that area. My MO said RT kills distant cancer when HT is used.

      "Content": "The end of a 3 month Lupron cycles was coincident with my last radiation treatment yesterday. I had an appointment with my MO for my next 3 month Lupron shot, or so I thought. He was not inclined to do another shot. I had read HT for 12-18 months after RT was beneficial and standard for G8-G10s. He agreed IF I had a prostate and RT was my primary treatment. Since I had surgery first and this was salvage RT I do not have a prostate so HT for longer than 6 months total was questionable. I tested the case that my SRT was started 2 months late (4 months after HT started) and the 3 months of the last shot ended at the same day as my SRT, I would not have much overlap of HT and SRT. He agreed there might be merit to one more 3 month shot to ensure coverage while my RT was doing its thing. (RT doesn't \"kill\" the PC cells, it prevents them from dividing and they die over days to weeks.) So I got the shot, and it is my last one. Reading several PubMed papers this morning I found several saying 6 months of HT concurrent with SRT may be of benefit but longer term was not associated with any additional increase in prostate cancer-specific survival. It sounds like 6 months of HT is enough for those undergoing SRT.",

      "Content": "It can be frustrating, most of us would be out of a job if our error rate was similar. Your last test at <.1 was standard sensitivity. You might want to switch to high sensisitivity. I went from <.01 to .01 to .05 and finally .1 at the end of the first when I started radiation. My last 3 are once again <.01 over the past year. Using the standard test I would have lost a year not knowing what was going on. As a G7 your odds at not recurring post surgery are better than mine were but there is something nice about a <0.01",

Without going back more than a week you can find the week by week logs we have both left on this site. As treatments go it wasn't bad at all. Have they started Lupron or other hormone treatment (HT) ahead of RT? With a G9 it is pretty much the standard and has been shown to make a real difference long term. HT is worst than RT. On surgery I had 12 of 16 cores that were 10% to 90% involved with 4/5=G9 and still had surgery. Of the 5 med centers I interviewed only one said \"you will need radiation anyway so there is no point having surgery\". I wanted surgery so I picked one of the others.... I'm happy with surgery and then radiation. Having had both now I'll say radiation is the easier of the two and has a similar cure rate with fewer side effects.",

A 90% chance of not needing RT means a 90% chance of not having a re-occurrence which is very good. It is likely that a re-occurrence would be related to the positive margin which is to say local, and very treatable with RT with a cure the likely outcome. Your first \"tell\" will be your first PSA usually at 3 months, personally I would get the ultra-sensitive test, when it comes back as \"undetectable\" you will know you are probably in the clear. With each subsequent test your confidence will build. So as Shaww said, your glass is 90% full. You have a lot of reasons to be optimistic that you are cured, but you need to keep an eye on it so you do not miss an opportunity to wack it again if necessary. Some argue against the ultra-sensitive test as TMI but in three month increments I went from <.01 to .01 to .05 to .1 at 12 months. With a standard test I would have seen <.1 at each test until the last test which would have been .1 (note that I was a G4+5 with positive everything so no one was surprised) I wish you the best.

      "Content": "Originally Posted by MLS Husband will clip one end of catheter and remove himself on Thursday I'm truly sorry this happened to you both, especially before a few days away. Emergency catheterization is one of my worst fears. I have not been through it. I was given the option of removing my catheter after prostate surgery to avoid a long drive to the hospital. I was not interested in this option. You are going to be at a medical facility Thursday afternoon for the ultra sound, I would make a earlier appointment and have them remove the catheter with a back flush. They use a large syringe to push water into the bladder just before they pull the catheter out. All of this water should come gushing out of the penis as soon as the catheter is removed. I have been through this, it does not hurt at all. They do not expect a problem if they want him to do it at home and you will be going to the clinic thereafter anyway. But should there be a problem he will be standing in front of the Doctor that can address it. I'm not a Doctor or any type of medical person. I'm just a guy that probably has a irrational fear of catheters. I wish you the best. HMS",

      "Content": "Lupron causes fatigue, in trials it was seen in 75% of the patients. My guess the nurse is working for the pay check without digging into what she is really doing. I do not know of an alternative to Lupron, but hopefully someone on here will. I've only been on it for 5 months. I'm active and in very good health but it has effected my strength even though I have been lifting weights more than before and it has slowed me down a bit. I think there is another aspect to it that effects me. Where I would work a 12 hour day, have dinner, and then go to the workshop till midnight I'm happy to watch TV or set and read a book after work. Its not that I'm tired, I'm just not drawn to projects like I was. My wife likes me just being around. It think the lack of testosterone has taken the conquering warrior out of me. Like there is more to libido than just the obvious. With all of that said I wonder how much of your Dad's issues are fatigue, and how much is loss of strength and motivation. I know I have to generate motivation to keep me busy or I'd just rest which would not be good. One motivation is having clients, this forces me to prepare and be somewhere on time. By motivation I mean something I have to do, not want to do.",

It is becoming clear I may have had some advantage in pulling the ART trigger at 6 months and PSA= .05, instead of SRT at 12 months and PSA= 0.1. There seems to be a re-think on several fronts over just the past couple of years. Topics like adjuvant RT with HT, adding chemo with HT and radiation, the role of surgery ahead of radiation for high grade PC and others are showing up in more papers and also as topics for several new trials. Include some of the new imaging techniques, and more support for targeting individual mets with radiation it is a quickly changing landscape. HMS",

      "Content": "Hello Mike, creekrat and I both posted a weekly log of our RT on this site from March through June of this year. Like many others it was pretty much side effect free. Creekrat's was primary treatment and mine was salvage which is closer to your case. Other than loose bowls in week 6 which was cured with a change of diet the only negative was having a daily appointment to keep for 8 weeks. Now 5 months after my last treatment I'm symptom and side effect free. Others have posted good advise. To repeat much of it: A PSA= 8 after RP says there was PC left behind. While ADT lowers your PSA there is a chance the PC can mature to being ADT tolerate and find its way to distance sites in the back ground. The hard part is determining if the PC is still local to the prostate bed. If it is SRT will help, if isn't then there is no point doing SRT. Various bone scans can see larger metastatic tumors which would definitely say it is not local. The problem is when the scans are negative but there may be mico-metastasis that can not be seen with CT or MRIs. Whether it is local and warrants SRT or not becomes a judgement call for the MO and RO. If PSA is increasing right after surgery and there were positive margins they attribute the increase to the margins and assume (hope) the PC is local, as they did in my case, and start SRT. As time goes on after RP this judgement call becomes more difficult. you need a really good MO and RO to make the right call. If there is a shot that the PC is local and SRT will kill it you need to take it. At 9 months on Lupron I was really starting to notice muscle loss and other issues, I'm glad to be off it while hoping my PSA remains un-detectable as my T returns to normal. So far, so good. My bone scan was sodium fluoride PET/CT.",

      "Content": "Hello Joe, I'm truly sorry to hear you face this dilemma. I understand avoiding any treatments that impact quality of life in the near term. A biopsy is not a treatment. It is just a test that take 15 minutes in the Urologist office that will give you needed information. The hardest part is waiting for the results. The information gained from the test is useful for managing PCa if present, and planning your future while minimizing the possible impact on your caregiver. You may have a infection that has enlarged the prostate and also my impact urination. If it is PCa 80% of the cases never have symptoms and do not require treatment. High grade cases can often be cured with invasive procedures or progression delayed by years with drugs. The very rare (<1%) forms result in death within a year, maybe 2. I the unlikely event that it is high grade PCa strategies to manage the symptoms can be developed while minimizing QoL issues, but you need the information.....",

The information gained from the test is useful for managing PCa if present, and planning your future while minimizing the possible impact on your caregiver.

Let's hope it is .03 but if it is truly a 0.3 then SRT with concurrent HRT sooner than later is likely. The somewhat iffy pathology report suggested there may have been positive margins. If cells were left behind they could be the source of the .3. It is better to have a local disease that is treatable, and possibly curable, with SRT due to positive margins than to have a systemic disease that has spread to distant places. Both Creekrat and I each posted radiation logs on this forum in March and updated them weekly through May. Creek's was a primary treatment and mine was SRT with 34 sessions. The good news is with SRT they normally only do HRT for 6 months. A quick read shows that it wasn't a bad experience at all. HMS",

      "Content": "My details are below. Nothing was spared in surgery, erections will be back once I get an implant. It is likely your DH will or has regain his naturally. After a year I started Lupron. I have been on it since Nov. I get hot once or twice a day. I do not notice it coming on, my shoulder and face are all of a sudden hot. It is brief. That is the only symptom for me. My wife and I are as intimate as ever. It is interesting once erections are off the table the tell tale sign is also gone. It is no longer game on when it is up and completely over when it goes down and a non-starter if it never goes up. Many guys write about multiple and better orgasms. That's my experience. Lupron will cause the loss of erections in most men, so it's no longer game on or off. It takes longer to reach orgasm but that works to my wife's advantage and when it is better for her it's better for me. In short, I need her more and closer than pre PC.",

      "Content": "I took a pair of the depends briefs to the catheter removal appointment and wore them home. Never again. I switched to pads in my Jockeys that evening. The heavy ones will hold a bladder full with no leaks. They fit in a pocket. You can snatch them out and replace them with your pants on. It seems a lot of guys are dry laying down from day one, including me, now getting vertical and to the head is a challenge.... One package of the heavy and 2 of the moderate pads got me through. 210 total. I still have a 1/2 pack left. Watch the catheter. The nurse caught mine and gave it a yank getting into the car. A week later the PA pull the shelf out on the examining bench snagging it, pulling it out a bit. I was really amazed how easily the Dr pulled it out. Your urethra was cut in two and reattached to the bladder (yikes). No lifting, straining, bar stools or bicycles. They sent me home with its straps taped to my leg. One day 3 the wife picked up a garter at a med supply, it was a big improvement. How it lasted a week I don't know. Make sure you have sweat or warm up pants handy. The baggy light poly ones are best. Get off the narcotics sooner than later, they cause constipation. I was on Tylenol at day 3. No straining, even down there, keep popping the Colace or similar stool softener they will give you. Get up and walk a loop around the house once an hour. Good luck!",

      "Content": "Hello Stephen You can see for my signature below I have some of the same issues but with 4/5 G9. PSA was 0 at month 3 and had only risen to 0.1 in a year. My RO and MO are optimistic that RT with HT will give me a cure or very long time to occurrence. Being at G7, even with the 4/3, you have good reason to be optimistic. Ajuvant RT is often started at 6 months to let you recover from the RALP. Where-ever you are at with incontinence and ED is frozen when you start RT. If he was planning to start RT it would begin with an office visit. It would be followed by a planning session (a MRI used to make a map for the RT machine), and a week or so later the start of 38-45 daily treatments. They may well suggest HT which would start 2 months before RT. What part of the country are you in? There may be a highly regarded RT center much closer to you. HMS",

Lupron or similar for just 4-6 months can be tolerated. He will get hot flashes starting at 30 days, they spring up and are gone quickly, and his initiative to do most things will be reduced. My MO assured me that bone loss, cardiac issues, growing breasts, etc are not an issue in 4-6 moths of use. Time goes quickly, 6 months from now he will be past it's affects and and have a better shot at being cured. Anything that may help avoid the PC becoming metastatic should be considered. I would opt for a 30 day injection and if all goes well by an additional 90 day injection.",

RT doesn't outright kill all of the PC, it keeps the cells from growing, and they die. Many of them die after the last RT treatment. PC is in the blood, a path to suitable bone is not a given, it is difficult. HT impacts the PC cells everywhere including in the blood making it even more difficult to survive the search for bone or other sites that can host them. If you wait until the PSA starts to rise after RT you are dealing with systemic PC for which currently there is no cure. In short you have a shot at killing the ones that have left the nest but have yet to find a home with HT. The Gleason 4 cells are possibly at or past the line between needing testosterone and being able to survive without it. Leave them be and let them progress (it is not a given they will) until they are testosterone independent and you are in trouble. The alternative is to cut their testosterone supply via HT and hopefully they will starve to death. This leaves one on the fence, 9 months of tolerable discomfort (1% have serious side effects) of HT which might not be required, versus a chance of avoiding or delaying a metastatic disease. If it was Gleason 3 cells remaining post RP just zap them and skip the HT. The circulating cells will likely die outside the prostate area on their own.",

My testosterone is back to normal at 443 and my PSA is <0.01 and I haven't had a hot flash in a month. For the newbies having testosterone AND a undetectable PSA is the good news. As a G=4/5=9 with positive everything including lymph nodes at surgery it is great news at the end of a long journey. I've graduated to being a non-patient and turned in my ID card today. For now the only thing on the medical calendar are quarterly PSA checks with my local GP. Hopefully I'll get to enjoy this gift for a long while.",

      "Content": "Hi Georgia Gal, Personally I'm biased toward surgery, even if has to be followed up with Radiation. Post surgery when the Pathologist gets the prostate you know 99% where you stand. For the 1% you can rely on the post-op PSA. At the three month test it should be undetectable and stay there. One thing I want to add was concerning ED. In the worst case if non-nerve sparring surgery is needed, ED is permanent. But orgasms are at least the same with many men on this site reporting an improvement. The \"one (maybe two) and you are done\" is gone for some reason. There are several ways to deal with the ED but once accomplished sex can be better than before. I would shoot for nerve sparring surgery. For G 3+4 and lower it as been shown to be safe, for G8-G10 the surgeons goes wide and takes it all. G 4+3 is a bit more gray. It sounds like you have a good surgeon and at a great med center, I would go with the surgeon on this one.",

Even with the small positive margin with a Gleason 6 it seems odd he would be rushing to RT without even waiting for the first PSA after RP.

      "Content": "Hello Stephen You can see for my signature below I have some of the same issues but with 4/5 G9. PSA was 0 at month 3 and had only risen to 0.1 in a year. My RO and MO are optimistic that RT with HT will give me a cure or very long time to occurrence. Being at G7, even with the 4/3, you have good reason to be optimistic. Ajuvant RT is often started at 6 months to let you recover from the RALP. Where-ever you are at with incontinence and ED is frozen when you start RT. If he was planning to start RT it would begin with an office visit. It would be followed by a planning session (a MRI used to make a map for the RT machine), and a week or so later the start of 38-45 daily treatments. They may well suggest HT which would start 2 months before RT. What part of the country are you in? There may be a highly regarded RT center much closer to you. HMS",

My MO assured me that bone loss, cardiac issues, growing breasts, etc are not an issue in 4-6 moths of use. Time goes quickly, 6 months from now he will be past it's affects and and have a better shot at being cured. Anything that may help avoid the PC becoming metastatic should be considered. I would opt for a 30 day injection and if all goes well by an additional 90 day injection.",

      "Content": "Hello civictim, If you have PC, it is circulating in the blood with or without surgery. In a previous post I included a NIH PubMeds paper on this. The importance of PC outside the prostate, such as in lymph nodes, is two fold 1.) is it suggests the PC has mutated to the point it can live \"away from home\". That is why there is some concern with positive margins, a bit more with seminal ducts, and even more concern with lymph node invasion. Each shows a greater degree of independence from the prostate and therefore more likely to become metastatic to bone etc. and 2.) there is still cancer in the body. This is where the Gleason score becomes important. G6 and down the PC is typically too immature to live outside the prostate and simply dies, G7 it is a maybe, and G8-G10 it generally assumed it can live beyond the prostate. That is why the recurrence rate is high even when the prostate is removed or radiated with G8-10, even if everything comes back negative from pathology. On surgery with High grade PC: With a G4/4=8 at biopsy I did not have a problem finding a surgeon at major PC centers to do a RALP, the RO sat through the meeting and agreed with the approach. I had 3 options for my RALP including JH. The reason they supported a RP is not every cancer cell finds a nice piece of bone to start a successful colony in, clearly the more there are in circulation the greater the odds of success. With a RP their numbers were greatly reduced. In my case some were left behind as evidenced by positive margins, lymph node involvement, etc. Hopefully those are being killed with IMRT and any swimming around are being starved to death due to the HT (Lupron).",

      "Content": "Hi Georgia Gal, Personally I'm biased toward surgery, even if has to be followed up with Radiation. Post surgery when the Pathologist gets the prostate you know 99% where you stand. For the 1% you can rely on the post-op PSA. At the three month test it should be undetectable and stay there. One thing I want to add was concerning ED. In the worst case if non-nerve sparring surgery is needed, ED is permanent. But orgasms are at least the same with many men on this site reporting an improvement. The \"one (maybe two) and you are done\" is gone for some reason. There are several ways to deal with the ED but once accomplished sex can be better than before. I would shoot for nerve sparring surgery. For G 3+4 and lower it as been shown to be safe, for G8-G10 the surgeons goes wide and takes it all. G 4+3 is a bit more gray. It sounds like you have a good surgeon and at a great med center, I would go with the surgeon on this one.",

Even with the small positive margin with a Gleason 6 it seems odd he would be rushing to RT without even waiting for the first PSA after RP. Hopefully the Radiation Oncologist will be a better doctor and will give you a better answer with some facts so you can make a good decision. Best regards, Hamilton",

Coupled with negatives for everything external to the gland you have a good chance of being cured without any future treatments such as HT and radiation. With the little bit of 4 it would still be wise to stay on-top of your PSA for years to come.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by Fishing Larry it's within the margins\" does that mean it has spread but just close by? Or what does that exactly mean They dye the removed mass, typically with blue and black dye for the different lobes. It is removed in multiple sections. The organ size and surgical method (open versus RALP) determine the number of sections Once the pathologist gets it they look for cancer that goes right up to the dyed edge. These edges are the margins. If the disease goes right up to the margin it is a positive margin, it is safe to assume the cancer continued on the other side and was left behind. It is considered contained if the margins are negative, that is they are all normal cells. If the margins are positive you will want to know if it was in one place, multiple places, or a lot of places. The Path report will use focal, multi-focal, or extensive. Be sure to request a copy of the Path report. I hope all goes well and everything comes back negative. If it doesn't there are \"next steps\" that may still hold the chance for a cure. If you review the signatures of other posters here you can get an idea of the timing for the next steps. Note there is typically many months to a year or more before the next step. There is time to make careful educated choices before signing on to a suggested treatment. I write this because a buddies Dr in Colorado started hormone therapy (HT) a week after the catheter was out even though he had a great Path report. The result is he will likely see a low PSA score at the first 3 month check, but will not know if it is a result of the HT or a successful surgery. You can't optimally treat if you do not know what it is.",

Wilde - with your numbers you have a good shot at not having to do this or a cure if you do. If I were you I would consider switching to the ultra-sensitive PSA test, just don't do anything rash until you really see a upward trend over several tests. As a G9 with positive everything I'm a poor canary in the coal mine to peg your sleep to, but then again they were surprised I made it a year at 0.1 without HT.

No tube in the bum. The CT panels dropped down and made a quick pass. Since it was visit #1 the RO had to OK the image which added a 5 minutes wait. With a thumbs up from the RO the CT panels retracted and the main head started buzzing. It made a single pass over and under me taking about a minute. I was done. I pulled up my pants, stepped off the bed into my shoes, and got my jacket on the way out the door. Other than a 10 minute near nap I did not feel a thing. I had a nice chat with the RO (Dr J Aronovitz from Barnes and now BIDMC Boston). The plan is 69 GY total in 34 sessions with most in the prostate bed and the rest where the lymph nodes live.",

      "Content": "Hello Tom, I started Lupron last Nov and have had a 1 month and two 3 month shots in the bum. I pictured something the size of a BB since it is good for 3 months and being inter-muscular would hurt for days. It is a fairly fine needle, and other than a very small pinch it's painless. I get the hot flashes 2-3 times a day. I'm suddenly hot, mainly shoulders and face. Just as quickly I notice it is gone. There is no ramp up or down. The fatigue is harder to describe. It gets me more on transitions from idle to cruising. If I jump out of my chair and trot up the stairs to the lab I find I'm breathing a bit harder for a minute or two. Same for a walk with the wife. The first 1/4 mile I notice a bit more breathing and faster heart rate but the next 2-3 miles including a good hill I'm normal. I work a long day typically at a desk, week before last I lead a week long equipment change out on a wind farm and was 100% while my buddies were suffering from the altitude. I used to get home late and start a project in the home lab or garage. Now I'm happy to kick back, go for a walk, watch TV, the wife loves it. It is like my initiative is down a notch. I'm not tired, sleepy, sore, or anything. I wonder if lower T has made me less of a conquering warrior? Exercise is up a tick, diet is down, and I have still gained 3-4 pounds. I have no other symptoms.",
