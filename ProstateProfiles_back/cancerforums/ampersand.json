      "Content": "My father passed away last month from prostate cancer at age 65 We are still confused as to how this happened, he was initially diagnosed with local prostate cancer in the summer of 2008 and the cancer was deemed cured by late 2009 after hormone therapy treatment. It came back early in 2013, but he was again being treated with hormone therapy, this time however the PSA scores kept rising. We are confused as to why was he not referred to surgery (radical prostatectomy) along with radiation treatment in light of his test results? Also, all statistics show over 99% ten-year survival rate from initial diagnosis, yet my dad passed only six years into it. http://www.cancer.org/cancer/prostat...survival-rates I am discussing with the family on whether to get a law firm to review all the records, it just doesn't make sense that he would succumb at a relatively young age and well within the survival time frame. By the way, we are not looking for a way to score an award over our dad's passing, we are not interested in any money, we just want answers as to what happened. Please let me know any advice, insights, suggestions, hard-won experience, etc. you may want to offer me. Thanks in advance.",

      "Content": "Wow, interesting...I didn't know hormone therapy was not the first line of treatment for prostate cancer. My father was private in this respect and did not tell us much about his cancer, my brother and I did not find out about how grave his situation was until this September - he had only told us he had a high count of white blood cells which as far as we know he did not have . Also, our father looked fine to us externally as we met with him twice a month and spoke with him separately almost every week (my parents have been divorced for many years so my mom did not see him anymore). Unfortunately we only have incomplete information from documents we gathered after his death. We did get to speak with his lady friend of the past twelve years but did not get much detailed clinical information, apparently he also misled her about his illness. I was advised by a friend to go to Surrogate Court (we live in NYC) and get myself designated as administrator of his estate, that way I can request all medical records from oncologists, PCP, hospital, etc. and have them reviewed by a consultant. Perhaps he was offered the surgery option way back in 08 but declined it, however we just do not know this and it's really gnawing at us what exactly went wrong. Thanks again for your replies and condolences - what hurts the most is how quickly the end came (at least from our point of view). We were enjoying watching the World Cup last summer, jumping together at the goals scored for the teams we liked, and six months later he's gone.",
