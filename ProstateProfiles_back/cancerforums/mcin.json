      "Content": "Originally Posted by Another It appears you are being treated for metastized prostate cancer. The drugs you are taking are not for AS. Your sudden drop in PSA is the result of your current hormone therapy. Cancer does not change gears. Significant changes are evidence of more aggressive cancer being present. If you complete your signature you may see your profile emerge and if you missed the warning signs or failed to monitor yourself adequately. Thank you. You are correct, the drop in PSA is due to hormonal treatment. All my tests prior to the jump in PSA were indications that I had slow growing cancer. My most recent biopsy and MRI were done in August of 2017. I sent results, as I have before, to John Hopkins for their review. They confirmed 3+3 Gleason Score. When the PSA jumped up my Urologist said my prostate size was to large to safely do RP and for that matter most every other type of treatment other than perhaps a form of radiation. Here are the findings:In August of 2017, I had an MRI and biopsy Seminal Vesicles were found to be normal No findings of adenopathy. Pelvic bone marrow signal is normal Prostate voume: 109ml PSA Density: 0.07 ng/ml2 Diagnosis after Microscopic Examination: Results sent to John Hopkins. Findings Below 1-3 Benign Prostate Tissue 4. Prostatic Adencarcinoma, Gleason 3+3=6 (Grade Group 1), involving 70% of (1) core -Perineural invasion identified in this case. 5-7 Benign prostate tissue 8. Prostatic Adenocarcinoma, Gleason score 3+3=6 (Group 1), involving 10% of specimen. 10. Prostate right medial apex, biopsy: Prostatic adenocarcinoma, Gleason score 3+3=6 Group 1), involving 100% of (1) core. 11-4 Benign Prostatic Tissue. Gleason Score: 3=3=6 Clinical Stage: T1c PSA: 6.7ng/mL Extent of Disease Probability % Organ confined disease 72 Extracapsular Extension 27 Lymph Node Involvement 1 Seminal Vesicle Invasion 1 Probability of Survival after Radical Prostatectomy 10yrs = 99% 15 years = 99% 10/3/2017 - Oncotype DX - Genomic Prostate Score. My GPS Score was 21 = Low Risk Prostate Cancer Death Within 10 years <1%",

      "Content": "All my tests from 2011 through October 2017 led me to believe I had slow growing cancer and have been on active surveillance. Have any of you experienced your cancer changing gears and moving into a rapid growth mode? My MRI in August 2017 continued to show 3+3 6 Gleason score. PSA was at 7.91%. 10/3/2017 - Oncotype DX - Genomic Prostate Score. My GPS Score was 21 = Low Risk Prostate Cancer Death Within 10 years <1% In December my PSA Jumped up to 12.22 Dr, put me on Finasteride to shrink prostate and Bicalutamide to get rid of testosterone and slow down growth of cancer. On Feb 27 PSA was down to 1.54. I'm wondering if anyone here has had a similar experience. Thank you, MCIN",
