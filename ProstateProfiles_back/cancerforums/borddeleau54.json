      "Content": "In less than 3 months, my PSA went from 6 to 8.2 and my first %fpsa was 16 at the second visit to my urologist. After thinking my chance of having PC was 33% I realized later, this time taking into account my family history and other factors that my chance of having PC was more or less 50% and chances of having an agressive PC was almost 25%(23%) using different calculators available online (among others the canadian Sunnybrook hospital online prostate risk calculator). My next visit is next November and I'm supposed to have my PSA/%freepsa done shortly before so the urologist can have the third results. The question is I'm having second thoughts about this 3 months interval given the now high probability that I may have PC. Should I still wait until November or should I schedule my next visit earlier? Thanks Pierre Racine, Canada",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by HighlanderCFH Welcome to the forum. I agree with your anger toward the doctor. She had no right to make such a notation, especially if it was on paperwork that you would take possession of. So you were correct in demanding that it be changed. Now, for the medical portion of this -- my advice is to get a biopsy as soon as you can. Waiting 3-6 months to see if the PSA comes down could be a tragic mistake because the initial PSA was already 6.0 -- which is a couple points above normal. That 6.0, by itself, was enough to warrant a biopsy. You don't want to find out, at a later date, that a very aggressive tumor is in there and that you gave it a 6 month head start. I know this is something you don't want to do -- I resisted my own biopsy for several years -- but it really is mostly painless and only takes 20 minutes. Hang in and we'll see what others think. But, for your own sake, I believe you need to get that biopsy very soon. Good luck! Chuck Thank you for your reply. But I disagree with you. Having a PSA at 6 is not in itself a sufficient reason to warrant a biopsy, given the risks. Nor is the free PSA. Given my age, it probably is prostate hyperinflation. Statisticlally, the numbers say I have about 33% chance of having PC. Also, PSA varies greatly from day to day (up to 30% variation).As far as I know my PSA might be a little high because I ejaculate every day... And, a stunning majority of PC in the elderly are slow PC which usually can take decades to progress. Do I take a risk? Yes. But statistics are on my side. The risk that I developp an agressive PC in 8 or 10 more weeks are laughable. Talking about risks, I personnaly know of a man who had a biopsy and had to be rushed to the hospital the next day because of a deadly general infection. The procedure, in my view, is barbaric and I won't accept it on the base of only 2 moderately high PSA over a 2 months period. If the PC is there it probably have been for a number of years. I want to have at least another blood test to confirm a regression before going the biopsy route.",

Having a PSA at 6 is not in itself a sufficient reason to warrant a biopsy, given the risks. Nor is the free PSA. Given my age, it probably is prostate hyperinflation. Statisticlally, the numbers say I have about 33% chance of having PC. Also, PSA varies greatly from day to day (up to 30% variation).As far as I know my PSA might be a little high because I ejaculate every day... And, a stunning majority of PC in the elderly are slow PC which usually can take decades to progress. Do I take a risk? Yes. But statistics are on my side. The risk that I developp an agressive PC in 8 or 10 more weeks are laughable. Talking about risks, I personnaly know of a man who had a biopsy and had to be rushed to the hospital the next day because of a deadly general infection. The procedure, in my view, is barbaric and I won't accept it on the base of only 2 moderately high PSA over a 2 months period. If the PC is there it probably have been for a number of years. I want to have at least another blood test to confirm a regression before going the biopsy route.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by HighlanderCFH Welcome to the forum. I agree with your anger toward the doctor. She had no right to make such a notation, especially if it was on paperwork that you would take possession of. So you were correct in demanding that it be changed. Now, for the medical portion of this -- my advice is to get a biopsy as soon as you can. Waiting 3-6 months to see if the PSA comes down could be a tragic mistake because the initial PSA was already 6.0 -- which is a couple points above normal. That 6.0, by itself, was enough to warrant a biopsy. You don't want to find out, at a later date, that a very aggressive tumor is in there and that you gave it a 6 month head start. I know this is something you don't want to do -- I resisted my own biopsy for several years -- but it really is mostly painless and only takes 20 minutes. Hang in and we'll see what others think. But, for your own sake, I believe you need to get that biopsy very soon. Good luck! Chuck Thank you for your reply. But I disagree with you.

      "Content": "First the numbers; 3 months ago my PSA was:6 This morning, at the urologist clinic: PSA 8.2, free PSA/total 16% Age 63 While in the urology clinic this morning, the urologist gave me me the numbers (see above) and told me to have a biopsy. I said no and told him that I prefer to wait and have another blood test in the next 3 to 6 months and see if the numbers still worsen. Urologist not happy after I told him that I have read something like 2 000 pages on the subject - a good portion of the expert books sold on Amazon - and that nothing in what she said to me (statistics, etc.) in our conversation was news to me. Then,while leaving his office, i noticed he wrote on a paper, to be given to her assistant, \"very weird patient\"... I was so furious I came back to her office and told her \"What the hell gives you the right to write this down? \"Very weird!\"? You give me another paper without this gratuitous and insulting judment. I know that I'm not your average Joe, that I know a LOT about PC and that you don't like it when patients make their own decisions but you're not going to write that I'm a \"very weird\" patient on that paper\"... And she obeyed, to my astonishment... These arrogant fu**** doctors... Am I the only one who had this kind of experience?",
