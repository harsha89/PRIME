      "Content": "1. When i asked my urologist, who has been practicing for 25 years, for a duet catheter, he gave me a strange look and told me that there was no such thing as a duet catheter. Rather than risk a confrontation with him i let it go. Do you not find it strange that a man who has been practicing his profession for 25 years would not know about the importance of this new innovation. It seems to me that the man has been practicing for 25 years. He has 25 years of experience but he has only one year of experience 25 times. I welcome your comments. 2. Does anyone know the procedure for removing a foley catheter from the penis. Does one simply pull it out or is there some more complicated method of doing it. I want to remove mine because in back of the sensation of the penis there is a very strong urge in the form of burning, to urinate and does anyone know if almost any doctor is qualified to re insert the catheter. Must the doctor who does it be a urologist. If you have any answers or comments i would appreciate them. Thank you",

      "Content": "Now i know it! i have 4th stage advanced prostate cancer! i am not doing well. My doctor told me that in order to get a cancer diagnosis i had to take a biopsy. Before this i was able to urinate, to walk properly and had a fairly good appetite. I took the biopsy and was told of my cancer diagnosis. Up to taking the biopsy i was able to live a fairly normal life. If i couldn't urinate once i simply waited for a while and was able to urinate. Now my leg is swollen to twice it's normal size. My foot and ankle are also badly swollen. After the biopsy i was not able to urinate at all. I started having bad burning pains in the abdomen. From being fatigued mildly i went to constant fatigue. My primary care doctor told me to go to the hospital with which he was associated. I went there and they put in a catheter which enabled me to pass urine. The catheter has been in my penis for about 2 in a half weeks and is causing me no end of discomfort. So i after i was finally diagnosed the doctor told me that he was going to put me on Hormone therapy. I spent 500$ on hormone drugs for 90 pills and was supposed to take one a day. I took one the 1st day and another one the day after and was up all night struggling to breathe. All of these and more side effects are listed in the description of this drug. One is more horrifying than the other. I immediately stopped taking these drugs. I believe that the entire prostate biopsy scene is a scam. They can get you when you are not in too bad of a position, make it much worse with a biopsy, and thus trap you into having their barbaric treatments. The people who say that the pharmaceutical companies control all of medicine with the doctors acting as mere puppets is closer to the truth. My PSA prior to the biopsy was 85. I have decided not to fight this disease. I am 81 years old. what good is fighting for another year of life going to do me? nothing! I am writing this blog to warn you not to take a biopsy if at all possible. I have never seen anything as destructive to physical and mental health. Thank you for paying attention and God bless you all.",
