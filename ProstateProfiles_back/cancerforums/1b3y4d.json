Also guess I am just a punk but the pain meds are starting to wear off and wondering how long before I can start taking my Tramadol? How about a cold pack or heating pad to sit on? Not unbearable but uncomfortable. Will know in a couple of weeks. Thank you all for help and support.",

Won't be long and it will be bed time so hopefully I can sleep and forget it. Thank you again. I have to give many thanks to my Primary doctor because without her pushing and insisting on the test I would still not have done them.",
