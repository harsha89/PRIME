      "Content": "So I am talking with my wife last night. She is an RN with a wide range of experience, both in the OR assisting a surgeon, and owning a Home Health Care agency for 20+ years with more than 100 nurses and caregivers under her management, and even owning a MedSpa for the last 11 years, and lobbied in Austin and Washington for health care... so she has been around a ton of docs, and \"knows\" the system. Given her history, I thought this would be an easy question I posed: \"I read here and there that I should be getting a 2nd, 3rd, or more opinion. This confuses me since how do I know which one is right? Who is to say Doc #1 is any more wrong than Doc #3, or #4? Am I, as a layman, supposed to now judge multiple highly-educated and experienced doctors on whether they are right or wrong? How can I \"grade their papers\"... I know the oil business, not the cancer business.\" Her reply suprised me. She said it's as much about intangibles as science. How do you feel with Doc #1? How are communications with Doc #3, AND his office... does he have a firewall and a moat around him (as does my Urologist) making communications difficult and stressful? Do you understand what Doc #3 is saying? Is she too this, or too that? Which one do you trust? Trust? Wow, what a variable... Is this what it comes down to? How I feel? Given that the extra opinions come from somewhat equally experienced doctors, how do you choose from perhaps multiple different approaches or even diagnostics? Do you just get ten of them and see which view/treatment path wins? I think she may be on to something... maybe it really is about \"How Ya Feel\". Whatcha think? Mike in Texas",

      "Content": "Being about a week out of diagnosis, I have read tons and have explored a variety of forums - reading and learning from others, for which I am grateful. But here is a thought that I would be interested in views from others on. Is there a general tendency for people who participate on forums, such as this one, to be folks that fall into one or two categories. 1. They are newbies to the disease and ask questions. 2. People with \"less than ideal\" outcomes. By no means am I disparaging anyone, but I am wondering if forums represent what we might call \"randomized sampling\" of participants? Who shows up here and participates? It just might be that folks with great outcomes, and who don't have additional treatment, and have limited to near-zero side effects, and that just carry on with life like nothing happend... maybe those guys don't participate so much in forums. Therefore, if a newbie reads a ton of forum posts about others experiences, do you think there may be a \"tilt\" to outcomes and experiences that are something other than \"walk away\" experiences? In no way am I saying that the whole range of experiences are not represented here, because they are. And all contributions are certainly valuable... But I recall researching hotels (or whatever) and finding that most people only post when they have something \"negative\" to say. People that are happy and thrilled with a hotel, product, etc., just go on with life and don't bother to post of their great experience. What's my point? I just wonder if newbies, like me, are exposed to a good sampling of outcomes via these forums. For example: Let's say that X number of men here chose surgery, and Y number chose IMRT. In my mind it is critical to rinse out the variables by asking questions like, 1) How many surgery men chose that path due to \"non-medical\" reasons? I have noticed the attitude of many men is, \"Just take the damn thing out, NOW. I don't want to hear about any of that damn Xray stuff, just take it out.\" Or maybe they chose surgery for certain financial, geographic or other non-medical reasons.; and 2) How many chose IMRT (or other radiation-based treatment) because they are fearful of the surgery, or maybe also for financial or geographic reasons... Maybe their insurance wouldn't cover this or that treatment, and they would have to virtually re-locate to another treatment location, so they are \"forced\" into their Option B, for non-medical reasons. If we could somehow take out the non-medical variables of why people chose one path or the other, I think that would paint an interesting picture. Of course, everyone has their own Choice Matrix... but what I am trying to do is boil it all down as to the best option for me, and the experiences of others is an important element of the matrix. But if a guy buys a Ford pickup in his town for $1000 and sings it's praises, he may not mention that all-things-being-equal, he would have prefered the GMC located a few states over that costs $1500... he didn't have $1500, and getting a few states over would have been too burdensome. So now he is a fan of Fords. With all that said. I admire and learn from every post I read, and I'm not being critical of anyone at all. But that doesn't mean there might not be a \"sampling bias\" inherent with forums, review sites, etc. (I bet there is a study on that somewhere.) What y'all think? Mike in Texas",

      "Content": "I'm having an argument with myself as whether to do RT \"now\" (when PSA is undectable one-year post RP, but I had negative pathology), or wait until/if PSA ticks up to say 0.03 before commencing RT. Today, I'm leaning on the side of going ahead and getting started. My wife says, \"Why wait for it to \"come back\" to kill it? Just do it.\" That makes sense to me... I think. (See my wavering? ) I'll make that decision soon, but for now, here is my question... During the course of 39 treatments of RT (whether I go with Proton or other), is it permitted to say do half of them, then take a 3-4 week break and then resume for the remainder of the treatments? I'm working up a list of questions for my RO, including the looming question of adding ADT to the treatment course. (One doc says yes, another says not necessarily.) Thanks All! Mike in Kerrville",

      "Content": "Well now, wasn't THAT fun? I've been living in my RV south of Houston since early February. Every day, except for weekends, I make the journey to the Proton Treatment Center at MD Anderson. It's about a 10 mile drive, and my appointments vary between about 7PM to 9PM each day. On Thursday this week, I will complete the course of treatments, 35. And I can tell you, it has been quite an experience! First - side effects. For me, no side effects other than just a little dribble when I take a leak. Other than that - no side effects at all. And none of the other 4-6 guys having treatments with me reported any side effects related to the radiation. Some of them had not had prostate surgery yet, some had (like me). The staff, all of them, from the docs to the technicians, have been incredible. I can tell they get good training in how to deal with people in such circumstances. The biggest issue during treatment is obtaining a full-ish bladder, and holding it until time for the treatment and treatment completion. This is a big challenge. Especially when the treatment schedule starts running 1-2 hours behind. That leaves 4-5 guys in hospital gowns sitting around \"The Holding Tank\" talking about bladder fullness and how to achieve and maintain fullness. I will be happy to not talk about pee any more. The treatment itself is simple. For me, it takes 13 minutes from the time I enter the room until I leave the room. The technicians align you with the Proton machine using Xrays, every time. Then, for me, they blast the country music and leave the room during the zap. I don't feel anything, nothing. And to this day, I don't have any outward sign of radiation treatment. No rash, no red spot, no nothing. Hanging out in a cancer facility for two months, and talking intimately with other men going through the same thing has likely been the best part of this adventure. Gentlemen, there are so many of us with cancer. All kinds of cancer. And when you spend countless hours with people from all walks of life, and hear their stories, it makes an impact and I am grateful for that experience. The support of the other men getting prostate treatment (we were a group to ourself as we are the only ones that have to fill the bladder, and therefore spend more time in The Holding Tank\") was very helpful. And I had the good fortune to meet other men and really get to know them and learn of their issues and struggles. Great group therapy! Also, I found the technology behind Proton treatments to be amazing. The behind the scenes tour was an eye opener as the equipment is massive (three stories tall). The Proton center runs three gantries from 4AM to midnight... every day except for weekends. MDA is building a new Proton Center next door. The existing one will be dedicated soley for treating children. Folks, there are a LOT of people getting treated! If anyone has any questions about Proton, I'm happy to try and answer. I will be VERY glad to get home to my wife and my life. The RO Doc says I don't need to follow-up, just keep getting PSA test and see if it goes up. So I will be doing that every month for some months from my home city. ...on another topic. I am considering getting a penile implant and had a visit with the MDA doc that does that procedure. His name is Dr. Run Wang, and is maybe the best in the world at such procedures... he told me so! lol MY RO doc said he is all for it and I would \"have a boner like an 18-year old\". Anyone have experience with this? Cost is $25,000. Medicare pays. Go figure... Mike in Houston (for a few more days)",

      "Content": "Thanks ASA (and all). I don't know if the treatments I had were classified as ART or SRT. Is it a distinction without a difference (in my case)? I also thought it may be \"odd\" to target the prostate bed with a \"pencil beam\" Proton. I'm not very clear on how the prostate bed sits in the anatomy, absent the prostate. Does everything just \"collapse\" on itself? Seems like an ill-defined target to me. But, I have to trust that the smart folks know how to hit it with the beam! I was not in a clinical trial. MIke",

      "Content": "Buried in one of the threads, someone posted a very important development. I just wanted to highlight that information in it's own post. I have no knowledge of the information, just repeating the post. It said that Mayo Clinic in Phoenix is now pricing Proton Therapy the same as IMRT! That's huge! The reason many insurance carriers won't approve Proton Therapy is because it often costs multiples of \"standard\" IMRT treatment. Before I knew the extent of my disease, I was leaning toward Proton. My Blue Cross of Texas insurance denied it, even after two appeals. They said IMRT was \"just as good\" - more or less. As it turned out, I didn't have any choice and needed to \"de bulk\" my disease by surgery. I'm a believer in Proton Therapy, for the right cases. If more places follow Mayo's lead with this, I think Proton Therapy will get a huge breath of life! Mike in Kerrville",

The average prostate gland when removed by surgery and its pathology is worked up, contains seven separate and distinct tumors.. That brings up an interesting question. Just what are the shape of prostate tumors? Are they oblong, circular like a ball, irregular in shape, or other? Are they solid, or do they just \"infitrate\" tissue? Plus, are they microscopic? Or, if I had a prostate sitting in front of me could I see a mass that is distinct from the other tissue? When I think of a \"tumor\", I think of something growing that I can see. It really doesn't make any difference, I'd just like to know what the little f*ckers look like.

If that is the csse, it would follow that the higher the number, the \"more\" cancer was found? So what if a core went through a horizontal plane of a tumor? On a core sample, it would be a small \"show\". (I'm from the drilling business, and oil wells take core samples too... But if it hit a vertical plane, the core could show 100%, yet be the same ultimate size as the previous example.

I won't re-iterate the whole story, but every single person, including multiple doctors of various sorts, I have spoken with (except for maybe a few of you on this forum) have said I need to \"do it\" due to my high risk. It's so hard to wrap my head around that. My gut tells me I should wait for a tick up that is confirmed. Like to 0.03, at least. But maybe it's better to get it over and done before there is anything to grow... It's quite a dilemmas for me. I guess it's kind of a good problem to have, and adding the radiation is like an insurance policy. Have any of you guys been in the same boat? What did you do? Mike in Kerrville",

      "Content": "All good replies! I thank you for the input. The bottom line is that I'm considered high risk as a result of my pathology. Even before I had the surgery, my origiginal RO, as well as my URO, clearly said they would want to wait X months to heal and then initiate radiation and possibly ADT. They said this using information from the MRI scan where they could see a better picture of what was going on. Toss in a \"high risk\" Decipher score - makes it worse. So the desire of the docs to use SRT is nothing new in my case - they said it from the beginning. I agree with everything all of you said. And even taking those comments in their totality, there's a mixed message. I'm going to do it. But I'll feel like I'm fighting ghosts. As to Proton. My RO says Proton WILL do a better job than IMRT (even if there is not a \"specific\" target), but only by a \"few percentage points\". I'll take those points. It will be a pain in the ass to go live in my RV for two months, four hours from home, and go through the daily grind of treatments. But I'm grateful to have the opportunity mop up and just hope and pray that my side effects are minimal and of short duration. Oh....and the RO says he doesn't suggest the ADT. So at least there's THAT ray of sunshine! Please don't take my musings as complaining. I'm not. I'm simply sharing thoughts as I move down the line with the rest of you. Mike in Kerrville",

      "Content": "About 3-4 days my catheter was removed (10 days post daVinci surgery) I started having very painful spasms and/or cramps. I mean REALLY bad. The worst was triggered this past Sunday. I thought I would take a break in the hot tub...for an hour. I had to have three people help get me out. After that, things are a little foggy, but I had two nurses and a nurse practiioner tending to me. The pain was so bad I was shaking uncontrollably, crying, and generally in the worse shape I have ever been in, They called an ambulance to take me to the hospital. I was hurting so bad I couldn't hardly even get on the guerny. They said they wouldn't give me any medicine until they got me inside the ambulance. I somehow managed to get in. Then I got fenytal (sp?) which calmed me a little. Then morphine at the ER. CT and other tests were run and all looked good (except I had a UTI which my wife had to identify from the lab results - the hospital folks didn't catch it). Released after about five hours. Pain came back pretty strong, and have had it for the last few days in varying degrees. Today is my best day yet with only one big flare up. I'm taking tramadol, robaxin, colace, levinsen for bladder spasms... none of which seem to do much. (I did smoke some weed which helped!) The point of all this... do you guys think it was not a good idea to be in the hot tub? Does that set off this kind of reaction, or was it coincidental? I haven't read of anyone on the forum talk about spasms, etc. following surgery. I'm hoping tomorrow will be even better than today. But anyone have any tips? I'm going to try a heating pad tonight. Last night I slept in the chair at my desk - zero pain. But the moment I got up, WOW, there it came. I don't know how to avoid this pain (other than maybe staying out of hot tubs)... anyone know of other \"triggers\"? This is by far the worst part of the whole ordeal so far. I got the Decipher test ordered, and I hope and pray I can monitor my PSA and not do more treatments until/unless the PSA rises. November 30 follow-up will give me more info as I have not spoken with the doctor since before my surgery. Best to all! And please do whatever it takes to avoid these spasms... they are unbearable.",

      "Content": "June 7 was my follow-up with Dr. Ward, Urologist, at MD Anderson seven months post surgery. In that time, I had three PSA tests that were undectable, and zero other complications, and have been dry for about four weeks (except when I drink, my bladder likes to party too!). This visit would determine my \"path forward\". First the Nure Practitioner comes in. She spends about 20 minutes going over things and telling me that with my PSA numbers, \"let me make another follow-up appointment in six months\" and we will just keep an eye on the PSA - and - do you want me to cancel the appointment you have with the Radiation Oncologist? And do you still want to see Dr, Ward? Uh, well yes I want to see Dr. Ward. And Dr. Ward can advise me whether to cancel the RO appointment or not. Dr. Ward enters the room, beaming with a smile and confidence. One of those guys you KNOW is smart and you can trust. (As an aside, he used to be at the Mayo Clinic where he tried to introduce fusion biopsies. He ended up at MDA and pushed for fusion biopsies, and now, he is the ONLY one at MDA who does them... he spends all day, one day a week, doing nothing but fusion biopsies. He is the go-to guy for complex prostate surgeries, like mine was.) Dr. Ward immediately started telling me that I needed adjuvant radiation treatments due to my adverse pathology. He says I had \"the real McCoy\" cancer and my risk factors are high for recurrance. He wanted me to see the RO to make a plan. Wow! If I would have followed the NP advice, I would have made an appt for six months later, and gone my merry way four hours to Kerrville. So now, Dr. Shah at the MDA Proton Center goes over everything with me. He says Proton is \"marginally better\" that other radiation treatments, and the back log is 2-3 months. I go on Medicare Sept. 1, and Medicare will pay for Proton treatments, but I can't get on the appointment schedule until I have been \"cleared\" for treatment, which can't be done until my Medicare is effective. Yea, pretty crazy. Now I am considering getting a second opinion regarding the \"kind\" of radiation treatment to seek. It's not a question of if, but what kind, when, and where. Can any of you offer thoughts on your view of the \"best\" kind of radiation treatment, with \"best\" meaning effectiveness and fewest side effects. I was told I would not need hormone therapy treatment - at least there was a BIT of good news! Grateful for any comments. Mike in Kerrville",

I am going to see a other RO locally, and am also considering another (yet to be identified)... where would you guys go for another opinion as to type and timing of RT? Thanks so much.

      "Content": "Our paths have closely matched as I've followed you. I'm doing pretty good in the pee department. Switched some weeks ago to pads only. And could prolly go without them unless drinking lots of liquids. It's no trouble to slip one in, so I just do it. However, my bladder calls to be emptied with much more frequency... that's a bit of a pain, but maybe it will get better. Maybe I should google around for some advice on how to train the bladder to hold more, like the old days! Good luck to you! Mike",

      "Content": "I had my third post RALP PSA text this week. (At 1, 4, 7 months post surgery.) And they have all come back <0.01, thank goodness. Given that I have adverse pathology, I was really sweating this last one. I go to Dr, John Ward III, my MD Anderson urologist, for the first follow-up in six months. I suppose it's then that we will have the dreaded discussion about additional treatment(s). Wait and see, or hit it hard! I wonder, is there anything \"in between\"? My bias is to \"wait and see\" unless convinced otherwise, and perhaps get an additional opinion. Which brings up an interesting question. If one goes to a highly qualified doctor (which he is) at a world-class facility (which MDA is), why would I go for a second or third opinion? Am I \"opinion shopping\" until I find someone with the answer I'm looking for? I have thought about this... have y'all? Anyway, I am grateful to still be in the Zero Club. By the way, my continence is excellent, unless I over do drinking, then the bladder has a mind of its own! lol Still wearing a pad for confidence, but may toss that soon. Also, I can get hard if using Tri Mix injections, even though the \"nerves\" were removed, along with seminal vesicles. Best Wishes to all, and thanks to all for the great personal stories shared in this forum. It really does help! Mike in Kerrville",

I think, but not sure, he made that appt for me after getting the results of my Decipher test. So, at least I will have an opportunity to visit with both URO and RO on the same day. I will continue to check PSA every 3 months prolly forever. It's cheap, plus my business partner is a doctor so I just get him to write the order, and in my small town it's very easy to get the blood drawn and get the results the next day.

      "Content": "There is a new device coming on the market that is FDA cleared for treating incontinence in women (stress or urge or mixed). The device is from a reputable company. (We own a MedSpa, and have done significant business with them.) The basic premise is the administration of focused electromagnetic pulse energy to stimulate muscle contraction in the pelvic floor area. I am told that a 28 minute session will produce the equivalent of 11,800 \"super maximal\" Kegel's. As you might think, a Kegel on a person's own strength is only around 15-20% \"contraction\" whereas a \"super\" is mnore like 80% contraction. The course of treatment for women is two 28-minute sessions, twice a week for three weeks. So what y'all think? Maybe work for men? Will doing super Kegels help more than manual Kegels? My first thought is 11,800 seems excessive and may \"overwork\" the area. Mike",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by Another I will add to your question. Are these clear 4s and clear 3s, or do they exist on a scale? Some 3s are closer to 4s and some 4s are closer to 3s. I suspect there are gradients. There are high and low grades within the classifications resulting in different multiplication rates across the spectrum. As mentioned, I suspect the grades are tied to measured outcomes to accomodate statistical forecasting. In the end a 3+4 is more risk than a 3+3 with a larger jump to 4+3. Think of it as multiplying rates being exponential functions. A small shift results in a much larger reproduction number on an exponential curve. And your prostate is probably producing them at a fixed rate, i.e. 10 - 3s to 1 - 4 etc, etc, etc, while a prostate that is producing more primary 4s is producing them at a faster rate than primary 3s and secondary 4s being produced in another prostate. This raises an interesting element... Is it the prostate that is \"producing\" the threes and fours - and is not producing 5's? Or do the threes and fours replicate themselves and perhaps morph/multiply into a higher number? In other words, where is the factory? All of this is just academic, but it's how I think. I'm of the view that nobody knows anything, including me. Remember when the earth used to be flat? My biopsy results just got changed (for the worse) after being reviewed at MD Anderson. I'm still leaning heavily toward Proton treatment, assuming I'm a candidate. Mike in Kerrville",

      "Content": "I've been thinking... While it seems to be common knowledge that a 3+4 is much better than a 4+3 Gleason, I wonder. Humor me with this: As we know, the first number represents the dominant \"cell\" (for lack of a better word), and the second number is the second most prominent. Also, a \"4\" is more agressive type of cell than a \"3\". We all get that. I'm thinking that the mere presence of any 4's - whether 3+4 or 4+3, is just as bad. For discussion sake, let's say there are 10 fours, and 5 threes. That would be a 4+3. That means we have 10 of those mean little 4's at work, doing what they do. But what happens if we still have 10 fours, alongside 15 threes. That would be a 3+4, and considered less agressive. But we STILL have those 10 fours busy working. So how can that be any less agressive than a 4+3 ? Just because the threes outnumber the fours does not mean the absolute number of fours are doing less work in either Gleason calculation, does it? It seems that even if there is only ONE four, regardless of how many threes exist, that would indicate an advancement and the army of fours is marching. Since all the smart science people seem to differ with this line of thinking, I am wondering where it is flawed? Thoughts? Mike in Kerrville",

      "Content": "There is a new device coming on the market that is FDA cleared for treating incontinence in women (stress or urge or mixed). The device is from a reputable company. (We own a MedSpa, and have done significant business with them.) The basic premise is the administration of focused electromagnetic pulse energy to stimulate muscle contraction in the pelvic floor area. I am told that a 28 minute session will produce the equivalent of 11,800 \"super maximal\" Kegel's. As you might think, a Kegel on a person's own strength is only around 15-20% \"contraction\" whereas a \"super\" is mnore like 80% contraction. The course of treatment for women is two 28-minute sessions, twice a week for three weeks. So what y'all think? Maybe work for men? Will doing super Kegels help more than manual Kegels? My first thought is 11,800 seems excessive and may \"overwork\" the area. Mike",

      "Content": "I've been thinking... While it seems to be common knowledge that a 3+4 is much better than a 4+3 Gleason, I wonder. Humor me with this: As we know, the first number represents the dominant \"cell\" (for lack of a better word), and the second number is the second most prominent. Also, a \"4\" is more agressive type of cell than a \"3\". We all get that. I'm thinking that the mere presence of any 4's - whether 3+4 or 4+3, is just as bad. For discussion sake, let's say there are 10 fours, and 5 threes. That would be a 4+3. That means we have 10 of those mean little 4's at work, doing what they do. But what happens if we still have 10 fours, alongside 15 threes. That would be a 3+4, and considered less agressive. But we STILL have those 10 fours busy working. So how can that be any less agressive than a 4+3 ? Just because the threes outnumber the fours does not mean the absolute number of fours are doing less work in either Gleason calculation, does it? It seems that even if there is only ONE four, regardless of how many threes exist, that would indicate an advancement and the army of fours is marching. Since all the smart science people seem to differ with this line of thinking, I am wondering where it is flawed? Thoughts? Mike in Kerrville",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by Another I will add to your question. Are these clear 4s and clear 3s, or do they exist on a scale? Some 3s are closer to 4s and some 4s are closer to 3s. I suspect there are gradients. There are high and low grades within the classifications resulting in different multiplication rates across the spectrum. As mentioned, I suspect the grades are tied to measured outcomes to accomodate statistical forecasting. In the end a 3+4 is more risk than a 3+3 with a larger jump to 4+3. Think of it as multiplying rates being exponential functions. A small shift results in a much larger reproduction number on an exponential curve. And your prostate is probably producing them at a fixed rate, i.e. 10 - 3s to 1 - 4 etc, etc, etc, while a prostate that is producing more primary 4s is producing them at a faster rate than primary 3s and secondary 4s being produced in another prostate. This raises an interesting element... Is it the prostate that is \"producing\" the threes and fours - and is not producing 5's?

      "Content": "I've been thinking... While it seems to be common knowledge that a 3+4 is much better than a 4+3 Gleason, I wonder. Humor me with this: As we know, the first number represents the dominant \"cell\" (for lack of a better word), and the second number is the second most prominent. Also, a \"4\" is more agressive type of cell than a \"3\". We all get that. I'm thinking that the mere presence of any 4's - whether 3+4 or 4+3, is just as bad. For discussion sake, let's say there are 10 fours, and 5 threes. That would be a 4+3. That means we have 10 of those mean little 4's at work, doing what they do. But what happens if we still have 10 fours, alongside 15 threes. That would be a 3+4, and considered less agressive. But we STILL have those 10 fours busy working. So how can that be any less agressive than a 4+3 ? Just because the threes outnumber the fours does not mean the absolute number of fours are doing less work in either Gleason calculation, does it? It seems that even if there is only ONE four, regardless of how many threes exist, that would indicate an advancement and the army of fours is marching. Since all the smart science people seem to differ with this line of thinking, I am wondering where it is flawed? Thoughts? Mike in Kerrville",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by Another I will add to your question. Are these clear 4s and clear 3s, or do they exist on a scale? Some 3s are closer to 4s and some 4s are closer to 3s. I suspect there are gradients. There are high and low grades within the classifications resulting in different multiplication rates across the spectrum. As mentioned, I suspect the grades are tied to measured outcomes to accomodate statistical forecasting. In the end a 3+4 is more risk than a 3+3 with a larger jump to 4+3. Think of it as multiplying rates being exponential functions. A small shift results in a much larger reproduction number on an exponential curve. And your prostate is probably producing them at a fixed rate, i.e. 10 - 3s to 1 - 4 etc, etc, etc, while a prostate that is producing more primary 4s is producing them at a faster rate than primary 3s and secondary 4s being produced in another prostate. This raises an interesting element... Is it the prostate that is \"producing\" the threes and fours - and is not producing 5's? Or do the threes and fours replicate themselves and perhaps morph/multiply into a higher number? In other words, where is the factory? All of this is just academic, but it's how I think.

Day of, administer an enema prior to the appointment and \"eat light\", avoiding raw fruits and vegetables. (I didn't eat anything since I was headed for a 11am appointment.) After doing all the consent forms, etc., and drinking a 20 oz water, I finally went in abour 45 minutes late. My bladder took notw of the 45 minute delay! The purpose of the water is to \"lift\" the bladder out of the firing zone. As it turend out, I had TOO much in my bladder, so I had to let some our... twice! They have a range of bladder fullness and it is measured with a nifty device she places on my belly... magic! Then comes the balloon in the butt part. This wasn't near as bad as I thought it would be, even when she filled it with 60cc of water. Then I was positioned on the CT sacan table. She did three scans. The second was a confirmation of the first, and the third was with the balloon removed. After everything is calibrated just so, she put marks with a semi-permanenet marker that will help get me aligned for treatement. After I was off the table they showed my the CT scans, which meant nothing to me, but pointed out the prostate bed that will be the Proton target. It took about an hour all in. I was surprised at the level of fulness they desired in the bladder. From what I have read, it sounded like they put you on the table along with a strong urgency to pee. That was not the case, after I had to drain twice, 250 cc total. It felt comfortable. Same for the balloon. While I know it sounds bad, it was actually a breeze, and I didn't feel it at all after insertion. This will be the same routine for the treatments, so I'm glad to learn firt hand it's not as bad as I was thinking it would be. I go badck to start real treatments next Tuesday. As for appointment scheduling, they operate from 4am to 11pm. I don't know yet what my time slot will be, and they said it will likely change around in the early days. I have a 10 mile drive from my RV site to the Proton Center, which can be 15 or 45 minutes, depending on time of day, so off-hours appointments would be fine with me. I'll check back in after the first treatment. Mike in Kerrville",

      "Content": "There isn't much info on this forum regarding Proton treatments for prostate cancer. The jury is still out on whether Proton treatment is more effective than traditional IMRT or other radiation treatments. I have looked into this and have concluded that applyiung simple logic would indicate Proton treatment to be more effective, especially with regards to fewer, less severe, side effects, especially when compared to surgery. However, not all prostate cancers are good candidates for Proton treatments. I chose surgery as my primary treatments due to \"having a lot of cancer\" in my prostate, plus seminal vesical invasion. The urologist said he would like to do my primary treatment with surgery to \"de-bulk\" the cancer. He even told me then that I will probably need to do radiation at some point following the surgery. Yes, a person can use radiation, Proton or otherwise, for their primary treatment but in the event of a recurrance, salvage options are limited. Yes, salvage surgery CAN be done, but is very difficult and rare from what I have learned. I think if I had a less advanced prostate cancer I would opt for Proton treatments as primary treatment. With that being said, I have recovered wonderfully from surgery with my only issue being \"leaking when drinking\" lol Some of you may recall that I've been talking about doing the radiation even though my PSA was mostly undetectable some 15 months post surgery. (Today I got my final PSA report prior to starting Proton treatments, it was 0.02, up from 0.01 seven weeks ago.) My choice to go ahead and start radiation treatments now instead of waiting for a higher PSA score that swould \"officially\" indicate a recurrance, is two-fold. First, it appears the cancer is \"easier to kill\" the earlier treatments are started and each tick up in PSA diminishes that advantage -- better results when starting at 0.02 than 0.2, for example.) Second, my high-risk pathology plus high risk Decipher score (.78 ) tells me I'm a candidate for a radiation \"mop up\". Sooo... Here I go. I'm going to update this thread as I stream through the treatments. Maybe some of you are considering Proton for your treatments and could benefit from the observations and thoughts of someone going through it. Of course, the first objection to Proton treatments is the cost. Understandably since the rack rate is over $100,000. A year or so ago when I had Blue Cross, they denied coverage, even on more than one appeal. But now that I'm on Medicare, it's covered! I don't know what the contracted rate is that Medicare pays to the Proton provider, but I've seen unverified numbers in the $30,000 area, I dunno. So for you guys on Medicare, or soon to be, if cost was keeping you from Proton strike that concern off your list. The first step for Proton treatments is to undergo a \"simulation\". I will be driving my RV to the Houston (MD Anderson) area this weekend and go for the simulation appointment Monday. I'm not all sure what goes on during the simulation, but will report back next week. My treatments start February 5, and go to March 29, every day except weekends. If any of you have questions about Proton, just let me know and I will try to get answers since I'll be up in the belly of the whale. That's it for now... weshallsee! Mike in Kerrville",

I was surprised at the level of fulness they desired in the bladder. From what I have read, it sounded like they put you on the table along with a strong urgency to pee. That was not the case, after I had to drain twice, 250 cc total. It felt comfortable. Same for the balloon. While I know it sounds bad, it was actually a breeze, and I didn't feel it at all after insertion. This will be the same routine for the treatments, so I'm glad to learn firt hand it's not as bad as I was thinking it would be. I go badck to start real treatments next Tuesday. As for appointment scheduling, they operate from 4am to 11pm. I don't know yet what my time slot will be, and they said it will likely change around in the early days. I have a 10 mile drive from my RV site to the Proton Center, which can be 15 or 45 minutes, depending on time of day, so off-hours appointments would be fine with me. I'll check back in after the first treatment. Mike in Kerrville",

      "Content": "There isn't much info on this forum regarding Proton treatments for prostate cancer. The jury is still out on whether Proton treatment is more effective than traditional IMRT or other radiation treatments. I have looked into this and have concluded that applyiung simple logic would indicate Proton treatment to be more effective, especially with regards to fewer, less severe, side effects, especially when compared to surgery. However, not all prostate cancers are good candidates for Proton treatments. I chose surgery as my primary treatments due to \"having a lot of cancer\" in my prostate, plus seminal vesical invasion. The urologist said he would like to do my primary treatment with surgery to \"de-bulk\" the cancer. He even told me then that I will probably need to do radiation at some point following the surgery. Yes, a person can use radiation, Proton or otherwise, for their primary treatment but in the event of a recurrance, salvage options are limited. Yes, salvage surgery CAN be done, but is very difficult and rare from what I have learned. I think if I had a less advanced prostate cancer I would opt for Proton treatments as primary treatment. With that being said, I have recovered wonderfully from surgery with my only issue being \"leaking when drinking\" lol Some of you may recall that I've been talking about doing the radiation even though my PSA was mostly undetectable some 15 months post surgery. (Today I got my final PSA report prior to starting Proton treatments, it was 0.02, up from 0.01 seven weeks ago.) My choice to go ahead and start radiation treatments now instead of waiting for a higher PSA score that swould \"officially\" indicate a recurrance, is two-fold. First, it appears the cancer is \"easier to kill\" the earlier treatments are started and each tick up in PSA diminishes that advantage -- better results when starting at 0.02 than 0.2, for example.) Second, my high-risk pathology plus high risk Decipher score (.78 ) tells me I'm a candidate for a radiation \"mop up\". Sooo... Here I go. I'm going to update this thread as I stream through the treatments. Maybe some of you are considering Proton for your treatments and could benefit from the observations and thoughts of someone going through it. Of course, the first objection to Proton treatments is the cost. Understandably since the rack rate is over $100,000. A year or so ago when I had Blue Cross, they denied coverage, even on more than one appeal. But now that I'm on Medicare, it's covered! I don't know what the contracted rate is that Medicare pays to the Proton provider, but I've seen unverified numbers in the $30,000 area, I dunno. So for you guys on Medicare, or soon to be, if cost was keeping you from Proton strike that concern off your list. The first step for Proton treatments is to undergo a \"simulation\". I will be driving my RV to the Houston (MD Anderson) area this weekend and go for the simulation appointment Monday. I'm not all sure what goes on during the simulation, but will report back next week. My treatments start February 5, and go to March 29, every day except weekends. If any of you have questions about Proton, just let me know and I will try to get answers since I'll be up in the belly of the whale. That's it for now... weshallsee! Mike in Kerrville",

      "Content": "Yes, I had to peek. One month post RALP, PSA was zero. Uro scheduled me for six months later (June 7) for next appt follow-up and PSA. Of course, I had to peek at what my PSA was before then! So at four months post RALP I did a local test, and again zero. Yay! Somewhere in all this I did the Decipher test which came back at .78 (high risk) plus, the Grid Report indicated I would be resistant to ADT. My Uro had never used Decipher, but he ordered it at my request. I guess insurance paid for it... or somebody paid for it, as I have never seen anything about any payment given or requested. Odd. After seeing the Decipher result, he scheduled me for an appt at the Proton Center (MD Anderson) on the same day as my visit with him (the Uro). (I am a fan of Proton Therapy, and visited with them prior to choosing surgery for my particular \"large volume\" case.) So now, I'm wondering... If my PSA is still zero on June 7 will the Proton folks still want to do radiation (considering everything EXCEPT PSA results would indicate it is likely needed)? Or will they say, let's wait until actual BCR, if/when? And IF radiation (Proton or otherwise) is indicated, what exactly is the \"target\" since the prostate is gone? Do they just shoot the whole area and hope for the best? Surely not. I guess this gets into the area of when is the optimum time to initiate salvage radiation. Before BCR, given my risk category, or after the onset of BCR? I will be getting on Medicare in September, so IF SRT is indicated, I'm sure I can wait until then to get started, yes? (Medicare will pay for Proton Therapy, my insurance will not.) Thanks to all! Always grateful. Mike in Kerrville",

I'm also concerned about \"low PSA PC\" indicating a more agressive cancer. Has this occured with anyone? Thanks! Mike",

      "Content": "I found myself in the same boat, however, my pathology is worse than yours. My MDA RO wants to do radiation without ADT, but I went to another RO yesterday locally and he said I should add the ADT, but he wouldn't insist. From what I have read, radiation + ADT generally gives better results. However, the RO yesterday said there is no way to \"measure\" if it helped and the only way docs know that it might help is from reading studies, etc. based on outcomes of the studies. Do you have the name of the study he suggested to you, I may also be a candidate for that. My PSA is >0.01. My plan is to wait until any indication of a rise, testing every three months, and at the first indication of a rise get a confirmation PSA, then, if the rise is to something less than 0.05 I may wait another three months and test again. If confirming, then start radiation with, or without ADT, immediately. I'm with you... this is such a foggy area... even the RO agreed with that on my visit yesterday. He suggests IMRT (because he is local, and that's what he has). I am also considering Proton at MDA, but am in the process of trying to understand how Proton's precise targeting can be useful (or not) for salvage treatment. The RO yesterday said it's almost fraudulent how Proton is marketed... he is a cynical sort of guy. lol But, there may be some truth to that. Good luck to you in trying to find to black or white in this prostate world of gray! Mike in Kerrville",

      "Content": "I have a small (invitation-only) Facebook group I started to keep my family and friends up-to-date with what's going on with me. It's a good way to share information \"all at once\". Some of you may already do this, but if you don't, you may want to consider doing so. I find it helps me to write, and it gives me a litle more room to share details with others. Here is my post of today: Day 59 What a difference a day makes. The last 59 days since my prostate cancer diagnosis have been quite a roller coaster. I use this space to sort of \"keep notes\". Plus, I feel it can be useful for others to know and learn more about this particular disease since it will affect 1 in 6 men, maybe including some of the men in your life. Like with many diseases, prostate cancer is much more curable when caught early. Men do not have the luxury of waiting until they can't pee before being active in monitoring their health, although I know many are stubborn that way. Stubborn can kill you. So I encourage men to get a baseline PSA test at least by age 50 and another test every year. It's not the \"number\" that is so important (mine is 3.5 which is BELOW the \"normal\" of 4), it is the rate of change in the number that matters most. A PSA test is a simple blood test. So if you are a man DO IT. If you love a man, MAKE HIM DO IT. I had, and still have, ZERO symptoms, yet here I sit with a high-risk, significantly large volume of prostate cancer. Ok, off the soap box. As many of you know, I have been stressing big time lately. You see, prostate cancer is a bit unique in that you have choices as to treatment paths. That's good, but it's also bad because while each path has it's \"pros\", each path comes with \"cons\". (I won't get into all of those now, but I am happy to speak with anyone interested.) I have been scared to \"pick a path\" for fear of choosing wrong. I wanted the smart doctors to evaluate me and guide me to the best path. I found they will often say, \"It's up to you.\". I didn't want it to be \"up to me\". I know the business world, I don't know the doctoring world. Yesterday at MD Anderson I met with what seems to be an incredible urologist, Dr. John Ward. He comes from the Mayo Clinic, and has a long pedigree, and seems to be quite a nice guy with a good bedside manner. Dr. Ward has already started to heal me by removing not my prostate, but by alleviating my tremendous stress of having to choose the path. He told me I have the \"real McCoy\" cancer. Meaning basically, I don't have a choice in my path. My cancer is high-risk, large-volume and involves the seminal vesicles and likely the bladder neck. My only realistic path is to take ALL paths - Fire all your guns at once and explode into space. He expertly explained that my path should start with surgery. Removing the prostate \"de-bulks\" the cancer and gets it out of where we KNOW it lives. Then we should follow, some few months later, with radiation to kill any stragglers that may have been left behind, and initiate hormone therapy treatment for up to two years to kill off any more cancer cells that may be circulating my body. His plan made sense. He was certain. He gave me confidence both in the plan, and in himself. He appeared to me as a \"pros pro\". I was put on his surgery schedule for October 23. After visiting Dr. Ward, even though the news wasn't good (no one wants to go through one, much less all three modalities), I felt my burden of choice being lifted. Now I had a plan and a doctor I have confidence in. It felt good. So now I have about a month of life \"pre-surgery\" before starting my life October 23 with a \"new normal\" - whatever that looks like. Maybe it took these last 59 days to get me ready for the new normal. This is a lot of stuff to digest, both intellectually and emotionally. But, I feel like I'm there and ready, with no small contribution from my incredibly supportive wife and family and... all of you cool cats. Let's roll.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by JustBrandon Excellent idea to be ready to tackle it when/if the PSA should reach 0.03 again. I believe in that case getting it done then would be most beneficial to you, and would quite likely be a successful treatment result. I certainly like it better than waiting til say like 0.2 like many physicans like to do. And of course if it does not reach that 0.03 threshold, then no action would be neccessary at the time, and you would get to avoid those side effects. I agree with the doctor that PSA is more important than time that has passed by since surgery. PSA is far more of accurate assessment of what prostate cancer does, and if it has returned after treatment. Hopefully it wont reach 0.03 and you wont have to begin therapy for it, but if it does come to that, I think you would do well. That's exactly my thinking. As we know, there is no black and white in this prostate cancer world... only gray areas and educated guessing. Mike in Kerrville",

      "Content": "Just FYI - Here is the note I sent to my RO at MDA today. Also, I agree with the MM comment above. Dr. Shah, Thank you for taking the time to visit with me last week. I have been digesting all of the information and have a couple of questions I hope you can help me with. In considering all of the aspects of initiating radiation therapy, there seem to be two factors that are fundamental to achieving the best outcome (with outcome being the combination of disease cure and quality of life issues). Those two factors are \"time elapsed post surgery to initiate RT\" and \"PSA, including the level immediately - say 30 days - after surgery and going forward\". I would think there would be a way to graph these two values in order to find the optimal time to initiate RT. In my reading (yes, I'm a bit of an Internet Doctor! lol) I find the following: \"... a PSA greater than or equal to 0.03 is the optimal threshold value for predicting BCR.\" And that 0.03 is the single most important and reliable predictor of BCR. It predicted all relapses (no false negatives) and hardly ever predicted relapses incorrectly. The study goes on to say 0.03 is especially prognostic if found on the first PSA test after surgery. (The study is: Kang, et al, UCLA, \"How soon after surgery should salvage radiation begin? July 9, 2017.) I have had three PSA tests, at 1 month, 4 months and 7 months. All were less than 0.01. Another study: Abugharib et al, Very early salvage radiation has up to 4-fold better outcomes and saves lives. September 20, 2016, says the time in months since completion of prostatectomy had no bearing on any of the outcomes and that the PSA at which they were treated has a major impact on all outcomes. This study defines \"very early salvage\" as 0.01-0.2 PSA. With these studies in mind, my question becomes: Does adjuvant treatment (treatment prior to any indication of BCR) give me any better outcome than waiting for my PSA to tick up to 0.03? And what if the time for the \"tick up\" is 6 months or 6 years, and only then initiating very early salvage treatment. Would RT started at that point be outcome equivalent to adjuvant treatment? If not, what would I be \"giving up\" in terms of chances for a better outcome? I hope my question is clear, but I suspect I'm not the first person to ask this. Secondly, regardless of when the RT is initiated, and I am fully onboard with the treatment but am just wondering about the timing, as above, what is the optimal treatment \"machine\" - Proton, IMRT, or other, and why. Cost aside. And hopefully putting aside the need for MDA to keep the Proton machine busy. Is my case such that another RO could be reasonably expected to come to the same conclusion (especially if they don't have a Proton)? My big fear is side effects - the long-term/permanent/late onset ones. I can live with the temporary side effects. Is there a trade-off between fewer side effects and the type of treatment (IMRT or other and Proton, for example)? I realize this is a lengthy question, and if you prefer, perhaps we can spend a few minutes on the phone to discuss. Thank you for your kind care, and for being \"a joker\". Mike Simmons",

      "Content": "I haven't been on the forum for a couple of weeks. I kinda thought I knew what was going on, and wanted to step away for a while. Then, I start my adventure at MD Anderson. First, an updated pathology report, still at a 4+3, but with 9 positive cores vs. previous 7. Then the MRI showed seminal ves. and bladder neck involvement plus a \"large volume of PC\". So now what? I had been leaning to Proton Therapy, and had a visit with a rad. onc. doctor, Dr. Mayo (interesting name, huh? lol). And, they say I'm still a candidate for that. I have a urologist appt. at MDA on Thursday to look at everything from a surgery view, and hopefully create a going-forward plan. I may need surgery + radiation + two years of hormone therapy. (That is what I am expecting I will be told.) Proton Therapy has been denied by Blue Cross, but MDA is appealing now. Not counting on them winning. It's really starting to get to me mentally. Indecision. Not knowing whether to choose path A or B. Scared of either option. The pros and cons exist at every turn. The only absolute, is that there is no absolute. In the end, I will seek, and accept, the learned judgement of the urologist and the MDA team on Thursday as to what path to take. Then, I'll buy my ticket and get on board! I have to trust they know better than me. Now I'll be reading the forum looking for info on bladder neck involvment and hormone therapy. I'm sure there are plenty of folks who have written about those topics. Sorry to sound so blue... but I am. And I know that so many have things much worse than me, so I have much to be grateful for.

      "Content": "Just FYI - Here is the note I sent to my RO at MDA today. Also, I agree with the MM comment above. Dr. Shah, Thank you for taking the time to visit with me last week. I have been digesting all of the information and have a couple of questions I hope you can help me with. In considering all of the aspects of initiating radiation therapy, there seem to be two factors that are fundamental to achieving the best outcome (with outcome being the combination of disease cure and quality of life issues). Those two factors are \"time elapsed post surgery to initiate RT\" and \"PSA, including the level immediately - say 30 days - after surgery and going forward\". I would think there would be a way to graph these two values in order to find the optimal time to initiate RT. In my reading (yes, I'm a bit of an Internet Doctor! lol) I find the following: \"... a PSA greater than or equal to 0.03 is the optimal threshold value for predicting BCR.\" And that 0.03 is the single most important and reliable predictor of BCR. It predicted all relapses (no false negatives) and hardly ever predicted relapses incorrectly. The study goes on to say 0.03 is especially prognostic if found on the first PSA test after surgery. (The study is: Kang, et al, UCLA, \"How soon after surgery should salvage radiation begin? July 9, 2017.) I have had three PSA tests, at 1 month, 4 months and 7 months. All were less than 0.01. Another study: Abugharib et al, Very early salvage radiation has up to 4-fold better outcomes and saves lives. September 20, 2016, says the time in months since completion of prostatectomy had no bearing on any of the outcomes and that the PSA at which they were treated has a major impact on all outcomes. This study defines \"very early salvage\" as 0.01-0.2 PSA. With these studies in mind, my question becomes: Does adjuvant treatment (treatment prior to any indication of BCR) give me any better outcome than waiting for my PSA to tick up to 0.03? And what if the time for the \"tick up\" is 6 months or 6 years, and only then initiating very early salvage treatment. Would RT started at that point be outcome equivalent to adjuvant treatment? If not, what would I be \"giving up\" in terms of chances for a better outcome? I hope my question is clear, but I suspect I'm not the first person to ask this. Secondly, regardless of when the RT is initiated, and I am fully onboard with the treatment but am just wondering about the timing, as above, what is the optimal treatment \"machine\" - Proton, IMRT, or other, and why. Cost aside. And hopefully putting aside the need for MDA to keep the Proton machine busy. Is my case such that another RO could be reasonably expected to come to the same conclusion (especially if they don't have a Proton)? My big fear is side effects - the long-term/permanent/late onset ones. I can live with the temporary side effects. Is there a trade-off between fewer side effects and the type of treatment (IMRT or other and Proton, for example)? I realize this is a lengthy question, and if you prefer, perhaps we can spend a few minutes on the phone to discuss. Thank you for your kind care, and for being \"a joker\". Mike Simmons",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by JustBrandon Excellent idea to be ready to tackle it when/if the PSA should reach 0.03 again. I believe in that case getting it done then would be most beneficial to you, and would quite likely be a successful treatment result. I certainly like it better than waiting til say like 0.2 like many physicans like to do. And of course if it does not reach that 0.03 threshold, then no action would be neccessary at the time, and you would get to avoid those side effects. I agree with the doctor that PSA is more important than time that has passed by since surgery. PSA is far more of accurate assessment of what prostate cancer does, and if it has returned after treatment. Hopefully it wont reach 0.03 and you wont have to begin therapy for it, but if it does come to that, I think you would do well. That's exactly my thinking. As we know, there is no black and white in this prostate cancer world... only gray areas and educated guessing. Mike in Kerrville",

She says once radiation is started, the pee skills are \"fixed\" at that point, so she wants me to be at my max. Anyone with experience on this? I think she won't go any longer than 2-3 months, regardless. Hoping I can get my skills hond by then. Mike",

      "Content": "This is snipped from a report posted here, published January 2, 2019 with authors from MDA. Treating all the patients with BCR after RP with salvage radiotherapy will result in unnecessary morbidity and overtreatment.[90],[91],[92] Ross et al. utilized Decipher to help guide the decision to use salvage radiotherapy in patients with BCR. Fewer than 10% of patients categorized in the low-risk group with Decipher <0.4 developed metastasis within 3 years of BCR, while 73% of men with Decipher ≥0.4 developed metastasis, with 40% within 3 years of BCR.[93] Furthermore, Den et al. demonstrated that for patients with Decipher scores <0.4, there were no reductions in cumulative incidence of metastasis when comparing adjuvant radiotherapy to salvage radiotherapy. For patients with Decipher scores ≥0.4, cumulative 5-year incidence of metastasis was 6% for patients treated with adjuvant radiotherapy group in comparison to 23% for the salvage radiotherapy group, indicated the superiority of adjuvant radiotherapy in patients with higher Decipher scores. This hits home with me since I'm headed for radiation in a couple of weeks and have a PSA of 0.01, but a Decipher score of 0.78. Mike in Kerrville",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by ASAdvocate A free PSA of 47% is by far the highest I have ever seen mentioned on a prostate cancer forum. That's because you don't have PCa. ASAP and HGPIN can/maybe not be precursors of PCa, There are different studies. They are anomalies, but not cancer. The chance that any man might get PCa in his lifetime is about 14-16 percent. The chance of a man of 73 having some amount of prostate cancer is much, much higher. I would take that 12 percent guess and sleep well on it. Yes, you are OK. The only concern you need to have about prostate cancer is keeping your next routine appointment. My Free PSA was 52%. But yep I had it. Mike",

Age 63. PSA 5.1. Doc suggests surgery, but said he might be biased since he is a surgeon. I'm ok with that if that's the best way, but have been exploring Proton therapy at MD Anderson in Houston, and am already setting up an initial appointment. Do they just do a \"sales job\"?

      "Content": "This is snipped from a report posted here, published January 2, 2019 with authors from MDA. Treating all the patients with BCR after RP with salvage radiotherapy will result in unnecessary morbidity and overtreatment.[90],[91],[92] Ross et al. utilized Decipher to help guide the decision to use salvage radiotherapy in patients with BCR. Fewer than 10% of patients categorized in the low-risk group with Decipher <0.4 developed metastasis within 3 years of BCR, while 73% of men with Decipher ≥0.4 developed metastasis, with 40% within 3 years of BCR.[93] Furthermore, Den et al. demonstrated that for patients with Decipher scores <0.4, there were no reductions in cumulative incidence of metastasis when comparing adjuvant radiotherapy to salvage radiotherapy. For patients with Decipher scores ≥0.4, cumulative 5-year incidence of metastasis was 6% for patients treated with adjuvant radiotherapy group in comparison to 23% for the salvage radiotherapy group, indicated the superiority of adjuvant radiotherapy in patients with higher Decipher scores. This hits home with me since I'm headed for radiation in a couple of weeks and have a PSA of 0.01, but a Decipher score of 0.78. Mike in Kerrville",

      "Content": "I've been debating with myself, and others, about whether to go forward with radiation treatments post surgery even though my PSA has been undetectable for 12 months post surgery. Or, should I wait until it \"ticks up\" to start? I have a phone appt with my RO tomorrow, so I thought I would get a current PSA. I had that done yesterday and today the result is 0.02. (One month ago it was undetectable.) In my view, and with my adverse pathology, 0.02 is indeed a \"tick up\", so I'm going to go ahead and proceed with Proton treatments (with or without ADT to be decided).

He said I am smack dab in the middle of the \"gray\" area as for as whether to proceed with radiation at this time. He is going to have me do a PET Scan (not sure of the exact name), and that is being scheduled in Houston now. I expect the scan to show nothing since I believe I read that the sensitivity of the scan isn't low enough to detect down to 0.02. He also said MDA does NOT use PSA tests that go to more than one decimal. I get my PSA tests done at CPL lab in Austin, not at MDA. Backlog for Proton at MDA is February. IMRT (or other) available \"immediately\". He said we can talk about which to use after the scan. Gray area... such is our lives. Mike in gray Kerrville",

Now to see how the pee goes... Also, taking the catheter out (my wife did it) was absolutely nothing. She had it out before I knew she had got started! I got my first pathology report today. (Day 10) Lymph nodes clear. Bladder neck clear. SV - report to follow (I know it is involved), and a new term I haven't seen here or anywhere... Anterior Fat Pad. The report said \"supplemental report to follow\", which means to me that there is an issue with this. From what I can determine, this fat pad is a place where lymph nodes can harbor that is different than pelvic lymph nodes. It may be that it is remarkable from just the presence of nodes in this fat, and they may or may not be malignant. That's about all I can learn, so far. Anyone have further info on this? So, my report from \"the other side\" is that all the worrying I did was pretty much for nothing. I'm surely not saying this was fun, but it was a damn bit easier than I would have ever thought it would be... thank goodness! I'm fully expecting I will need further treatment (radiation, hormone therapy, or both), but my follow-up is Nov. 30. Thanks to all. Mike",

He said I am smack dab in the middle of the \"gray\" area as for as whether to proceed with radiation at this time. He is going to have me do a PET Scan (not sure of the exact name), and that is being scheduled in Houston now. I expect the scan to show nothing since I believe I read that the sensitivity of the scan isn't low enough to detect down to 0.02. He also said MDA does NOT use PSA tests that go to more than one decimal. I get my PSA tests done at CPL lab in Austin, not at MDA. Backlog for Proton at MDA is February. IMRT (or other) available \"immediately\". He said we can talk about which to use after the scan. Gray area... such is our lives. Mike in gray Kerrville",

      "Content": "I had surgery Oct. 23 at MDA, with first follow-up Nov. 30. The post-op pathology confirmed the pre-op Gleason 4+3. Prostate was 35 grams with a tumor 3.5 cm x 2.0 cm located extensively in the apex and base. Invasion of both seminal vesicals, perivesicular soft tissue, and microscopic bladder neck invasion (which was cut out). Clear margins. No lymph node or other involvement. Staged at pT3b. Considering the extent of all that, I was fully expecting to go in and learn about my future treatment plan (radiation, hormone therapy, etc.). Turns out, my PSA on that same day was \"undetectable\". So the news was... \"come back in six months\". I was kinda shocked, but thrilled, of course. I asked the doc if I should do more PSA tests along the way - maybe at 1 month or 3 months out - he said no need to do that, just put it out of your mind and let's do it in six months. I asked him about the ultra-sensitive PSA testing - he's not a fan, saying it just causes unnecessary worry, and said (pointing to my wife) that he could find PSA in her with a sensitive enough test. So that's exactly what I'm going to do. Forget about it. (As soon as I lose this incredible rectal pain I've had for 2+weeks, but is MUCH better now. Doc thinks caused by bladder/pelvic floor spasms and gave me a new Rx which seems to work.) I'll start focusing on learning to pee better - I have a bit of control, but a ways to go yet. And haven't even started thinking about ED issues. Hopefully, I'll renew my Zero Club membership on June 7, 2018. It sure feels good to get some good news for a change! I'll close this with a funny -- Doc was trying to understand my pain issue. So he asks, \"Do you ever see fecal matter when you urinate, or urine from your rectum when you have a BM?\" To that question I immediately replied, \"Only when I'm on acid.\" He almost spit on me laughing...",

      "Content": "My bladder situation is much like you describe. After catheter was out it was a contant dribble, never \"full and release\". Today I still don't get a real full bladder. As I'm walking around, it leaks out with no control. If I go sit on the toilet, I can have a small stream - but I never wait for it to get too full. The urgency to go is really a pain in the butt, and often there isn't much there. I had horrible spasms and pain for about three weeks, starting about 3 days after catheter was out. I'm just today getting through some of that pain. It was exhausting, and kept me on the toilet an extreme amount of time, 24 hours a day. The rectal pain, abdominal and urethra pain was happening all at once, and I couldn't hardly take it. Doc said some of this pain is normal, but I was having WAY more than normal - it was deblitating. He changed my spasm Rx, and seems to have done the trick. Now I just have rectal pain only after walking around - sitting or laying, no pain. So I think I have turned the corner on getting rid of the pain. Because of all that, I haven't been \"working\" on continence so much, but now I can. I'm on one diaper all night (but am up several times). It feels soooo good to feel good again. (I went to the hospital by ambulance when the pain first started... of course they did nothing except drug my pain down and send me home. In honesty, there really wasn't much more they could have done. Lucky my wife is a highly-skilled RN and she has managed my Rx's and pain treatment.) I'm not comfortable being out and about just yet because things can happen very quickly - both pain and urges - but am starting to venture short trips. Good luck to you!",
