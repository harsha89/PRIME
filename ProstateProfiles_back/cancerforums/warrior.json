      "Content": "Thanks, shu246. I do feel like a warrior. I had breast cancer 17 years ago. My father had prostrate cancer and passed from leukemia. My mom had lung cancer, and now has advancing breast cancer. My brother has lymphoma. My DIL was just diagnosed with stage 2 breast cancer. And my hubby is trying to deal with his prostrate cancer. It's been a part of my life for a long time.",

      "Content": "Yes, a bone scan and CT, both were negative. The first urologist was recommending surgery too, they were just moving too slow. So, first and second opinion are both surgery. I could see no reason to wait two months to do it. There was a very good chance the cancer was contained, so why not go for the cure? If possible, avoid dying from PC. Keep the muscle mass for as long as possible, and be able to do things for many years. He had no other health issues, not even high blood pressure. And lived a very active life.",

      "Content": "They believed the cancer was contained, and if surgery was chosen he would have less lasting side effects. He is very active, works full time in our biz, does much gardening, and we travel. It was our choice. We were hoping for a cure without the side effects of radiation or hormone therapy. We saw two urologist. The surgeon was one of the top urology oncologists.",

      "Content": "Hello all! I\u0092ve read most posts. Thank you all for sharing and discussing your situations. Knowing others are willing to share is very helpful when trying to understand your own situation. My father passed with prostrate cancer several years ago, and so my husband has always done PSA tests. This year, the discussion was you\u0092re 75, too old for PSA tests. But, we insisted. His PSA was 4., a dramatic increase. So, the discussion became, you\u0092re too old for a biopsy, but we insisted, and it was positive. 4+3 about half positive, on one side. The recommended surgeon was very slow. It would have taken about 5-6 weeks to determine robotic surgery or not, more time to actually get it done. So again, we pressed, and asked my oncologist for the name of another surgeon, and he was able to get staged and the surgery completed in two weeks. Clear margins and negative lymph nodes. After the surgery, he was walking within one hour of returning to his hospital room. Feeling good, things were great. We worked hard to take care of the catheter, and had it removed after six days. Four days later, things started falling apart. I\u0092ll leave out all the details. He had developed UTI. After IV antibiotics and 21 days of pills, UTI was gone. He is now three months out. He has pain in his buttocks, groin, penis, and scrotum, so much he has problems walking or sitting. He has goopy discharges, some clear, but many are yellow or pink. Has anyone else had pain for this long or these discharges? He was very active before, and now feels like he is just existing. Thank you for any response.",
