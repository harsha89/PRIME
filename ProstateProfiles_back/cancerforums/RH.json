      "Content": "Is it continuous, or more like 'pulsating' pain? I got the pulsating kind about two years after surgery, I've had it a couple of times since. A bit like someone sticking a needle at unregular intervals in the groin. My doctor thinks that it may be hernia, which sometimes follows surgery. If it is hernia, then further surgery is an option. If you find out some other reason, I'd be interested to hear about it.",
