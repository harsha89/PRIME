I had NUC bone scans and CT of the pelvis and abdomen and they were both negative. So, those were not enough for him to clearly see the Prostate, apparently? Hope this helps?",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by Consult1 I'm not as knowledgeable as those who have been dealing with this for years, but I had a similar genetic test done called OncotypeDx GPS. In my case the blind biopsy showed I had Gleason 6, so the additional test was being done to evaluate whether active surveillance might be appropriate. I don't understand the logic in your case of the additional lab test (other than perhaps a confirmation of the biopsy). You should be relieved that the bone scan was negative. Maybe I missed it, but was a 3T MRI ordered? I would think that would be more helpful in determining a course of action than the genetic test. In any event, I wish you the best! Consult1, no just the NUC Whole Body Scan & CT Urogram were ordered and then the Prolaris. Good question to pose in my consult. Perhaps it is to determine how quickly to act and the method. Have not discussed any strategy yet. Thanks for the input!",

      "Content": "I am 69 and been lurking for about a month, since my diagnosis, and now with just about all of the facts, thought I would get the advice of you brave and knowledgeable individuals, regarding my next step! I would like to think my PSA of 51.2, was at least a little high, due to having ejaculated, jogged a mile, lifted heavy weights and mowed for an hour on my John Deere, within 24 to 48 hours before the test. Like others have expressed, it is not common knowledge what not to do before having a PSA test done. I am waiting on the Prolaris test (maybe next week) to help determine how aggressive it is and then a consult on 9/11/17 (crazy date, huh). Scans were CLEAR. Seeking anyone's thoughts on possible course of action. I am leaning towards robotic, radical surgery, foregoing possible side effects over more likelihood of possible permanent cure, if that is even possible? Let me know if you need more info. from the biopsy? Oh by the way, it has a UroScore Report in it, which I haven't been able to find much info. on, on the NET.

The visualized liver demonstrates no discrete mass or biliary dilatation. The spleen appears unremarkable. Gallbladder is contracted with gallstones noted. The pancreas and adrenal glands appear to be unremarkable. Kidneys and collecting system demonstrates no signs of urinary calculi. Contrast images demonstrate no sign of suspicious mass within the kidneys. No hydronephrosis noted. No filling defects are seen. The bladder appears to be unremarkable. Prostatic enlargement noted. No abscess or free air. No significant adenopathy. Diverticulosis seen involving the descending and sigmoid colon. Of course, if surgery is performed, metastasis will be more obvious, around the Prostate, I assume? Thanks, so much for your input!",

      "Content": "I am 69 and been lurking for about a month, since my diagnosis, and now with just about all of the facts, thought I would get the advice of you brave and knowledgeable individuals, regarding my next step! I would like to think my PSA of 51.2, was at least a little high, due to having ejaculated, jogged a mile, lifted heavy weights and mowed for an hour on my John Deere, within 24 to 48 hours before the test. Like others have expressed, it is not common knowledge what not to do before having a PSA test done. I am waiting on the Prolaris test (maybe next week) to help determine how aggressive it is and then a consult on 9/11/17 (crazy date, huh). Scans were CLEAR. Seeking anyone's thoughts on possible course of action. I am leaning towards robotic, radical surgery, foregoing possible side effects over more likelihood of possible permanent cure, if that is even possible? Let me know if you need more info. from the biopsy? Oh by the way, it has a UroScore Report in it, which I haven't been able to find much info. on, on the NET. Thoughts from you courageous, knowledgeable and VERY wise survivors, would really be appreciated.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by MRJ Mike, you'll need to train your bladder to wait just a bit longer than it wants to. Instead of getting up and going when you first feel the urge, you'll need to wait just a little, then go. Mike, 1st few days off the cath, I had a similar problem of almost constant dribbling, when standing up. One online source recommended sitting on the toilet every 2 hrs. the first day and then lengthen the time between each day until you have some control. Can you stop your flow midstream? This is a good exercise, too. Some claim lots of walking helps gain control, also. Unfortunately, my cath was in for 3 weeks so my bladder really lost some muscle. So, I am trying to \"pump it back up\". Doc. said I would have difficulty figuring out when to go and would have to go more often for the first week. So, it can be different for everyone but the goal is to just see improvement over time and most likely nothing is wrong. Hang in there!",

Consult1, no just the NUC Whole Body Scan & CT Urogram were ordered and then the Prolaris. Good question to pose in my consult. Perhaps it is to determine how quickly to act and the method. Have not discussed any strategy yet. Thanks for the input!",

I am waiting on the Prolaris test (maybe next week) to help determine how aggressive it is and then a consult on 9/11/17 (crazy date, huh). Scans were CLEAR. Seeking anyone's thoughts on possible course of action. I am leaning towards robotic, radical surgery, foregoing possible side effects over more likelihood of possible permanent cure, if that is even possible? Let me know if you need more info. from the biopsy? Oh by the way, it has a UroScore Report in it, which I haven't been able to find much info. on, on the NET. Thoughts from you courageous, knowledgeable and VERY wise survivors, would really be appreciated.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by Consult1 I'm not as knowledgeable as those who have been dealing with this for years, but I had a similar genetic test done called OncotypeDx GPS. In my case the blind biopsy showed I had Gleason 6, so the additional test was being done to evaluate whether active surveillance might be appropriate. I don't understand the logic in your case of the additional lab test (other than perhaps a confirmation of the biopsy). You should be relieved that the bone scan was negative. Maybe I missed it, but was a 3T MRI ordered? I would think that would be more helpful in determining a course of action than the genetic test. In any event, I wish you the best! Consult1, no just the NUC Whole Body Scan & CT Urogram were ordered and then the Prolaris. Good question to pose in my consult. Perhaps it is to determine how quickly to act and the method. Have not discussed any strategy yet. Thanks for the input!",

      "Content": "I am 69 and been lurking for about a month, since my diagnosis, and now with just about all of the facts, thought I would get the advice of you brave and knowledgeable individuals, regarding my next step! I would like to think my PSA of 51.2, was at least a little high, due to having ejaculated, jogged a mile, lifted heavy weights and mowed for an hour on my John Deere, within 24 to 48 hours before the test. Like others have expressed, it is not common knowledge what not to do before having a PSA test done. I am waiting on the Prolaris test (maybe next week) to help determine how aggressive it is and then a consult on 9/11/17 (crazy date, huh). Scans were CLEAR. Seeking anyone's thoughts on possible course of action. I am leaning towards robotic, radical surgery, foregoing possible side effects over more likelihood of possible permanent cure, if that is even possible? Let me know if you need more info. from the biopsy? Oh by the way, it has a UroScore Report in it, which I haven't been able to find much info. on, on the NET. Thoughts from you courageous, knowledgeable and VERY wise survivors, would really be appreciated.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by MRJ Mike, you'll need to train your bladder to wait just a bit longer than it wants to. Instead of getting up and going when you first feel the urge, you'll need to wait just a little, then go. Mike, 1st few days off the cath, I had a similar problem of almost constant dribbling, when standing up. One online source recommended sitting on the toilet every 2 hrs. the first day and then lengthen the time between each day until you have some control. Can you stop your flow midstream? This is a good exercise, too. Some claim lots of walking helps gain control, also. Unfortunately, my cath was in for 3 weeks so my bladder really lost some muscle. So, I am trying to \"pump it back up\". Doc. said I would have difficulty figuring out when to go and would have to go more often for the first week. So, it can be different for everyone but the goal is to just see improvement over time and most likely nothing is wrong. Hang in there!",

I ask because I\u2019m on the same 2ADT regime an am flummoxed about continuing the Casodex. Thanks, and keep those 00\u2019s coming! It is interesting that you bring this up, garyi, because my wife and I have the same question and will confront our new Medical Oncologist (MO), next week, when getting the Lupron injection. My RALP surgeon was the one to start me on Lupron/Casodex, possibly for the alleged \"flare\" that can occur and my Radiation Oncologist (RO) questioned whether I should stay on it but deferred to the MO. Have you read anything challenging the duo, because I am definitely interested? So, otherwise, I will report back, next week.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by garyi You mention another Lupron shot. Are you staying on Casodex for the duration of your Lupron therapy? I ask because I\u2019m on the same 2ADT regime an am flummoxed about continuing the Casodex. Thanks, and keep those 00\u2019s coming! It is interesting that you bring this up, garyi, because my wife and I have the same question and will confront our new Medical Oncologist (MO), next week, when getting the Lupron injection. My RALP surgeon was the one to start me on Lupron/Casodex, possibly for the alleged \"flare\" that can occur and my Radiation Oncologist (RO) questioned whether I should stay on it but deferred to the MO. Have you read anything challenging the duo, because I am definitely interested? So, otherwise, I will report back, next week.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by Another I had bladder spasm near the end of my catheter period. Very, very, very painful. Uncontrollable. Just had to beathe through them and wait them out. Similar to birth contractions, but probably not as large. I found pushing some with them relieved some of the discomfort. Resisting them and trying to make them stop only made it worse. When I asked the doctor he said it was a sign of healing. I assumed attempt by the bladder to reject the catheter. Mine was in for longer than normal. They continued mildly after removal of the catheter whenever I urinated and ended within a few days. It is a muscle cramp. If you had an enlarged prostate and reduced stream your bladder (a muscle) has gotten muscled up forcing urine through the restricted urethra. When it cramps you will feel it. Try some electrolytes. Wow, Another, I will have my cath in 13 days, assuming the leak heals? Hope I don't share your problem. My Prostate ended up being 70 gm. (2x what biopsy showed), hopefully not too muscular. I don't remember your signature, did you have RT in the St. Louis area. Now that I know I will have to, I am researching alternatives. Thanks!",

The cancer had went outside of the prostate so the Seminole Vesicle was removed along with the lymph nodes. Pathology shows the left vesicle was cancerous as well as 1 lymph node out of 3 and 32% of the prostate. Path also scored him as a Gleason 9. Recovery is going pretty good after 3 days of fighting the results of the CO2. He biggest problem is his penis and scrotum are so swollen and painful. Does anyone know how long this will last. Charlie's wife, how is it going with your hubby. My scrotum is finally close to normal (day 14) and it makes a big difference in wanting to do things. You don't have to waddle when you walk. Hopefully, he is showing some improvement and, unlike me, his catheter will come out at a more normal time, which will also make a great difference? Keep us posted.",

CW, yes it is very common, as I have read on another forum. Mine became swollen after a few days and turned black and blue. My Doc. told me to elevate them. Still try to walk but it may be more of a waddle. I put an ice pack on them sometimes and that reduced the swelling but it will come back until they have healed. They returned to normal color after about a week and still are not normal at day 12, but getting close. My left side still has a little pain and I just take tylenol but he may need something more. Check with the Doc. Bottom line it is just part of the surgical side effects and very common and some have it worse than others and some not at all. I also sent you a private message.",

Charlie's wife, how is it going with your hubby. My scrotum is finally close to normal (day 14) and it makes a big difference in wanting to do things. You don't have to waddle when you walk. Hopefully, he is showing some improvement and, unlike me, his catheter will come out at a more normal time, which will also make a great difference? Keep us posted.",

CW, yes it is very common, as I have read on another forum. Mine became swollen after a few days and turned black and blue. My Doc. told me to elevate them. Still try to walk but it may be more of a waddle. I put an ice pack on them sometimes and that reduced the swelling but it will come back until they have healed. They returned to normal color after about a week and still are not normal at day 12, but getting close. My left side still has a little pain and I just take tylenol but he may need something more. Check with the Doc. Bottom line it is just part of the surgical side effects and very common and some have it worse than others and some not at all. I also sent you a private message.",

He still has some swelling in the abdomen but it has went down considerably. His scrotum and penis are still swollen. They both go down some at night but go back up after he gets up. He reclines most of the time which helps some but according to him not enough! He did finally put some jeans on this week which he said did help as far as support but he still is in the waddling state when he walks. He has been outside walking more this week which I think helped some. After reading about everyone else having the same problems it helps relieve the anxiety which also helps. He said it it wasn\u2019t for the boys being three times their size he would be in great shape considering. He is also a pT3b, GS 9 with one positive lymph node. Incontinence is not bad. Dry at night and mostly during the day except when getting up, sneezing etc. Has already switched from wearing the guard pads to the lighter pad which I feel is pretty good. Go back for his first PSA and follow up since surgery on 1-3-18. Hoping for a good read but prepared for probable radiation treatments. How long did you have to have the catheter. How are you doing with treatments? If you look at my signature, we are nearly the same. I had 3/7 lymph node, seminal vesicles + and + margin between bladder neck and prostate. Periprostatic tissue = -. My Doc. feels he got everything but you never know about the microscopic cells. He immediately put me on Lupron and Casodex to stop any growth for 3-6 months so my body could heal before adjuvant radiation. I'm going back at week 3 to get the catheter removed, maybe? Where he sewed the ureter to the bladder neck the neck was inflamed by being pushed on by prostate and is healing slowly. He also did a sample there, too. Nothing in the bladder fortunately. Sounds like big decisions ahead? Keep us informed.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by tpjames 1st PSA since surgery Nov 21, reported < 0.1 which was stated as undetectable . Will be tested every 3 months for 2 years, then every 6 months for 2 years. Then, if all is well, once a year. I was told that anything reported .2 or above may require attention. We talked about many things, incontinence being one. I have never had an issue of WET at night and the stress incontinence during the day is less and less each week. Several weeks back I stopped using any pads at night and this week I have started with NO pads during the day. A very minimal drop now and then. I do understand that if I am doing any assertive work it would be good to use a thin pad. Regarding ED, still not woke up but sensations are there , something is going on, I can feel it waking up. I am now cleared to use 100 MG of Viagra (Sildenafil) , lets see what happens. Even though I was expecting to be a member of Club Zero, it is still a relief to hear the words and learn the results. Been a crazy last 6 months thats for sure. best to all t Fantastic news, tpj!!!!!!!! I stopped using pads at about 10 weeks.

      "Content": "Originally Posted by BAB Keep good spirits! I started a clinical trial (post RALP) at Johns Hopkins for guys with metastatic PCa. The regiment started off with 4 sessions of Docetaxel (each session separated by 3 weeks). Also began Lupron on same day as starting chemo. My major side effect from the chemo was tiredness -- which began on day 5 after chemo and lasted about 4 days. My hair thinned but I did NOT lose it. After completing chemo I had 69 Gray of radiation. PSA has been tested each quarter after surgery and has stayed at .01. Have been reading a LOT of research (as most of us do!), and it seems as if administering docetaxel for guys like us has become popular. My doc (Dr. Pienta) feels that administering the chemo early treats some of the systemic cells (I had two lymph nodes that tested positive.) Not enjoying the ADT, but you do what you gotta do! BAB, As you can see from my signature, I too, had 4+5 and + bladder margin, and 3 of 7 lymph nodes +, plus, but also + sv's and vas deferens. So far, I have had RALP, starting Lupron & Cassodex, following final path. After 3 months I am about to start RT, for 8 wks. to Pelvic bed and Pelvic and Periaortic Lymph Nodes. My RO, yesterday, recommended I do Chemo 2 weeks following RT. This surprised me because I had the advanced Axumin PET scan, showing no obvious mets. He is convinced, that with a 4+5 most likely I have microscopic mets beyond the Pelvic area and Chemo, combined with ADT is the new way to go. So, I meet with the MO on the 2/20/18 to discuss. Definitely not looking forward to Chemo. I noticed you had genetic testing done. Was that a factor in going with Chemo?",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by BAB Keep good spirits! I started a clinical trial (post RALP) at Johns Hopkins for guys with metastatic PCa. The regiment started off with 4 sessions of Docetaxel (each session separated by 3 weeks). Also began Lupron on same day as starting chemo. My major side effect from the chemo was tiredness -- which began on day 5 after chemo and lasted about 4 days. My hair thinned but I did NOT lose it. After completing chemo I had 69 Gray of radiation. PSA has been tested each quarter after surgery and has stayed at .01. Have been reading a LOT of research (as most of us do!), and it seems as if administering docetaxel for guys like us has become popular. My doc (Dr. Pienta) feels that administering the chemo early treats some of the systemic cells (I had two lymph nodes that tested positive.) Not enjoying the ADT, but you do what you gotta do! BAB, As you can see from my signature, I too, had 4+5 and + bladder margin, and 3 of 7 lymph nodes +, plus, but also + sv's and vas deferens. So far, I have had RALP, starting Lupron & Cassodex, following final path. After 3 months I am about to start RT, for 8 wks. to Pelvic bed and Pelvic and Periaortic Lymph Nodes. My RO, yesterday, recommended I do Chemo 2 weeks following RT. This surprised me because I had the advanced Axumin PET scan, showing no obvious mets. He is convinced, that with a 4+5 most likely I have microscopic mets beyond the Pelvic area and Chemo, combined with ADT is the new way to go. So, I meet with the MO on the 2/20/18 to discuss. Definitely not looking forward to Chemo. I noticed you had genetic testing done. Was that a factor in going with Chemo?",

      "Content": "Yes, the MRI is not reliable for specifics. Mine showed my SV's \"symmetrical\" and both had cancer. It was not clear that the cancer had invaded the bladder neck either, making my GS go from 4+4 to 4+9. The final path, post RALP, revealed it all, one of the advantages of surgery but you have to look at all of the options, before deciding.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by renfro Hello everyone, Found this forum about a week ago. Great info. I haven't done the forum posting thing much in the past however, I thought I would give it go today. As the title says I have my Da Vinci surgery scheduled for tomorrow. A little anxious, but feeling ok. The surgeon doing the procedure is very highly rated and considered one of the best in the area, if not the country. It's being done at one of the top university medical centers in the country. They've been excellent in preparing me for the process and I feel fortunate that I'm able to have my surgery done there. I've been reading about post surgery experiences on this forum and it's been very helpful in preparing for what and what not to expect. Between this forum and what the hospital staff is sure to tell me before my release, I should be in pretty good shape making it through a good recovery. Thank you. Welcome, renfo! I am 4 wks. post op and getting closer to normal every day. I kept making sure the ice pack on my abdomen stayed cold, my only night in the hospital, to relieve the discomfort and swelling. Don't plan to sleep much, there will be time for that. Don't forget the stool softeners because the bladder is sensitive to pushing with foley in it. Tomorrow evening, no matter how you feel, will be a great relief, knowing that it is over! Best of luck and keep us posted.",

My RALP, scheduled for 11/15/17, will be performed by one of the top surgeons, in the St. Louis area, who has completed 600. I understand, the skill of the surgeon is critical in side effect outcome, but you shouldn't expect better continence or ED, post surgery than pre-surgery, unless maybe your prostrate was so big it was restricting flow, etc. As others have said, you still have time to research more. Also, provide more information, so forum members, who have probably forgotten more about this scourge than we will ever know, and can be an invaluable resource!",

With surgery, I can still choose Radiation later but, from my understanding, it is harder to do Radiation first and surgery later, if necessary. Others may know better about this? My RALP, scheduled for 11/15/17, will be performed by one of the top surgeons, in the St. Louis area, who has completed 600. I understand, the skill of the surgeon is critical in side effect outcome, but you shouldn't expect better continence or ED, post surgery than pre-surgery, unless maybe your prostrate was so big it was restricting flow, etc. As others have said, you still have time to research more. Also, provide more information, so forum members, who have probably forgotten more about this scourge than we will ever know, and can be an invaluable resource!",

If you look at my signature, you will see I have 4, GS 8's but per the biopsies and MRI, it seems to be organ confined.

Viagara, Cialis they really haven't done anything other than give me a thumping headache or heartburn Without being too crude...There's only so many things you can can perform sexually without the aid of an erection before it becomes boring or \"im too tired tonight babe\".

      "Content": "Originally Posted by renfro Hello everyone, Found this forum about a week ago. Great info. I haven't done the forum posting thing much in the past however, I thought I would give it go today. As the title says I have my Da Vinci surgery scheduled for tomorrow. A little anxious, but feeling ok. The surgeon doing the procedure is very highly rated and considered one of the best in the area, if not the country. It's being done at one of the top university medical centers in the country. They've been excellent in preparing me for the process and I feel fortunate that I'm able to have my surgery done there. I've been reading about post surgery experiences on this forum and it's been very helpful in preparing for what and what not to expect. Between this forum and what the hospital staff is sure to tell me before my release, I should be in pretty good shape making it through a good recovery. Thank you. Welcome, renfo! I am 4 wks. post op and getting closer to normal every day. I kept making sure the ice pack on my abdomen stayed cold, my only night in the hospital, to relieve the discomfort and swelling. Don't plan to sleep much, there will be time for that. Don't forget the stool softeners because the bladder is sensitive to pushing with foley in it. Tomorrow evening, no matter how you feel, will be a great relief, knowing that it is over! Best of luck and keep us posted.",

      "Content": "My Doc. had me use Neosporin, 2 to 4 times per day. Because I had positive margins on the bladder neck and the prostate, it was critical that the connection (anastomosis) healed so he had it pressure tested at twice the pressure as during surgery. It took 3 weeks for it to fully heal. In hind site, however, I am glad he didn't rush it because the connection stayed fully open and my flow has continued to be like a 17 year old, even after 37 doses of radiation. I know guys, whose Doc's rushed it and didn't properly heal and have to have it \"reamed out\" later. You can't tell this just by urine color, either. Mine had no blood it it on day 2. If your fiance's surgery was not complicated, it probably won't be an issue. As previously stated, if he is having bladder spasms, there are medications for that. As a result, when he is having a bowel movement, urine comes out around the catheter. This is not unusual but uncomfortable. As we all agree, in not too long of a time, it will be a distant memory!",

I was having Nocturnal Erections and thought YEEEESS he's coming back to life sadly they diminished quickly. Viagara, Cialis they really haven't done anything other than give me a thumping headache or heartburn Without being too crude...There's only so many things you can can perform sexually without the aid of an erection before it becomes boring or \"im too tired tonight babe\". I appreciate its a healing process and im probably trying to run before i can walk but it is becoming an ongoing concern in my mind daily Thanks PS got my first major review post op on Friday with PSA test results.. I'm going to mention it to the doc Gorhad, excuse my Lupron brain (boy I use that excuse more and more) but I don't see when you had RALP or RT or whatever you had and a timeline as to where you are now, on your signature?",

The surgery for you will seem like it takes a second or two, whereas, your wife will suffer the agony of the actual time spent. Based on your GS I would think your surgery would pretty short in length. And if it is all confined he won't have to do a lot of extra exploratory surgery, resulting in less swelling, healing, etc. So, relax and before you know it will be over. I am already starting to forget some of the details and at times it seems like it was a dream. Of course, then I look in the mirror and see the 6 small scars and realize it was not. Best of luck and keep us posted.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by DjinTonic I believe so. I see it referred to as the prostate fossa, or bed: the depression or area where the prostate was. Of course if other precise areas are revealed on imaging, those can be targeted too, in theory. The prostate fossa may in fact have residual prostate tissue missed in the RP and the areas at positive margins with other structures may be targeted. This is just what I've surmised from reading. Other brothers who have gotten SRT can be more precise. From what I have read, you can never be sure about Lymph Nodes (LN), unless they are all sampled, and a sample is just that? And any positive margins are red flags for the bed, although, in my case the sampling of the Periprostatic tissue showed no cancer. But my RO wants to be aggressive, for reasons Djintonic points out, plus, the fact that 3 of 7 LN's were positive and wants to go higher than normal, to the periaortic LN's, to be sure everything is hit. So, one has to weigh aggressiveness and possible toxic affects with missing the millions of cancer cells that can be in one cubic millimeter of space, that won't necessarily show up on even the Axumin PET scan, and become harder to kill once they mutate and are attempted to fry later! With today's advanced RT equipment and, in my case, the proposed use of Cone-Beam CT, IMRT, and the aggressiveness of my cancer, I agree with my RO (who was once head of the MO RO Association & on the board of the US Association), to throw everything at it. Bottom line, however, for each of us, you have to decide, on your own with recommendations, of course, what procedure is best for you!",

The dosage is only 45 gys vs. 65 for the Prostate bed. Like several of us I am having the Trifecta to cover all of the bases. My RO is using cone beam ct imaging to even further narrow the field to better target exactly where the radiation is going.

      "Content": "Djintonic, So far, I have had RALP, starting Lupron & Cassodex, following final path. After 3 months I am about to start RT, for 8 wks. to Pelvic bed and Pelvic and Periaortic Lymph Nodes. My RO, yesterday, recommended I do Chemo 2 weeks following RT. This surprised me because I had the advanced Axumin PET scan, showing no obvious mets. He is convinced, that with a 4+5 most likely I have microscopic mets beyond the Pelvic area and Chemo, combined with ADT is the new way to go. So, I meet with the MO on the 2/20/18 to discuss. Definitely not looking forward to Chemo. He will probably propose 6 cycles of Docetaxel every 3 wks. approximately 2 weeks following RT. Heard anything about this? I think they are leaning toward the Stampede and CHAARTED studies recommending combining ADT and Chemo?",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by MichiganMan16 John4803: Are they adding the Chemo because of the positive nodes? Standard of care for pT3bNO has been ( assuming they had surgery) ART/SRT, along with up to 2 years of ADT. I received this answer from 3 different doctors. I have also noticed that some RO/ MO are also throwing Zytiga in the mix with ADT. The studies to which you refer have been around since I started treatment...wondering what has changed. You are correct, G8-10 can be highly predictive of micro-mets. When I asked my uro if SRT/ADT could kill off stray cells, his answer was...\"We think it can\". But no conclusive evidence. Ask your RO the question as to why the standard of care may or may not have changed. Most of the pT3BNO on this forum have had the triple whammy of Surgery, SRT, ADT. Not many chemo additions. Good luck, MM MM, I will ask the MO, whom I first meet on 2/21, is this the new standard of care, and supported by the insurance companies. I suspect the insurance companies will rule?",

Supposedly the cancer is somewhere but where..? The PSA was lowered before the Radiation with hormone therapy drugs to about .12 1) HAving said that I received over 30 rounds of Radiation therapy directed at the prostate bed to no Avail..? 2) If the radiation did not kill the cancer this must mean that it spread beyond the prostate bed and it was not there after the surgery. I'm confused has anyone else run into this situation.? cvictim, I am not in your situation but my RO is trying to keep this from happening by not only zapping lymph nodes (I had 3/7 tested positive) in the pelvis region but he is going higher to the paraaortic region. So, did you have any lymph nodes tested? Your signature would be interesting to see?",

When I went for surgery he stated that the lymph nodes in that region were clear upon observation. Am I missing something that should of been tested prior to surgery and prior to having Radiation to the Prostate bed based on the likelihood of cancer cells been present in that area when in fact my PSA was rising at the same rate After Radiation. I now have serious continent problems and damage to the lower colon and rectal area. My bladder was checked not long ago, its negative. Usually the surgeon cuts into or removes some lymph nodes to verify there is no cancer in them. Maybe you can be sure by just looking but my surgeon actually sampled some for the Pathologist to exam? An Axumin Pet scan will show cancer tumors if they are large enough. Have you had any scans?",

The surgery for you will seem like it takes a second or two, whereas, your wife will suffer the agony of the actual time spent. Based on your GS I would think your surgery would pretty short in length. And if it is all confined he won't have to do a lot of extra exploratory surgery, resulting in less swelling, healing, etc. So, relax and before you know it will be over. I am already starting to forget some of the details and at times it seems like it was a dream. Of course, then I look in the mirror and see the 6 small scars and realize it was not. Best of luck and keep us posted.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by DjinTonic I believe so. I see it referred to as the prostate fossa, or bed: the depression or area where the prostate was. Of course if other precise areas are revealed on imaging, those can be targeted too, in theory. The prostate fossa may in fact have residual prostate tissue missed in the RP and the areas at positive margins with other structures may be targeted. This is just what I've surmised from reading. Other brothers who have gotten SRT can be more precise. From what I have read, you can never be sure about Lymph Nodes (LN), unless they are all sampled, and a sample is just that? And any positive margins are red flags for the bed, although, in my case the sampling of the Periprostatic tissue showed no cancer. But my RO wants to be aggressive, for reasons Djintonic points out, plus, the fact that 3 of 7 LN's were positive and wants to go higher than normal, to the periaortic LN's, to be sure everything is hit. So, one has to weigh aggressiveness and possible toxic affects with missing the millions of cancer cells that can be in one cubic millimeter of space, that won't necessarily show up on even the Axumin PET scan, and become harder to kill once they mutate and are attempted to fry later! With today's advanced RT equipment and, in my case, the proposed use of Cone-Beam CT, IMRT, and the aggressiveness of my cancer, I agree with my RO (who was once head of the MO RO Association & on the board of the US Association), to throw everything at it. Bottom line, however, for each of us, you have to decide, on your own with recommendations, of course, what procedure is best for you!",

      "Content": "Jeff, I don't see anything about lymph nodes. Were any examined? 3 of 7 of mine sampled were cancerous, thus, the RT, I start next month will also be aimed at the numerous nodes, in case something is lurking and not killed by the Lupron. The dosage is only 45 gys vs. 65 for the Prostate bed. Like several of us I am having the Trifecta to cover all of the bases. My RO is using cone beam ct imaging to even further narrow the field to better target exactly where the radiation is going. He claims he has seen a reduction of 5% in SE's with this approach, already. Good luck!",

I noticed, after the pathologist's name, the comment \"This case was reviewed at the daily intradepartmental conference.\" This has me wondering does this or do most path labs review all cases, just the ones with bad news, the hard-to-call ones? Does anyone have a similar comment on their path report? My G scores were so dismal that I didn't even discuss getting a 2nd path opinion with my doc. But some reports (e.g. 4+3 vs 3+4) can obviously be critical--how many of you sought a 2nd opinion? How many expert eyes are looking at the average biopsy (or post-RP) slides? Djin Djin, Yes, mine was done by Dianon Systems and it states, \"This case was reviewed at the daily intradepartmental conference.\" Our Uro said Dianon is one of the largest systems analyzing biopsies.",

Also, had to do 2 fleet enemas 1 hr. before leaving. Was given Propofol and inserted an ultrasound device, in the rectum for viewing the placement, and a catheter (smaller in dia. than the foley we had after surgery) into the bladder. Fortunately, this was all done while I was in dreamland and didn't feel a thing! 2 markers were put even with the L4 Vertebrate (where Prostate was) and the remaining 2 in the Prostate bed.
