      "Content": "Hello everyone, We have just found out that my father has prostate cancer. Very shocking and frightening as you well know. He has had MRI scans and a cat scan. Bone scan is due on Thursday. I have only known a few days and am struggling to understand everything. My Dad is amazing, totally calm and very well in himself. He has been monitored for a number of years as he had a swollen prostate years ago and the central core was removed. 6 months ago his Psa was slightly elevated but was just asked to come back in another 6 months. Which brings us to where we are now. I have just seen his notes and wonder if anybody could shed some light. Dad is 75, Gleason 9 ( 4 + 5) right.... 6 of 7 cores Gleason 9 7 of 7 cores (4 + 5) MRI t3b + lymph node Psa = 16.1 As I mentioned.... Bone scan to follow. Hormone therapy started, followed by injections followed by possible radiotherapy. I understand that the gleason score indicates how aggressive the cancer is, I realise that 9 is high. I am thinking that t3b = stage 3. I guess what I really want to know is.... is it possible to overcome at this stage? Are these results very worrying indeed? I fear they may be. I realise that is a very difficult question to answer as everybody is different.... just very worried. Love my Dad so much... Wishing you all the best. You are all in my prayers",

      "Content": "Thank you very much for your response. It means a lot. I guess my confusion lies in the fact that if it is aggressive why has it been classed as stage 3 rather than 4. I hope and pray that the bone scan is clear. The notes are scribbled and just say MRI - t3b + lymph node. The MRI and CAt scan were done over a month ago. I'm guessing that is all that showed up. They did not suggest surgery... I have read some have gone for this even with scores like my Dad. Just very worried, I have read up quite a bit now. Everyone's stories are different. I just wonder how .... how long they can 'put it to sleep for'. Apparently they were the Drs words. With the stage being tb3.... and a gleason score of 9, is .... how long can they usually control it? I know that is an incredibly difficult question to answer. I'm just in shock, he has no symptoms, he looks and acts like there is nothing wrong. I see that you have been doing well after surgery. I am very happy to read that. Long may it continue. I will take a look at the book, thank you for the recommendation. My thoughts are with all of you battling with this. Lots of prayers being sent your way x",

I am beginning to question what on earth they have been doing. My Dad keeps things to himself, really laid back and didn't really give us too many details about his visits. I know that they were monitoring Psa... And I believe his isn't incredibly high like some, it's 16.1, but surely, routine check ups would have involved digital rectal examinations. Surely that would have been suggestive something wasn't good?! Or maybe.... In the last 6 months this has happened. I don't know how it works... does it start low and then get higher... or do you suddenly just become a G9? I am trying to be positive.... and I pray that the drs will do what they can to control it. I pray that for every single one of you on here. A T2c, yes, better than T3b... Is better an appropriate word? Wish none of you had to experience any of this. I'm going to look in to his diet... I believe pomegranate juice, broccoli are good... no sugar, no dairy etc can all help. I am no dr but I have every faith that you will overcome this... you have caught this earlier. Take care x",

Bone scan is due on Thursday. I have only known a few days and am struggling to understand everything. My Dad is amazing, totally calm and very well in himself. He has been monitored for a number of years as he had a swollen prostate years ago and the central core was removed. 6 months ago his Psa was slightly elevated but was just asked to come back in another 6 months. Which brings us to where we are now. I have just seen his notes and wonder if anybody could shed some light. Dad is 75, Gleason 9 ( 4 + 5) right.... 6 of 7 cores Gleason 9 7 of 7 cores (4 + 5) MRI t3b + lymph node Psa = 16.1 As I mentioned.... Bone scan to follow. Hormone therapy started, followed by injections followed by possible radiotherapy. I understand that the gleason score indicates how aggressive the cancer is, I realise that 9 is high. I am thinking that t3b = stage 3. I guess what I really want to know is.... is it possible to overcome at this stage? Are these results very worrying indeed? I fear they may be. I realise that is a very difficult question to answer as everybody is different.... just very worried. Love my Dad so much... Wishing you all the best. You are all in my prayers",

      "Content": "Thanks for your message.... again Trying to be positive, hoping they can stop it spreading any further. He's due for the bone scan on Thursday. With regard to his previous scans, all that is mentioned on his notes is MRI-tb3 + lymph node ( I believe it is a lymph node near to the prostate) Generally, would an MRI and a CAT scan identify cancer in the bones? The only other thing mentioned was some soft tissue in the urethra.. the consultant said that this could be just a little damage caused by the numerous procedures he has undergone lately. He is unsure if it is related to the prostate c. Sorry... so many questions. I know we just have to wait and see but ... would like to know if the fact that nothing else was mentioned may be a positive sign and that it hasn't spread to the bones. Xx",

I hope and pray that the bone scan is clear. The notes are scribbled and just say MRI - t3b + lymph node. The MRI and CAt scan were done over a month ago. I'm guessing that is all that showed up. They did not suggest surgery... I have read some have gone for this even with scores like my Dad. Just very worried, I have read up quite a bit now. Everyone's stories are different. I just wonder how .... how long they can 'put it to sleep for'. Apparently they were the Drs words. With the stage being tb3.... and a gleason score of 9, is .... how long can they usually control it? I know that is an incredibly difficult question to answer. I'm just in shock, he has no symptoms, he looks and acts like there is nothing wrong. I see that you have been doing well after surgery. I am very happy to read that. Long may it continue. I will take a look at the book, thank you for the recommendation. My thoughts are with all of you battling with this. Lots of prayers being sent your way x",

Anyway, after a hopeless diagnosis he's doing brilliantly! I guess it's all about how a person responds. Dad is incredible, wouldn't even know anything was wrong. No symptoms, nothing! Dad had a transurethral resection of the prostate a number of years ago as it was enlarged, no cancer. He was put in medication to reduce swelling and stayed in it. Apparently, according to the oncologist, this is what kept the psa relatively low. I do feel that they missed this, I know it's not worth thinking about, but he was checked every 6 months then suddenly he's diagnosed at this stage! They should have taken in to consideration the meds he was on!!",

      "Content": "Hi everyone, I joined back in around March when my father was first diagnosed. You were all so kind and helpful I took a break as it became all consuming and I think I became a little research obsessed! I'm sure you all know what I'm talking about. Anyway. Here is the latest. Dad was initially given these results: T3b plus lymph node. Psa 16 (although oncologist said it was likely to be higher owing to certain medication... That's another story!) Gleason 9 (4+5) (4+5) Was started on hormones, now on injections. Dad's recent consultation with the oncologist was both good and bad The good...he has responded well to the hormones so far and psa is down to 1.4. This has happened relatively quickly. No lymph nodes in the groin are affected, we knew this BUT... The lymph node near his tummy button is cancerous we were hoping it wasn't, during the previous appointment the oncologist was not sure and wanted to See if it reacted to the hormone injections. If it did it indicated cancer. Unfortunately it did however it has shrunk down to 1cm. The problem is, nothing can be done with this lymph node because of it's position. The oncologist said it was very unusual. Anyway, Dad starts radiotherapy in a number if weeks. He is having a strong dose, once a week. I'm afraid I don't know the exact type of radiotherapy. I'm abroad at the moment and all the information I have is by telephone. The oncologist told my family that the problem with the affected node is, when it reduces to its final cells he can't say what will happen, whether it will spread or not. Anyway... Just want to hear your thoughts. I guess... I want to know, has anybody who had lymph nodes affected ... What had been your experience? Dad's bone scan is clear by the way. I know it's not a great diagnosis at all but we are trying to remain hopeful. Hopeful that it can be controlled for a long time. I am guessing it is not curable but.. Still saying prayers. Hope you are all doing ok. Thanks for reading xx",

Things usually pick up again after the weekend, so look for some good replies starting Monday. I wish I had more knowledge on his type of situation so I could offer you some info. But I'm sure we'll find some helpful comments coming as the new week begins. Wishing the best for BOTH of you! Chuck Thank you for taking the time to respond it\u0092s much appreciated. I do hope that somebody can tell me about their experience of Abiraterone. It appears that most people refer to the brand name \u0091Zytiga\u0092 on the forum. The Gleason score concerns me greatly... i wouldn\u0092t say he\u0092s on his last legs but I just don\u0092t know. I don\u0092t know what to expect. He hasn\u0092t been given any time frame thank God.... his consultant is very good and is always positive. I guess the fact that they\u0092re still prepared to treat him is a good sign.

      "Content": "I joined back in March 2015 when my father was first diagnosed. You were all very kind and helpful. I had to take a break as it became a little all consuming. I have copied and pasted this part from my last post to give you all an idea of what's been happening. Dad was initially given these results: T3b plus lymph node. Psa 16 (although oncologist said it was likely to be higher owing to certain medication... That's another story!) Gleason 9 (4+5) (4+5) Was started on hormone tablets, now on injections which he has at 3 monthly intervals. Had radiotherapy which he sailed through with barely any side effects. He responded well to the hormones initially and psa went down to 1.4. When last looked at no lymph nodes in the groin were affected, I would imagine owing to recent events this will be checked again. The lymph node they identified when first diagnosed was near his tummy button and cancerous. There was no evidence of cancer anywhere else. Anyway, long story short. He has done brilliantly from then up until now. I think around 6months ago his PSA went up to 2. Unfortunately he went last week and his PSA was up to 13 My Mum goes with him, he would hate the fuss of me also going so I'm relying on what she tells me.... meaning she remains really positive, which is good I guess.... but I'm not sure they are asking the right questions... me being me did a huge amount of reading up on it after his initial diagnosis... So would have a million questions ... my parents are very much 'leave it in the hands of the consultant.' I think if they knew too much they would worry more. Anyway, the consultant told him to take another hormone tablet every day - Bicalutamide and to continue with the 3 monthly injections (Zoladex) He will see him again in 2 months. He also said that they might be looking at 'tweaking' his treatment for want of a better phrase.. something like that anyway. Wish I'd be there! I'd be able to tell you word for word. The crazy thing is, Dad has never had any symptoms, never been ill really. An increased need to go to the loo when diagnosed, but that's it. He still remains 'well' I know his diagnosis isn't good �� But we have been happy with how he has been doing for the past 2 years. In fact, we forget there is a problem! I guess my question is... Has anybody been in a similar situation with PSA rising again? My fear is that this is the beginning of the end ��I know this increase is rapid and that worries me. At this stage what do they do? Is there even a chance for the PSA to reduce again? I remember reading early on that hormone treatment only lasts a certain amount of time. The consultant said it was common... do you think he will be offered other options? I realise my questions are difficult to answer ... I just don't want them to give up �� He's 78 but super ❤️ Still up and about doing little jobs around the house. Thanks for reading. Any advice much appreciated X",

When he was first diagnosed he had lots of scans and was told that nothing was evident in the bones etc. With a rise in PSA I wonder if they will scan again when he returns in 2 months.

I do know that when they last looked at it, it had shrunk... but that was a good while ago now. Your messages have made me feel a little better, I know everybody is different and it's hard to say what will happen but you've made me feel like there are more options at least. Yes, I'm happy to say that he is symptom free, always has been... apart from the increased need to urinate around the time he was diagnosed. It's hard to believe he is ill at all.

      "Content": "Hi all, I haven't posted in a while. Needed to talk tonight. My Dad was diagnosed about 2 years ago... Gleason 9, psa 30, lymph node involvement (I think I have added a signature below) He did really well up until earlier this year when his psa started to rise. Hormones were increased. Anyway, cut a long story short his psa is now 70, he has clearly stopped responding to the hormone treatment He had a scan a few weeks ago and there are 'spots' in the lumbar region. Apparently they were there 2 years ago but I'm pretty sure we weren't told about them! He received radiotherapy last week, since then he seems to be struggling. Throughout this whole thing he hasn't had any symptoms at all, so it's very upsetting to see. He's off his food, everything tastes salty and he feels very tired and weak. He's complaining of aches in his upper thighs/groin area. This has coincided with the radiotherapy... He seems much worse! My question is... Is this common after radiotherapy? Last time he breezed through it, I think he was expecting to this time too. He starts arbiterone in January... I'm wondering why he can't start now! Does anybody here have experience of this drug? I'm scared, he seems so out of sorts, not himself at all. So many thoughts running through my head... Is it going to be all downhill from here? Is this just a bad patch and once he starts his new regime things will improve? I realise this is a very difficult question to answer but is it possible that things may improve somewhat? I know it's a matter of controlling this wretched thing rather than curing it but do any of you have any experience of similar ... I'm presuming the cancer is active at the moment... Will the drugs make it inactive again? Please forgive my lack of medical knowledge/terminology ... I've read so much over the past few years... Today I can't string a sentence together... All a bit of a blur today. I would really appreciate any input at all. Thank you",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by TLDinMD Hi Kathy, I'm new here and can't offer much but wanted to let you know I'm thinking about you and sending prayers your way. Stay Strong. My Dad was just diagnosed a week ago and we are currently awaiting results of scans. Thank you for your message, it was thoughtful and kind of you to respond. Reading my post might have frightened you, I hope not. My Dad clearly had PCa a good while before diagnosis and unfortunately his is an aggressive strain. The G9's seem to be less common so ... well I hope your Dad's results are 'favourable'. I pray his scan results are clear. At this time the best thing to do is try to keep positive. I'm thinking of you too. Xx",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by Gerd Had my 8 week post op check with my surgeon yesterday afternoon and the first thing out of his mouth was \"ZERO PSA\" my wife and I were so happy we wanted to cry. Then as the conversation went on...he began to explain how the operation went well but the results from the lab showed that some of the cancer was very near the base of the prostate. This being said...he felt most likely isolated to the prostate, but there is a chance it snuck out...and that's the catch! Amazing how your elation can turn into confusion in the matter of minutes. Anyway...he said not to worry that in the off chance there is something...it can be treated! So now it's a wait and see situation. I'm still happy with the >0.1 so Merry Christmas to all of you and may your days be Merry and Bright! I think that\u0092s pretty great news Zero psa... wonderful! Try not to focus on the \u0091chance there is something\u0092... even if there was your consultant has said it can be treated. Enjoy your Christmas xx",

      "Content": "Hi, I have been posting updates with regard to my Dad's situation 'Father just diagnosed.... G9' Anyway.... Long story short. Results showed tb3 plus lymph node, G9. That was a few weeks ago. He saw the oncologist today and he told him it was unusual as there is no cAncer in the lymph nodes in the groin, and the lymph node mentioned was referring to a lymph node near his tummy button. He also said that they are not sure if it is cancerous or not. After discussion Dad was advised to see him again in August, apparently he felt that radiotherapy wasn't required at the moment. He did not want to give it to him unnecessarily. So... as it stands... dad stopped taking the hormone meds (bicultamide) and is now on the injections (Zalodex) The consultant said to see how that works for him, he will have another scan and blood test in August and they will take it from there. He said that the hormones will basically shrink the cancer, if it has no effect on the lymph node, which I presume is swollen, then it isn't cancerous. He ruled out surgery for various reasons which I understand but I'm left wondering why wait for the radiotherapy??? I think Dad will receive it but the consultant wants to wait and see how he reacts to the hormones. Anyway.... Question is.... Has anybody else had similar.... Swollen lymph node in the tummy??",

      "Content": "George, thank you very much for responding. I see.... I did not realise that. I was under the impression that it was a matter of controlling it rather than curing. Wow.... I am a little lost for words. To think that this could be cured is good news. I did not realise that radiotherapy may not be offered if there is a chance of it coming back. I knew surgery wasn't really an option... I just presumed radiotherapy would definitely be given regardless. So... If there was a risk of it coming back, what usually happens? Hormone treatment and then what?? So many questions! Surely radiotherapy would slow it down???",
