      "Content": "Originally Posted by Michael F Hi Brad! As Chuck points out, you will receive a lot of responses from other Forum members. The key opinion must come from your MD. Simply either go back to your Radiation Oncologist or make an appointment with a Medical Oncologist who specializes in Prostate Cancer and address this issue and its implications. Based on the #s you provided, it appears that your PSA is increasing and has doubled from the nadir of 0.24. Is this within your 'normal' range of PSA \"bounce?\" The standard diagnosis of PC \"Recurrence\" includes: 3 consecutive rises in detectable PSA. If willing, please provide additional info such as age, location, PSA history pre and post radiation, reasons for selecting your treatment of choice, treatment experiences: positive & negative. This will serve to help educate others on The Forum. IF this indicates recurrence, there are many new treatments such as immune therapies that are either available or in clinical trials. Also, ask your MD about HIFU. It was recently cleared by the FDA for \"ablation of prostate tissue.\" In theory, an imaging technology such as a C-11 Choline PET scan could pinpoint the focus of PC and HIFU could \"ablate\" it. The beauty of HIFU is, as I understand, it is non invasive, no transcutaneous probe insertions, often only requires a single treatment, no anesthesia, and can be repeated as necessary. (Disclaimer: I neither work for nor have any financial interest in any HIFU technologies. But do have a strong clinical interest! - especially as a 1st line treatment and a 2nd line treatment for recurrent PC) Hope your next PSA 'bounces' downward! Good luck Brad and keep us updated! MF Guten Tag. Michael, I'm fairly sure that HIFU is done with a spinal anesthesia",

      "Content": "After surgery and bio chemical recurrence the usual treatment at a PSA of around 0.2 is so-called salvage radiation to the prostate bed. In most or many cases that works fine. A few of us unfortunately did exactly that without the hoped result , finding out later that the cancer cells (not necessarily a tumor) were just outside the prostate bed or field of salvage radiation. In my case that was determined with a radioactive PET using Choline marker once my PSA had risen above 1.0 and after I had had salvage radiation to the prostate bed. Today I read about a new marker for PET called Gallium 68 which is offered here in Germany at about 4 University Clinics and can detect prostate cancer outside the prostate bed at a PSA reading of 0.5. Seems in the US the FDA is doing its usual wait for a thousand tests approach before approving. However, so it seems now the gap has narrowed form 0.2 to 0.5 which is better than the past gap of 0.8. Hopefully, they will find a tracer to totally remove the gap and be sure that the cancer is either in or not in the prostate bed prior to salvage radiation. The point being if your prostate bed is radiated and thereafter it is determined that the rise in PSA is because of cancer cells just outside the prostate bed they will not radiate again. If not radiated in the first place then they could radiate the spot they find in some cases, perhaps providing a definitive cure. Hope this makes sense to all. Ive also heard of a PET Acetate test which also can find such when least than 1.0 but don't know about it.",

      "Content": "I am an American (66 years young) living in Germany. In 2002 after some long nose bleeding I was diagnosed with an Extramedullary plasmacytoma in my sinus. The tumor was surgically removed by an Austrian and I got 36 GY radiations in a clinic headed by a Greek Cypriot in a German hospital. I was very lucky not to develop multiple myeloma; most doctors here told me I won the jackpot in the Cancer lottery, if there is such a thing. After that my dear wife insisted that I get just about every type of cancer test known, and as you might expect in 2003 my PSA was around 5 and kept going up to 7.4 in 2005. So that is when I had a laparoscopic (non-robotic) op done in a German hospital by a Greek doctor who got his medical degree in Italy!! (Pt2c, pN0(0/2) Gleason 6, R0, negative margins). PSA went down fast to 0.005 and stayed there until 09/2006 0.018, 12/2006 0.029, 03/2007 0.030, 10/2007 0.060, 01/2008 0.10, 10/2008 0.20, 01/2009 0.30, 04/2009 0.43. That triggered SRT of 66 Gy which ended in 07/2009. Since SRT my PSA has slowly decreased as follows 08/2009 0.35, 11/2009 0.29, 02/2010 0.25. I have had some bowel problems but nothing much. Searching the web I read that PSA should drop within a year to 0.1 or below. I have searched but cannot find any studies that really measured the rate of decrease. Is there anyone out there with better info on PSA decline? The guy who went down to less than 0.1 in two months after SRT does not need to answer!",

      "Content": "I am adding this information for anyone with a rising PSA after surgical removal and salvage radiation treatment. In Germany they will now do a so-called PET-Cholin-CT ( you get a painless Radioactive shot then a CT) if ones PSA is equal to or greater than 1.0( I had one a few years ago when my PSA was at 0.43 and triggered salvage radiation, but because the PSA was not equal to 1.0 or greater the test was negative) Below 1.0 nothing will show up. In my case my PSA rose to 2.2 and the PET-Cholin-CT showed a positive area just outside of the area that was radiated during SRT. The reason I add this is that I have not read anywhere of this method for diagnostic in forum posts and wonder if it is done in the US and if not why not???",

Concerning Pet Choline or Acetate and sensitivity at 1.0 or 2.0 the issue after surgery and salvage is what is the second salvage approach. Of course it depends on what is found, but there is absolutely no medical consensus, what to do, when to start. UNFORTUNATELY it's once again the whole story repeats itself and the patient gets to decide. I should mention that I live in G e r many and h e 're they will do a choline up to about 1.5 and if the results are negative then they will do an acetate.

      "Content": "In a different discussion it came up that salvage radiation after surgery is usually recommended at a PSA reoccurring level of 0.1 or a bit above. PET Choline or Acetate tests will only detect cancer cells at a PSA of 1.0 or greater. So we have a gray area of 0.8 or so. Since it seems Mets are not found at these levels of PSA(0.Xxx-1.0 or 2.0 ) then can anyone tell me why the neck any Expert recommends SR below a PSA reoccurance of 1.0? Since SR is usually only targeted to the prostate bed, and recurrence may be outside of the bed, then it seems to me that it makes sense to do nothing until PSA reaches a level detectable by PET Choline or Acetate. Comments and thoughts appreciated.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by Jim215 Pratoman: Thanks for your views. In reading your reference numbers, XJC3 cited PSA numbers of 1.0 to 2.0 for certain advanced scans and Chuck referred to PSA numbers of 0.1 to 0.2 to consider commencement of salvage radiation. You're not viewing those numbers as being equal, right? I just can't imagine ANYONE risking the occurrence of possible metastasis while waiting for your PSA to hit 1.0. XJC3 takes the opposite view and suggests that EVERYONE should wait until the PSA hits 1.0 when a Choline scan MIGHT show a more definitive area where cancer has spread to. In my view, waiting until reaching a PSA of 1.0 post-surgery is a sure-fire way to lead to unnecessary deaths. I'd love to see a show of hands on the issue. Jim Sorry if what I wrote was confusing. By no means do I take the view that everyone would OR should wait until a PET scan can show a positive! All I was trying to indicate is that regardless of the number picked to indicate biochemical recurrence there is a gray area between that number and when PET Choline or Acetate can confirm if something I.e. lymph node or else outside the prostate bed is causing the detectable PSA. A number of us have had SR WAY before 1.0 only to find out that for us it was not only a waste but prohibited further radiation near but outside the prostate bed. I for one would like to see a study comparing GLEASON grades, SR and numbers of 're-recurrence thereafter.",

      "Content": "In a different discussion it came up that salvage radiation after surgery is usually recommended at a PSA reoccurring level of 0.1 or a bit above. PET Choline or Acetate tests will only detect cancer cells at a PSA of 1.0 or greater. So we have a gray area of 0.8 or so. Since it seems Mets are not found at these levels of PSA(0.Xxx-1.0 or 2.0 ) then can anyone tell me why the neck any Expert recommends SR below a PSA reoccurance of 1.0? Since SR is usually only targeted to the prostate bed, and recurrence may be outside of the bed, then it seems to me that it makes sense to do nothing until PSA reaches a level detectable by PET Choline or Acetate. Comments and thoughts appreciated.",
