      "Content": "I am a 55 year old male. I have been having problems urinating for a little over a year now, reduced/weak flow and increased frequency. This past December I had my annual physical and my doctor did a DRE and told me that my prostate was about 40% enlarged, but appeared smooth. He did a PSA test at the time and it came back normal. He said I could take medication to help with the symptoms, but I declined because I did not want to experience the side effects, and did not want to be on another medication. I felt that the symptoms we bearable. For the most part it did not make me have to get up at night and urinate. Over the last year, I have been having to get up at night more and more, but still bearable. This last week, my urine flow has gotten even worse and this time it is accompanied with pretty bad pain and burning when I urinate. I get up numerous times at night to urinate now. I also have pretty severe hip, back and upper leg pain, with pretty bad headaches. When I look back on it, I have been getting the hip, back and upper leg pain for at least a year, but I never gave it much thought. It has been intermittent, lasting a few days then going away. Anyway, I went to see my doctor this last week and he did a PSA test and my level came in at 108.2. He told me that a normal level is about 4.0, so I am obviously pretty high. He told me I may have acute prostatitis, so he put me on an antibiotic for 2 weeks, and pain killers for the hip, back and leg pain. I am only 3 days into taking the medication and the lower body pain is under control, but the pain and burning when urinating, and the frequency and flow have not improved at all. I realize I need to stay on the antibiotics for the 2 weeks and then probably have another PSA test. My question is, could 108.2 PSA level be related to acute prostatitis or an enlarged prostate, or is it more likely that it is cancer? I would appreciate if anyone could give me a perspective on this. Thanks, Joe",
