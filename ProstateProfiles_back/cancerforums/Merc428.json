I wonder if yours had been reported the same way...<.015 if they'd be less alarming to you. I don't know why some labs push the decimal places out that far. From what I read, it may be implying cancer screening accuracy that's just not there. I echo others suggestions to relax and wait to see what future tests bring.

This kinda happened once, with disappointing leakage, but for the most part wasn\u2019t a problem. It woke me right away. I used a bucket to hold the bag at night. It worked well for me. I used KY at the tip. Clean and then KY. Worked for me. I gave up on clothes in a few days. Just used a robe or blanket. Ditto on the meds and constipation. I wish I had used less meds and had prune juice on hand. My belly was HURTING. I think there was too much air in there. Good luck. Have easy to prepare food on hand. And drinks/water.",

      "Content": "Thought I'd post an update. I know I'm very fortunate in that my case was mild and my recovery seems to be going really well. I know a G6 may seem like an AS case to some, but with having tumors in both sides and having an older brother stage 4, I elected to have surgery. Anyway, I saw my doc today (David Lee..highly recommended). Anyway, here's a short update of a so-far positive case. September 2015: Age 45. DaVinci surgery at University of Penn. 3-4 hours. Much belly pain in the days after. I just couldn't pass gas and likely didn't walk enough. Catheter bag was bloody for what seemed like a long time then suddenly cleared a couple days before removal. I peed stitches and clots. I opted for my bed, not a recliner. But before the surgery I had built a step to help me in and out. Catheter removal was not painful. Incontinence: bad at first but tapered off quickly. Was off all pads in 5-6 months. Stopped kegels about the same time. I really think I overdid them for a time and it set me back. 12 months out I release a small amount if 1) I laugh extremely hard 2) my girlfriend totally surprises me with a grab or very sexual remark or text 3) I force a fart (I stopped doing that). The doctor just instructed me to restart kegels and told me that they would help in these situations. ED: nerves were spared on both sides. started 5mg/day of Cialis when catheter was removed. ED not much of a problem since catheter removal and has gotten better and better since. Interestingly, nothing would happen solo at first, but my gf could make it work. Over 12 months things have only improved. Erections 100% firmness. Slightly more difficult to obtain than before, especially solo. I'd say 70% as easy as before solo, 90% as easy with gf. Sporadically taking the Cialis but the doc advised me to stop (except for her B-Day!). He said I could become desensitized to it. And that I may well need it in the future. So...I'll be stopping it immediately and will see how it goes. I don't think I need it anyway, I think it's in my head when I have the occasional problem. One suspicion in this department. YMMV. My wife of 20+ years left me just as it was suspected I may have cancer. My new gf I was lucky enough to find and I had sex like crazy leading up to the operation. Much unlike in my marriage. I believe this increased activity for months before hand helped me regain function quickly afterwards. I have no scientific support for this, it's just my theory of a contributing factor. Lots of activity before may help regain activity after. PSA: all <.015 since the surgery one year ago. Best wishes to all. This forum has given me much knowledge and comfort. I hope this info gives back just a little. Good luck to all in your own individual struggles.",

My experience at age 45: 1 night in the hospital Abdominal pain from bloating for several days Catheter in 10 days I took six weeks off. 4 would have been ok for me, but I'm glad I took six. I have a desk job but move between facilities often with computer and gear. Urinary control about one month. Sexual function came back quickly for me (nerves spared) and just keeps improving.",

      "Content": "To me, the thin liners were all about placement. Too high and they're no good...the end of the penis is too low. Too middle and they weren't as effective as they could be because I naturally \"hang\" to the left. I had to place them where the end of my penis was most likely to be in the middle of the pad. Not the center of my underwear (as the nurse showed me). Cialis and Viagra, I think, are different for everyone. I take low dose 5mg Cialis everyday. Some days I know I won't see my girlfriend and I don't take it. Other days I'm sure I'll see her and I take 2 or 3. I rarely have a problem being floppy using this method. And I'm quite happy, not just \"OK\". But I know each mans journey is different. And the drugs that work for some don't work for others. And that even with nerve sparing surgery, the nerves can be stretched and damaged quite a bit and need 12-24 months to heal. So everyone is different. Your husband is lucky to have such a caring and understanding wife. All the best to both of you on this recovery journey.",

If I recall correctly, Viagra loses half of its effectiveness in 3-4 hours where Cialis is more like 36 hours. I've used both. They both seem to work similarly. Fortunately my side effects are minimal so I can't comment much on that. I have experienced headaches, but nothing that two Advil couldn't take care of in ten minutes.",

This was an ultra sensitive test done at Labcorp. Continence continues to improve. I'd say 98%. Very occasional squirt or phantom squirt. Occasional night wet. I usually forget to do kegels. Maybe I do them 2-3 days per week. Ejactulations now dry. ED is intermittent. Usually no problem at all with my girlfriend. Often I'm 100%. Sometimes I'm 85%. Solo is a different story. Could be 0%-75%. Seems to still be improving. I'm not sure. Was taking daily 5mg Cialis but stopped it out of curiosity. It does make a difference. Erections are easier when I'm on the pills.",

      "Content": "Age 45 Da Vinci surgery September 2015. Doc said both nerves were spared. PSA results received today: \"<.015\". Obviously I'm pleased with the news. This was an ultra sensitive test done at Labcorp. Continence continues to improve. I'd say 98%. Very occasional squirt or phantom squirt. Occasional night wet. I usually forget to do kegels. Maybe I do them 2-3 days per week. Ejactulations now dry. ED is intermittent. Usually no problem at all with my girlfriend. Often I'm 100%. Sometimes I'm 85%. Solo is a different story. Could be 0%-75%. Seems to still be improving. I'm not sure. Was taking daily 5mg Cialis but stopped it out of curiosity. It does make a difference. Erections are easier when I'm on the pills.",
