      "Content": "I had RP 20 years ago at 52. Me along with my family got really anxious when PSA begin to increase to double digits. I just learned that a friend of mine has a PSA of 373 and he thinks that is pretty good. After talking to my doc about his high PSA the doc told me that he treats guys regurally with PSA in the thousands. Hmmmm why worry about my PSA of 14 now. In my opinion PSA numbers are \"noise\" and should not cause anxiety until they get into triple digits. Chances are that one will die of something else by that time. Ask your doc what the highest PSA that he has seen..............you will be relieved and surprised.",
