      "Content": "I am a 50 year-old having 3+4 prostate cancer in about 50% of the prostate. I don't have any symptoms. I am scheduled to have surgery June 28th. Since finding out about the cancer in March, I have altered my diet and take quite a few supplements. My PSA scores have been 11.25 (3/1/13), 10.64 (3/22/13) and now 9.01 (6/10/13). The dilemma I have is whether I should wait on the surgery to see if the PSA continues to go down or move ahead with surgery. Has anyone else experienced PSA drops like this and are there benefits to waiting. Thanks.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by lancepeace What is the size of your prostate? A large prostate can contribute to PSA. Diet is a benefit and studies has shown it helps with PSA progression. You have obtained a benefit but there is a limit to what diet can do. Your cancer looks significant enough that you should continue with treatment, in my opinion. The comments are great and much appreciated. My prostate is normal size. Since the cancer affects 50%, the surgeons are not sure whether they can save 1 of the nerve bundles on that side of the prostate. I live in the Minneapolis, MN area and will be having Dr. Utz as the surgeon. He has done over 3,000 of the robotic surgeries and has the reputation of being the best in the Twin Cities area. Thanks again.",
