      "Content": "You may want to take a look at this discussion on strictures: http://www.cancerforums.net/threads/...ight=stricture About 4 weeks after my surgery I had another catheter because of a stricture. I was then scheduled for an urethrotomy nine day later. In this procedure the doctor uses a scope with a cutting instrument to clean out the scar tissue. I then had to remain on the fat catheter for another week though. When the catheter came out my flow was great. I think the expression is, \u0093Like a race horse\u0094 great. The danger though was that the scar tissue could come back. To ensure it didn't, my doctor had me self- catheterize. Sounds worse than it was. I did this twice a day for two weeks. Then for the next two weeks it was once each day. For the next 10 weeks it was once per week. So after four months of this treatment, no more stricture! Now my case may be very different than yours, but I would also suggest that you get a second opinion.",

Bottom line: intraductal is a rare, more aggressive cancer. Finding it on a biopsie is rare too. Sending your biopsie slides for a second opinion would be a good idea as intraductal is sometimes misdiagnosed. Treatment should be sought soon. In my case, my surgeon followed me closely even at 3 years post surgery every six months. Now on an annual follow-up. Surgery seems to have done the trick. Four and 1/2 years and PSA is <.006",

I would stop drinking by 7pm. My goal was to go through the night without getting up. Get Depends, male diapers and put a pad in it. It should keep you from wetting the bed. You can sleep on a towel for extra protection. You'll see progress over time, especially if you keep a daily chart. Keep track of when you get up during the night, pad usage, etc. Before you know it you will be charting erections, penetration, and your spouse/partners orgasms.",

I opted for MUSE. Seemed like it would be easier to do. So I substituted MUSE for a Viagra once each week. About a month of this led to success. Able to have intercourse. With MUSE you insert a tiny pellet into the penis by using a small applicator. I took 2 Advils one hour before the MUSE because MUSE tends to cause discomfort. With the Advil it was bearable. About the 11 month mark I stopped the MUSE and changed to 5mg daily cialis and 100 mg Viagra before intercourse. At 14 months, just Viagra.",

      "Content": "A urinary stricture blocks urine flow. Your doctor will be able to test your urine flow by measuring the amount of urine and how long it takes to empty your bladder. Retaining urine, not emptying your bladder, can lead to serious complications. The doctor will be able to tell if you have a stricture. The stricture is scar tissue. If you have a stricture the treatment is to keep the passage open because they tend to build up again and block the flow. In my case I went back on a catheter for two weeks. When the catheter came out my flow was great. The danger though was that the scar tissue could come back. To ensure it didn't, my doctor had me self- catheterize. Sounds worse than it was. The catheter is a flexible 18 inch thin tube. You have to insert it until it enters the bladder. So after urinating I would insert the catheter. As long as only a few drops came out I knew I was emptying my bladder. I did this twice a day for two weeks. Then for the next two weeks it was once each day. For the next 10 weeks it was once per week. So after four months of this treatment, no more stricture!",

      "Content": "A urinary stricture blocks urine flow. Your doctor will be able to test your urine flow by measuring the amount of urine and how long it takes to empty your bladder. Retaining urine, not emptying your bladder, can lead to serious complications. The doctor will be able to tell if you have a stricture. The stricture is scar tissue. If you have a stricture the treatment is to keep the passage open because they tend to build up again and block the flow. In my case I went back on a catheter for two weeks. When the catheter came out my flow was great. The danger though was that the scar tissue could come back. To ensure it didn't, my doctor had me self- catheterize. Sounds worse than it was. The catheter is a flexible 18 inch thin tube. You have to insert it until it enters the bladder. So after urinating I would insert the catheter. As long as only a few drops came out I knew I was emptying my bladder. I did this twice a day for two weeks. Then for the next two weeks it was once each day. For the next 10 weeks it was once per week. So after four months of this treatment, no more stricture!",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by Otago \"In more than 14,000 radical prostatectomies, there was not a single case of a Gleason score 6 tumor ever spreading to lymph nodes.\" Though there is always the chance of finding a 3+4 or 4+3 in the post surgical pathology report, the information above may well allow many more men to be willing to go ahead with AS for several years. Zero in 14,000 is pretty impressive. Very true, but there is still a small chance of Recurrence with a PSA between 4 and 10 and clean margins after surgery. From Johns Hopkins: \"Probability Following Radical Prostatectomy Probability of Biochemical Recurrence (detectable PSA level) at : 3 years after surgery: 2% (1-5) 5 years after surgery: 3% (1- 7 years after surgery: 4% (2-12) 10 years after surgery: 6% (2-15) All numbers represent predictive probabilities with a 95 percent confidence interval\"",

      "Content": "No ED issues before surgery. Only pre-surgery urinary symptom was minor dribbling at end of urination. Pathology showed PIN and acute and chronic inflammation BPH. Usually slept through the night; on occasion made one trip to pee. ED issues can take from 6 months to 2 years to improve. For a soon to be 67 year-old, I'm very fortunate. It was not until my seventh month that I was ready for intercourse. That was after a month of using MUSE once a week. My protocol was 20 mg of Cialis three days each week (Tues. Th. & Sat) with 100 mg of Viagra twice each week (Tuesday & Sat). After my 6 month visit, doc said try injections or MUSE. I opted for MUSE. Others here have talked about how helpful the shots are, but figured I would try MUSE first. So once a week for about a month I substituted MUSE for a Viagra. About a month of this led to success. With MUSE you insert a tiny pellet into the penis by using a small applicator. Having had to self-catheterize myself for what seemed like forever because of a rare urinary stricture, this did not seem bad at all. I took 2 Advils one hour before the MUSE because MUSE tends to cause discomfort. With the Advil it was bearable. Although as soon as I could, I stopped the MUSE and went back to Viagra. Best wishes for a speedy recovery.",

      "Content": "My stream was weak from the first day of catheter removal and just got weaker. Ultimately I was flexing stomach muscles to help the stream. What ends up happening is your bladder does not empty completely and you start having to go very frequently (every hour). This can become a serious problem. Retaining urine is not a good thing. I waited too long about 5 or 6 weeks before I went in to get it checked. I had a urinary stricture. It blocks urine flow. They don\u0092t know why it occurred. It was not at the point where the urethra was sutured. Your doctor will be able to test your urine flow by measuring the amount of urine you produce and how long it takes to empty your bladder. If you are not emptying completely the doctor will be able to tell if you have a stricture. The stricture is scar tissue. If you have a stricture the treatment is to keep the passage open because the scar tissue tends to build up again and block the flow. When I went to the doctor\u0092s office they easily saw I was not emptying completely. So the first line of treatment is to self-catheterize. The PA explained what to do. I was supposed to follow-up at home with the self-catheterization. So I tried to self-catheterize but could not get it in. The PA tried two more times - unsuccessful, bloody and painful. They rolled me into the procedure room and the doctor did a cystoscopy with numbing jell (put did not help enough). He used the thinnest wire and after a lot of poking, gradually worked up to a wider tube so that ultimately he could look inside and finally inserted a fat catheter. Very painful despite numbing jell. I was scheduled for an urethrotomy nine day later. In this procedure the doctor uses a scope with a cutting instrument to clean out the scar tissue. Since this was more than 30 days after my surgery I had to have another preop check. Blood, heart, chest, etc. When it came time for the urine test I pulled up my large catheter bag opened it up and poured out a rather district red sample. This was a really long bad day. Nine days later when it was time for the next procedure I was prepped knocked out and awoke in the recovery room to learn that much to everyone\u0092s surprise there was no more scar tissue to remove. Seems all the earlier suffering and poking opened everything up. I did have to remain on the fat catheter for another week though. When the catheter came out my flow was great. I think the expression is, \u0093Like a race horse\u0094 great. The danger though was that the scar tissue could come back. To ensure it didn't, my doctor had me self- catheterize. Sounds worse than it was. The catheter is a flexible 18 inch thin tube. You have to insert it until it enters the bladder. So after urinating I would insert the catheter. As long as only a few drops came out I knew I was emptying my bladder. I did this twice a day for two weeks. Then for the next two weeks it was once each day. For the next 10 weeks it was once per week. So after four months of this treatment, no more stricture! The moral of this story is if you have a weak stream when the catheter comes out you should be back in the doctor\u0092s office getting it checked. Waiting a couple of days to see if it improves is one thing. Waiting weeks is not a good idea.",

      "Content": "My stream was weak from the first day of catheter removal and just got weaker. Ultimately I was flexing stomach muscles to help the stream. What ends up happening is your bladder does not empty completely and you start having to go very frequently (every hour). This can become a serious problem. Retaining urine is not a good thing. I waited too long about 5 or 6 weeks before I went in to get it checked. I had a urinary stricture. It blocks urine flow. They don\u0092t know why it occurred. It was not at the point where the urethra was sutured. Your doctor will be able to test your urine flow by measuring the amount of urine you produce and how long it takes to empty your bladder. If you are not emptying completely the doctor will be able to tell if you have a stricture. The stricture is scar tissue. If you have a stricture the treatment is to keep the passage open because the scar tissue tends to build up again and block the flow. When I went to the doctor\u0092s office they easily saw I was not emptying completely. So the first line of treatment is to self-catheterize. The PA explained what to do. I was supposed to follow-up at home with the self-catheterization. So I tried to self-catheterize but could not get it in. The PA tried two more times - unsuccessful, bloody and painful. They rolled me into the procedure room and the doctor did a cystoscopy with numbing jell (put did not help enough). He used the thinnest wire and after a lot of poking, gradually worked up to a wider tube so that ultimately he could look inside and finally inserted a fat catheter. Very painful despite numbing jell. I was scheduled for an urethrotomy nine day later. In this procedure the doctor uses a scope with a cutting instrument to clean out the scar tissue. Since this was more than 30 days after my surgery I had to have another preop check. Blood, heart, chest, etc. When it came time for the urine test I pulled up my large catheter bag opened it up and poured out a rather district red sample. This was a really long bad day. Nine days later when it was time for the next procedure I was prepped knocked out and awoke in the recovery room to learn that much to everyone\u0092s surprise there was no more scar tissue to remove. Seems all the earlier suffering and poking opened everything up. I did have to remain on the fat catheter for another week though. When the catheter came out my flow was great. I think the expression is, \u0093Like a race horse\u0094 great. The danger though was that the scar tissue could come back. To ensure it didn't, my doctor had me self- catheterize. Sounds worse than it was. The catheter is a flexible 18 inch thin tube. You have to insert it until it enters the bladder. So after urinating I would insert the catheter. As long as only a few drops came out I knew I was emptying my bladder. I did this twice a day for two weeks. Then for the next two weeks it was once each day. For the next 10 weeks it was once per week. So after four months of this treatment, no more stricture! The moral of this story is if you have a weak stream when the catheter comes out you should be back in the doctor\u0092s office getting it checked. Waiting a couple of days to see if it improves is one thing. Waiting weeks is not a good idea.",

      "Content": "Have you had other tests like PCA3? You might consider a saturation biopsy. With about 50 samples taken you have a better chance of finding cancer than with a typical 12 core biopsy. I was on Active Surveillance for almost 2 years with 2 saturation biopsies. Very little cancer was found with the biopsies. But my last PCA3 score was very high. My doctor advised treatment. My post-op pathology was upgraded to Gleason 7. It turns out my Gleason 7 was a more aggressive cancer (Intraductal). If your rising PSA score has been consistently going up and not just fluctuating, I would recommend you look closely at a Saturation biopsy.",

      "Content": "Over almost two years, I had two, 50 core biopsies that showed small Gleason 6 cancer in just three cores. Post-op it turned out to be Gleason 7 (3+4). I\u0092ll never know what a 12 core biopsy would have revealed, but I am glad I did the saturation biopsies and fortunate to have done the surgery when I did. My cancer was present in the nerves of the prostate. It is thought that traveling along the nerves is one of the ways it can spread. My doc also monitored PCA3. In the end, my decision to do robotic surgery was influenced in part by my high PCA3 numbers. A urine test measures the PCA3 gene which is prostate cancer specific. It is not influenced by the size of the prostate. During the DRE, the prostate is massaged (milked). Results depend upon the experience of the person doing the exam. So if you don\u0092t have an infection and you are thinking about Active Surveillance I would suggest you consider a plan that includes saturation biopsies, regular PSA tests, DREs, MRIs, Ultrasounds, and PCA3 tests. They are all different ways to gauge if cancer is present and how significant it can be. None of them is perfect. No one can predict the future with the degree of certainty we would like. Delaying treatment too long precludes some treatments and runs the risk that the disease will spread. Knowing when to stop AS and begin treatment can be tricky when the biopsy shows a small cancer and the conventional wisdom is you\u0092re a good candidate to continue AS. You could have a serious case that has just not yet been detected. But establishing a plan with your doc that includes all of these indicators will give you the ability to track changes over time and increase your chances of detecting a significant cancer before it is too late.",

In my case I had two saturation biopsies with about 50 cores in each. Even with two, my Gleason 6 was upgraded to a 7 post surgery. Multiple saturation biopsies can miss serious cancers.",

      "Content": "Two years after robotic surgery life is getting better! I\u0092m still a zero, continent and with a little help from the blue pill, able to have a satisfying sex life. With the pill it is as good as it ever was. (No prior ED problems). On my own, without the pill, erections are serviceable but not as strong as before. My Doc says within the next year I might be able to give up the pill. We\u0092ll see. I post this message to give hope to those who are coming after me. I also want to give a little advice. As many are coming to realize the Prostate Cancer game is one that is characterized by probabilities, luck, and skill. What are my chances that the cancer will be more serious than my biopsy indicates? With your biopsy Gleason score you can get a probability, based on the thousands of cases documented like yours, about the chances that your cancer is more serious. With a Gleason 6 you might have a 30% chance that your cancer is more severe. But at the same time you have a 70% chance that your 6 will stay a 6. Unfortunately there is currently no way to know which camp you fall into. So it\u0092s a game of chance. You place your bet, and take your chances. Some opt for Active Surveillance while others seek treatment. If your 6 stays a 6 and you do AS, great. And if you opted for treatment under the same conditions you may kill the cancer but run the risk that you may suffer unwanted side effects. On the other hand, if your 6 is really a 7 or worse and you don\u0092t treat it, you will more likely than not see the disease progress and suffer its consequences. But if your 6 is really worse and you do treat it, then you may have just saved your life. Luck also plays a part in our game. Your cancer may be very aggressive, despite your relatively low PSA. It may have been detected early in its development or later when it is more advanced. You may or may not have a bad family history. You\u0092ve got what you got. Some of us are lucky while others are not. When it comes to treatment, the skill of your doctor is incredibly important. If I could offer only one piece of advice it would be that when it comes time to seek treatment, find the most skilled doctor you can find. Find the best even if you have to travel far to do so. Examine the chances your doctor\u0092s patients have a recurrence, suffer with Ed, or have to deal with incontinence. Make sure to get their definitions of these conditions. In my case, I eventually opted for surgery. My doctor\u0092s patients have a 97% chance of being continent after surgery (not needing any pads 6 months after surgery), a 15% chance of suffering with ED (not able to maintain an erection sufficient for intercourse 12 months after surgery), and a 95% chance of a cure. Do your homework and shop around. I got a second opinion on my slides, looked at radiation and seeds, consulted with an oncologist, a geneticist and a couple of other urologists. In the end no one else could beat these numbers. I think I'm making progress. Last year I posted this thread, one year after surgery. http://www.cancerforums.net/threads/...c-Life-is-Good!",

When I started to do the one hour straight the gas was gone in days. I pushed the day after surgery and was walking close to an hour in the hospital. Go easy, but keep moving.",
