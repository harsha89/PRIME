      "Content": "Hi All, I am new to the forums here and this is my first post. I'm not diagnosed at this point but I think I'm heading down that path. I know that a lot of you are fighting this thing and I hope for the best for everyone. I'm 50 years old. My Dad had prostate cancer, and so I started getting screened a couple of years ago. My PSA scores were as follows: Last week: 21.4; free PSA 1 (which calculates to a 4.67% free PSA) 6 months previous: 7.6 6 months previous: 2.1 6 months previous: 2.4 I had a 12-core biopsy after the 7.6 reading that came back negative. I just saw my urologist yesterday regarding my 21.4. My DREs have all been negative, including yesterday's. I have pain in my lower back and under my scrotum and chronic constipation that I always thought was the source of the pain. I've had the constipation and \"pain\" (more like discomfort than pain) for several years. I usually fell like I need to have a bowel movement and I urinate frequently and have had several times where I couldn't and walked away from the urinal without going. Our current plan is to take antibiotics for 1 week (start Apr 10) and get a PSA re-done Apr 17. If the PSA has not dropped we will do a biopsy late next week. I haven't been able to find anything that can explain such a high jump in PSA. My urologist said that it was very unlikely that prostate cancer could cause such a high jump. I tripled from 2.1 to 7.6 in six months, then almost tripled from 7.6 to 21.4. Can anyone shed any light on the likelihood that it's prostate cancer? Thanks and best wishes to all of you.",
