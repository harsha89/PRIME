The infection was gone by the testing day, but the test was just after it cleared. 18.7 My concern is the testosterone replacement therapy triggerred growth of something. Last 6-8 months I've been very tired and sleeping heavily. It was so bad that I stopped taking testosterone entirely 6 weeks ago. I have felt better since stopping. I've been off testosterone for 6 weeks and know not to take it again. I see my GP doctor today. She wants me to retest PSA in two weeks and only then will she refer me to a urologist.

But, I've been on testosterone replacement therapy for 3.5 years. But, I just got over urinary tract infection prior to the 18.7 test being done. The infection was gone by the testing day, but the test was just after it cleared. 18.7 My concern is the testosterone replacement therapy triggerred growth of something. Last 6-8 months I've been very tired and sleeping heavily. It was so bad that I stopped taking testosterone entirely 6 weeks ago. I have felt better since stopping. I've been off testosterone for 6 weeks and know not to take it again. I see my GP doctor today. She wants me to retest PSA in two weeks and only then will she refer me to a urologist. Given everthing, what should I expect frim my GP at todays visit. Staying calm...know false positives are common, but also can not stop thinking about it....",
