      "Content": "Was diagnosed in November 2014 with PC in (4) areas in the prostate. Gleason 8.0. Had surgery on12/31/2014 robotically. Surgeon remove 24 lymph nodes with cancer in (2). Gleason 9.29. Currently I Am currently incontinent and have ED. Had PSA on 01/23/2015 with a great 0.18. Currently I am working on floor exercises to deal with the incontinence issue. I read that it is important to get the blood flow back into the penile tissue to maintain a healthy situation. I recently purchase a penile vacuum pump to try and deal with the ED. I discussed this with my wife and she wasn\u0092t certain that she was comfortable with the idea of artificially achieving an erection. She said that she may need to talk to a councilor. I was so taken aback with her statement and the fact that she would not help me to work through these various issues. I started on Lupron on 1/23/2015. At this time I have sexual desire for my wife but I am not sure how long that will last with the Lupron. Can anyone give me some idea where my wife may be coming from on this matter. Maybe some females help me understand. I know that this has been an ordeal on her and I would not want to make things more difficult. I am 68 years old. Still Frustrated",

      "Content": "Where did you have your surgery? I had my surgery at Vattikuti Urology Institute at Henry Ford in Detroit. My surgeon was the first to perform a robotic prostate surgery world wide in 2001. I noticed that you are from Collierville, Tn, My wife is from Paris, Tn. We live in Ohio but we are in Florida for the winter. When you went on the HT were the side effects immediate or were the progressive the longer you were on the HT. Were you on Lupron. I got the shot on 1/23/2015 and have had no side effects that I can recall. From what the medical people told me I expected more side effects. Do get me wrong. If this is as bad as it gets I'm ok with that.",

      "Content": "I have recently purchased a vacuum pump. Have tried it a few times and found that it does not achieve the same hardness as a normal erection. For those of you that have used the pumps is this normal. I did not know what to expect. It was covered by Medicare. I thought that there is a need to get blood flow back into the penile tissue. In addition I wanted to start having a sexual function again. I am 6 weeks past surgery. Would appreciate any advice.",
