      "Content": "Our story began in Dec 2013.....my husband is 56 and I am 43......he , without stereotyping is a man who hadn't been to Dr in 15 years! In December he developed a cold that when he coughed caused severe chest pains....I thought he was having a heart attack......ended up in ER twice, referred to primary physician who found a spot on lung X-ray! This is where everything kind of snow balled, ordered a pet scan and discovered he had a cracked rib, we think came from rough housing with 3 yr old grandson.......anyway ordered full battery of tests.....lung biopsy negative, colonoscopy looked fine.......blood work came back PSA 19.3, biopsy in March 2014! 6/12 positive 3+4!gleason 7 Husband in huge spiral of denial, he felt fine ( although he lost 25 pads and looked sickly) they messed up, cause after all he felt fine.....he drank a lot, he cried, he worried who would take care of me, he thought about blowing his brains out......he finally felt his mortality and slowly accepted surgery ......he was angry, his Italian temper flared, he debated, why risk Ed, incontinence and all that comes with it , only to have cancer rear it's head again.....ll After many a day and night on this unpleasant roller coaster, acceptance came! The surgery was done May 20th, 3 hours left nerve spared partial right, in hospital till Thursday! Recovery was rather smooth, he was helping plant flowers on Friday! First follow up today, cathedral out, no leaking.....yet......gave him 5 mg dial is for penile rehab........but most importantly, final pathology was called in, waiting for hard copy Upgraded to 4+3 Lymph nodes seminal all clear Negative margins Considered very aggressive and very grateful",
