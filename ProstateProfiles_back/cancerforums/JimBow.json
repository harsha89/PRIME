I ended up in an ER where they had to call in a urologist to get me dialated. Wasn't fun. You can have urine retention issues with surgery too, if scar tissue forms around the urethral connection. So far, I've lucked out in that area. My flow is good. And I'm nearly 100% continent. Is proton therapy covered by insurance? I would have had to travel for that treatment, so it was never feasable for me.",

ED is another story. There is very little action in that department. It has improved slightly since month 3. I told the NP that I just saw that I was at 20% of where I was before surgery. I can have orgasms though, and they are at least as good as before. I'm not taking any meds for the ED or using any devices. My PSA was .03 ng/dl, up from .01 three months ago. I'm a little concerned about the increase, but there's nothing to do but keep checking it every three months and watch for any upward trend. On a possibly unrelated front, or maybe not, I sold my house and am planning early retirement from a job I hate!",

      "Content": "I don't really have any answers to your question, just a comment. They have me on 5 mg Cialis per day, but it's having no obvious effect so far. I guess that is to be expected at 4 weeks post op. My uro wrote me two prescriptions for the Cialis. One for a month, along with a $200 discount card. The other is for longer term, but a paper was included with contact info for a pharmacy in BC Canada. I was impressed with how my uro's office has this stuff figured out. My insurance only covers 6 Cialis pills per month. So, Bravehardon, I take it you have no trouble getting generic Cialis and Viagra, since you're located in Canada? My understanding is that I can order it mail order from Canada, with the script that I have.",

In fact, mine has been so bad that I learned to self-catheterize in case of an emergency, such as being away from a private restroom for hours. I've always called it shy bladder, and it's also known as paruresis. Something like 21 million Americans have paruresis, yet it isn't talked about much. Anyhow, I've been wondering how having a prostatectomy might ultimately make it easier to pee, and reduce the shy bladder problem. It's interesting that you brought that up. I'm probably a couple of months away from the surgery, so we'll see. Good luck with your recovery!",

I was a little worried that my PSA was on an upward trend, but apparently not! This is an ultra sensitive PSA test with a reference range of 0 to 4. I have no incontinance to speak of. I have some urgency when it's time to go. When I gotta go, I gotta go soon! I can have a slight squirt if I wait too long to urinate. My stream is good, so I haven't had any narrowing of my urethra due to scarring. ED is still significant, with no improvement in the last 3 months.

      "Content": "So I'm one year out from RALP. My continence is good. I don't use pads or anything. My stream is strong, so there's no narrowing of the urethra. I'm happy with where I'm at in this department. I do have significant ED, but there has been some improvement in the last 3 months. I think I could get a decent erection with Cialis, so I'm going to give it another try. I'm going to order some 20 mg generic Cialis from Canada. The not so good news is my PSA is up. It's at .06 ng/dl. My PSA history has gone like this over the last year, testing every 3 months: .01, .03, <.01 ?, .06 At the appointment, the NP said come back in 6 months for another PSA check, but that was before we knew the results. Should I keep getting it checked every 3 months considering the apparent rise? She mentioned that the number (.06) was still \"reasonable\". She also said at the appointment that they don't consider it a recurrence until the PSA reaches .2 ng/dl. I know there's some evidence that acting before the PSA reaches .2 is a good idea. I'm in no hurry to pull the trigger on SRT though. Any thoughts?",

      "Content": "I just had my latest PSA done. It came in at <.01 ng/dl, which is undetectable. Woo hoo! My last one was .03. I was a little worried that my PSA was on an upward trend, but apparently not! This is an ultra sensitive PSA test with a reference range of 0 to 4. I have no incontinance to speak of. I have some urgency when it's time to go. When I gotta go, I gotta go soon! I can have a slight squirt if I wait too long to urinate. My stream is good, so I haven't had any narrowing of my urethra due to scarring. ED is still significant, with no improvement in the last 3 months. This has been the most discouraging part of the surgery. I'm not very hopeful I'll ever have a useable erection again.",

My URO took the 12 cores very fast, which helped get the procedure over with quickly. If you have anything other than a local, you'll have to have someone with you to drive you. I drove myself there and back. Here's a tip. Keep your eyes closed during the whole thing. Just seeing the instruments made me more queasy than anything. They use a big assed needle to inject the local. That was the worst part of the whole thing for me.",

I guess I'm more worried about the treatment than about the cancer at this point. It sounds like there's a pretty good chance of a cure. It's good to hear you guys are getting back to, at least close to normal after surgery. I may make an appointment with Dr. Christopher Amling at Oregon Health Sciences University. He's apparently done over a thousand of the robotic surgeries. Anyway, I'm probably getting ahead of myself until I know more. I'm single and live alone. Am I going to need help after the surgery, if I end up having it? I'm normally a fairly self-reliant guy. Is it possible to come home after the surgery and take care of yourself?",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by HighlanderCFH Welcome to the forum. Don't worry about it being Christmas time -- cancer does not keep any calendar. You have received fantastic advice from the others, so far. As for surgery, just 2 months from my surgery I was already back running 8 miles every day & carrying heavy picturetube TVs up and down my basement stairs. I was continent from the moment the catheter was removed. Everyone does not have the same recovery rate, but mine was probably pretty typical. Also, as Prato suggested, can you tell us if your Gleason 7 is a 3+4 or a 4+3? It can make a difference, although they are all curable if still confined to the prostate -- and yours probably is. We're glad to be here for you every step of the way -- and I'm also glad you will be reading Dr Walsh's book. A great read. Good luck! Chuck Thanks, man. It's been a crappy Christmas for me in more ways than one. I will give an update after I see the doctor again. I don't know if it's a 3+4 or a 4+3 yet.",

I was continent from the moment the catheter was removed. Everyone does not have the same recovery rate, but mine was probably pretty typical. Also, as Prato suggested, can you tell us if your Gleason 7 is a 3+4 or a 4+3? It can make a difference, although they are all curable if still confined to the prostate -- and yours probably is. We're glad to be here for you every step of the way -- and I'm also glad you will be reading Dr Walsh's book. A great read. Good luck! Chuck Thanks, man. It's been a crappy Christmas for me in more ways than one. I will give an update after I see the doctor again. I don't know if it's a 3+4 or a 4+3 yet.",

      "Content": "Hello. I'm new to the forum. I just got the call from the urologist a few days ago with the results of my biopsy. It was a pretty short conversation, as I was stunned. I thought the biopsy would come back negative. He said they found 5 of 12 cores, all on one side, positive for cancer. Gleason score is 7. All he said is that the cancer needed treatment, and it wasn't appropriate for observation. I have an appointment next week to find out more. My PSA was 6.5, and then 7.6 three months later. That's what triggered the visit to a urologist, and the biopsy. The DRE was negative. I'm 54 years old. Another wrinkle to my story is that I've been on TRT for a few years. The latest thing I was on was Androgel, the patches before that. My total T was usually in the 600 to 700 range when on the gel. Needless to say, I'm off TRT now, and the last test for total T came back at 300, completely off the gel. My understanding is that TRT doesn't cause doesn't cause prostate cancer, but you don't want to be on it, if you have prostate cancer. Is this the current thinking? The urologist's ears definitely perked up when I told him I had been on Androgel. I don't know much yet. I ordered Dr. Walsh's book. From what I've read on here so far, I'm thinking surgery may be in my future. One concern I have is that I do very strenuous work for a living. I would have to be near 100% before going back to work. The hormone therapy for PC sounds horrible. I don't see how I could do the heavy work I do on it. What am I in for?",

      "Content": "Hello. I'm new to the forum. I just got the call from the urologist a few days ago with the results of my biopsy. It was a pretty short conversation, as I was stunned. I thought the biopsy would come back negative. He said they found 5 of 12 cores, all on one side, positive for cancer. Gleason score is 7. All he said is that the cancer needed treatment, and it wasn't appropriate for observation. I have an appointment next week to find out more. My PSA was 6.5, and then 7.6 three months later. That's what triggered the visit to a urologist, and the biopsy. The DRE was negative. I'm 54 years old. Another wrinkle to my story is that I've been on TRT for a few years. The latest thing I was on was Androgel, the patches before that. My total T was usually in the 600 to 700 range when on the gel. Needless to say, I'm off TRT now, and the last test for total T came back at 300, completely off the gel. My understanding is that TRT doesn't cause doesn't cause prostate cancer, but you don't want to be on it, if you have prostate cancer. Is this the current thinking? The urologist's ears definitely perked up when I told him I had been on Androgel. I don't know much yet. I ordered Dr. Walsh's book. From what I've read on here so far, I'm thinking surgery may be in my future. One concern I have is that I do very strenuous work for a living. I would have to be near 100% before going back to work. The hormone therapy for PC sounds horrible. I don't see how I could do the heavy work I do on it. What am I in for?",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by Webheadfred Hi Jim, welcome. I was 54 when I had my prostatectomy. My Dr was the same as mjimsr. You'll need someone to be able to drive you as you'll not be able to drive for the first week while you have the catheter. I was able to return to work in 10 days but no physical activity for 6 weeks. After that, no restrictions. My outcome was very superior and I have no regrets. Everything works as it should with no incontinence. Do as everyone previously advises and you will be fine. As far as taking care of yourself, I think that's certainly doable. My wife was here for moral support for the first two days but I was solo after that. I actually didn't mind much the catheter. It was odd of course but not nearly as bad as I initially thought. I was able to shower, dress, walk, eat, take a crap () and anything else. Just couldn't lift anything that could cause any abdominal strain. I sat and played PS4 and killed a few kids in Call of Duty. You'll have to have someone drive you to take the cath out as well. Here's to a good result. Fred I'll get someone to drive me. Maybe. I broke my leg a few years ago. Had a cast up to my thigh. I still drove my truck with one leg. I could probably manage drive myself with a catheter. jk. I'll find someone to drive me.",

The hormone therapy for PC sounds horrible. I don't see how I could do the heavy work I do on it. What am I in for?",

      "Content": "Thanks for the replies! I know around Christmas time isn't the most popular time to be posting about this stuff. I will ask about the MRI when I go in for my next appointment. I guess I'm more worried about the treatment than about the cancer at this point. It sounds like there's a pretty good chance of a cure. It's good to hear you guys are getting back to, at least close to normal after surgery. I may make an appointment with Dr. Christopher Amling at Oregon Health Sciences University. He's apparently done over a thousand of the robotic surgeries. Anyway, I'm probably getting ahead of myself until I know more. I'm single and live alone. Am I going to need help after the surgery, if I end up having it? I'm normally a fairly self-reliant guy. Is it possible to come home after the surgery and take care of yourself?",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by HighlanderCFH Welcome to the forum. Don't worry about it being Christmas time -- cancer does not keep any calendar. You have received fantastic advice from the others, so far. As for surgery, just 2 months from my surgery I was already back running 8 miles every day & carrying heavy picturetube TVs up and down my basement stairs. I was continent from the moment the catheter was removed. Everyone does not have the same recovery rate, but mine was probably pretty typical. Also, as Prato suggested, can you tell us if your Gleason 7 is a 3+4 or a 4+3? It can make a difference, although they are all curable if still confined to the prostate -- and yours probably is. We're glad to be here for you every step of the way -- and I'm also glad you will be reading Dr Walsh's book. A great read. Good luck! Chuck Thanks, man. It's been a crappy Christmas for me in more ways than one. I will give an update after I see the doctor again. I don't know if it's a 3+4 or a 4+3 yet.",
