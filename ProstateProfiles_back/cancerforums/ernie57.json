      "Content": "I went to meet Dr Matsunaga on Monday. He seemed like a guy I would be willing to put my life in his hands. He said that if he can get all of the cancer out, there's about a 95% chance of remaining cancer free. He also stated that they're going to be 15-20% of the nerves excised on y the right side, maybe more. He obviously can't guarantee any results on sexual function, since he may need to remove more nerves once he's inside. Scary to just leap into the unknown. It's easy to say that getting all of the cancer out its primary job #1 but at what price to quality of life? It's also easy to say to compare myself to others worse off than me. I've been clinically depressed my entire adult life and slogans and things that might work for situational depression really don't help much to someone who struggles with deep clinical depression. There is a big difference. Now it's combined with a serious situational depression as well. I'm scared to death of how this will alter my life permanently. Many people are told one thing by the Dr pre surgery and then go in with expectations only to have them never met and end up more depressed, isolated, and too lost to attempt any attempts at attracting a mateas a result of their treatment. I read about that here all the time from those brave enough to express those emotions. Many just hide our deny them from what I can tell. I live alone, I'm now single. My family is really of no support through this. So, yeah I am seriously depressed, scared, and not wanting to risk doing any kind of treatment. Sometimes I just want to let nature take its course. I have a job I hate, owe lots of money to IRS and now have to face this whole thing alone. What I need to hear is how other men have made it out of a similar situation. Guys with living wives who helped them through, have money in the bank, high self esteem, blah blah blah can't really relate. If they've crawled out of a dark place like I'm in, please let me know how it's done. Maybe I'm feeling sorry for myself, but from where I am I don't see a lot of hope in front of me. Only selecting the least worst option and then dealing with a potential serious negative effect on the rest of my life just to stay alive at all costs. Many that have posted here have regretted getting treatment as their lives are never the same and a lot worse than before treatment. Those are my fears, concerns, and Feelings on having this awful disease and the awful choices that have to ( or not) be made. Help me out here. I need it.",

The surgery option doesn't feel much better, either. All of these options feel like they come with a very high price tag. Does perineural invasion mean the nerves that control erections? That is listed on the pathology report. I'm confused and scared at this point and nothing feels right any longer. I see Dr. Matsunaga (Surgeon) on Monday and then Dr. Reiter (UCLA Surgeon) on July 11. It's all of the moments, seconds, minutes, and hours between then are the problem right now.",

Hard to deal with that. I did see a radiation oncologist yesterday and became utterly despondent when he explained ADT and radiation. I'm pretty convinced I'm not going that route. The surgery option doesn't feel much better, either. All of these options feel like they come with a very high price tag. Does perineural invasion mean the nerves that control erections? That is listed on the pathology report. I'm confused and scared at this point and nothing feels right any longer. I see Dr. Matsunaga (Surgeon) on Monday and then Dr. Reiter (UCLA Surgeon) on July 11. It's all of the moments, seconds, minutes, and hours between then are the problem right now.",

      "Content": "Hi Recently diagnosed about 3 weeks ago. Scared beyond belief about what I read here about side effects from Da Vinci RP. Has anyone here had experience with either of these surgeons? They both seem to be highly recommended, but some first hand knowledge would help. thanks",

      "Content": "I went to meet Dr Matsunaga on Monday. He seemed like a guy I would be willing to put my life in his hands. He said that if he can get all of the cancer out, there's about a 95% chance of remaining cancer free. He also stated that they're going to be 15-20% of the nerves excised on y the right side, maybe more. He obviously can't guarantee any results on sexual function, since he may need to remove more nerves once he's inside. Scary to just leap into the unknown. It's easy to say that getting all of the cancer out its primary job #1 but at what price to quality of life? It's also easy to say to compare myself to others worse off than me. I've been clinically depressed my entire adult life and slogans and things that might work for situational depression really don't help much to someone who struggles with deep clinical depression. There is a big difference. Now it's combined with a serious situational depression as well. I'm scared to death of how this will alter my life permanently. Many people are told one thing by the Dr pre surgery and then go in with expectations only to have them never met and end up more depressed, isolated, and too lost to attempt any attempts at attracting a mateas a result of their treatment. I read about that here all the time from those brave enough to express those emotions. Many just hide our deny them from what I can tell. I live alone, I'm now single. My family is really of no support through this. So, yeah I am seriously depressed, scared, and not wanting to risk doing any kind of treatment. Sometimes I just want to let nature take its course. I have a job I hate, owe lots of money to IRS and now have to face this whole thing alone. What I need to hear is how other men have made it out of a similar situation. Guys with living wives who helped them through, have money in the bank, high self esteem, blah blah blah can't really relate. If they've crawled out of a dark place like I'm in, please let me know how it's done. Maybe I'm feeling sorry for myself, but from where I am I don't see a lot of hope in front of me. Only selecting the least worst option and then dealing with a potential serious negative effect on the rest of my life just to stay alive at all costs. Many that have posted here have regretted getting treatment as their lives are never the same and a lot worse than before treatment. Those are my fears, concerns, and Feelings on having this awful disease and the awful choices that have to ( or not) be made. Help me out here. I need it.",
