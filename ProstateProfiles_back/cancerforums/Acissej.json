      "Content": "Thank you all. Im getting married in March and to hear that my dad might only have a year really scares me. His urologist and oncologist both said the cancer is very aggressive. He was completely fine 2 months ago and just 3 weeks ago he got worse. He cant walk right. Barely eats. And even has a fracture in his rib already. His psa was at 500. His first lupron shot will be given tomorrow and the first chemo starts on monday. I was also hoping to talk to his urologist and ask if removing his prostate will still work. The urologist didnt recommend it but i read some articles online that removing it still helped. Thank you again. I didnt really believe in these forums until now. Hearing others gives me hope.",

      "Content": "Hello, My dad was just diagnosed with very aggressive rare type of prostate cancer. They did tell us that it has spread in his lungs and liver and the bones. The oncologist said he has less than a year. Although they will still have him go through 6 treatments of chemo. They didnt want to remove his prostate anymore and just give him shots of lupron to keep his testosterone level down. I was wondering if anyone else has experience with this? And if there is hope that my dad will love longer than a year.",
