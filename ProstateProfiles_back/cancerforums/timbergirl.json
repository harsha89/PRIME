My question is what is considered intermittent Lupron treatments? How long and how much. Thank you very much and best of luck to you. His PSA is 45 and only has two more chemo treatments left.",

      "Content": "Hi All, My boyfriend has metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer. He is only 48. He has done provenge, zytiga, taxotere. All failed. Doctor wants to start him on Xtandi. He has just started experiencing extreme bone pain in his neck, shoulders, back and his left leg and hip. After reading SE of Xtandi, he doesn't want more pain. Would rather have quality of life over quantity at this point. He takes Oxycotone for pain and is up to a pill (5/325) every 4 or 5 hours now. Also lots of fatigue. Any suggestions for pain alleviation? Very open to holistic suggestions as well. Thank you and prayers for all on this site.",

Worried that if he feels this bad, he won't continue with chemo. We see his doctor on Wed for a zometa treatment. Will ask doctor then. Thanks for replying.",
