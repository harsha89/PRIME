      "Content": "I would say based on what I have read my recovery is moving pretty normal. Catheter was removed 15 days after surgery. 8 days later I leak only on a rare occasion but still wear a pad per day just in case. My doctor told me to hold off having sex for 2 -3 weeks after catheter removal. My erections are about 75% after working on it awhile. One thing i have noticed when doing my erection therapy is that my penis in MUCH more sensitive after arousal, especially on the tip. Has anyone else noticed a difference in sensitivity areas? I'm totally not complaining because I have more sensation now then before survey. Although I have not climaxed yet, I do get close enough to get the throbbing going.",

      "Content": "Hi There, I am 55 and was diagnosed in October. 12 step biopsy, 3 positive. PSA 6, Gleason 6. I am still recovering from my surgery. Prostate removal December 3rd. Catheter out on December 18th. I really had no pain throughout this whole event. The biggest problem was my catheter. I had nerve sparing traditional vs robotic. I seem to have recovered fast in the erection department. Enjoyed my wife for the first time yesterday in almost a month.",
