      "Content": "Don't give up. I tried all the methods. MUSE simply didn't work. The vacuum pump works, but as mentioned, it's lacks spontanaiety. And it can be sort of technically difficult. All of the Viagra type medications rely on at least SOME nerve sparing. If the nerve is missing those will never work. HOWEVER, my doctor, as a last resort tried a \"tri-mix\" injection. There is almost no way that cant work. In fact when he was titrating the correct dose he got way too much, and the problem then was \"getting it down\". If you don't mind poking the needle in, (or if you are lucky enough to marry a nurse as you say), there almost has to be a dosage that will work for anyone, as it acts directly on the arterial blood supply and does not rely on the nerve normally involved with erection. The tri-mix contains prostoglandin E1, phentolamine, and papavarine. The problem is titrating the correct dosage, and concentration. It is only available at a few compounding pharmacies in the USA. If you found that it didn't work, then up the dosage until it does work, that is the secret. And BE CAREFUL not to overshoot the dosage level, that can result in a painful and prolonged erection which must be reduced by a physician that knows what he's doing. I've been through that experience once, and I wouldn't wish that on anybody. There is almost no way that this won't work for just about anybody, at the proper titration. Hope that helps.",
