There are some supplements that can have a reverse effect and diminish the effectiveness of the therapy. Anti-oxidation and I believe it is called radical absorption is not what you want during radiation. My RO told me the best way to sensitize the cancer cells was to exercise. Lift weights, fast walking, etc. FWIW. Best, MM Thanks MM, I start the radiation probably around late August. I'm guessing it's ok to keep w/ the diet until then? I am starting to walk some. I have a weight bench too, and maybe if I strengthen up my legs, maybe the incontinence will get better too. I walked a mile last night, came home, leaned over and dribbled about 3 times....",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by wtdedula redbelly7; The following study (below) demonstrates the benefits of consuming pomegranate juice to slow the progression of Prostate Cancer. Drinking Pomegranate juice is an easy step to take as it could be substituted for your morning orange juice or coffee and it won't hurt but may help. I prefer to juice whole fruit in a vitamix rather than buying juice in a bottle because I'm sure some of the nutrition is lost in the processing and bottling process. Below is an excerpt from the study ... \"The most striking evidence for the biological activity of pomegranate extracts was demonstrated in prostate cancer cells. In vivo and in vitro studies have shown that pomegranate extracts are capable of inhibiting tumor cell proliferation, migration, and invasion, while also inducing apoptosis.\" If you want to read the full article, the link is below ... https://www.hindawi.com/journals/ecam/2013/701434/ Tim Good read, thanks, I'm taking real pomegranate, broccoli, green tea and turmeric each day. Plus some kale, mixed berries (raspberry, black berry, blueberry) but will probably have to stop some of it at time of radiation, so I get full benefit of the radiation.

I believe he must have gotten most of cancer, but when I asked about longevity, he hung his head. I kind of liked Dr Cimino's bedside manner, but he isn't as nearly qualified as Sanda or Al. I hope the radiation doesn't hinder me in the dove and quail seasons. My kids and friends do the deer hunting around the house. I may sit in stand w/ a kid, but it would have to be a monster for me to pull a trigger. We have some English Cockers that I enjoy watching flush quail and breeding some this fall.",

I was put on waiting list for the on site living, but haven't heard back from them. According to Dr in Albany, he has latest technology and does a CT scan prior to each radiation and the radiation machine overlays the CT scan. According to him, Emory has just gotten this type of machine or getting it. Albany Dr said he was first place in GA to get one. He seems like a good guy and I like him, but like someone said, this is a one time shot and I want it done right. Dr Jani wanted me to be in a trial w/ PET scan and all of that, but I was in a PET scan trial prior to surgery and I'm wondering if they looked at it. If they had seen cancer was in margins or just barely outside margins, shouldn't they have done radiation first? Or treated first in a different way? Dr Rossi from Emory gave me the green light to proceed w/ Dr in Albany and said that he would give just as good treatments as they would. Dang, this is touch decisions.",

Head guy at Emory says that the guy in Albany will be fine and he supports that. Just got a call from a friend, whose dad got burnt bad by guy in Albany, (15 years ago). My friend's dad has a bladder bag, and he salvaged his colon w/ being cauterized a few times. The Dr in Albany does have a new machine. I'm guessing that there is always a chance of damage during radiation. Albany is 30 minutes away and Emory is 3 hours. I feel Dr in Albany does care, and I feel like a number at Emory.

Drinking Pomegranate juice is an easy step to take as it could be substituted for your morning orange juice or coffee and it won't hurt but may help. I prefer to juice whole fruit in a vitamix rather than buying juice in a bottle because I'm sure some of the nutrition is lost in the processing and bottling process. Below is an excerpt from the study ... \"The most striking evidence for the biological activity of pomegranate extracts was demonstrated in prostate cancer cells.

      "Content": "Dr Sanda will give you a most invasive prostate exam, but I think he is good. They will have you talk to the radiologists as well, so you can make your choice on surgery or radiation. Dr Sanda will most likely refer you to Dr Al (last name to long for anyone to pronounce). Dr Al has good pedigree and was in surgery w/ me for over 6 hours. I am going back to Emory next month for a colonoscopy, as I feel that I get better service there than in S. GA. Had another guy install an AUS800 at Emory in the fall.",

      "Content": "Hey guys, I recently got turned down for Zytiga, and this time while getting Lupron shot, the Dr said to take casodex w/ it until end of July when Lupron wears off. That will be my 2 years on Lupron, one of those years I was on Zytiga. My PSA today was .06, which is as low at Phoebe in Albany can do, I think. I went to the Winship Center at Emory a few weeks ago, and the oncologist there said that we were going over and beyond the standard protocol. He made me optimistic in the fact that it may be cured, probably 50%. Anyhow, what do you guys think of the casodex w/ Lupron? Also, getting a colonoscopy April 16th, and I have an AUS800, radiation, etc.., Should I be worried about the colonoscopy? I 'm having it done at Emory.",

Or does radiation give you this on the first treatment? What do I need to watch for? FYI, I'm doing radiation about 5 months after RP, because Dr said he saw some in the bed.
