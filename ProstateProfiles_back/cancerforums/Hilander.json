      "Content": "New to this forum and have a biopsy scheduled for next week. I'm 51 and my PSA was 6.1 and DRE was explained to be abnormal, Dr. felt bumps on the outside of my prostate. Been searching everything looking to see what the possible odd's are of my biopsy being positive and high Gleason score. Have found very little info. on my age and abnormal DRE w/PSA of >6. Any insight to the probability of me having a conclusive biopsy for cancer? Thanks",
