Today it all seems to be a little overwhelming even though I have been looking into this for the past month or so as I was expecting this outcome from the biopsy. Reading others advice seems to help.",

      "Content": "I am 52 and was just diagnosed yesterday with prostate cancer after a biopsy I had last week returned positive results. They are as follows: 12 Core sample, 3 positive (13%, 35%, and 85%) all in the left lobe. PSA prior to the biopsy was 10.5 and the month just prior to that was 8.5. Gleason 3+4=7. I don't like my options at this point but I am leaning towards robotic surgery. I do have a consultation for a second opinion on Sept 2. The doctor I am seeing on the 2nd is supposed to be one of the best in the state if not the country, Top 5% of doctors in the State of Texas, and does 10 or so surgeries a week. He has performed over 2000. Couple of questions I have is what should I be asking and how much time do I have to consider all my options without putting my health in further jeopardy? Thanks ahead of time for the help!",

I was wondering if anyone has any insight or experience with in repercussions from letting their staff/employees know about their cancer diagnosis. What I am trying to make sure doesn't happen is that people get nervous about the long term viability of their jobs and they decide to leave. All I know I can do is explain the situation as clearly as I can and reassure them that this is a manageable condition. Thoughts?",

      "Content": "What are peoples thought on getting a second reading of my biopsies by another lab? With my results what they are, I'm not sure even if it came back with a lower Gleason score that I would do anything different, unless the one that was done is completely out of whack. With a 3+4 and 3 out of 12 cores positive does it really make any sense to have it checked out by another lab? That along with my 10.5 PSA and 7.5% fPSA. Thanks again for everyone's help and support!!",
