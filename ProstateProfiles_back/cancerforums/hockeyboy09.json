      "Content": "My doctor got my biopsy back this evening. He called me at 9:00pm with extremely good news. I have no cancer. I have a case (or had) of prostatitis (sic)? that caused the hard spot on my prostate and my elevated PSA. Thanks for all the good wishes and for the gents I exchanged posts with, continued good health for you and yours. Best wishes for all the rest of you on the forum as well. I also found flowmax (generic). That has worked great for me. I step up to the plate and hit a home run every time. Chuck, you win the bet. And hats off to my doctor Eduardo Kleer from St Joe's Ann Arbor MI. He performed a painless biopsy and called me at 9:00pm on a Friday night to save me a weekend of worrying.",

      "Content": "I had my biopsy today. It really wasn't that big of a deal. A little pressure from insertion and one core sample felt like a very brief mosquito bite (other 12 painless). The antibiotic injection in the hip was the most painful thing. Pain 1.5-2 out of 10. Now I wait till next week. The doc would not give me an opinion on cancer/no cancer. I suspect that was wise on his part and I understand. The rest of you are not limited to taking a stab at my diagnosis! My history. 59,relatively healthy, 30 lbs overweight. 2010 PSA 2.7, 2012 - 3.8, 2014 - 5.7 DRE - hard spot felt by urologist. Ultrasound - Dark spot where urologist expected it. I saw the pic. It looks like 10% of the volume of my prostate. Prostate size 50mm I had a kidney infection on 5/30/14. After said infection my urinary issues (about all you can think of except blood) got much worse. Because of that I consulted a urologist (most recent PSA was 2 weeks after my antibiotic treatment for UTI). The prostate cancer calculator says 48% change of cancer. 32% chance of aggressive cancer (sometimes I hate the internet). And hot off the presses... Guys with vasectomies have a significantly higher chance of getting very aggressive prostate cancer. Yup had one of those 30 years ago. I'm going into next week thinking I have cancer so if the doc tells me I do, it might lessen the blow. If he says no, it will be a great feeling. It's going to be a long 6 or 7 days. Oh, and hello, I'm new here. Can't say as I'm glad to be here, but I believe I'm starting a long journey today and it will be nice to have some support from people who have been down the path before. TIA! Mike",

Steve - Sorry to hear about your Dad. He and I are close to the same age. My kids don't know anything yet. If I do have cancer that is one of the things I am really not going to enjoy... telling my daughters. Fred - nice looking fish! I fish the gulf of Mexico shores in the winter and the Northern lakes of Michigan in the summer. I surf cast in Florida and I've just ordered a Yak to be able to sneak up on the fish in MI. Thanks for the note on the vasectomy study as well. I'm sending well wishes for a clean lymph node biopsy report.",

      "Content": "I had wondered about the antibiotics. I had a UTI infection on 5/30. Did Cipro for 10 days. Test at GP doctor and Urologist showed no infection. The day of the Biopsy I had two Cipro and an antibiotic shot. I guess that was enough. The urologist did not mention another course of antibiotics. He did say another PSA in 6 months though. I'll be sure not to miss that appointment! Mike",
