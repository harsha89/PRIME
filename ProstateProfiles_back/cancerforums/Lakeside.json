      "Content": "Hello Everyone, I'm new to forum, 11 yr survivor of prostate cancer. I've had DaVinci surgery, post operative Radiation and for the last 3 yrs been on once a month Firmagon stomach shots and recently changed to Lupron 3mo butt shots and taking Erleada orally. Started a couple days ago getting some dry itchy skin around my nose, mouth, and eyes. Just trying to see if anyone else might be experiencing something like this or if some new allergy has crept into my life. Thanks in advance for your help",
