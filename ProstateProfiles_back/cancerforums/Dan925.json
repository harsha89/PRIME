    "Content": "I am 55 and have enlarged prostate with frequent urination and not nearly emptying my bladder. Had a bladder stone removed 4 weeks ago and also had prostate biopsy which showed Gleason 6 -- in 2 of 12 samples. Was considering TURP prior to biopsy -- an operation my brother successfully had a year ago. ** Wondered if any others are facing this situation of urination/bladder issues that need fixing but also have early stage prostate cancer. ** Was considering TURP to fix bladder/urine issue...then Active Surveillance for the cancer. However... Have heard that after TURP, prostate continues to grow making eventual Robotic surgery more risky. Also with larger prostate, risk of cancer growing and becoming more aggressive also increases. Lastly, heard that TURP changes the anatomy and make reconnecting the the urethra to the bladder in Robotic more complex. I'm currently on Tamsulosin (Flomax).",
