I had a DRE and a PSA test done about 2 years before and it was somewhat enlarged and my PSA was under 1. I went the next day for the PSA and the reading had jumped to 17.6. I was then sent to a urologist and he scheduled a biopsy for me about 2 weeks later. I am now waiting for the results of the biopsy and am very nervous. I have a Cystoscopy scheduled as well in a week. I am assuming it is PC and am now looking at the different options that are open for me. Any words of encouragement are appreciated.",

The cystsoscopy is painless and just takes a moment or two. The doctor will just check the inside of your bladder and the urethra.
