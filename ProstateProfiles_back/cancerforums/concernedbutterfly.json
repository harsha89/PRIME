      "Content": "My husband just got his results and he has a gleason score of 6. The doctor says that his prostate might be a solid mass of cancer and its was in every spot that had a biopsy sample, and that there might be a chance that the cancer has spread to his lymph nodes. They are going to surgically remove his prostate and lymph nodes, and he is going to have to follow up with radiation. I have been reading alot about it online, and many websites say there is a 99% percent survival rate, but my question is what is the survival rate if the cancer has spread out to his lymph nodes, and what stage would that be considered? The doctor says that he doesn''t even know how far the cancer has spread out, but he said statically that it probably hasn't gone past the lymph nodes and there wasn't anyway to test for it, \"which I thought was very odd\". Thanks for all your previous responses, any helpful advice is much appreciated.",
