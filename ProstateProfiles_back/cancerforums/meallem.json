      "Content": "I have had prostate cancer for 13 years.in 2004 i had 45 radiations and couple of biopsies.in 2008 i had cryotherapy which did not succeed.i had gleason 7 +7 and maximum 25 psa.after2008. i have been having casodex during the last 9 years which managed to keep down the psa to maximum to 3 .two years ago i had a urine blockage and had to go to hospital .they found that my psa went up to 33 and the cancer got out to the bones. i am treated now with an injection called decaptil each 3 months and stopped the casodex.i started also to take xtandi for the lasr 2 months and i found that i am wanting to sleep all the time.and my urine problems aggavated. i am wondering if some patients are in a similar situiation and what have they done about it.i am 78 years old. Thanks. ezra meallem",
