      "Content": "I live in the Memphis area and when first diagnosed with PCa a couple of weeks ago, was considering going to either Vanderbilt or Urology Centers of Alabama where they have surgeons who have done in the thousands (Dr. Tully at UCA does about 9 a week and has done over 3000). I'm now looking into local doctors because I feel if I have an emergency post surgery, I'd rather have my surgeon at hand. Memphis is known for its fine medical centers (St. Jude, Lebonheur, and Methodist University Hospital where Steve Jobs had his liver transplant). I've located a local surgeon who has done 800 of these procedures and has trained over 20 doctors in the area in the use of the da vinci system. I sent him an e-mail and actually got a very nice reply from him. He also assured me that I was in good hands with my present urologist who has only done about 300. My urologist is 63 and has years of conventional surgery and urological procedures but is getting to the age when some begin to lose fine motor skills (I know...I'm 66). The other doctor is 40 with only 11 years experience in medical practice, yet he's the most experienced in the robotic procedure. I'm still weighing options but leaning toward the 40 year old doctor. There are still some more in town who may have more experience, so I'm still still researching. However, there has to be a point of diminishing returns on experience...is a doc who's done 3000 more capable than one who's done 2000? 800 sounds like a pretty good number to me, plus this doc trains others which reinforces his skills as he demonstrates the procedure. I'd appreciate any feedback on this subject. Thanks....Fred",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by Fairwind The good news is the Gleason 6.. 97% of the guys with G-6 PC live to die of something else...So virtually any treatment you choose works equally well..Many G-6 patients can go on AS, active surveillance and go for years without any treatment..But your numbers look a little more advanced so some form of treatment is in your future. The big side-effect risk with surgery is impotence..in the real world, about 75% of the men who have had surgery suffer from it in one degree or another..Surgeons of course will tell you the impotence is much less, the \"nerve sparing\" technique, yada yada yada ...But it's still 75%... The BEST surgeons can cure your cancer and leave you both continent and potent..But during the surgery, they are trying to cure you, to save your life..They are not going to forgo that goal to save your potency..Read a couple of books..\"A guide to surviving Prostate cancer\" by Patrick Walsh and \"Winning the battle against prostate cancer\" by Gerald Chodak. To create a signature, go to \"Settings\", scroll down the left hand side..\"Edit Signature\" Thanks for the information. I have the Walsh book on hold at local library. My best friend had the robotic surgery in October and when I talked to him last week he said he had incontinence for a few weeks and is 85% back to normal sexually. He had his done at Urology Centers of Alabama by Dr. Tully who has done over 2000 and does about 2 a day.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by Fairwind This is a VERY tough call because the SKILL of the surgeon is so important to have a successful outcome..But any surgeon doing 4 a week or more must be pretty good at it..That points to a prostate SPECIALIST, not a general surgeon..The specialists tend to like what they do so they do a lot of them and they get very good at it...You are doing the right thing, asking lots of questions..You might post your age, PSA history and Gleason score to get more detailed answers to your thread.. I'm 66. Gleason score 6. 12 point biopsy found 3 positive (40%, 60%, and 23% malignant) and 1 borderline. I tried to put this info in my profile, but for some reason it didn't work.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by newporter Fairwind gave you an excellent unbiased review. I might add that in addition to selecting a skill surgeon, outcome depends on a number of other factors and is very personalized. If the cancer is too close to the nerves, nerve sparing could be difficult and potency could be a challenge. If it is too close to the bladder neck, apex or urethra, it might affect continence, etc. So, in the end, it also depends on your situation. Based on a number of posts I read here and elsewhere in the past six months, it seemed for surgery, in general most eventually were able to achieve continence. ED seemed more of a challenge. In the end many required medications or aids to function but were able to function. Folks that had done radiation mostly reported only minor short term side effects. However, there were not too many long term outcome reported. I don't know, maybe because there were none to report? Discuss all options with your doctor. In the end, it is your choice. Best of luck. Well...I already have Peyronie's and had pain with it for almost 5 years, which was a big blow to our sex life anyway. Shame too, because we shared a very fulfilling sexual relationship. Back in about October I discovered ubiquinol (from an Iranian study posted on the Peyronie's Disease Forum). The ubiquinol has knocked the Peyronie's pain back to almost zero, but the last time we had sex, when I ejaculated it was excruciating...pain on underside of penis where I don't have any Peyronie's plaque. My urologist said this pain was a prostate issue (this was before I was diagnosed). So I'm hoping if the surgeons are able to spare the nerves I'll be able to have some sort of sex life again. I've also found another local doctor who does about 5 a week and his team has done over 700. He says they are the only ones locally who use a 2 physician team approach and they spend a lot of time \"working on the nerve bundles to maximize erectile function\"...sounds good to me..",
