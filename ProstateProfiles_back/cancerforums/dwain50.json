    "Content": "I had robotic surgery to remove my prostrate 2 years ago and radiation 1-1/2 years ago. PSA was .20 after surgery , was .35 after radiation . Sept. of 2015 PSA was .71, March of 2016 PSA was .83 and this Sept. 2016 PSA is 1.22 . I will meet with my doctor in a couple of weeks to discuss further treatment. I guess I am asking what I might expect for treatments . I know there are a lot of people more serious but like everyone its the fear of the unknown. THANK YOU.",
