      "Content": "Hi! New to this forum and I hope I`m posting correctly. I`m now 69. When the prostate cancer was originally diagnosed in 2010, psa was 1.8; then from doing a biopsy, was small fraction of 1 of 12 samples. Agreed that just needed watching with doing a PSA every 6 months and was put on avadart med. Over next 4 years psa results continued to show 2 - 5.3. Had a couple more biopsies in there, basically showing samething as original. Jan/16 psa 10.6 May/16 psa 11.8 biopsy Gleason 3+4=7 At that time Urologist said time to start thinking about doing something about this. He referred me to a radiation oncologist at the Credit Valley Cancer Centre to look at doing radiation. The radiation oncologist referred me to the cancer centre at Sunnybrook (east side of Toronto) about doing the Brachytherapy. When the doc. there reviewed my report, he said no way was I a candidate for the brachytherapy because of my medical history and meds I take especially (at that time the methotrexate 25mg/ml injection once per week) He said I would endup with burning side effects . In June, 2015 was diagnosed with Rheumatoid Arthritis. At that time put on the Methetrexate 25mg. Bit more history here: back in 1976/77 had two back operations; I was 26/27 at the time. The 2nd surgery and care over years through a neurosurgeon. In 1984 problem started again. Over next years through all kinds of therapy`s, meds, etc. Diagnosed with degenerative disk disease, facet joint degeneration and arachnoiditis. Meds: Statex 5 mg. x 5/day; msconten 30 mg 3x/day; Nortriptyline 10mg 1/day; Tylenol #4 1/day; Zopiclone 7.5ml 1/day Sept.20/16 PSA 19.6 Radiation Oncologist; said to do 40 treatments would be difficult to get through, was going to reduce to 20 and up the dosage, Would need to go off the methetrexate 2 weeks prior and stay off til 2 weeks after. Probably have side effects of continued burning. I was to see Urologist Sept. 27/16 to discuss having radiation or doing surgery. Morning of Sept. 27/16: early morning had abdominal pain, vommiting; this continued to get worse over morning. By early afternoon, my wife (retired r.n. for 38 yrs.) called ambulance; could see motteling in extremeties; skin was cold & clammy. At hospital; blood work was elevated and lactic acid over 500. As afternoon went on, no control over diarrhea (couldn`t change diapers & sheets fast enough) From tests/scans surgeon thought to do with bowel. He didn`t think would make it to morning if didn`t have surgery . He thought going in, may have to do Ileostomy. He couldn`t save any of the colon and had to do the Ileostomy. Just after getting me setup in O.R. I had cardiac arest (I was out at this point and had no idea what going on) Spent 5 days in ICU and total of 3 weeks in hospital. They had sent in pathology reports, but they came back not revealing specific information as to what caused this. Prostate; everything put on hold re radiation. Oct/16 Rheumatologist took me off the methotrexate. Now take APO-hydroxyquine 200mg 2x/day. Dec. 8/16 psa 21 saw Urologist. He referred me to another Urologist for his opinion. Saw him couple weeks ago. Neither Urologist want to do surgery, given what happened in Sept./16. The 2nd urologist suggested doing a TURP; then do the radiation treatment. The water works is very slow, but not having any burning, anything like that. To me I would prefer not to have the TURP from what I`ve read about it. I`ll be having another psa test Mar.20 and see radiation oncologist Mar. 27 to discuss radiation with now having the Ileostomy. I`ve searched the internet trying to find any information about having prostate radiation with having an Ileostomy. At end of Mar./17 (6 mons. after surgery) surgeon will test to see if can reverse the Ileostomy, provided able to do that at that time. Does anyone know if there is chance that damage could be done from the radiation that would affect the reversal. I hope this hasn`t been too long winded; wasn`t sure of how much info. to give. Thank-you Lloyd",

      "Content": "Hi! Hi! Back on Monday, I saw the radiation oncologist. If I had the prostate cancer and no other serious problems wouldn`t be a concern of doing radiation, in my case. Now with having an ileostomy, she said it`s going to be difficult; not so much in doing the actual radiation, but the side effects, that could be long term. With having to empty pouch 10-15 times a day now (I empty when gets about 1/3 full, to help stop leaks and/or whenever go out, always makesure it`s empty). She said with radiation could endup in bathroom 25-30 times/day. Is that quality of life. Plus there will likely be sufficient damage to rectum area, that any chance of reversal is off the table. She is leaning towards doing hormone therapy; less side effects. do one injection; this doesn`t cure the cancer, but slows it down for 4-5 years. The docs continue to follow with 6 mon. psa/review. In meantime, she (like urologist) is concerned with psa numbers doubled in last year and if it has got outside the prostate. Scheduling a ct scan and bone scan to check. Then have another appointment with her. Yesterday I ended up at er. About 4 a.m.; started being sick, nothing coming through ileostomy. Couldn`t keep anything down and was getting very dehydrated. (I am constantly thirsty) Plus not able to take my regular meds that I need to take some every 3 hrs. About 8 a/m. my wife said this is enough, going to er, she called ambulance. They did blood tests at beginning; then er doc decided to do ct scan, said there might be chance of scar tissue blockage (had read somewhere this can happen). As you know at er`s takes time for all this to happen. By mid-afternoon, put me on i.v. for my meds and some fluid. By later afternoon, the ileostomy started working and nausea settled down. The scan didn`t show any serious blockage. They then gave me some more i.v. fluid and start sipping fluid to makesure staying down. Back home later in evening. I suppose just one of those things with an ileostomy Take care Lloyd",

      "Content": "Hi! Chuck & Delta, thank-you for your replies. I suppose I'm trying to pre-guess what options the radiation oncologist may say, so I have some knowledge of what the procedure is with radiation, while having an Ileostomy. Ie: would the Ileostomy equipment need to be removed for each treatment. If this were the case, given my limited experience having a stoma with Ileostomy, would need to stop eating 12 hours before treatment. Then there's still no guarantee it wouldn't run during treatment. Maybe I'm worrying too much about this, until I speak with her. Going by what she told me, prior to my having the Ileostomy, has me concerned. Granted at that time (as mentioned earlier) I was on methotrexate for rheumatoid arthritis. Now I'm not; now on different med. As far as the reversal of the Ileostomy; according to what surgeon told us, about 3 inches of the colon & about 6 inches of rectum were left. They will re-attach the ilium (small intestine) to the colon. This is all up in the air, depending on whether the sphincter are working properly. As this surgeon said (saw him beginning of Jan. & again beginning April) do what need to do for the prostate cancer, then we'll deal with the Ileostomy.",

      "Content": "Hi! Thanks for your reply Michael. I've been seeing a cardiologist over past year; once Spring/2016 - had stress test,etc. All okay. Then again saw him just after my surgery & cardiac arrest in Oct. didn't do stress test at that time, but had ecg. According to cardiologist heart is fine to have more surgery. Actually I'm supposed to be calling his office now, for 6 mon. check. He thinks the cardiac arrest was result of being totally septic at that time. I've since heard from radiation oncologist office, ct scan April 6th; bone scan April 11th, then have appointment with RO April 18th to discuss results. She's doing these to check to see if ca has moved out of prostate. As mentioned earlier, she's leaning towards hormone therapy. From what I have read at Prostate Cancer Canada site, brochure basic information; hormone therapy is used if the ca has moved outside prostate. Take care Lloyd",
