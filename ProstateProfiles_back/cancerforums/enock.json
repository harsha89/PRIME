Along with the size of my prostate (225 grams), this made for a lengthy, ten hour surgery with an additional incision for another doctor to come in and assist. However, my recovery was uneventful and overall I am pleased with the surgery. I should add that my overall health was reasonably good going in. My suggestion would be to consult with a top notch prostate surgery specialist who has done many hundreds is not thousands of these procedures. Your urologist's reluctance may be because of a lack of experience. Do you have other health conditions which may impact your decision? Eric",

I can hold a fair amount in my bladder but when I start to leak quite a bit instead of the little dribble I go pee, usually a fair amount. I have asked the same question you did about not feeling the urge to pee here a couple of times but no one has ever answered so I guess no one else has experienced this. I asked my doctor about it and he said some of the nerves may have been injured but they should heal up. So far I still don't feel a real urge to pee. That's all I know about that. I had my prostate removed on October 2, 2017. Like you, for some time I did not feel to urge to pee. My guess it is a function of the fact that you are constantly leaking so that your bladder never fills to the point that triggers the urge, and also the fact that the whole area gets pretty beat up as a result of the surgery. For me, as I healed up, I gradually regained continence and the urge to pee. The trick is to stay patient. Eric",

I had my prostate removed on October 2, 2017. Like you, for some time I did not feel to urge to pee. My guess it is a function of the fact that you are constantly leaking so that your bladder never fills to the point that triggers the urge, and also the fact that the whole area gets pretty beat up as a result of the surgery. For me, as I healed up, I gradually regained continence and the urge to pee. The trick is to stay patient. Eric",

      "Content": "Hi Busby, welcome to the forum. As far as pain goes, everyone is different. My doctor perscribed four days worth of painkillers. I stopped after two and switched to over the counter for a couple of days more. You, however, should do whatever is necessary for yourself. If you need the pills take them until you don't need them anymore. The thing that helped me the most with pain was getting up and walking. It got the blood flowing and helped stretch out the sore muscles. You probably should try to have someone stay with you for the first couple of days after you get home from the hospital. I was pretty out of it for a couple of days. Remember you won't be able to drive while on the painkillers and you can't lift much for a while. As far as the catheter and bag, it is not difficult. Just follow the cleaning instructions to the letter. The worst part of the catheter is the pain and soreness where it moves around at the tip of the penis. The lidocaine helps a lot, and what really helps is getting it out. Good luck, you'll get through it fine. Eric",

In my case, like you, I seemed to be leaking constantly, going through six or seven heavy duty pull ups a day. Gradually, however, it seemed to be less and less, and at the three month point there had accumulated a lot of improvement. I think I was down to a couple of pull-ups a day. I continued to mprove and at about six months switched to a light pad every day. I am now more than a year post surgery and I still use the pad. I still drip and dribble a little, mostly when I sneeze and cough, but I am satisfied where I am. It is important to do the kegels, and it may be helpful to avoid caffeine and alcohol. I also found that if I frequently emptied my bladder, that decreased the need to change pull-ups. Wherever I went, I always carried a bag with pull-ups, some wipes and anything else I thought I'd need. Another thing you can do when you are away from home is to use a booster pad inside your pull-ups or diapers. This way after a while you can discard the pad without changing undergarment. The main thing is not to worry. You will be dry or next to dry before you know it, and you will manage things up until then. Eric",

      "Content": "Hi Mlock, Welcome to the forum and thank you for posting your journey so far. A lot of what you said resonated with me. I too am very fortunate to have a partner of 35 years that I can depend upon. However I am so used to trying to be the strong one, that I hesitate to tell her bad news because I don't want to worry her. There is a lot to get through emotionally with a cancer diagnosis. Good luck with the surgery. With a great team on your side, I am sure you will come through with flying colors. Eric",
