      "Content": "Hi all, I have been reading for a few days and am finally posting. Thanks to all in advance for advice as I am very grateful. I just turned 50 and went in for a checkup with my primary care physician because I had been experiencing what I would consider mild to moderate bph symptoms. I have them all. But no pain, more of an irritant than anything really. He performed a dre and I gave blood for psa test, my first ever. Next day, get call... Psa is 77.1 Dr request me to come back in next day for another psa test, puts me on antibiotics and makes appt. with urologist that same day. Go to urologist and he recommends a biopsy the next day, I go do that the next morning and have an appointment next Friday for the biopsy results. Got call today from pcp and second psa results was 71.9 and a free psa of 5.5 Okay, I know I have to wait on biopsy results.... But, what does it sound like so far? As many have expressed.... Waiting is pure torture!",
