    "Content": "Hi. Had robotic prostatectomy in January 2017. Following this, developed extreme discomfort/pain in rectal area. Called urologist to get renew Rx for pain. He said go to ER but having worked on ambulance, didn\u0092t want to do that-too much paranoia re:drug seekers. Finally got in to see family doc. He gave me antibiotic. First relief in pain but only lasted a few days. Finally got in to my regular doc and he prescribed procto-foam. After a course of that ,pain subsided but condition persists. Manifested by feeling of always needing to have bowel movement but nothing or tiny results. On internet found term \u0093tenesmus\u0094 which described problem exactly. Referred to surgeon to do endoscopy but instead, he told me I had levator syndrome. He did a massage of the levator muscle but hasn\u0092t helped. Going to go back to my regular doc to try to figure things out but just wondering if anyone else with rectal issues post-prostatectomy?",
