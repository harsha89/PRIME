      "Content": "Hi all, I am posting here because I'm really worried about my dad, age 68. He had a PSA reading of 23 and has gone for a biopsy awaiting results later this week. He does have a naturally large prostate which may partially account for the elevated number, but on manual examination the doctor felt a lump which is why he ordered the biopsy. In the meantime, he was sent for a bone scan and chest X-ray just in case. This morning, he called to tell me the chest X-ray was clear, but the bone scan showed a couple of \"spots\". The doctor said the spots could be caused by the elevated PSA itself (I have been reading and haven't heard of this?) the doctor wasn't worried and said they would redo the bone scan in 3 months time. My dad said the doc wasn't at all worried at this point especially since we don't have the biopsy results. I know spots on the bone scan can be caused by things other than cancer but can benign spots be directly caused by elevated PSA? I am wondering if my dad misunderstood what the doctor was saying. It just seems like high PSA plus lump on prostate plus bone spots is not a good coincidence. He has no history of bone trauma, no arthritis that he knows of (I guess it could be possible) and is not experiencing any pain whatsoever. I was already preparing myself for the idea that he has prostate cancer but until today I wasn't too worried because of how overall treatable it is. My understanding is if it's in his bones there is no cure? Needless to say I am a lot more worried today. Can anyone put my mind at ease? How likely is it that the spots on the bone scan are benign/irrelevant? We live in western Canada if that makes any difference. Thanks in advance, Ponyroller",

      "Content": "Yes, it occurred to me my dad might want to soften the blow, knowing that I'm going to worry regardless and not wanting to make it worse. Having said that, we do have a pretty honest and open relationship and I don't think he would tell me something that wasn't true. It is worth mentioning that my dad has significant overseas travel planned in the next couple of months and the specialist has repeatedly told him not to change or cancel his plans, so that is a good sign right?",

      "Content": "Hi all, I am posting here because I'm really worried about my dad, age 68. He had a PSA reading of 23 and has gone for a biopsy awaiting results later this week. He does have a naturally large prostate which may partially account for the elevated number, but on manual examination the doctor felt a lump which is why he ordered the biopsy. In the meantime, he was sent for a bone scan and chest X-ray just in case. This morning, he called to tell me the chest X-ray was clear, but the bone scan showed a couple of \"spots\". The doctor said the spots could be caused by the elevated PSA itself (I have been reading and haven't heard of this?) the doctor wasn't worried and said they would redo the bone scan in 3 months time. My dad said the doc wasn't at all worried at this point especially since we don't have the biopsy results. I know spots on the bone scan can be caused by things other than cancer but can benign spots be directly caused by elevated PSA? I am wondering if my dad misunderstood what the doctor was saying. It just seems like high PSA plus lump on prostate plus bone spots is not a good coincidence. He has no history of bone trauma, no arthritis that he knows of (I guess it could be possible) and is not experiencing any pain whatsoever. I was already preparing myself for the idea that he has prostate cancer but until today I wasn't too worried because of how overall treatable it is. My understanding is if it's in his bones there is no cure? Needless to say I am a lot more worried today. Can anyone put my mind at ease? How likely is it that the spots on the bone scan are benign/irrelevant? We live in western Canada if that makes any difference. Thanks in advance, Ponyroller",

      "Content": "Thank you. I do know he got regular screening but don't know what his PSA levels were before this one. Obviously never enough for his doctor to be concerned. So I am guessing this means it was caught early, correct? I am expecting that he has prostate cancer. The idea of bone mets is what really threw me for a loop. I have a diagnosed anxiety disorder which I take medication for, but I still struggle with worrying at the best of times let alone right now. So, even with the bone scan showing spots, there is still a reasonable chance he might not have bone mets? I assume if the doctor thought that's what they were that he would want to investigate further, not just do another scan in 3 months...but I'm obviously no expert so maybe what I assume is incorrect.",

      "Content": "Hi there - long time bladder infection sufferer here. Speaking from a woman's perspective just to throw that disclaimer in. Not a doctor, but have done years of research and tried everything under the sun - medical and natural. Cranberry pills absolutely work. They have a specific kind of sugar in them (D-mannose) which is not metabolized in digestion and ends up in the bladder. The bacteria that cause the infections bind to the sugar instead of binding to the bladder walls, because as we all know bacteria love sugar. Then you pee the whole thing out. I used to get infections every time I had sex. It was debilitating and affected my life constantly. I now take a cranberry pill every time and very rarely get infections. You can also buy the D-mannose by itself but it is more expensive and I find the cranberry works just as well.",
