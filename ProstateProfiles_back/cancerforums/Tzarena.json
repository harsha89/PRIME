      "Content": "Why is the Urologist waiting until November 27th to do a biopsy if he is concerned? A wait of 8 weeks is ridiculous. When he does the biopsy there is another delay to get the results. If it is cancer then there is a 6 to 8 week period that has to elapse before surgery can take place, if surgery is the recommended treatment. I suggest strongly that you do one of two things. Either ring back your present Urologist and ask for a much earlier appointment or go to another Urologist for a second opinion and early biopsy. Do not delay. My husband was diagnosed with Prostate cancer a few months ago and is now recovering very well. Pay attention to what Highlander said about the biopsy procedure! Best wishes, and Good Luck",
