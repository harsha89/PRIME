Recently, my PSA jumped from 2.4 to 4.1. I had a biopsy performed. From a brief conversation on the phone with the doctor, my results were a Gleason 3+3=6. I have read \u0093Dr. Patrick Walsh's*Guide to Surviving Prostate Cancer\u0094 which was valuable, though a bit overwhelming for me, too. I am leaning toward having the prostate removed, even with the incontinence and impotency possibilities, because just having cancer, even if non-aggressive, really worries me a lot now and especially how it might develop in the future. (I understand the Gleason number is not always accurate. Could be higher?!) But I know many think active surveillance is good option, too. I will schedule a follow up visit with the doctor soon. I welcome any advice or questions I should ask that are not obvious. Thanks!",
