      "Content": "Hello friends, I got a good PSA result from February. <0.008. Am now almost 1 year post Robotic Prostatectomy. The cancer had penetrated the capsule but looks like it may be contained within the surgical margins. Time will tell. I meet with the Urologist in May to work on my problems, ie incontinence and ED. I am probably headed for the urinary sphincter(AUS) and they have already suggested the double surgery with the implantable prosthesis for ED at the same time. They say the sling for incontinence just doesn't work as well as the AUS. I am all for the sphincter because I lose 200 ml a day, but I want to try the injections before I go for the implantable prosthesis. I tried the Vacuum pump and I don't have much success with getting it to work. Cialis gets a half mast erection with stimulation but when I lay down it gets soft. They suggest both surgeries at once to get the healing over with but I am hoping the ED will come around. Thanks for your thoughts. Jeb",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by 7Seas I found this on the web. http://www.harvardprostateknowledge....g-incontinence Good article. Interesting perspective for all the incontinent patients. I, too, had a lot of the feelings of depression that these guys had. From my urologist's point of view, this patient was not a candidate for the sling because he was using 5-6 pads/day. From Papa's perspective, the bulking agent might be the thing to try first, since he has a very small incontinence problem. I had that done without success but it was very simple and not painful at all. With my 1-3 pads/day and passing the uro-studies, we decided to try the Advance Sling and it has been successful so far. If that didn't work, I would definitely have gone to the Artificial Urinary Sphincter. I always felt left behind comparing myself to the large group of guys that seemed to get over their incontinence from robotic prostatectomy. It just happens to some of us. Jeb",

      "Content": "Hello Poppa, I had robotic prostate removal surgery 2 years ago and got the incontinence bug. I lost from 100-200 ml of urine a day into pads. Incontinence sucks. Last summer I received the Advance sling. I was in the gray area as far as whether to get the Sling or the AUS (Artificial Urinary Sphincter- this is what Chuck is describing). The AUS is for worse cases of incontinence and the Sling for the milder forms. That would definitely put you up for a consideration of an Advance Sling based on leakage.The reason I opted for a try of the sling because over your lifetime and mine, an Artificial Urinary Sphincter would need 2 - 3 revisions. The AUS puts a collar on the urethra 24 hours a day, 7 days a week and keeps urine from leaking until you push down on the valve which is implanted in the scrotum to release the collar and let urine flow. The reason for further revisions (ie operations) is that the pressure on the urethra eventually causes atrophy of the urethra and thus leakage. The collar needs to be moved. The Advance Sling puts a \"kink\" in the urethra so that to urinate you have to increase pressure in the bladder to overcome the kink and then you can urinate. When the pressure is reduced from the empty bladder, the \"kink\" keeps the urethra closed to urine flow fromabove. At least that is the way I understand it. I figure I would try the Sling first. Did it work? Yes, very well for me. I don't leak. I have had only 2 real accidents when I drank tea and coffee and went for a 1 1/2 hr walk and I guess so much bladder pressure overcame the kink. The other time, I forgot to empty my bladder before my walk. Before the Advance Sling, I would walk for 90 minutes and could not retain a drop of urine. All ended up in my pads. Major change in life for me now. I am sorry to hear the urologist said slings commonly fail after 3 years. I hope that is not the case. I will tell you that I was referred by my prostate surgeon to another urologist(Dr. Williams) in his practice that did the Sling and the AUS for their practice. The Uro prostate surgeon had given up on the sling and was recommending the AUS for me. Dr. Williams disagreed with his referring partner and said that he had excellent results after doing pressure tests and a few others to see if I was a candidate. He said he would do the AUS on me if I wanted but he thought I would have success with the sling which might include a spurt or two a day. I have none at all except for the 2 I mentioned. I think Kegels are important to keep the pelvic floor as strong as possible. He catheterized me to see how strong my kegels were and they passed. I also think I can't gain a lot of abdominal weight which would put more pressure on the kink in the urethra. That said, I am very happy with my Advance Sling. If you decided on a sling, be sure the surgeon has a good success rate and has done a lot of them. Dr. Williams was very proud of his success rate and protective of it. I had to be very careful for 12 weeks after the surgery to make sure the sling had healed and anchored in place. If I pulled it loose, he said he would not be able to get it back in place. The inactivity was the hardest thing about the surgery. I only took 4 Vicodin postop even though the incision was from a half inch from my rectum forward to an inch up my scrotum. Sounds worse than it was. I live in Tyler, Texas if you want Dr. Williams number. Let me know. Good luck to you. I can empathize with your irritation with your incontinence. You are in the very mild category but it is still sucks. Jeb",

      "Content": "Hello all, I received good news on my PSA: <.008 at my 8 month postop visit. Really happy with that. My urologist discussed the other issues with this, ie incontinence and ED. On the Incontinence: I started in July weighing my pads and calculating urine loss/day. Not much change since July. I lose 100-200 cc a day. Depends on whether I walk my 4 miles or not. He said I fall in the moderate range and that we should begin the discussion on what would be next if I don't stop leaking by 12 months. He told me 3 things to consider: 1) Injection of a collagen like substance (not collagen, I can't remember what) around the valve to beef it up and help it close. 2) Male Pelvic Sling 3) Artificial Urinary Sphincter I am leaning toward 1) at first. Anybody have experience with this? He said the sling doesn't work as good in males. I will go for the AUS if I need to. I am sick of the pads. On the ED front, I get to half mast on the pills but not enough for the act. We talked about the vacuum device and Trimix and urethral suppositories. He also said I could consider a double operation of the AUS and the implantable Penile Implant. Another guy in his office is the guru on this operation. He said we are only starting this discussion and to begin to think about what is next. I have another PSA in 3 months and my next office visit is 6 months. Anyway, I trust my Urologist but patience sure is needed with this disease. Thanks for all of your input, Jeb",

I know there are other recommendations on the frequency, etc. I am pretty dedicated with this. Kept up with the leakage with a food scale for 3 months and then stopped. I am starting back again and there is not much change. I need this info to give to my urologist. He told me if the incontinence didn't go away after a year, that it probably wouldn't. Obviously Chuck has some different information. I will definitely try the injections for ED. It is hard to know what to do. I am going to retire in May and would like to solve some of these issues. The first and most important is the PSA next Monday. Thanks again, guys. Jeb",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by Johnm1 I'm ~15 months post radical robotic prostatectomy (Da Vinci) and still have both, stress and urgency incontinence. I've tried \"all\" of the medications for the urgency (and they were too expensive anyway). I've done the kegels and even tried reducing my intake of fluids. I go through 1-4 large pads a day, not soaked but quite uncomfortable to wear (and they leak if I let them go too long). The dr said I'm a good candidate for the AdVance male urinary sling surgery and says that it \"should\" get me back to where I was pre-sugery when I only had urinary urgency but no leakage and I could hold it until I got to a bathroom. I say the dr said \"should\" because he also said he makes no guarantees ... which I understand. I've changed my life because of this - I don't go on long walks with my wife because I can't hold back the urgency. I no longer go on Boy Scouts camp outs or other outings with my 2 boys and I have to be careful where I go, making sure I don't intake too many fluids and I always carry a spare pad in my back pocket. Has anyone had this surgery and what should I expect? Thanks, John Hi John, I can understand your feelings about the incontinence. It drove me crazy. I had the Advance Sling. It worked for me. I used 2-3 pads per day, leaking somewhere between 150-250 ml/day. He said I was on the borderline between needing a Artificial Urinary Sphincter and an Advance Sling. He would test me before he could recommend the sling. I posted about this a year or so ago in detail and would recommend you reading it. He tested my ability to do a kegel with a scope visualization of my bladder sphincter, did some other tests and pronounced me to be a candidate. Now he was the urologist in a group practice that did the incontinence surgeries, both the Sling and AUS. I was referred to him by my urologist in that practice that did the robotic prostatectomy on me. My original surgeon did not recommend the sling as he felt that the results were not reliable enough to recommend going through all that. However the incontinence surgery doctor disagreed and said that due to his screening his surgeries were very reliable and he was sorry his colleague disagreed with him......He said he would do the Artificial Urinary Sphincter if I wanted but expected to have to replace it 2 more times in my lifetime. Well I was willing to try and I am glad I did. I wear no pads. Peeing in the commode takes a while because I must do kegels to get all of the urine out or it will leak a little but I have no problem walking 4 miles or playing golf or anything. If I wait to long to pee (3 or 4 hours- hard to say) and the pressure builds and I squat without tightening my abdominal floor (kegellike) I might squirt a ml or 2. I am very grateful to Dr. Clay Williams in Tyler Texas for his placing the sling in me. The day of surgery he told me he thought he was going to hit a home run and he did. He is good at it. I recommend him and I think skill,experience, and success rate is the key Good luck with your decision and going forward and I hope you can solve your incontinence. Jeb",

      "Content": "Hello everyone, I posted earlier about my surgery with the Advance Sling for my incontinence. I had my 8 week post op visit and release this week. I still have a great outcome. In 8 weeks, only a couple of spurts (maybe 5). They usually occur when I have an urge to urinate and do not answer the call. I think the bladder overcomes the resistance I now have due to the sling. I was told in 4 more weeks I can do anything I want and that I can start to exercise slowly. I have walked 3 miles 4 times and had one 2 or 3 cc spurt ( a vast difference to the 90-150cc I usually have in a depends undergarment). So, I asked my surgeon what criteria did you use to decide that I was a candidate for a sling. As I mentioned, my robotic prostate cancer surgeon (who is the most respected in his practice and probably in town as you can see by the number of physicians that use him) sent me to Dr. Williams (his partner, the sling surgeon). He said I would get an Artificial Urinary Sphincter from Dr. Williams. I asked him why he didn't mention the sling as he had done before. He said that he felt that the results were too variable with the sling. When I visited with Dr. Williams, he said I might be a candidate for the sling but that he would put in the AUS if I insisted. He said that I would probably get 2-3 revisions of the AUS in my lifetime. He said he needed do several things to evaluate my chance of the sling: They were: 1) Leakage per day : I leaked on average 100-200 ml/day (in the moderate gray area: better if I was less but still a possibility) 2) Cysto: He did a cysto and had me do a kegel to see if I still had the ability to close my sphincter. He said I still needed a functioning sphincter and I evidently passed this with a strong contraction (lots of Kegel experience). 3) Urodynamics: Tests ability to empty bladder and fill levels that prompt the urge to urinate. His recommendation was that the sling should work and he expected a \"home run\" : dry or a small spurt . I welcomed the chance to avoid future surgeries and went for it. What was also said in a veiled way was that Dr. Williams believes the skill of the surgeon is paramount. 2 other surgeons in his office (my robotic prostate urologist and one other) have given up on the sling. Williams believes his experience and selection criteria gives him a high rate of success. I am glad I chose it and am incredibly grateful for the outcome. So choose your surgeon carefully if you get a sling. I will be doing Kegels from here on happily. Good luck to you all, Jeb",

      "Content": "Chuck, Aloysus, MP, and Newporter, Thanks for your responses. Glad to contribute to a very kind, supportive, and helpful forum. Aloysus: I would think your large prostate does contribute to your slight incontinence. Mine was 50 gm. All are individuals, I think. I believe Chuck had a large prostate and no trouble with incontinence. Go figure. MF: As to my sling surgery particulars: The surgery required a catheter for 2 days after because I could not void in the recovery room. The urologist said that could happen as some patients cant figure out how to pee at first. I figured it out after the catheter was removed. 2 days with a catheter isn't bad compared to the 10 days after robotic prostatectomy. The surgery was a little painful but not seriously painful. The incision was 1/4 \" away from my anus midline to an inch up the back of my scrotum. Sounds gruesome but I only took 4 Norco 7.5 mg tablets post op. I controlled the pain with Tylenol after that. I didn't want to get constipated so I tried to avoid the opiate narcotics if I could help it. Norco is an opiate with hydrocodone in it. I took the stool softener Docusate Sodium 100mg twice a day to help with the bm's. I really didn't want to strain that midline incision. A toilet extension helped me avoid squatting on the commode which also would have strained the midline incision. I sat on a donut for about 4 weeks which helped. Pain came mainly when I moved, as sitting still was not an issue with pain. I did have a weird hypersensitive scrotum for a while when the shower hit my scrotum. Also the anti Tom Brady syndrome: my balls were overinflated. All have resolved and gotten better over time with still a little sensitivity at 10 months. I did also have 2 additional holes punched in the top part of the groin where the surgeon grabbed the tape and secured it to the muscle. One side is still a little sore, but I figure it will go away with time. The hardest part for me was the mandate for inactivity for 8 weeks: The urologist told me I couldn't lift over the weight of a milk carton, squat, or walk over 1 or so miles. I also had to keep my knees together when I got in and out of a car and bed. The sling needs to scar into place to become permanent and pulling it loose would be \"hell to fix and probably couldn't be\". Quite the motivator especially after it worked. At the 8 week visit, my MD said to slowly start exercising and that at 12 weeks, I could do anything I wanted to. 2 weeks to go and still dry. I am on Medicare and it paid. I will be working on the ED issue next (Viagra works somewhat but not enough) and a PSA in December. Best of luck to you all, Jeb",

      "Content": "Hello everyone, My ED has not responded well enough to Viagra, Cialis, Muse or the Pump (actually I dont like the pump) so I decided to try Trimix. Viagra works for a short time standing or sitting but not lying down. My urologist gave me 0.20 ml which he said was one-half the standard dose. 3 1/2 hours later he had to stick a needle in the side of my penis to draw out blood to deflate the dude. The deflation worked and I waddled out of the office having second thoughts about Trimix. Got pretty painful in the last 2 hours. He said he has never had anyone with this problem at this dose (my mother always said I was special) and that if I want to try it again we would start with 0.05ml. There is definitely a lot of power there but I guess we need to get the correct dose. Jebstart",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by SeaCock You referring to pain from the needle or the mixture? I'm not sure but the first few times I used the Gel it hurt. My guess is partly because I'd not had a full erection in a while, because it get much less painful after you used it a few times. We are active at least once a weekend since I got the gel. So \"he\" is seeing some regular action. I think the pain of the mixture is what is bothering me and the fact that I got too much that gave me a priapism. Nice to know that it gets less painful.

The reason (I think) that we may not do radiation is that he said that it is possible it was small enough outside the prostate to be burned away by cautery to the area. I guess the PSA will tell but the paper he had me read seems to give better survival if radiation is immediate (ie 4 1/2 months according to the paper, 6 months per my urologist so that I can heal completely) even if the PSA is 0 instead of waiting until the PSA goes up. I think this is called adjuvant radiation versus salvage radiation when the PSA goes up. I think he was wanting to consider my colon situation in the decision to radiate as you suggest. I am not sure of this. I did not know of Gleason 6 not living outside of the prostate immediate area. That would tend to make me want to do radiation and risk the side effects.

      "Content": "Originally Posted by oshguy I had my annual checkup at the Cleveland Clinic on Thursday and discussed my continuing incontinence with my surgeon. I explained to him that I'm mostly dry, but after standing for 15-20 minutes or more, leaning forward for more than 30 seconds or so, lifting heavy items, etc., I start to leak slightly. I can feel it coming on, and nothing I do seems to be able to stop it. I've Kegeled more, less, none at all, and no frequency seems to help. The total volume of urine that I leak in a 24 hour period is usually actually quite small, anywhere from 5-6 ml to a maximum of 20 ml. While that doesn't seem like a lot, it can be bothersome. My surgeon suggests that I have a mesh sling implanted, as it is likely that my incontinence will not improve at this point. He all but guaranteed that I would be very happy with the result. That sounds good, but the thought of recovering from a gash right behind my scrotum is not very appealing. Has anyone here had this done? If so, how painful was the recovery period? Side effects? Was it successful? As my surgeon pointed out, there is no rush to do this, so I can take all the time I want to reach a decision whether to undergo the procedure or not. On the plus side, he considers the surgery a success and thinks that the cancer is permanently gone. And my erections are as good as pre-surgery, which is a testament to his nerve-sparing skill. Hello friend, I had the sling and it changed my life . Was leaking 100-200 ml per day and my urologist said I was on the borderline for the sling or the AUS. He thought it would work for me because he said he was good at it in contrast to the other urologists in his practice that quit doing it due to mixed results. I threw the pads away and am doing great. My thoughts on your situation: 1. With your small leakage, a competent urologist who is good at the sling surgery should have no problem solving your incontinence. I used Clay Williams at Urology, Tyler in Tyler, Texas. He did several pressure tests to see if I fit the criteria and took a look with a uroscope at my bladder valve. Be sure you get someone who is competent in this. Ask for results. 2. Surgery: I didn't look at it on You-Tube to see what was being done to me. The surgeon didnt need my help. We discussed it , he gave me a prescription for 30 Vicodin and I took 4 after the surgery. Wasn't that bad. 3. Post op Restrictions: THe hardest part. Couldn't lift more than a carton of milk, couldn't exerecise, etc. Was restricted for 12 weeks with the admonition that if I pulled the mesh loose, he probably wouldn't be able to get it back to where I would be continent again. A great motivator. 4.. For you and my 2 cents worth, it seems like a decision between can I put up with a \"relatively\" small leakage(I know any leakage is not small for any of us) or do I want to go through the surgery. I hope the best for you with your decision and your future. Jebstart",

It comes a syringe too...real skinny, but I use 5 units and it's like being a teenager again! It's starting to last a little too long so I really need to scale back the dosage. Viagra does work now...last weekend used 50mg and did very well...even good response the next morning. Not quite usable, but very close... Congrats on being able to get back in the saddle again! Thanks for your comment. Sounds like the Trimix Gel should be very popular. This deal seems to be all about the dosage. My injection really hurt a lot in its last 2 hours. I don't know if it was the alprostidil or just the priapism thing. Viagra definitely makes a difference for me but just not enough to play in the major leagues. Jebstart",

      "Content": "Brave, I know it is heresy on this board and thread, but maybe you should return to more kegels. I discussed the small amount of kegels given by good sources on this board with my physician and he and the others in his urology practice recommend what you were doing before you reduced them. Obviously different opinions throughout the country. Hard to argue with Chuck's Mayo Clinic. In my case, I am four months post robotic prostatectomy and with exercise, I cannot remain continent. Sitting or lying down or getting up from sitting and walking a short while , I can retain urine. I walk for my exercise instead of running like you but retain nothing. I hope you get it back.

My urologist wants me to get to 50 kegels per day and that is what I do. I stopped for about 10 days and went with the 7- 10 at bedtime recommended on this forum and saw no difference so I felt like I needed to follow my own urologist's advice and go back to 40-50 kegels per day. I may be slow..ly improving but not much. I think a lot of folks here were going to be fortunate and be continent early no matter what. It is dependent on a lot of things beside kegels like anatomy, surgeon's skill, size of prostate removed,etc. I was told I had an extra middle lobe of my prostate that was extending into my bladder. My urologist said he got a good water seal on the sphincter but who knows, it may be weak because I never used it. There is no way that you should get really discouraged 5 weeks after your surgery. Most people get continence eventually and I bet you will be the same. I well know it is damn frustrating! Hang in there and good luck, Jebstart",

We have a lot of people that come to Tyler to get this surgery from a urologist in my urologist's group practice. I wonder how long the implants last? Did you ever get any kind of erection? When sitting or standing I get to a little above horizontal, but when I lie down, its gone. I am 10 months post robotic prostatectomy. Good luck to you and keep us posted with your experience.

      "Content": "Greywolf, I hear the satisfaction rate is pretty high for this. My Urologist is telling me to consider the implant surgery in combination with the AUS if I get another good PSA. We have a lot of people that come to Tyler to get this surgery from a urologist in my urologist's group practice. I wonder how long the implants last? Did you ever get any kind of erection? When sitting or standing I get to a little above horizontal, but when I lie down, its gone. I am 10 months post robotic prostatectomy. Good luck to you and keep us posted with your experience.
