      "Content": "Hello All. My husband was recently diagnosed with prostate cancer (roughly six months ago). He is 46 with a Gleason 3 + 4 of 7. We were originally anticipating robotic Davinici surgery. However, we were now introduced to Dr. Dattoli and the Dattoli Cancer center for radiation therapy. Can anyone PLEASE share their experiences, if any. We need to make a decision quite urgently. Thank you so much in advance.",

      "Content": "Yes I'm sorry to have joined to club too. May I ask how your husbands are doing with ED and incontinence post surgery? It is really such a hard decision. The MAIN FACTOR is we have to choose a treatment plan that minimizes recurrence. Second are the nasty side effects of surgery. One of our Doctors told that surgery actually INCREASES a man's chances of the cancer recurring as the microscopic cancer cells are then mixed in with the blood during surgery.... Help. I fell like I'm sinking.",
