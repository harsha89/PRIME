      "Content": "Hi, my boyfriend was just recently diagnosed. He's going for his first surgery consultation on friday. I realise this is an extremely personal thing for a guy but I'm concerned. He's refusing to even acknowledge to his family that anything is wrong. He's not going to tell any of them about the surgery until after he has it. He's convinced himself that this is going to be ok, just a little operation and things will be fine. But he's so tense lately that I think inside he's really having a hard time with this. My first thought was to let someone in his family know. But I debate doing that with myself because if I do he may think I betrayed his confidence and went behind his back. He says he doesn't want anyone to worry. I don't know what to do. They should know and he will need their help. But how do I tell him that without making him angry? I feel caught between a rock and a hard place and all I want to do is help him. Any suggestions please let me know. Thanks Hope",

      "Content": "Hi, thank you so much for answering. He's being very private about the whole thing. I can tell you that he's 58, in good health otherwise and prides himself on being so. He had a routine physical for his insurance and they told him his PSA reading was too high. From there he was referred for a check with a urologist and he's had a biopsy. I don't know the percents or numbers. He just recently went for two tests, one was a barium test, he had to drink it and then xrays were done, a few hours later they did a test using dye that was put into him by IV and xrays again. He doesn't like to talk about it, I know he's scared to death. He's been tense as can be but he's trying to keep everyone else from worrying. He has 3 grown children and a brother, sister and mother who live not far away. But I guess no one will realize anything until after the surgery. After the PSA test he was saying things like \"oh this friend had higher numbers and it was nothing\". With each test or result he's brushed it off as much as possible. If I try to talk about it with him too much I get, \"this is my problem, I don't want to put it on you\". I'm walking a very fine line because if I try to ask too much he shuts me out an I don't want to make him angry. My whole wish is to help him if I can or be there for him. He doesn't see that by burying it or hiding it, he's only making people who love him feel worse. And I don't see how it helps him to go through it alone like that. I will try to find out results, I'm really worried that its bad and he's not telling me. Anyway, thank you so much for your answer. It helps to have people to talk to about this. Hope",

He read a flyer and he's asked friends who have had some problems but he doesn't know anyone who's actually been through the surgery. I suggested he make a list of questions to ask the doctor on Friday. It's easy to get involved in talking or other things and forget to ask something. He won't do chemo for personal reasons, his father went through it. But his doctor did tell him the surgery would take care of the cancer. He said something about hormones afterward. Is that normal? I know he's scared and confused with all the numbers being talked about and he's not remembering it all that well. At least he's talking to me more about it now and going to let me be involved. But in a way its like the blind leading the blind, I don't know much at all about what to ask the doctor. This forum has been so much help. You have no idea. Hope",

      "Content": "Thank you so much, both of you, I did manage to get him to talk some which I have to tell you is a big step for him. I had a few questions based on what he told me. And based on the fact that he admitted all the numbers and things are confusing to him he's agreed to let me be more involved. Thank God!!! Ok what he does remember is that the Gleason score was a 4.5. I don't know if that's good or bad. He also says that based on the tests that were just done the doctor says its confined to the prostate and feels that removing it will remove all the cancer. I hope this is true. I asked him if he chose the surgery or the doctor recommended it. He said he won't do any chemo. His father died of pancreatic cancer and he went through all of that with him and he refuses to even consider it. So surgery it is, but he's only read a brochure on what to expect, he meets with the doctor on friday. All he really knows is he'll have a catheter. He says, \"the brochure said it was a quick recovery.\" I don't know what to expect really anymore than he does but quick can be a relative term. I just don't think its going to be as easy as he thinks. The other question I have is this. He had his biopsy on 7/1 and they told him he could have bleeding on urinating or ejaculation. He hasn't had any on urinating but he's still having bleeding when he ejaculates. It's been awhile, shouldn't that have stopped by now? Is that an indication of anything further wrong? Hope",
