      "Content": "Thanks to all of you who took the time and time to reassure me. Generally I'm in great spirits and very positive, but there have been a few days..... Anyway, I'm anxious to get to the other side and to full recovery. When the surgeon asked me when to schedule, I told him if he had a pair of pliers and some scissors he could start right away. He declined. (Probably didn't have pliers.) Anyway, thanks again. You have all added to my optimism and I'll be happy to follow up and hopefully add to the wonderful encouragement to others you have given me.",

      "Content": "As a recent member of the forum, I wonder how many of us are, or were, in the same boat as I am. I want to make it absolutely clear I am not looking to pace blame anywhere. I had been asking my family Dr for two years about doing a PSA. He told me that conventional thinking about PSA's had changed; that they raised so many \"false positives\" that the thinking was now to wait until there were symptoms. (This was confirmed by a family friend, a urological surgeon with 50 yrs experience.)He did do a DRE and said everything felt as it should. My first PSA was run completely by accident. When doing pre-op lab work for shoulder surgery the lab ran a PSA without being directed to. That came back elevated; a second PSA blood test was taken which also came back elevated which led to the biopsy and diagnosis. My point is that had I waited till I was symptomatic, it may well have been too late to hope for a positive outcome. Should the collective\"we\" be pressing for some sort of diagnostic test that is more dependable that the PSA or DRE? God Bless all of the other various cancer groups pushing for $$$$, but I have been astounded by many men I know have come forward to me saying they have gone through various forms of prostate cancer. Two men I know lost their battle with the disease. And that's just in our little town. This is certainly a common condition, and one which will kill if treatment is left too late. If a PSA is not considered reliable enough, why isn't an alternative test or screening procedure being developed? If one is, how can we support it?",
