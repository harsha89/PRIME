      "Content": "My Dad had surgery about 2.5 years ago for prostate cancer that had a Gleason score of 8 and a PSA of 22. His PSA started rising soon after surgery and he's been on hormones ever since. He currently went from a PSA of 1.6 to 6 in only 3 months. He's now hormone resistant which I know is very bad news. I'm not sure his doctor has really explained what this means, and from what I have found, life expectancy is only 19 months (obviously each case varies but it seems the time left isn't much). Even with new treatments it seems that his life only extends by months. I know it's a heavy request, but if anyone has any experience with late stage cancer progression, I'd appreciate some ideas of what to expect. I read that it often spreads to the bones first. Will he be in a lot of pain? How do bone tumors ultimately cause death? What are the best ways to help him deal with this? I just need to know what to expect so I can deal with this and know how to help him best. We will still seek out any feasible treatment options so I'm definitely open to any new clinical trials, but at the same time, I feel like doctors don't help prepare for the inevitable at this point either, and this is what I need help with. Thanks.",

      "Content": "Thank you all for your responses. We definitely will still be looking into any treatment options that are available, but I was really disheartened when I read that the average survival after hormone resistance is only 19 months. And it seems that my dad's is a very fast growing cancer. I'll try to provide as much information as I can, but he often doesn't remember all the details. He's now 66 and was diagnosed about 2.5 years ago. He had a Gleason score of 8 and a PSA of 22. The surgeon didn't really want to do surgery because the tumor was so large, but that's what he ended up getting. There was some cancer in the lymph nodes but the surgeon thought he got it all (ha!). His PSA was 1.? after surgery. 3 months later it has skyrocketed. I don't remember the number but it was more than double. He was then given a hormone shot to slow the growth until he could get a scan. By the time he had his scan, the hormones had shrunk the cancer and they couldn't locate it. For the next 2.5 years he was taking a hormone treatment and staying around 0.1 PSA. This was great until 3 months ago when his PSA jumped to 1.6. The doctor thought he just needed more hormones, but this week his PSA was now raised to a 6. That's like a 1.5 month doubling rate. This was basically what happened before the hormones. The doctor is trying to schedule a scan in the next few weeks (if insurance covers it). He mentioned radiation as a possibility and told my dad he now qualified for clinical trials. The doctor also plans on discussing his case with some other doctors to get some treatment ideas. His doctor is located in Indianapolis, but my dad also lives equally close to Chicago. I'm honestly not sure how up to date the center is with prostate cancer. I wish I had more details but that's all I currently know. The doubling rate has me terrified about how fast this cancer will start growing. Any ideas on treatment or doctors would be appreciated. Thanks!",
