      "Content": "There is a debate in the medical community over focal HIFU - only treating identified lesions and trying to preserve rest of prostate, along with some functionality. Here is link to article that highlights the debate and summarizes a new article advocating focal HIFU. (Because my PCa is in both lobes, focal HIFU is no option for me.) http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/853490. Here is opening paragraph: Arguments over the use of focal therapy for prostate cancer, which uses ultrasound to treat only the index lesion in the prostate, have heated up. The October issue of the Journal of Urology carries a pro and con couplet of articles. The point of view in favor of focal therapy is from Mark Emberton, MD, who argues that focal therapy is \"a legitimate and necessary response to a changing world.\" The opposing view is from Mark L. Gonzalgo, MD, PhD, who counters that focal therapy \"aims to kill cancer while minimizing side effects\" but that, on the basis of current data, \"the hype...outweighs the hope.\"",

      "Content": "I had read of the Hopkins' testosterone biopolar study, which I found fascinating, as it goes against convention wisdom. As the article states, \"according to Denmeade, there is no evidence that testosterone promotes cancer.\" I had not read before that increased estradiol correlates with increased PC. Both before and after my treatment, I was taking Clomid, which is an inexpensive method to stimulate more testosterone. But my estradiol also increased above normal range, which can negatively affect libido/energy. (Taking anastrozole can bring down estradiol but my uro hasn't prescribed that -- yet.) I've been off clomid for a month and will be tested next week for T and PSA.",

      "Content": "There is a sticky at the top of the forum discussing HIFU, which also includes my report on my HiFU on February 26th. Although opinions understandably differ among some guys here because HIFU is still relatively new and the long term outcomes are not yet known, but I felt that, after considering all the options, HIFU was the best option for me. Recent studies discussed in the sticky are encouraging on longterm outcomes. It was relatively painless and a quick recovery. I will not get my first post-HIFU PSA until late May, as it takes 3 to 4 months for to reach the nadir. What is your friend's Gleason stage and is it confined to prostate? If he proceeds with HIFU, finding a very experienced HIFU specialist is very important. There is a learning curve and I would not want to be among the first 100 HIFU cases performed. My urologist had performed over 1,000.",

      "Content": "Good to hear that your HIFU went well. I'm scheduled for HIFU on Feb. 26, but mine will be for entire P, rather than focal. Not looking forward to catheter but that is a temporary annoyance. I will also have a pre-procedure prostate laser vaporization using a green light laser on Feb. 23. This is necessary as my P is slightly over the max size for HIFU (43 cm, rather than 40 which is max). Catheter will be inserted during that procedure and stay there until several days after HIFU. Once concern I had about HIFU is that the urethra in the prostate is also ablated, but my doctor assures me that the channel is recreated by the body.",

Would that information have been helpful in deciding treatment, or justify a second opinion? Another question is the stage. Technically, it seems I fit State 1C, as it was not palpable on DRE, and was found after elevated PSA, but my urologist said that because it's in both lobes, he said it is 2C and recommends either RP or radiation, not AS.

I've read Walsh's book and now reading Invasion of Prostate Snatchers to educate myself about options. My initial question is whether to get second opinion biopsy from Epstein at JHopkins. A summary of my biopsy results: A. LLB: Benign. B. LB: Benign C. LLM: Benign D. LM: Infiltrating prostatic adenocarcinoma, Gleason score estimate at 6 (3+3) E. LLA: positive, Gleason 6 F. LA: Positive, Gleason 6 G. RB: Benign H. RLB: Benign I. RM: positive, Gleason 6 J. RLM: positive, Gleason 6 K, RA: positive, Gleason 6 L. RLA: positive Gleason 6 M. Lesion 1, positive Gleason 6 N. Lesion 2, positive Gleason 6. In addition to pathologist who wrote report, another pathologist in his group is a friend of mine and took a second look and said he agreed with findings. I am considering a second opinion by Dr. Epstein. The pathology report did NOT report what percentage of each core was cancerous, density, size, and other factors listed in \"ideal\" report. Would that information have been helpful in deciding treatment, or justify a second opinion? Another question is the stage. Technically, it seems I fit State 1C, as it was not palpable on DRE, and was found after elevated PSA, but my urologist said that because it's in both lobes, he said it is 2C and recommends either RP or radiation, not AS. Many thanks for your help and insight.",

      "Content": "Good to hear that your HIFU went well. I'm scheduled for HIFU on Feb. 26, but mine will be for entire P, rather than focal. Not looking forward to catheter but that is a temporary annoyance. I will also have a pre-procedure prostate laser vaporization using a green light laser on Feb. 23. This is necessary as my P is slightly over the max size for HIFU (43 cm, rather than 40 which is max). Catheter will be inserted during that procedure and stay there until several days after HIFU. Once concern I had about HIFU is that the urethra in the prostate is also ablated, but my doctor assures me that the channel is recreated by the body.",

      "Content": "Thanks for your response. Increased PSA is the number one side effect of Androgel. I think that's what I will do - taper off Androgel and retest before biopsy. That, combined with other potential causes of PSA, seems to be worth at least another one more PSA test before biopsy. I will also research Androgel and if its effects on PSA are such that I should discontinue completely if I get a <4.0 PSA next time. Some controversy there, both whether elevated PSA side effect is innocent or indicative of PCa (as well as if taking Androgel makes your body shut down T production). I had similar effect with statins and liver enzymes. Taking statin caused elevated liver enzymes to abnormal range. GP wanted to stop but had a specialist do liver work up and determined that although the statin may be causing elevation, it was not indicative of liver disease. So continued the statin. Slightly off topic, but I had been taking Resveratol for other reasons until about year ago when my local store stopped carrying it. Some studies indicate possible positive effect on limiting PSA, although that was not why took it. May reconsider taking it again.",
