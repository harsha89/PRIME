Well, that's easy for them to say, isn't it?? I leak a couple pints a day, and I THINK it's getting better........but not fast enough. Depends (not the diapers) work great..I swear one will hold a 6 pack. I'm also trying medication for overactive bladder. Try to avoid irritants like caffeine and alcohol. We lost one sphincter with the prostate which doesn't help. Without the restriction of an oversized prostate, plus the loss of one sphincter, some of us have problems. Do your exercises, cut back on irritants, it will improve....or so I'm told.",

My prostate was so enlarged (130 g) that the urethra was compressed..possibility the bladder became \"stronger\" to force fluid through the restriction.

I've been taking Myrbetriq for overactive bladder, and it seems to help. Before starting it, I believe I could pee on the ceiling..now, just to the top of the door. Just too much pressure. I can't cough or lift anything without an issue. I had a huge 130g prostate which restricted flow for years. Bladder became a world class athlete to overcome restriction. Now, bladder just merrily does its thing with no restriction. Kegels helped with normal retention, but \"urge incontinency\" still remains. Real frustrating. I've gone from 6 pads to 2-3 daily, IF I don't cough or pick up anything heavy. Walking makes the situation worse, as does vibration from riding the mower, or going out fishing in the ocean.",

My local doc said that since the bladder is a muscle, it builds up strength to force drainage through an oversize, restrictive prostate. After surgery I think I could pee on the ceiling. As such, It's often difficult for the remaining \"shut-off\" valve to work effectively with such overwhelming pressure from the bladder. The first couple months were miserable...the control circuits still worked, but shut-off was ineffective. Recently, I've gotten significantly better. Why? Exercise, time, Myrbetriq? Dunno. After surgery I was pretty pissed off (oops, Freudian slip?) Everyone says \"it will get better\". Great. Easy for YOU to say...you're not peeing down your leg. Well, it IS getting better, but I'm pretty impatient. However, I've got a client with a good attitude. He asked me what I had for breakfast..\"ham sandwich\". Beer after dinner? \"hell yes\". did I enjoy them? \"you bet\". Well, if I hadn't had surgery, I eventually wouldn't be enjoying those, would I? Hmmm...he's gotta point. A competent surgeon retains the nerves which control incontinence and impotency. As undesirable as it sounds, time (sometimes a lot of time) does seem to allow these functions to return.",

My local doc said that since the bladder is a muscle, it builds up strength to force drainage through an oversize, restrictive prostate. After surgery I think I could pee on the ceiling. As such, It's often difficult for the remaining \"shut-off\" valve to work effectively with such overwhelming pressure from the bladder. The first couple months were miserable...the control circuits still worked, but shut-off was ineffective. Recently, I've gotten significantly better. Why? Exercise, time, Myrbetriq? Dunno. After surgery I was pretty pissed off (oops, Freudian slip?) Everyone says \"it will get better\". Great. Easy for YOU to say...you're not peeing down your leg. Well, it IS getting better, but I'm pretty impatient. However, I've got a client with a good attitude. He asked me what I had for breakfast..\"ham sandwich\". Beer after dinner? \"hell yes\". did I enjoy them? \"you bet\". Well, if I hadn't had surgery, I eventually wouldn't be enjoying those, would I? Hmmm...he's gotta point. A competent surgeon retains the nerves which control incontinence and impotency. As undesirable as it sounds, time (sometimes a lot of time) does seem to allow these functions to return.",
