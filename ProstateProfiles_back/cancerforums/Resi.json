      "Content": "Hey Frank, our stories are almost identical. I just had my surgery in January of 2015 at Johns Hopkins in Baltimore. I can't say enough about my surgeon, Dr. Arthur Burnett and his facility. Similar to you, I'm 52, 200#'s, Gleason score of 7, hypertension and other pre-existing conditions. I too spent 1 night in the hospital and returned home; after 2 weeks the catheter was removed and I went into the Depends. Today it's a mix of Depends at home and the pads if I choose to go out. Wearing those things is humiliating to me. About 2 weeks ago, with a fresh pad, I left home for a quick haircut and to visit my kids. Company arrived and I notice my jeans are wet. I went out the back door 'to smoke' and never went back. I can hold my urine, but if I were to cough, laugh, bend to get in the car, etc I squirt. I am dealing with the depression, incontinence and don't want to leave the house. As a man, I can't imagine going to work and having to disrobe to change the Depends (Real Fit) so I'll have to use the pad. Unfortunately, I work in a confined area with women and I know if I can smell it, they can. The erectile dysfunction is not a major concern right now, I hear it will get better over time. I have located a support group in my area that I plan to attend this week; I'm not really sure what to expect. Thanks for your story. Resi",
