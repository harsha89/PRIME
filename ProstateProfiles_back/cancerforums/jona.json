He said he would operate on me, but warned me about the incontinence issue. His concern was because I am 70. I am in good physical shape: runner, walker, skier, weightlifter. Dr. Walsh also recommended that I consider radiation and I have a meeting with a radiation oncologist on 11/18. After that meeting, I will decide on the course of treatment I will pursue. I would like to get feedback from any members of the forum in my age range who have had surgery.",

I don't think Dr. Walsh was that hesitant about operating, but did tell me that if you compare 500 surgeries against 500 radiation treatments, the statistics for long term cure are about the same. I have plugged my numbers into the Partin tables and also the calculators at Sloan-Kettering and UroPredict Bostwick Laboratories Staging System. Sloan-Kettering numbers show a better 5 to 10 year history for surgery versus IMRT, but about the same for brachytherapy. Walsh told me he didn't think I was a good candidate for brachytherapy. I've also been looking at proton beam therapy (PBT). The frustating thing about choosing a PCa treatment so far is that all of these institutions do heavy marketing for their methods. The PBT people act like this is the best treatment out there, but I haven't seen any statistics. Anyway, I have a consultation with a radiation oncologist at JHU on 11/18.

He said he would operate on me, but warned me about the incontinence issue. His concern was because I am 70. I am in good physical shape: runner, walker, skier, weightlifter. Dr. Walsh also recommended that I consider radiation and I have a meeting with a radiation oncologist on 11/18. After that meeting, I will decide on the course of treatment I will pursue. I would like to get feedback from any members of the forum in my age range who have had surgery.",

      "Content": "Yesterday (11/18/2009) I had my consultation with the Dr. Song, the radiation oncologist at Johns Hopkins. He told me that I was a good candidate for IGRT (Tomo), but admitted that it was a tossup with surgery. He would like to do an MRI to check if I have any extraprostatic extension --if I go the radiation route--so he can factor that into the plan. This like the old story of \"The Lady or the Tiger.\" Choose a door and behind one is a beautiful woman; behind the other is a tiger: a 50/50 chance. In this case, choosing between surgery and radiation is like there is a tiger behind one door and a leopard behind the other. No perfect answer. Both can have bad side effects. The main fears I have about surgery, of course, are the incontinence problem because of my age (70) and ED. On the other hand, if I can beat the first problem, I've found that there are a lot of posssible solutions for the ED problem. I think it would give me peace of mind no matter where I stand because of the accurate staging and the fact that PSA in this case is such a good indicator post-surgery of any cancer progression. This is not so accurate with radiation and harder to assess--and would seem to be a bigger worry. Would like feedback on the following: 1. Is there anyone out there over 70 who has had surgery? Would like to know your experience post-surgery. (My surgeon would be Dr. Patrick Walsh at John Hopkins.) 2. Experience with radiation, especially at Johns Hopkins 3. Experience with salvage radiation after surgery, if needed. 4. Do Kegel or other exercises before surgery help with gaining continence after surgery? I am in good physical shape (run, bike, etc.), so that is why I am currently leaning in the direction of having surgery. I'm looking for at least another 15 to 20 good years. (Hey, I'm optimistic!). Also, my gut feel from research is that surgery is still the better way to go even though the experts tell me both approaches are about even for being cancer-free down the road. I know it's my decision in the end, but it is a tough one. You all already know that! Thanks",

      "Content": "Thanks to both Otago and Replicant for your responses. I don't think Dr. Walsh was that hesitant about operating, but did tell me that if you compare 500 surgeries against 500 radiation treatments, the statistics for long term cure are about the same. I have plugged my numbers into the Partin tables and also the calculators at Sloan-Kettering and UroPredict Bostwick Laboratories Staging System. Sloan-Kettering numbers show a better 5 to 10 year history for surgery versus IMRT, but about the same for brachytherapy. Walsh told me he didn't think I was a good candidate for brachytherapy. I've also been looking at proton beam therapy (PBT). The frustating thing about choosing a PCa treatment so far is that all of these institutions do heavy marketing for their methods. The PBT people act like this is the best treatment out there, but I haven't seen any statistics. Anyway, I have a consultation with a radiation oncologist at JHU on 11/18. I'll see what he says and then decide. Meanwhile, I'll continue the research.",

      "Content": "Yesterday (11/18/2009) I had my consultation with the Dr. Song, the radiation oncologist at Johns Hopkins. He told me that I was a good candidate for IGRT (Tomo), but admitted that it was a tossup with surgery. He would like to do an MRI to check if I have any extraprostatic extension --if I go the radiation route--so he can factor that into the plan. This like the old story of \"The Lady or the Tiger.\" Choose a door and behind one is a beautiful woman; behind the other is a tiger: a 50/50 chance. In this case, choosing between surgery and radiation is like there is a tiger behind one door and a leopard behind the other. No perfect answer. Both can have bad side effects. The main fears I have about surgery, of course, are the incontinence problem because of my age (70) and ED. On the other hand, if I can beat the first problem, I've found that there are a lot of posssible solutions for the ED problem. I think it would give me peace of mind no matter where I stand because of the accurate staging and the fact that PSA in this case is such a good indicator post-surgery of any cancer progression. This is not so accurate with radiation and harder to assess--and would seem to be a bigger worry. Would like feedback on the following: 1. Is there anyone out there over 70 who has had surgery? Would like to know your experience post-surgery. (My surgeon would be Dr. Patrick Walsh at John Hopkins.) 2. Experience with radiation, especially at Johns Hopkins 3. Experience with salvage radiation after surgery, if needed. 4. Do Kegel or other exercises before surgery help with gaining continence after surgery? I am in good physical shape (run, bike, etc.), so that is why I am currently leaning in the direction of having surgery. I'm looking for at least another 15 to 20 good years. (Hey, I'm optimistic!). Also, my gut feel from research is that surgery is still the better way to go even though the experts tell me both approaches are about even for being cancer-free down the road. I know it's my decision in the end, but it is a tough one. You all already know that! Thanks",
