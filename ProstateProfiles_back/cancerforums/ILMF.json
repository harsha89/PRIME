      "Content": "I want to share my experience in case it is of help to anyone else. My brother his prostrate removed due to cancer in the spring of this year due to cancer and advised me to get the PSA test. I requested the test from my physician but put off going in for the test along with other blood chemistry tests. This August I was on vacation in Cabo Mexico and started having severe back flank pain. I had a kidney stone about 2 years ago so I figured it was a stone but was not sure because the pain was slightly different. So I gutted it out for the 3 days and flew back with my family and went in to the doctor the next day. I had my blood test which was ordered months ago drawn in the morning when I went in thinking it would be needed to evaluate. This test included the PSA test previously requested. The PSA came out at 11.6 which put my brain into a tailspin. They confirmed that I had a 7mm kidney stone which I passed the next day and they put me on Cipro for 3 weeks. I came back in 4 weeks and was retested and my PSA went down to 2.07. They believe I must have had an infection in my prostrate but the urine tests could not get bacteria culture to grow so initially I did not have much faith that the Cipro would make a difference. In addition my creatinine levels were taken at the same time as the PSA and were very high at 1.6. They also came down some to 1.2 with the higher level most likely due to the blockage of urine on my one side. I wanted to put this information out there in case it is of help to others. As advised by my brother I plan to go back and get a free PSA test done as a benchmark in case the PSA rises again I will have a better benchmark to determine if its caused by infection.",

      "Content": "RobLee I went to your blog and I hope you and your wife are feeling better. I am 56 so we are exactly 10 years apart. I went to the Urologist today and they did not want to give me the free PSA test because my total PSA is under 4 so I am going to have it done elsewhere outside of my health plan. I see you changed urologists. You really have to look out for yourself because the system sometimes does not. I went through very excruciating case of lyme disease 5 years ago where I had to self diagnose and request the lyme test when my primary care physician had me going to physical therapist for 3 weeks while I was withering away.",
