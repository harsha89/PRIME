      "Content": "First post although I have been an avid reader for the last 3 years (not much of a joiner). I want to express my sincere thanks to everyone on this forum for the information and indirect support I received as I proceeded through my journey with prostate cancer. The insight gained by reading the forum made the biopsy, eventual surgery and now recovery infinitely easier. Things I learned along the way, now 2 weeks after surgery: 1) Biopsies although not very painful are not a minor thing- had sepsis with 2 days in hospital on IV Antibiotics as a result-(even though Dr tested for resistance beforehand and prescribed antibiotics). 2) Kegels, Kegels and more Kegels- when my catheter was removed I had NO incontinence, in fact I had no leakage- better than before surgery. 3) Pain after RALP was less than expected other than initial gas pain- only extra strength Tylenol. 4) Dr Jeff Yoshida at Hoag Newport Beach is a god! 5) Neosporin is your friend with catheter, and changing the catheter in the shower makes it much easier. 6) A lounge chair may not be a requirement, but it will make life after surgery much more enjoyable. 7) My wife is a goddess- I could not have done this without her help and support. This forum is invaluable Thanks again for all the help- now on too final recovery!",

      "Content": "Hi Ron- I had my catheter removed 4/10/17. Had NO leakage or incontinence, so Ive got a big supply of pads going into the trash. I would buy some briefs if you dont already have them, one pack of pads (brand like Tena), and maybe mens underwear. Dont buy more than a weeks worth, until you see how you are doing. Like I said Im lucky and a whole lot of stuff is going in the trash.",
