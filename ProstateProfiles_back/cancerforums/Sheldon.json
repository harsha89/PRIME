      "Content": "Hello, I am currently being treated with Lupron (ADT) which of course eliminates testosterone and libido. I am also in a new relationship. Does anyone know of a natural or other product that increases libido and.or aids in getting and maintaining an erection. Viagra and Cialis are very unreliable based on ability to get aroused mentally. Thanks",
