      "Content": "Hi, My hubby was diagnosed with PCa in March 2013. In April he had radical prostatectomy, with a post-op diagnosis of T3bNO (Gleason 9, seminal vessel invasion and positive margins). In August 2017, his PSA had risen back up and was at 0.57. He began hormone treatment early September for 6 months, with radiation therapy to begin in January. The side effects have been expected...restless sleep, hot flashes, depression, low energy. However, for the past 7 days he's had diarhhea in the evenings, and a rumbling stomach with some cramping. Has anyone experienced stomach issues while on Zoladex? Thanks, Karen",

      "Content": "So I first became a (quiet) member in this forum in March 2013, when the love of my life was diagnosed with PCa. The information on this site coupled with all other research and consultations we received, led my man to the decision of RPP, which occurred April 19, 2013. Over the subsequent years, I would log into this site to gather more information as we proceeded through the various steps of recovery. From catheter issues to incontinence to ED challenges and rising PSA numbers, I've read and learned so much here. Thank you all for contributing. And, here I am again following his appointment of last week where the PSA post-surgery is now at 0.4 and we were advised to consider next treatment options. With a T3bN0M0 rating and a Gleason score of 9 (post-op), the outlook isn't great. What I have not seen/read, is the sharing of any information around alternative treatments - specifically CBD Oil (cannabidiol), yet when an online search is done for scholarly articles and medical research publications, there are many findings that suggest CBD oil has the potential to kill prostate cancer cells. CBD (1 & 2) are some of the non-psychoactive properties of marijuana. While the THC properties have been recognized to include inhibition of nausea and emesis associated with chemo- or radiotherapy, appetite stimulation, pain relief, mood elevation and relief from insomnia in cancer patients, CBD research is showing it's potential to kill cancer cells, specifically prostate, and preserve healthy cells - without providing the psychoactive effects of THC. While we wait for an appointment with an oncologist and begin a number of tests, hubby is taking CBD oil, and I'm wondering if there is anyone here who has had any experience with this.... Appreciate your comments... Karen",

      "Content": "Thanks for your perspective Rob. Medical marijuana is also legal where we live, and as per my post, THC offers many benefits for pain - but what we're more curious about is CBD, which does not make one \"high\".

      "Content": "My man had his prostate removed in April 2013, following a couple years of active surveillance and once his PSA reached 8.0 The post surgery pathology report had a diagnosis of: pT3b, N0, R1 (seminal vesicle invasion, no lymph node metastasis, no distant metastasis), positive margins and a Gleason 9. Three months post-surgery, his PSA was 0.019 and from then until present (July 2017) his PSA continued to rise, with it now sitting at 0.44 Hubby chose to not have adjuvunct treatment at the time, and is now faced with a recommendation from the Radiation Oncologist to do both radiation and hormone therapy. In fact, at the meeting we had yesterday - our first consultation meeting with the radiologist oncologist - the Dr had already arranged for treatment to begin that day! Since we had 2 pages of questions and received a lot of information from him, we told him we needed a little while to digest the information before making a decision. The doctor agreed to arrange for a bone scan and a CT scan, which will happen sometime in August, to give us a better view of whether or not the cancer has metastasized. After receiving the results of those scans, we expect to make the decision around next treatment. What we didn't like hearing is that the primary treatment being recommended is Radiation, even though all we have read indicates hubby is a poor candidate for RT, given his Gleason 9 rating, seminal vessel invasion and positive margins. When we raised this with the dr., he said hubby is a \"pretty good\" candidate, and that there is a 70% the cancer is localized in the prostate bed. When I asked if the % rate is different given that the pathology findings are 4+ years old, he didn't really answer, just said 70% is an excellent odd and greater than any other cancers. Which clearly isn't an answer. One question we didn't ask was why not do Hormone Therapy on its own. I've been reading many Cancer Agency websites and can't find an answer to this. If we consider all the information that says hubby's pathology indicates he is a poor candidate for radiation, why even go that route - we understand that Radiation is a potential \"cure\", but in reality, with his pathology, that seems extremely unlikely so why put the body through radiation, with all the risk factors and side effects? OR, if the doctor is confident the cancer is still within the prostate bed, what would be the risk of doing just Hormone Therapy? Thoughts and shared experiences are greatly appreciated! Karen",

      "Content": "Thanks MF - Yes, my bad - \"primary\" treatment was RP in April 2013. Hubby's PSA was 0.019 in July 2013, three months after surgery. It's been monitored every 3 - 6 months since, with it now at 0.44 Not 0.044 Doubling has been between 6 months and 14 months. We've been seeing the Urologist regularly and while he mentioned RT early, he felt with the slow rise in PSA, we were OK waiting. Our Urologist uses 0.4 as the indicator for recurrence. It wasn't until a June 2017 appointment when we met with a different Urologist (filling in for ours on vacation) who said he needs to be speaking with a Radiologist asap and begin RT and HT. In Canada, there are no PET scans with Axumin (new diagnostic tool used in some agencies in the States and the UK to pinpoint the sites of recurrence) and all literature (and Radiologist) says the best imaging available to us is Bone Scan and CT scan. Hubby's biggest concerns are around the side effects of RT and trying to figure out if they are worth it when we do not know that the cancer is still (4+ years later) localized. Karen",
