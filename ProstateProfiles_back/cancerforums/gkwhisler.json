      "Content": "I actually was diagnosed in September of 2014 by Biopsy (2 of 10 samples one 5% the other 20% = Gleason 3+3) I had an MRI last April which did not show anything significant. I had my second biopsy yesterday and will get the results in 2 weeks. I am 55, very active (50 marathons and just ran 2 50 mile events). Do I need to have treatment to remove my prostate and if I do how long will I be laid up? Even though I have researched things some I am still very confused about all of it. I am told most people die with PC and not of PC.",
