I have 4 grandkids 2 of which live with me one ( here i go again just like a broken record ) I just don't want to go. Knowing I'm going is just one more layer of b.s. .. i'm going crazy trying to get everything in order but it seems like it's all slipping through my fingers. in the next week or so i have to get married and adopt my son to make everything legal...i've changed my will twice in the last 2 days and changed the executor once. I'm making so many mistakes and I'm afraid I'll screw it up ,I don't no what i'm doing......I'm just so DESPERATE, ....Oh my God getting hit by a bus would've been so much more humane....but knowing pretty much about when I'm going to leave is scary....I keep thinking they'll find a cure in the next few days, fat chance thats going to happen.....I USED TO BE SOMEBODY, now look at me I've become a babbling COWARD. Your right I should call the hospice, and I will right after the civil ceremony. Thanks for saying what every one else was afraid to say. Thanks for letting me vent..Good luck to you Sarg and God Bless You All........Gimmy......my real name is Eugene Eugene, I have one wish right now. I wish that people who are dying, near death or dxed terminal take over this forum for a while. I want to hear from people like you. You help me... It breaks my heart that you are about to leave this life and feel so unfinished. I feel all of your feelings. I have thought: I used to be somebody. I\u2019m still somebody only slower... I'm going crazy trying to get everything in order but it seems like it's all slipping through my fingers. They are and it's time to let someone else help you. Call hospice. There\u2019s no giving up there. You are dying. And they will make it so much easier. You won\u2019t believe the resources they have and how many questions you have for them. They help dying people for a living and a love of the career. I\u2019m not going into my history, but, you might want to verify it and my thread is my cancer april51. I just saw another of your more current threads and decided to see if I could find more information on you. You PM me or get in touch. There are tons of people out there who are in our shoes and could compare the experience. Jody",

Eight weeks of radiation and chemo. Carbo and Taxol. Follow up with four rounds of Carbo and Alimta. December 2011 CT scan shows all clear. April 2012 CT scan shows all clear. July 2012 had several x-rays taken at the chiropractor for shoulder pain. Took them to the onc and nothing suspicious noted. See them again in Oct. October didn't work out. Pain in the left shoulder continued to worsen and lymph nodes in the supraclavical swelled so I called the onc and they bumped the regular scan up to September 19 and we went for the results on the 24th. The tumor is back and the spread is extensive. Option 1: Try targeting chemos that may work and then on to clinical trials. These would give me about a year or so if the cancer responds. Option 2: Do no treatment and let nature take its course. This will give me six months give or take. As good as I feel right now, I\u0092m going for door #2 and will continue to live well and enjoy myself until I don\u0092t. I\u0092ll keep you posted. Live it up everyone! 7 months into hospice and palliative care. It has been a very good relationship with the organization as a whole with a minor glitch. April 2013 spent the night at hospice facility, PICC line inserted for morphine drip. I said I wouldn\u0092t but, had a hospital bed delivered. Started 10 rounds of palliative radiation to shrink the neck tumor. Busy month for me! I've taken a couple of nasty falls this last week. (first of & mid-May) Right on the cancer shoulder.

      "Signature": "May The Odds Be Ever In Your Favour. Born 1960. Diagnosed 4/2011 with one tumor, LUL, NSCLC. Tumor size 1.1 inches. Thoracic surgery 6/1/2011. No action taken. Eight weeks of radiation and chemo. Carbo and Taxol. Follow up with four rounds of Carbo and Alimta. December 2011 CT scan shows all clear. April 2012 CT scan shows all clear. July 2012 had several x-rays taken at the chiropractor for shoulder pain. Took them to the onc and nothing suspicious noted. See them again in Oct. October didn't work out. Pain in the left shoulder continued to worsen and lymph nodes in the supraclavical swelled so I called the onc and they bumped the regular scan up to September 19 and we went for the results on the 24th. The tumor is back and the spread is extensive. Option 1: Try targeting chemos that may work and then on to clinical trials. These would give me about a year or so if the cancer responds. Option 2: Do no treatment and let nature take its course. This will give me six months give or take. As good as I feel right now, I\u0092m going for door #2 and will continue to live well and enjoy myself until I don\u0092t. I\u0092ll keep you posted. Live it up everyone! 7 months into hospice and palliative care. It has been a very good relationship with the organization as a whole with a minor glitch. April 2013 spent the night at hospice facility, PICC line inserted for morphine drip. I said I wouldn\u0092t but, had a hospital bed delivered. Started 10 rounds of palliative radiation to shrink the neck tumor. Busy month for me! I've taken a couple of nasty falls this last week. (first of & mid-May) Right on the cancer shoulder. So I have a life alert necklace on me now. I wish I could get my hands on a small scooter! There is another node swelling on the other side of my neck. Still small.
