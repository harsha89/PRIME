      "Content": "I've been advised to consider having a PET scan. My PSA has now risen from the low of 0.003 following hormone therapy and is currently 4.2. This followed a treatment \"holiday\" of more than two years, during which I had no further hormone injections and no other treatment. I had radical prostatectomy in 2002 and salvage radiation in 2008. The hormone treatment began in January 2011 and ended in October 2011. I will be 70 on 15 July 2014 and am generally in good health. My oncologist in Cyprus, where I live, has suggested that while I am still off hormones I should have a CT scan and if that is negative for spread, then a PET scan. He says this holds out the possibility of finding the cancer and treating it, possibly even eradicating it, although he added that it is still early days for this approach. I would be interested to hear from anyone who has tried this, or knows about it.",

      "Content": "Hello again - I completed my first course of hormone therapy in mid-October 2011. This consisted of Suprefact injections every three months. My PSA rapidly fell to virtually undetectable and remained there -- until my most recent blood test on 15 April 2013. PSA is now 0.194, versus 0.003 six months previously (10 October 2012). Testosterone has also risen, to 17.58 from 5.03 six months ago. I'm due to be tested again on 9 September 2013 and after that it may be necessary to resume hormone injections. I guess this is a fairly common type of result in such situations, but wonder if the doubling time is significant at such low levels e.g. 0.003. In other words, PSA of 0.194 is actually more than 60 times 0.003. Thanks for any observations. The background is that I had radical prostatectomy in May 2002 and then salvage radiation Oct-Nov 2008, both at Sloan-Kettering.",
