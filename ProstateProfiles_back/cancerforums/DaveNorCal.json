      "Content": "Newporter, should I take it you are from Newport Beach? I am in Chico and it's a medical backwater. My plan is to move forward, the problem is that there are only three urologists in town, all the docs here are really clubby, and the one who examined me actually told me that an area of my prostate was \"firmer\" but didn't feel like cancer and said he hated to go ahead with biopsies and to return in a year. He never used the term nodule. When I got my written report he had written that I have a nodular prostate and that he had encouraged a biopsy and I declined, that he offered me a six month follow-up and I declined. His word against mine. I am actually very risk averse and will do what needs to be done. If he had suggested biopsy, I would have agreed that day. Now I obviously don't trust him and am worried that any of his local colleagues will circle the wagons. I don't trust the local docs to do the biopsy honestly or competently so I am going to have to move all of this to the Bay Area. UCSF is one of eleven designated centers of excellence for prostate cancer in the U. S. so I guess that is where I am going ASAP.",
