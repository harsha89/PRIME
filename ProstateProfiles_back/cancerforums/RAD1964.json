      "Content": "Hello Gentlemen, I hope it's okay that I post this query. My husband was diagnosed with PC two weeks ago, after an initial PSA test on a regular physical back at beginning of July came back as 4.5. Here is what the pathology report states: Right Prostate: adenocarcinoma, Geason score 3+4 (Grade Group 2, TC1), carcinoma involves multiple cores and approximately 10 percent of examined tissue Left Prostate: benign prostatic tissue 6 cores were taken from each side. He has not been scheduled for a bone scan or any other follow-up test, including genetic, as his urologist does not think it necessary (his words). This puzzles me, as I have since learned that scans and genetic tests are imperative. My husband is 54 years old. First PSA test was given two years ago. It was 2.5. Current numbers are: regular PSA 4.5, 4K score 28 percent, and free PSA is 8. Husband's current care team is comprised of a resident and a urological oncoloist with 25 years of experience performing radical prostatectomies. They are both at the University of New Mexico Cancer Center in Albuquerque. We met first with the resident, who believes that active surveillance is a definite possibility for my husband. Then the doctor came in, who advised \"immediate\" surgical treatment. By the time we finished talking, however, he very grudgingly said that \"more than likely\" this was not an immediate threat, and we could take a few months to get second opinions, etc. and then decide. The disconnect between these two recommendations is interesting, to say the least. In the meantime, my husband is seeking his second opinion at Integris, a cancer specialty clinic in OKC (where we live parttime), which takes a multidisciplinary team approach to treatment. Instead of shuttling the patient around from doctor to doctor, they meet with all specialists (surgeons and radiologists) at one time. They will likely do the PET scan, but we don't know yet. We expect to hear from Integris this week. Also considering sending slides to Dr. Epstein at John's Hopkins, but do not know what his lead time is. Will call this week. We also have a follow up PSA test scheduled for January 20th as part of our active surveillance approach until a second (or third) opinion suggests otherwise. My bottom line question is: how much time do we have to make a decision on treatment? Any thoughts you can share with me about time frames would be most appreciated. Thanks so much, CPG",

By the time we finished talking, however, he very grudgingly said that \"more than likely\" this was not an immediate threat, and we could take a few months to get second opinions, etc. and then decide. The disconnect between these two recommendations is interesting, to say the least. In the meantime, my husband is seeking his second opinion at Integris, a cancer specialty clinic in OKC (where we live parttime), which takes a multidisciplinary team approach to treatment. Instead of shuttling the patient around from doctor to doctor, they meet with all specialists (surgeons and radiologists) at one time. They will likely do the PET scan, but we don't know yet. We expect to hear from Integris this week. Also considering sending slides to Dr. Epstein at John's Hopkins, but do not know what his lead time is. Will call this week. We also have a follow up PSA test scheduled for January 20th as part of our active surveillance approach until a second (or third) opinion suggests otherwise. My bottom line question is: how much time do we have to make a decision on treatment? Any thoughts you can share with me about time frames would be most appreciated. Thanks so much, CPG",

      "Content": "Hello Gentlemen, I hope it's okay that I post this query. My husband was diagnosed with PC two weeks ago, after an initial PSA test on a regular physical back at beginning of July came back as 4.5. Here is what the pathology report states: Right Prostate: adenocarcinoma, Geason score 3+4 (Grade Group 2, TC1), carcinoma involves multiple cores and approximately 10 percent of examined tissue Left Prostate: benign prostatic tissue 6 cores were taken from each side. He has not been scheduled for a bone scan or any other follow-up test, including genetic, as his urologist does not think it necessary (his words). This puzzles me, as I have since learned that scans and genetic tests are imperative. My husband is 54 years old. First PSA test was given two years ago. It was 2.5. Current numbers are: regular PSA 4.5, 4K score 28 percent, and free PSA is 8. Husband's current care team is comprised of a resident and a urological oncoloist with 25 years of experience performing radical prostatectomies. They are both at the University of New Mexico Cancer Center in Albuquerque. We met first with the resident, who believes that active surveillance is a definite possibility for my husband. Then the doctor came in, who advised \"immediate\" surgical treatment. By the time we finished talking, however, he very grudgingly said that \"more than likely\" this was not an immediate threat, and we could take a few months to get second opinions, etc. and then decide.
