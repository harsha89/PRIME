Almost no leaking at this point, even when playing golf, and though I have to work to get the erection, (or my wife does), when I get one, it is fully functional and working like a charm. Anyhow, all my best to you in your recovery.",

      "Content": "So, on May 10th I underwent a daVinci robotic prostatectomy at Celebration hospital in Orlando, by Dr Vip Patel. Not the most fun I have ever had, but not nearly as bad as I feared on post op day, 4, my catheter was removed, that made me a lot more comfortable, but again the catheter wasn't terrible. Believe it or not, by the following day, post op day 5, I had almost no urinary incontinence! To date, I have an occasional drop of urine, maybe 3-4 times a day, if that, only upon standing, not every time, just occasional! Today, i started chipping and putting, (yes, I'm a golf nut), and had minimal leakage. Wearing a pad only! Pain was really only significant the 1st 48 hours, after that a Tylenol if needed would do the trick. Dr Patel starts most patients on Cialis a couple days after your catheter comes out. I have started this, but nothing happening down below yet that being said, I didn't really expect it yet. Anyhow, just wanted to post this to let the undecided guys out there know, it's not that bad, and when they get the cancer out, you will sleep better. Best of luck to all.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by HighlanderCFH One thing I'd ask is whether you have cleared it with your doctor to be chipping & putting so quickly? For the first month or so they usually do not permit any type of activity that might involve any twisting, turning, etc. For example, when I returned home from my surgery in Nov. 2011, they would not even allow me to rake my leaves. LOL So if you haven't checked with your doctor on this, you might consider doing that before using the golf clubs next time. In the meantime, I hope your post-op pathology report was very good. Good luck! Chuck Thanks for your reply. Yes Dr Patel told me chipping and putting was ok in two weeks, full golf swing ok in 4 weeks. Final path in my signature below, disease completely confined to the prostate, no capsule penetration, margins negative, as good as could be expected!",

      "Content": "I'm 6 weeks out from my daVinci radical prostatectomy by Dr Vipul Patel in Orlando. I feel great, back to work for 3 weeks, and i have been playing golf for the last 2 weeks. My 6 wk post op PSA was <.01! I am for the most part completely continent and have been having spontaneous erections and have been fully sexually active for the last two weeks....no issues fortunately. That being said, even if I empty my bladder immediately before sex, I will occasionally have climacturia, almost as if I am ejaculating urine. I will say, while it sounds gross, it somehow makes ejaculation feel like before. Anyhow, my question is, is this common? Does anyone else have this? Will it improve, or do I just deal with it? In the end, I'm super glad I'm hopefully cured and fully functional. I will discuss this with my surgeon, but my post op appt isn't until July 17th. Thanks for your input.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by Sarg Really glad everything worked out well for you. It's scarey going in, but after it is over it is a great relief. Keep up the chipping and putting. I am back playing at it a little. The only thing I have to remember is to do a kegel right before driving off the tee, or I may leak a drop or two. I think it is because of the combination of the twisting and effort put forth in the drive. Just another learning process. Again, glad you are doing well.
