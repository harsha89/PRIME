      "Content": "Originally Posted by brownie43 Hi Zaldamo. I too have Stage IV PCa, and am the same age as your Father-in-Law. I have been using the VA for the past 10 yrs here in Albuquerque NM, and have been very well taken care of. They do not have much of an Oncology dept. here, and referred me to the University of New Mexico Comprehensive Cancer Center for treatment thru the \"Veterans Choice\" program. PCa is a \"presumptive\" disease associated to exposure to Agent Orange, and if he served in Vietnam at any time between Jan 9,1962 and May 7, 1975, then he is eligible for compensation and treatment. I am considered 100% disabled as a result of the PCa diagnosis. Your Father-in-Law will have to \"prove\" that he served in Vietnam during this period. I know this sounds ridiculous, as the Military should know this, but I was able to provide a copy of my DD214, as well as copies of Citations and Awards during the period, plus I had letters I had sent to my mother in 1968, and was able to provide them, showing postmarks, etc. The local Veterans Administration was very helpful in assisting me in filing this claim. I would suggest he file this claim right away, as the Compensation is very helpful, especially if he chooses to go outside the VA System and has Medicare Copays, etc. There is a lot of information online about this subject, as well as assistance in filing his claim.......Good Luck, Brownie Thank you, Brownie! This is great info and I will make sure he follows through with it...Good luck to you!",

      "Content": "Hello, Sorry for the lack of detailed info, but my step dad is very stubborn, angry and not communicating very well right now. He has prostate cancer, verified via biopsy. He had an MRI last week and confirmed it had metastasized into his bones. I don't know which ones. He said they would try to give him \"a few years\" and he's getting a shot of some kind at the urologist in 10 days. That's all I know... Assuming I can get him to communicate, can anyone give some general tips about how to proceed? I want him to go to a the local teaching university, or even The James in Columbus or The Cleveland Clinic. (We live in Cincinnati.) What questions should he ask? Second opinion? Should he not be seeing an oncologist or a uro who specializes in cancer? Thanks! zaldamo",
