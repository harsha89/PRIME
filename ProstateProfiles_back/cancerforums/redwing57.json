      "Content": "I had primary radiation therapy, so maybe it's a little different from SRT. But for what it's worth I did receive some dietary recommendations. Similar to RobLee, I was told to avoid anything \"gassy\", mostly to minimize any movement of the radiation target area during treatment. So, they limited vegetables (especially beans), no carbonated beverages, that sort of thing. Also, I avoided caffeine because it irritates the urethra somewhat. Friday afternoons were great - we'd hit a Mexican restaurant and I could have a salad, beans, beer, all of it! But by mid-day Sunday it was back on the wagon. I had blessedly few side effects from the radiation, nothing long term. No rectal issues. Urinary urgency",

      "Content": "The \"new prostate cancer infolink\" site has a new article about prostate cancer screening, saying most of the time the treatment risk is worse than the possible PCa risk. I've seen references to this perspective before, but I'm curious what the members of this forum think. It seems really aggravating that one could go through all that PCa treatments entail, and have a broad spectrum of others think you shouldn't have even done it. I can see the opposite of support happening! Has that been anyone's experience so far? I know I have a hard time putting this out of my mind, since I'm still in the \"high risk\" but undiagnosed category right now. I know too many numbers I guess, and all of these screening metrics are in the \"concern\" range, so I'm scheduled for a biopsy in a few days.",

      "Content": "Just checking in here with some background and a couple of questions. This is a little bit long... 11 years ago at age 44, PSA was around 5 and free PSA was under 10. Three negative biopsies (last one color doppler by Dr. Fred Lee, also stated it's a 30g prostate), and only found inflammation. So, aspirin \"therapy\", and PSA dropped down to around 2 for several years. I quit having it checked for 4 years, then had a recent physical only to find it was back up to 4.1 again, 15% fPSA. Rechecked in 6 months, now 5.2 and 12% fPSA. So, off to the urologist again. We decided to do a PCA3 assay (not sensitive to inflammation) , and it came in at 31. That's considered \"positive\" since the cutoff now is considered at 25, so the next step is another biopsy. The PCA3 reading is a ratio of two factors based on the RNA in prostate cells, and they verify the sample is valid by checking that one of the metrics is of a certain level. So, it seems pretty robust. However, even at 31 it is a little bit gray. Have any of you had multiple PCA3 tests over time to get any idea of the variability for an individual? According to the assay's own documentation, their standard deviation is around 7 so it seems there's quite a bit of variability within the assay itself. The urologist (board-certified Dr in a teaching hospital), says he doesn't think we need to do a \"saturation\" biopsy, since he's not really looking for the tiniest bits of PCa. I tend to agree, but I'm curious what others think. Does it seem like a 12-14 core biopsy would be reasonable to look for anything \"clinically significant\", as opposed to finding \"anything\"? I have *no* issues today other than these crazy metrics indicating a future risk, and I'm not interested in drastic \"therapies\" that will cause real physical issues immediately. Hopefully, the biopsy will be negative, and then the waiting begins for the next readings in another 6 months or a year.",

      "Content": "Thanks for the comments. I found an article titled \"More data on accuracy of the PCA3 test in the real world\". Their point is pretty much that PCA3 isn't all that helpful in the real world. To set the cutoff high enough to avoid enough biopsies to be useful, it will miss too many cancers. Lowering the cutoff to catch enough cancers, it only reduces biopsies about 20%. So... not terribly useful. But, there have been many other studies indicating it is useful, so who knows? I'm heading for another biopsy, which we had considered, and now supported by the PCA3 score even if it is somewhat of a weak metric.",
