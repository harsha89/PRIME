Like mtsarpilot said, ditch the caffeine and citrus drinks. Caffeine and citrus drinks cause the bladder to spasm, hence the leaks. Stick with water. I do pretty good most of the week, but on Saturdays (like today) I like to pressure test the bladder with about 8 beers, and I leak like a sieve. But on Sunday it's back to normal (just some stress incontinence). Only 5 days after catheter removal, you're doing great and it should improve as every week goes by. Good luck.",

However, the increased risk of side effects are a concern to me. I appreciate whatever input everyone can give with personal experiences to help me make this decision. You will also find that the chances of making a good recovery from those side effects is better the younger you are, and that the experience of the surgeon has a lot to do with both the success of the surgery and the minimization of side effects. Sorry to have you join us. Good luck on your decision/treatment.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by KW2014 Due to insurance I would be using a local surgeon, he has done hundreds of open surgery procedures but only about 25 da Vinci operatons. I am a bit concerned about the experience factor, but he is about my age and did come to the local clinic from Sloan-Kettering so he has solid experience and training. Personally, I wouldn't let a guy that's only done 25 robotics anywhere near my prostate. If he's done several hundred open procedures, you might want to consider going that way if you are absolutely tied to this guy because of your insurance. Having a lot of experience doing opens doesn't translate into being a good robotic surgeon. It's a whole different ball game and the learning experience of the robot is quite steep, on the order of several hundred procedures. The first thing I would do is find out what his outcomes are. He should have that information. If they aren't good, I'd be doing battle with my insurance company to get me to a guy who's outcomes are good. No do-overs here. Good luck to you.",

Since my prostate is gone, it seems that the blood flows even better. Erections seem just a little bit bigger, and and certainly more, umm, sensitive.

One thing everybody should be aware of is that no matter what kind of patient you are, YOU are responsible for your care. Not the doctor, nurse, or anybody else. YOU. Honestly, I don't know how anyone considering surgery and having done any research at all could not have been aware of the possibility of climacturia prior to surgery. The cancer boards are filled with threads about it. Walsh's book talks about it. The American Cancer Society has at minimum four different references to it on their web site.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by KW2014 Due to insurance I would be using a local surgeon, he has done hundreds of open surgery procedures but only about 25 da Vinci operatons. I am a bit concerned about the experience factor, but he is about my age and did come to the local clinic from Sloan-Kettering so he has solid experience and training. Personally, I wouldn't let a guy that's only done 25 robotics anywhere near my prostate. If he's done several hundred open procedures, you might want to consider going that way if you are absolutely tied to this guy because of your insurance. Having a lot of experience doing opens doesn't translate into being a good robotic surgeon. It's a whole different ball game and the learning experience of the robot is quite steep, on the order of several hundred procedures. The first thing I would do is find out what his outcomes are. He should have that information. If they aren't good, I'd be doing battle with my insurance company to get me to a guy who's outcomes are good. No do-overs here. Good luck to you.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by RickRed52 In one of my surveys of the 153 men who responded 37% said knowing what they know today about life without a prostate they would not have chosen surgery. What would be a very revealing follow-up question for these men is who and how experienced their surgeon was. How may of them did any research at all prior to undergoing surgery? Also, of that 37%, what percentage of those do you suppose would have also regretted a different treatment option down the road? Lots of guys have gotten plenty screwed up by radiation. Others have not had their cancer cured. The guys who had surgery don't know what life would have been like had they had another form of treatment. I wonder if there is a similar survey somewhere of guys who had radiation, HT, etc. Maybe 37% of them wished they had opted for surgery. I also noticed that only 11% of the survey guys were solidly in the \"regret my decision/ruined my life\" camp. I'm not criticizing your position or survey, mind you. Just thinking out loud.",

You need to make doing a kegel when you cough, laugh, bend over, sit up, etc almost second nature. That will help with a lot of the dribbling. Everybody's recovery is different, so if you get 20 responses to this, there will be 20 different recovery stories. I never had much more than an occasional dribble (except very early after surgery when I drank a lot of beer) and consider myself to be 100% continent now. And a 70 percenter makes ME smile.

      "Content": "Originally Posted by doinalright Thanks Dan, Does the urinating and the erections gradually get better or is it like wake up one day and \"hello there\"? The answer is: Depends. (See, I made a funny) I never had to change pads, other guys have to change pads for months or years. Some guys get gradually better erections, but I just read a post the other day on one of the boards from a guy who went a couple of years and then all of a sudden had nice erections again. Mine seem to be getting gradually (very gradually) better, but they are adequate. And based on what I've been through and the experiences of many other PC guys, I think I'm doing really well. Do you drink coffee or citrus juice? If so, I would recommend stopping for a while and see if that helps. Both cause bladder spasms and make it difficult to control the dribbles.",

Something's causing it. You need to find out what. The other guys are quite correct, the chances of it being prostate cancer are pretty remote. But not outside the realm of possiblity. Plenty of guys on these boards who were diagnosed in their thirties. I'm not trying to scare you, but you need a little better answer than your guy \"feels\" it's prosatitis. Hopefully, it is. But you need to find out. And not in four years. More like four months. If that. The advice to see a urologist is spot on. By the way, is there a family history you're aware of? You might want to ask around. After I was diagnosed, I found out that many of my uncles and one of my grandfathers had it. Best of luck to you Dan",

I took another week off from the gym and then hit it again at about four weeks, which was fine for elliptical training. At the same time I cheated a little and did a few bicep curls on the machine and some abdominal work, but both with very little resistance. I was 55 and in pretty good shape prior to surgery. I let my body tell me what it was ready for. I was scuba diving at a little over three weeks but had my buds haul my stuff into the water for me so I didn't have to carry any weight at all. But I also tend to be a risk taker, so don't take this as sound medical advice. Or even crappy medical advice.",

      "Content": "Welcome. Glad to see you that you did your research and found a surgeon with a bit of experience. Your story is exactly why I didn't mess around getting into surgery; I didn't want to take the chance that the biopsy was wrong. You mention incontinence but talk about having to go to the bathroom frequently, are you actually leaking or just have to go frequently? Sometimes it takes several months for the bladder to return to its normal shape and capacity after a prostatectomy if you had an enlarged prostate. If you're having a leakage problem, cut off all the caffeine and citrus drinks for a while and see if that helps. Both cause bladder spasms. I leaked a little for a couple of months after surgery and still have an occasional drip if I'm not careful. Do a kegel when you stand up, bend over, cough, etc if that's when you're having problems. Good luck Dan",

      "Content": "Travel? Yeah, I traveled - About 6500 miles one way from Guam to Los Angeles and then back again. I arrived a couple of days early for my pre-op appointment and to get situated. I had my procedure done at City of Hope, they had hospice cottages and we rented one for about 10 days. We stayed there until the catheter was out (7 days) and then drove up to the SF area to catch a flight to Hawaii. The drive was long but not unbearable. If your guy's in decent shape he should be able to handle a 4-5 hour drive after a week (maybe sooner, but a week is my experience). I wouldn't, however, head out on a 6500 mile flight after a week knowing what I do now. I made it, but it was extremely unpleasant. I wouldn't consider a DaVinci with anyone less than 1000 procedures under their belt. It's a one-shot deal, if the surgeon screws it up there's no second chances. Review their outcomes and even interview them if you need to. I interviewed a couple over the phone from Guam and ruled them out. If they won't divulge their outcomes (successful cancer removal/negative margins, continence, and sexual potency) then run away. You'll hear a lot of advice that getting the cancer out is the number one outcome and that everything else is secondary. I wouldn't disagree with that. But with the DaVinci and a surgeon who really knows his way around it, there's no reason not to try to shoot for the trifecta. And that generally won't be a guy with 300-400 procedures. Could be, but I'd go with the odds..... Good luck. Dan",

Looks like you answered your own question. Those were my thoughts exactly. Surgery is the gold standard, and it's the only way to know for certain what the real extent of the cancer is. At your age, and with an experienced surgeon, you should be able to regain continence (if you even lose it) and sexual function fairly quickly. Good luck. Dan",

      "Content": "My lifting restriction was for six weeks. After that my doc told me I was limited to what my body could handle. I power walk in addition to elliptical training. Three-four weeks after surgery I was back up to three plus miles a day (albeit a little slower than normal). But it wasn't long after that I was back to my usual speed. I jumped on the elliptical at about three weeks but that was a little too much, so I laid off that for another week then eased back in. I wouldn't mess with bands or anything like that, because if you're standing up it's going to strain your abdomen. Now, I found that I could do some bicep curls if I was on a machine that totally isolated the biceps. But I kept the weight down a bit. Started that about four weeks post surgery. I also did a few ab crunchs at a little over four weeks, but with much lighter resistance than normal. Six weeks out I was pretty much back to normal although I had to be careful with the ab crunches for a couple of months. Sometimes I felt it wasn't good to do as many as usual. You'll know. You will probably need access to a good gym to find machines that totally isolate your upper body. Anyway, that's my story. Your mileage may vary. This isn't medical advice. Blah, blah. Good luck on your surgery, and sorry you have to be here. Dan",

And don't consider any of them who don't have at least 1000 procedures under their belt. Preferably more than that. The \"300\" number is bandied about quite a bit as the learning curve for the robot, but that doesn't necessarily get the surgeon to the peak of his game. Ask about their outcomes in terms of getting all the cancer out and what percentage of their patients experience ED or incontinence and for how long. ED and incontinence pretty much go hand in hand with a prostatectomy, but the best surgeons have lots better outcomes. They should be able to give you those numbers. If they can't, walk. There aren't any do-overs with a prostatectomy; if the surgeon messes up your surgery, you're screwed. You want the guy who gets all the cancer out, his patients don't need salvage treatment, they can hold their urine after a reasonable amount of time, and don't need dick injections or an implant to have sex when it's all over. That will undoubtably be a guy with thousands of procedures behind him. Not saying that a guy with 600 can't accomplish the same thing, but this game is all about playing the percentages.

      "Content": "Originally Posted by SDH Hi all, My Ur does robotic and standard surgeries, and has done hundreds. I was surprised when he told me that he thought I was a better candidate for open surgery since that way, he could easily remove the lymph nodes during surgery. He told me that removing them with robotic was difficult. Find another urologist. Now. Nothing wrong with open surgery, but to say that robotic is more difficult and that he can't get the lymph nodes easily tells me he isn't experienced enough in either procedure. \"Hundreds\"? What does that mean? One hundred opens and one hundred robotics? You need to be going to a guy who measures his procedures in the thousands, not the hundreds. Sounds to me like he isn't comfortable with the robot, and even \"hundreds\" of opens woudn't give me warm and fuzzies. I would tend to agree, given the limited information we have, that a prostatectomy is probably your best choice. But if you want to be continent and have any sexual function left afterwards (not to mention negative margins and no cancer left behind), you need to find a surgeon who really knows what the hell he's doing. And that guy hasn't done just \"hundreds\". Welcome to the board, by the way. Sorry you're here.",

He is in a larger group of urologist that all have some sort of awards. My only concern is that he has close to 300 surgeries with the Da vinchi and he has a senior doctor with him and they both do the surgery. My urologist is on the younger side, also, and seems very knowledgeable. But I wouldn't let him operate on me, and he understood why. The fact that your guy has someone else assisting (training?) him is a big red flag to me. I'd be finding me someone who has over 1,000 robotics under his belt and doesn't need to have a senior doctor in the room with him. Good luck, and sorry to meet you.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by SDH Hi all, My Ur does robotic and standard surgeries, and has done hundreds. I was surprised when he told me that he thought I was a better candidate for open surgery since that way, he could easily remove the lymph nodes during surgery. He told me that removing them with robotic was difficult. Find another urologist. Now. Nothing wrong with open surgery, but to say that robotic is more difficult and that he can't get the lymph nodes easily tells me he isn't experienced enough in either procedure. \"Hundreds\"? What does that mean? One hundred opens and one hundred robotics? You need to be going to a guy who measures his procedures in the thousands, not the hundreds. Sounds to me like he isn't comfortable with the robot, and even \"hundreds\" of opens woudn't give me warm and fuzzies. I would tend to agree, given the limited information we have, that a prostatectomy is probably your best choice. But if you want to be continent and have any sexual function left afterwards (not to mention negative margins and no cancer left behind), you need to find a surgeon who really knows what the hell he's doing. And that guy hasn't done just \"hundreds\". Welcome to the board, by the way. Sorry you're here.",

The fact that you knew you had a cardiac problem \"EKG showed a little abnormality. In the last 3 weeks I have seen no less than 4 Dr.'s no one said anything about another workup.

If the February biopsy comes back showing cancer, well, then you still have cancer. If it comes back clear, then the biopsy needles missed the tumor.

He\u2019s young, but a 3+3 diagnosis is relatively easy to make (per my niece, who is a Johns Hopkins trained pathologist) and the UCLA department head signed off on it. Thank you, guys. Reading the slides isn't the problem. The problem is hitting the worst part of the cancer with the biopsy needles. If the pathologist doesn't get the sample with the G9 in it, then he can't diagnose G9. And even if one of the needles hits the G9 (or whatever), that doesn't necessarily mean that the slice they shave off to send to the pathologist will have the G9 cells in it. Maybe they sliced off the part with the G6 and left the G9 in the petrie dish.",

However, I began to have some serious concerns about medical ethics and conflicts of interest within the HIFU medical community. One of my concerns was discovering instances where doctors performed the procedure despite indications that it wouldn't be appropriate. HIFU isn't for everybody. Also it appeared that most, if not all, of the doctors performing the procedure had a vested interest in the companies producing the machines. The majority of the articles I read that gave HIFU rave reviews were by doctors who had a financial interest in HIFU outside of their normal surgical fees. This is not a judgment about the efficacy of HIFU at all, but do your due diligence before making the leap. Good luck - Dan.",

      "Content": "Well, let me just say this. After interviewing three surgeons and researching many more, I flew 7,000 miles to have Dr. Wilson do my prostatectomy. And the results couldn't have been better. Hit the trifecta. Dr. Kawachi at City of Hope has a reputation equally as impressive as Dr. Wilson's. City of Hope was great. They have some cottages you can rent for something like $60 a night. I stayed there for a week doing my initial recuperation. Just a walk across the street to the hospital for follow-ups, etc. Made life pretty easy for the wife, also. They have free buses so I made sure she got out to take a break from being around me too much. Get the hair done, etc. Things just couldn't have gone better for me there. The grounds are also fantastic and they have a meditation garden, etc. Plenty of space to go for the frequent post-surgery walks and have some solitude. Well needed after the surgery, I'll tell you. Good luck. Dan",

I am so stressed over all of this that I just want someone to tell me who the best surgeon is that will give me the best outcome at the best hospital w/out having my wife and family travel far nor myself. Hi, Tazz. Sorry you're here. You're saying you want the best possible care and outcomes, but then you say you don't want to travel to get them. That's not the right perspective to come at this problem with, especially at your age. Finding the right surgeon is not all that difficult, you have made a good start by coming here. If you're like me and several others here, you will decide that the inconvenience and expense associated with obtaining top-notch care, no matter where you have to go to get it, is well worth it. Or you can stay local, let whoever hack you up, and hope for the best. I would say that I narrowed my list of prospective surgeons down to not more than a half-dozen in the entire country. Guys with thousands of procedures under their belts and the outcomes that come with that experience level. Besides what you learn here, US News has lists of the best doctors and hospitals, you can Google it. Often you will find the surgeon's or hospital's web sites will list outcomes in detail. If they don't, you can ask. If they won't or can't tell you, walk away. The top-notch guys are rightfully proud of their outcomes and won't hesitate to tell you. Good Luck Dan",

It's real easy to miss cancer with a biopsy, if you don't believe it check out some of the signatures of the guys here. Years of negative biopsy results and then, boom. As an example, I had a 12 core done last year. I had the results interpreted by three hospitals. One of the hospitals reported exactly what you have, 11 cores negative and 1 core 1% or less.

I am so stressed over all of this that I just want someone to tell me who the best surgeon is that will give me the best outcome at the best hospital w/out having my wife and family travel far nor myself. Hi, Tazz. Sorry you're here. You're saying you want the best possible care and outcomes, but then you say you don't want to travel to get them. That's not the right perspective to come at this problem with, especially at your age. Finding the right surgeon is not all that difficult, you have made a good start by coming here. If you're like me and several others here, you will decide that the inconvenience and expense associated with obtaining top-notch care, no matter where you have to go to get it, is well worth it. Or you can stay local, let whoever hack you up, and hope for the best. I would say that I narrowed my list of prospective surgeons down to not more than a half-dozen in the entire country. Guys with thousands of procedures under their belts and the outcomes that come with that experience level. Besides what you learn here, US News has lists of the best doctors and hospitals, you can Google it. Often you will find the surgeon's or hospital's web sites will list outcomes in detail. If they don't, you can ask. If they won't or can't tell you, walk away. The top-notch guys are rightfully proud of their outcomes and won't hesitate to tell you. Good Luck Dan",

SBRT has gained acceptance as a primary treatment, but not for salvage treatment. There are a couple of clinical trials going on right now at City of Hope and the University of Virginia using SBRT for salvage treatment. However, I wasn't getting warm fuzzies about them and after consulting a radiation oncologist at a well-known teaching hospital I had pretty much written off SBRT as a salvage treatment.

You don't need an erection to have sex or achieve orgasm, and it will benefit you psychologically and physically. I was back at it 17 days post-surgery. Don't expect great results for a while and both of you need to be mentally prepared for occasional (or even frequent) failures. No big deal. Keep trying. You will probably find that the directions tell you to wait about an hour after eating, I have found that an empty stomach is best. Way, way better than any attempts within a few hours after a meal.

      "Content": "The saturation biopsy has a better chance of hitting any cancer that might be present, and possibly hitting some higher grade stuff that might be missed on a regular biopsy. There are several surgeons with 6000 or more procedures, they get mixed reviews as some of them cherry pick their patients to keep their outcomes looking good. Which is not necessarily a bad thing if they're willing to take you as a patient. I wasn't quite comfortable going the assembly line route so I found a guy with several thousand procedures but didn't make it his life's work to crank out as many prostatectomies as he could. Glad to hear you're willing to travel to find the right surgeon, it can make all the difference in the world. Good luck!",

Don't be surprised on the final pathology report (should you choose surgery) to find you have some G8 or G9 hiding in there that the needles missed. Bottom line is you need to choose the treatment that has the best chance of curing the cancer, otherwise you won't be around to take care of your wife.

Given your age and those numbers, my gut reaction is that they either missed a large chunk of the tumor, misread the slides, or your PSA test was wrong. Or perhaps you also have an enlarged prostate that is contributing to the high PSA readings. I wouldn't even consider \"alternative therapies\" until I got another read of the biopsy results (which will be a different slice than the original) and had a second biopsy. When they do a pathology report, they don't look at the whole sample, just a slice of it. Sorry that this won't serve to calm you down, but on the surface those numbers just don't jive in my opinion. Something's going on that you need to know about before making a treatment decision, and it may very well not be a G6 tumor in 5% of your prostate. Good Luck - Dan",

I now consider myself to be 100% continent for all intents and purposes, and have been since roughly three months or so after surgery. I still get an occasional squirt, but it's typically when I have a full bladder, stretch or move suddenly, and I'm not paying attention. All bets are off after 8 beers, though. As far as the rest of the plumbing, I was ops-checking it 17 days after surgery. Nothing to write home about, but better than nothing. Within a few months, with a little Viagra, it was real good. Now, with a Viagra, I feel like a hormone-charged teenager in the back seat of the old man's car at the drive-in theater. I think I could probably wean myself off the Viagra, but what the heck for? BTW, I quit doing kegels altogether several months ago just because I didn't feel like doing them any longer. All is well.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by mariod PSA 11 , Gleason 6, small tumor, 16 samples taken 5% positive in one sample only. I'll be the contrarian. Given your age and those numbers, my gut reaction is that they either missed a large chunk of the tumor, misread the slides, or your PSA test was wrong. Or perhaps you also have an enlarged prostate that is contributing to the high PSA readings. I wouldn't even consider \"alternative therapies\" until I got another read of the biopsy results (which will be a different slice than the original) and had a second biopsy. When they do a pathology report, they don't look at the whole sample, just a slice of it. Sorry that this won't serve to calm you down, but on the surface those numbers just don't jive in my opinion. Something's going on that you need to know about before making a treatment decision, and it may very well not be a G6 tumor in 5% of your prostate. Good Luck - Dan",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by mariod PSA 11 , Gleason 6, small tumor, 16 samples taken 5% positive in one sample only. I'll be the contrarian. Given your age and those numbers, my gut reaction is that they either missed a large chunk of the tumor, misread the slides, or your PSA test was wrong. Or perhaps you also have an enlarged prostate that is contributing to the high PSA readings. I wouldn't even consider \"alternative therapies\" until I got another read of the biopsy results (which will be a different slice than the original) and had a second biopsy. When they do a pathology report, they don't look at the whole sample, just a slice of it. Sorry that this won't serve to calm you down, but on the surface those numbers just don't jive in my opinion. Something's going on that you need to know about before making a treatment decision, and it may very well not be a G6 tumor in 5% of your prostate. Good Luck - Dan",

Plus, I had two different pathology reports, one reported 40% of one core and the other only 1% because of how they sliced it.

Or when they sliced off a piece for the pathology report they missed it. I only had one positive core but the tumor occupied 20% of the prostate, and they did a 12 core biopsy. Plus, I had two different pathology reports, one reported 40% of one core and the other only 1% because of how they sliced it. Something's causing your numbers, you need to be aggressive until you find out for sure what. Best of luck to you.",

Plus I considered that at my age I would probably have to get it treated eventually anyway, and didn't want to wait around until I got older and make recovery more difficult. Not to mention regaining continence and potency, which seems to be easier the younger you are. Just my opinion.",

      "Content": "Sorry to hear you've joined us, Dunbar. Walsh's book is a good read, another I'd recommend is Winning the Battle Against Prostate Cancer by Gerald Chodak, MD. A little more up to date and covers some different territory than Walsh's. I bought them both, they complement each other. As Replicant stated, your age is a factor and you'll probably find surgery is the recommendation you'll hear most often. But you have to select the treatment that's right for YOU. You would have a better chance of regaining continency and potency after surgery at your younger age, also. If you do choose surgery, find a guy that's done at least 300 procedures. Preferably way more. Prostatectomies are definitely a practice makes perfect operation. If you're going to go robotic, the guy needs to have at least 300 of those under his belt, also. You don't get a do-over, so do it right the first time. I flew 7,000 miles to get a surgeon and hospital I was comfortable with, but understandably not everyone has the resources to do that. Point is, don't limit yourself to the guy close by if you don't feel he can give you the outcomes you desire and you have the ability to travel. Best of luck to you. You're going to find the next month or so to be the most difficult time as you digest all you're about to learn, which makes you realize how much you still have to learn. Then you have to translate all of that into your own treatment plan. Fortunately there's a wealth of experienced guys here to help you along.",

      "Content": "As johnT said, a second biopsy is imperative. Biopsies frequently understate the extent/aggressiveness of the cancer. I considered AS when I was diagnosed too, but two things kept me from it. One was that I just didn't want to risk the biopsy being wrong about the extent (it was wrong) or the aggressiveness (it was right) of the cancer. Yeah, I could have had another biopsy, but I just wanted the cancer gone. The second reason was that assuming I would eventually have to deal with it because of my relatively young age (55), I'd rather do it sooner than later as sooner would give me a much better chance of recovering potency and continence, which I have for the most part. At any rate, everybody has to be comfortable with their decision and treatment plan. Good luck.",

      "Content": "Sorry to hear you've joined us, Dunbar. Walsh's book is a good read, another I'd recommend is Winning the Battle Against Prostate Cancer by Gerald Chodak, MD. A little more up to date and covers some different territory than Walsh's. I bought them both, they complement each other. As Replicant stated, your age is a factor and you'll probably find surgery is the recommendation you'll hear most often. But you have to select the treatment that's right for YOU. You would have a better chance of regaining continency and potency after surgery at your younger age, also. If you do choose surgery, find a guy that's done at least 300 procedures. Preferably way more. Prostatectomies are definitely a practice makes perfect operation. If you're going to go robotic, the guy needs to have at least 300 of those under his belt, also. You don't get a do-over, so do it right the first time. I flew 7,000 miles to get a surgeon and hospital I was comfortable with, but understandably not everyone has the resources to do that. Point is, don't limit yourself to the guy close by if you don't feel he can give you the outcomes you desire and you have the ability to travel. Best of luck to you. You're going to find the next month or so to be the most difficult time as you digest all you're about to learn, which makes you realize how much you still have to learn. Then you have to translate all of that into your own treatment plan. Fortunately there's a wealth of experienced guys here to help you along.",
