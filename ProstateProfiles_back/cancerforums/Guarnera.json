      "Content": "I looked at their statistics. at the 8 year mark, the two were identical. At 10 years, the continuous group had a slight advantage but I don't think it was statistically significant. For some of you facing ADT, discuss both options with your doctor.[/QUOTE] So like I said, I'm new to the club. Does this mean people with PC that has spread to the bone actually live 10 years and up? The Oncologist I saw was kind of slippery with the answers. I know it was the first visit, and she hadn't reviewed the disk with the bone scans yet, But I couldn't get a percentage rate of how many make it 5 years and beyond. All she would say is it depends on if you respond to the treatment. But this sounds encouraging.",

      "Content": "What do they mean by continuous Treatment? For how long? Do they do the Androgen Deprivation for the rest of your life? Or is there a time when they would even stop those, to see if you get a rise? ( in PSA's that is ). I,m Really new to this club. So I've got lots of questions. Thanks for the info. You all have been very helpful so far.",

      "Content": "Hello, My name is Tony, I'm new here. I'm a little concerned. The news just keeps getting better. I have a few questions. First, Can one have prostate cancer without their PSA's going up? I get a regular yearly bloodtest. Last check they were 1. A year to year in a half later they are at 17. Cancer on left side of prostate, stage 4 and 5. Has spread to bone in the hip, pelvice, leg, ribs, spine in several places, and maybe 2 spots in my head. The reason I ask is that I've had this pain in my hip, and pelvice on and off for a couple of years, so If I've had this cancer for several years already, Why didn't it show up as raised PSA's sooner? My other Question is, with the amount this has spread already, Am I like Totally Scewed? This news is all from the biopsy, and bone scan and CAT scan. I have an appointment with the medical ongologist tomorrow morning, and the radiation Doc next Wed.",

      "Content": "Thanks for the reply's. Sorry, I was freaking out a little when I posted. I had just read the bone scan report, but hadn't seen a doctor yet, except the Urologist, who told me over the phone that the report said that there was a spot in the spine in the center of my back. When I read the report I was kind of shocked. I went to the medical oncologist yesterday. I go to see the radiation oncologist next Wed. The urologist Said he would send me the Biopsy report along with the bone scan, and CAT scan results, but didn't. So I don't have all that info at hand. I call today to get those. About my PSA's I was told that they were 1300, before they tried antibiotics, because since it spiked so fast they thought it was an infection. Then after the antibiotics they said it was 1700. I thought there had left out the decimal point. Anyway, I'll get the biopsy report and the blood test results with dates for the last test when they where normal, and the next couple that were high. Oh, I'm 62 years old. It seems that they want to do radiation on my prostate, and hormones for the rest. The Doctor said that they only do Chemo if the hormones don't work. I'll let you all know as soon as I know more myself. Thanks again. Guarnera",

      "Content": "Know that I know I have PC, and that it has spread to the bone, and that I will me getting the hormone therapy, and radiation therapy, how much do I need the urologist? Right now, the urologist will be giving me the hormone therapy. The Medical oncologist wants to give me a shot of some thing for bone health, but she said she could give me the hormones also. It would be easier to just see the radiologist and just one other doctor. Especially if I could get both shots at once. So should I cut the urologist out of the loop for now? Or let him do the shot so he see's me regularly, even if it is just for a monthly shot? How much will I need to see the urologist During all of this if he wasn't giving me the hormone shot? By the way, It's not that I don't like the guy. He is a very nice person and I have no problem with seeing him. Thanks.",
