      "Content": "Hi There, About 6 weeks ago my father was diagnosed with prostate cancer. Gleason score of 9 & PSA of 2.5. His PSA has remained the same having been tested twice over a 5 week period. He's awaiting a bone scan but his MRI has come back clear. He now faces the decision of whether to opt for surgery or go down the route of radiation therapy. The doctor will give no direction whatsoever and has advised that the decision needs to be his own. We're finding this difficult to deal with as we are very afraid of making the wrong choice. Given that his Gleason score is so high I'm worried that there's a chance that the cancer has already spread but is undetectable at present and that further treatment will be required even if he does opt for surgery. Just to point out, we are based in Ireland and robotic surgery is not an option here. I've been browsing through this forum and it appears that many people have opted for the surgery. He's currently reading Patrick Walsh's book. I'd love to hear from other people that have had a Gleason score of 9 and what route they've chosen. I'm finding it difficult to accept that surgery & radiation therapy are equally effective - I want one of them to be better just to make this decision easier..",

      "Content": "Thanks so much for your replies. Just to clarify, that advice came from his consultant urologist who would potentially be operating on him if he were to proceed with surgery. Things work a bit differently over here, I know that many of ye are based in the US. My father doesn't have private healthcare so our options are limited unfortunately. He met with this consultant initially 6 weeks ago for a few minutes to be told he had the cancer and then again yesterday for a catch up on his results. The public health system is under a lot of pressure so time spent with patients is minimal. The expectation is that you inform yourself, which he's doing with the Patrick Walsh book and the pamphlet from the hospital. He has been referred to a radiation oncologist & should hopefully get to see them soon. He's very scared of the surgery & risks that come with it. I thought his PSA was low too & panicked initially thinking it was because the cancer had spread and changed so was no longer identifiable by the PSA reading. Since his MRI is clear this is hopefully not the case. He's 66 & once I get access to his biopsy report I'll post his details here as someone may be able to relate. I'd like to add that I've found the threads in this forum extremely encouraging & helpful - ye are all alive to tell your tales, can't get more encouraging than that!",
