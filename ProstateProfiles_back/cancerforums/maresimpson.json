      "Content": "They don\u0092t think it has spread beyond the prostate, however the numbers are baffling. (And scary). The doctors all feel like he will need to remove prostate, but they won\u0092t know if the scans aren\u0092t showing something more than they are seeing. Are these crazy high numbers necessarily as bad as our fears? Or is it possible for some people to have numbers that seem off the charts?",

      "Content": "My brother-in-law goes to Mayo for physicals. He is currently 66 years old. He was told he could come less frequently than annually since his health was very good, so it was 3-4 years since his last physical . When he went back around 5-6 weeks ago, his PSA level was at around 100. His biopsy revealed cancer, but scans indicated lower grade than numbers. He is currently in hormone therapy and going to Mayo and Northwestern, trying to decide where to have surgery. As I\u0092m reading these posts, I\u0092m not seeing anyone with these kinds of numbers. Any thoughts and/or suggestions?",
