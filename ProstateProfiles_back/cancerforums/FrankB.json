      "Content": "While we're waiting for Mark's results.....this is my first post. I went for a regular blood screen in May (vitamin/diet doctor) and my PSA came back at 17.7 from Quest diagnostics lab! I'm 58 years old and my father had prostate cancer in his mid 70s (successfully treated with proton therapy at Loma Linda). I made quick pace to a urologist. DRE was normal. Another PSA with his lab came back 24.6! Two weeks of antibiotics (levo), wait two weeks, another PSA came back 28.9! MRI ordered and no signs of anything spreading with just one spot of an \"indeterminate abnormality\". Biopsy is scheduled for August 14th. He'll take 16 samples, or \"until my wrist gets tired\" (my doc has a sense of humor). I'll let you guys know what's up...obviously could be a few different things. I just wanted to share and thank everyone for their honest remarks on this forum. It's a huge help. Good luck to everyone!",

      "Content": "Thanks for the special treatment! What confounds the urologist is that the DRE was so normal and that I have no symptoms at all. With a PSA that high, he would expect burning, pain, difficulty urinating, etc. but I have none of that. As I mentioned, I only found this while checking on cholesterol and glucose! My last PSA was ten years ago and that was a 1.3. To add to this, I take finesteride for hair and from what I've read that can falsely bring down a reading, so it might otherwise be even higher?",
