      "Content": "Thanks everyone for your input. I have made an appointment with my radiation oncologist to get his perspective on this issue. Since my original post on Monday regarding this, I have gone through another 7 hour bout of the bleeding with blood clots present also. I have done a lot of reading regarding the possiblity of this being radiation damage, and I am now on board with the notion that this may be the cause. But the bleeding is so extensive, and that is what raised the concern with me. I did have issues with proctitis for a few months following the completion of radiation, but it was never this severe. Thanks, Gary.",

      "Content": "Dave, thanks for the info. It eases my mind somewhat, and gives me confidence that it is something other than a case of recurrent cancer. I will be able to rest my mind until after my appointment with my RA. Be well-Gary.",

      "Content": "I completed my radiation therapy (49 treatments) a year ago this past June. A couple of weeks ago I began bleeding profusely when I urinate. These episodes tend to last anywhere from 4 to 24 hours at a time, with very large amounts of blood in my urine along with blood clots also present. My concern is that my cancer has returned and moved into another organ (bladder ??), but my urologist has assured me that this is just a delayed reaction to the radiation treatments. I trust in him, but I am also concerned that he has come to this conclusion without any testing beyond my most recent PSA (which was in normal range). Does anyone know if my PSA would have to again be elevated for there to be a valid concern for the cancer having moved into another area. Or could there be cause for concern even though the PSA is normal. I should add that the bleeding is very sporadic. It may happen a couple of days in a row, and then not happen again for 3 or 4 days. But I bleed something fierce when it does happen. Any thoughts on this would be appreciated. Thanks.",

      "Content": "Dave-it just occurred to me that the links you sent me all are in reference to proctitis following radiation therapy. Yes, I did have to deal with that for a while. But what I am going through now is severe hematuria while urinating, which is a completely different animal. The proctitus I was warned about and expected, but this was unexpected and quite unnerving at the same time. Again, I have made an appointment to follow up with my RA, and hopefully he will tell me that this is just a part of it. I do thank you for what you have shared with me. Good health to you. Gary.",
