      "Content": "Hello All, I wanted to give update on dad\u0092s diagnosis. Since my last update, doctors did many tests including Biopsy. We do not have complete report on Biopsy results yet. However based on the initial findings from biopsy, doctors (haematologist) are pretty sure that it is Defused Large B Cell Lymphoma (DLBCL). They would like to start treatment with low intensity steroids right away as they they think it\u0092s of aggressive kind. (I could not catch the name of the drug). Other things to note about Dad\u0092s health is he had renal failure with only right kidney functional, his both legs are still swollen (edema), his heart rate is high and he is very fatigued and nauseated.",

      "Content": "My father who is 72 in otherwise good health condition, recently complained about swelling in both the legs. Based on the doctor requested ultrasound which indicates \u0093probably prostate malignancy\u0094 and subsequently requested plain CT scan. CT scan revealed that ill-defined mass legion involving the prostate and posterior inferior wall of urinary bladder. The approximate measure 10.4 x 11.3 x 8.3 cm in size. Both UV junction appeared involved. Multiple enlarged lymph node seen in pre and para aortic, pre and paracaval, left and right common iliac, left and right internal iliac and pre sacral region. Mild to moderate dilatation of both pelvi-calyceal system and utheter. We have PSA test tomorrow. Is this stage IV? Is it curable? What are the next steps for us?",

      "Content": "Hello All, I just wanted to give you updates about my dad. Doctors have been doing tests since last week and it appears that he may not have Prostate Malignancy. Current diagnosis leads doctors to Lymphoma. I have started a new thread in the Lymphoma forum (https://www.cancerforums.net/threads...098#post370098). Thanks for your support until now and I hope we are able to get more information from this forum.",
