      "Content": "Originally Posted by canesmacker . My Dr stated that the facility he set me up with has a 1.5T MRI and the technician is very good at interpreting the scans. He has a relationship w/the technician and I guess they review the scans together to come to an agreement, etc on results. . Sounds like my doctor here in Bergen County NJ. He sent me to Holy Name Hospital in Teaneck (NJ) because of the solid reputation of the radiologist. My MRI was on a 1.5T machine without an ER coil. One little area that was a PIRAD3 score and I had the fusion guided biopsy done yesterday at the Stone Center in Newark NJ. Hoping for good test results in a week or so.",

      "Content": "I'm a 63 year old with a 68cc enlarged prostate and a PSA that varies from 2.6 to 3.1 . I've suffered with prostatitis flare-ups over the past 10-15 years....presumably non-bacterial as the 10-day doxy regimen doesn't seem to help. Taking Cardura and Avodart since mid-July, currently with good success. Flow is better than its been in many years. My primary urologist had been hinting towards a (\"blind\") biopsy. My testosterone is low (209). PSA was 2.6 in Jan 15 (free PSA of .74) but went back up to 3.1 in July. We did a PCA3 test in Sept that came back negative (2) . I went for a second opinion with another urologist who immediately sent me for a MP MRI. This is what I wanted. Unfortunately, the machine was a Siemens 1.5T (and not a 3T) but (thankfully) no ERC was used. The radiologist said findings were compatible with BPH and a PI-RAD score of 2 for the transition zone. However, there was a small focal abnormal signal intensity in the left lateral peripheral zone measuring 1.0x0.6cm, compatible with a PI-RAD 3 lesion. The lesion was mapped for a potential fusion biopsy. (The radiologist notes that this suspicious area is only seen on a single image and no discrete lesion is visible on post-contrast images.) I spoke with the new urologist about possibly re-imaging in 6 months on a 3T machine. He said they used to ignore PI-RAD 3 scores but the thinking has changed as approx 25% of PI-RAD 3's turn out to be cancer (gleason 6 or 7). Not sure insurance is going to cover a 2nd MRI so soon (the first one was 1 month ago today). I'm hoping that the suspicious area might be just an imaging artifact (the MRI table shakes quite a bit during the diffusion sequence) or a remnant from the last bout of prostatitis in August . Is re-imaging on a 3T machine in 6 months a good idea or should I just get the biopsy done now?",
