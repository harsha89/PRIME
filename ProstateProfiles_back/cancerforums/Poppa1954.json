      "Content": "My surgeon is a nice bloke and had 4000+ open surgery RPs at the time of my surgery. When I woke up he said he was pleased with the op BUT found my pelvic cavity was a little narrower than usual and I would have a little more bruising as a result. I had a major haemorrhage about four weeks after surgery followed by another major haemorrhage at seven weeks and again at nine weeks. My grandfather died of PC at 67. My surgeon was perplexed by the number and severity of the bleeds after surgery but I still figure he saved my life. The moral to the story is that surgery ALWAYS carries a risk. I weighed the risks and benefits before I agreed to the surgery and I don't have any regrets. The post op complications were crappy but, if I had done nothing, dying from PC would have been a lot worse. Only you can decide what is best ... you pay your money and you take your chance.",

      "Content": "My sincerest apologies for not expressing my gratitude earlier for the responses above. Thank you for your assistance, it is sincerely appreciated. For anyone finding this thread, I have decided to hold off doing anything other than a bit more exercise and being a little more proactive on portion control in my diet. I have been doing Kegel exercises on and off since the RP (although I didn't know they were called that) and I do feel they help. Also, over Christmas I put on a few extra kilos but have now taken them off through exercise and diet and the incontinence events have reduced significantly. The article provided by 7seas alludes to the effect additional abdominal weight has on increasing incontinence and I think this is important. Perhaps my smaller than usual pelvic cavity also contributes to the added abdominal weight factor. I am also somewhat humbled by the realisation that my problems are quite petty compared to the experience of many others. I can survive without pads etc but so many other prostate cancer survivors can not. In my humble opinion the existence and the effects of incontinence and impotence post RP surgery are severely understated by many in the medical profession. It behoves all of us to spread the word and raise awareness so that men are more informed on their choices and the consequences of each. That being said, I will be forever grateful that I am surviving the cancer as a result of the RP surgery.",

      "Content": "Its over three years now since I had my RP. I have had minor dribbling issues and leakage which now seems to be getting worse albeit slowly. I often have the sensation that the urethra contains urine and is about to leak. If I squat or am tired I have a leak but can shut it off by clenching. It's not serious enough to wear pads but damned annoying when I experience a dribble or leak at work etc. It seems to be happening more often. I have discussed this with my urologist/surgeon and he has suggested having an Advance sling implanted. I have been researching it but getting some conflicting opinions. Someone I have known for ten years or so had a sling implanted post RP for severe incontinence but it stopped working four years or so after it was implanted. He tells me his uro told him that it is common for the slings to fail after 3 years. I am also uncertain what other effects might result from having the sling implanted. I would really appreciate hearing some advice from other PC survivors who have had to deal with incontinence and especially any who have had a sling implanted. Thanks in advance and cheers",
