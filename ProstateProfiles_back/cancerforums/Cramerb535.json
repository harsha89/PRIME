      "Content": "Hello I just turned 38 years old and have been dealing with prostate issues for about 4 years on and off. When I was 34 I had a bad bout of prostatitis but it did not last very long. Almost 2 years ago I had prostatitis for over 6 months and it was hell. I had my PSA tested twice and I had readings of 1.4 and 1.6 but both tests were done during my prostatitis. My symptoms have always been lower back pain, pain while sitting, sometimes weak stream, and pain the day following sex. My current case of prostatitis has all of the same symptoms except not I am having pains radiating into my groin and pubic region. Urologist check for hernia but everything felt normal. Prostate was boggy but no hardness or bumps. I have been prescribed antibiotics once again even though there is no bacteria and I have a prescription for pelvic floor therapy but I am just scared my urologists have been possibly overlooking something more serious. I do not feel like years of this on and off is normal but not sure what else to do or look for. I also worry that some of the pains I feel such as in my back, indicates I have cancer that spread. The one bright spot I guess is I am not lethargic and have not lost any weight. I am very confused and scared and I suppose I am wondering what symptoms are typical of PC, especially at an early stage. No history of PC or cancer other than grandmother had breast cancer. Thanks for any input you may be able to provide!",

      "Content": "For the last 5 years I have had bouts of prostatitis confirmed by either my doc or urologist. My primary symptoms have always been slower urinary stream, feeling like my tailbone area is really sore if I sit on a hard surface. The worst pain is my lower back and nothing seems to help at times but it does wax and wane. I went 6 months recently with no issues and once again out of the blue I have the back pain and urinary discomfort. I had a psa a year and a half ago and it was 1.4 or 1.6 can't remember. Non bacterial as antibiotics did not work. The fact it keeps coming back and more than anything the fact the lower back pain is always an issue when my prostate is irritated makes me think it may be early signs of PC. I did the bad thing about google checking symptoms and worry that's what I have. Any advice?",
