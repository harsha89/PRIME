      "Content": "Originally Posted by HighlanderCFH Hi Fred, Welcome to the forum while also sorry about your diagnosis. Do you know if they will be bathing the entire area -- to cover all those parts -- at the same time? Or will they treat them with individual beams during each visit? I'm not an expert on external beam radiation, but I would think that bathing the entire area to cover everything at the same time would expose your healthy tissue to a wider range of the radiation's effect. Maybe they will individually focus on each target area with individual beams, one after the other. Let's see what others might have to say as the read your question. So please keep checking back. Chuck They will be using IMRT that has a bunch of small shaped beams that avoids good tissue",

      "Content": "Hi, I just found out I have prostate cancer Gleason 7 4+3. PSA 7.0 with a velocity of .8. I had colon cancer 20 years ago, so I do not have a anus for a DRE. Age 69, good health otherwise. My biopsy done by transperenial shows the following; left outer 3+4 80% Benign Benign left inner HGPIN 3+3 5% Benign right outer 3+4 60% 4+3 40% Atypical glands right inner 3+3 10% Benign 3+3 5% Dr. Walshes book and others cover a Gleason 7 with a PSA 10+, but none cover a 7. I am guessing T2c or T3. Radiation??? Thanks",

      "Content": "I had my radiation (IMRT 81 GY) with Lupron the first of 2016 for my T2c, Gleason 7 (4+3) prostate cancer. My testosterone returned by first of Sept. 2016 and I had my first post-Lupron PSA in Oct. 2016 with a reading of .2. My next PSA 4 months later Feb. 2017 was .3. I emailed Phoenix Molecular Imaging with my medical info and asked how high my PSA had to get before the C-11 Acetate PET/CT scan would pick up anything. They called back and said because of my \"doubling time\" of 8 months the scan would work now and set up a scan two weeks later. The scan ($3,000) showed a small tumor near the center of my prostate and he recommended action be taken in weeks as opposed to months. My Urologist poo-pooed the scan (which he never heard of) saying it would take a year or two for all the cancer to die. He said the rise in PSA was Bounce. My next PSA in June 2017 was .4. I bypassed my Urologist and went to a Cancer center supported by MD Anderson and spoke to the Radiation dept head doctor. I had the scan picture with me but he didn't want to see it. He said the PSA couldn't be trusted because of \"Lupron Washout\". He said that Lupron took a year or two to get completely out of my system. 3 doctors 3 answers. Any thoughts?",

      "Content": "Went to Rad Oncologist Friday. He was with MD Anderson for 14 years and is Dept. head of Rad dept at UT San Antonio. He wouldn't look at C-11 scan and blamed PSA on \"Lupron Washout\". I told him I never heard of that term. He said Lupron will stay in fatty tissue for up to two years. I thought Lupron had a half life of 7 to 10 days. Either way, if Lupron is causing false PSA readings I would guess it would cause readings to be low??",
