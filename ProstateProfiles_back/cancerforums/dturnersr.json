      "Content": "Hi, I just got my biopsy results back. Looks like I am in the cancer club now. I was fortunate enough to be friends with RonDef already so he has been a godsend. I've been trying to get up to speed on all this reading your posts. I am also try to be positive about extending my life even if it looks like loosing that pesky prostate gland. From what I know now it looks like my choice is the robotic Divinci. I just got the phone call Thursday and my sit down with the urologist I have now is on 12/5. So, in the mean time I'm trying to get an appointment with Dr. Pattaras from Emory. Does anyone have any experience with him. The doctor I am seeing now is from Rome, Dr. Gilbert I don't even know if he does the Di Vinnci as of yet. I can't help right now much as I am just thrown into this, but I will do anything I can to help anyone of you guys. As I am a disabled veteran I thought I was through health challenges but looks like it continues. However, I am up to the next chapter and many more. Thanks for your support and this forum. David",

      "Content": "Hi, I just got my biopsy results back. Looks like I am in the cancer club now. I was fortunate enough to be friends with RonDef already so he has been a godsend. I've been trying to get up to speed on all this reading your posts. I am also try to be positive about extending my life even if it looks like loosing that pesky prostate gland. From what I know now it looks like my choice is the robotic Divinci. I just got the phone call Thursday and my sit down with the urologist I have now is on 12/5. So, in the mean time I'm trying to get an appointment with Dr. Pattaras from Emory. Does anyone have any experience with him. The doctor I am seeing now is from Rome, Dr. Gilbert I don't even know if he does the Di Vinnci as of yet. I can't help right now much as I am just thrown into this, but I will do anything I can to help anyone of you guys. As I am a disabled veteran I thought I was through health challenges but looks like it continues. However, I am up to the next chapter and many more. Thanks for your support and this forum. David",
