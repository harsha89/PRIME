My husband just wants on with his life and doesn't want to see anyone else and in fact said for me not to go on the forum to ask my friends lol I do know from going through the whole catheter and incontinence experience with him that he would not be a good candidate if radiation affected anything negatively...he'd rather loose a few years than put up with any type of incontinence or bowel issues. He's fully continent now and back to work and ready to charge on with life, although he's still quite fatiqued. I caught up on your thread....took a break away from here for a while.

      "Content": "Thanks all for your responses. Yes Jim the surgeon believes based on research that radiation at any time, because of seminal vesicle involvement, should not be considered because research that concludes it would make any difference. Balancing that with possible side effects...radiation is not his recommendation. If there is recurrence based on PSA, then HT and later chemo if necessary, is his recommended course of action. And MM the lab we had PSA done doesn't measure PSA as fine as others and we didn't know beforehand. I asked surgeon if he should have redone and was told no...just have it done in June at the better lab. And that is end of that. My hubby has already moved on from cancer as he's feeling well and he is fully continent so he's happy and back to work. He doesn't even want to discuss this anymore but I know if he has a detectable PSA he's going to be shocked as he believes he's cured. I've read of other wives who are in similiar situations as mine and they don't want to burst the bubble. Trouble is I guess like Chuck says maybe the surgeon got it all and there is no bubble to burst! I would like my husband to go for a 2nd opinion on this.",

      "Content": "Hi MM...thanks for your response...no lymph node involvement...psa was done at a lab that doesn't measure below zero which we didn't know until we went for checkup. Psa was 39 prior surgery. Staging was pT3bpNOpM according to report. Sorry don't know what assay is? My husband just wants on with his life and doesn't want to see anyone else and in fact said for me not to go on the forum to ask my friends lol I do know from going through the whole catheter and incontinence experience with him that he would not be a good candidate if radiation affected anything negatively...he'd rather loose a few years than put up with any type of incontinence or bowel issues. He's fully continent now and back to work and ready to charge on with life, although he's still quite fatiqued. I caught up on your thread....took a break away from here for a while. How are you doing? I know you didn't receive the best news either...not an easy journey.",

      "Content": "Hubby's pathology was upgraded to Gleason 8, 2 positive margins and seminal vesicle involvement. PSA last week was at zero 12 week checkup. Surgeon is not recommending radiation as says research indicates not effective for this type of cancer...seminal vesicles involved. He says watch and wait...next appt in 3 mths. I am feeling scared about this decision but my husband is very happy cause his interpretation is he doesn't NEED radiation...I want to be positive but am having a hard time...he doesn't know this as I hide it! Anyone have an opinion on no radiation? I guess I was not prepared for this decision and somewhat surprised. My hubby said he was going with whatever the surgeon suggested as he trusts him. Guess I'm less trusting or I wouldn't be posting this!",

      "Content": "Thanks all for your responses. Yes Jim the surgeon believes based on research that radiation at any time, because of seminal vesicle involvement, should not be considered because research that concludes it would make any difference. Balancing that with possible side effects...radiation is not his recommendation. If there is recurrence based on PSA, then HT and later chemo if necessary, is his recommended course of action. And MM the lab we had PSA done doesn't measure PSA as fine as others and we didn't know beforehand. I asked surgeon if he should have redone and was told no...just have it done in June at the better lab. And that is end of that. My hubby has already moved on from cancer as he's feeling well and he is fully continent so he's happy and back to work. He doesn't even want to discuss this anymore but I know if he has a detectable PSA he's going to be shocked as he believes he's cured. I've read of other wives who are in similiar situations as mine and they don't want to burst the bubble. Trouble is I guess like Chuck says maybe the surgeon got it all and there is no bubble to burst! I would like my husband to go for a 2nd opinion on this.",

      "Content": "Hi everyone, this is my first post, ever in my life to any forum but desperate times call for desperate measures! 61 year old husband's cancer diagnosis was confirmed through biopsy last week. He's had rising PSA and multiple negative biopsies starting Jan 2013. PSA was 4.4 first reading, now 39. Found 1 core from 8 with Gleason 4+3 on recent biopsy after MRI found cancer location in anterior. Surgeon says his cancer is high risk due to his high PSA. He has been given stage of T1 as no noted tumor on DRE but I question whether it would be felt on DRE due to anterior location. Surgeon did say he fears tumor is much larger and more advanced than we realize. Bone scan yesterday is clear. Pelvic scan yet to be done. Open radical surgery has been offered (if scans clear) as best treatment followed by probable radiation although we have not seen the radiation oncologist yet - appt. not until Oct 28th. Surgeon felt during our 1/2 hr. appt. that my husband is surgery adverse and said hormone/radiation may be a better option for him. This is all new to us and we are feeling a bit lost in all the jargon and research. We were set to retire next spring and looking forward to the adventures we had planned. This is now a somewhat unexpected blip in the radar as I'm sure it is for everyone on here. We go back and forth between being very scared and being very optimistic...my husband goes back and forth between 'let's get the d... prostrate out of there' to 'I'm not having surgery, too many downsides'. It's an emotional roller coaster for sure. I am supportive of whatever informed decision he decides to make knowing there are many risks and life altering consequences to any treatment. Any tips/advice/support as we move forward?",

We do not have access to the daVinci surgery locally but it is no problem to travel to another province for this - the only issue is there are waiting lists and they may not consider my husband because of his high risk situation.
