    "Content": "Hi All, Good day! My dad diagnosed prostate cancer stage 4 since 2012. CT scan shown some black spot at his back bone Doctor did about 6 times radiotherapy on his back on 2012 Prescribed casodex as oral hormone therapy. My dad's psa dropped from 400-300-200-100-80-60-30-20 Then after 2 years, it climb back to 20-30-60 etc. Doctor Suggested my dad to do chemotherapy but we choose to Try alternative treatment which is Nutritionist. Since 2014 my dad visited nutritionist every month and Did blood test every month and his condition improved much But the psa is still high. Today his psa as high as 370 though his blood Shown there is no cancer mark. Nutritionist suggested my dad Try western to treat his prostate enlargement issue. Then we went to urologist and western medication treatment give us 2 options : I) take 6 samples tissue from prostate to test. I assume it is Biopsy. If it is not cancerous then take medication to control. If it is cancer then he will tell us next plan. 2) surgery to remove 90% of the tissue that cause his prostate Enlarge. May I have your opinion which one should we go for and Anyone of u hear of Veritalife before? Are they trustworthy And good in treating prostate cancer? Pls share your view and I appreciate All your time n suggestion here.",
