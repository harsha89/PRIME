The biopsy Thurs was uneventful, it was done in Houston and hours after the biopsy he was on a plane to New York. No discomfort and no bleeding. He will meet with the doctor and get the results on Wed. TW",

      "Content": "Unfortunately my husband does have prostate cancer. He has taken a couple of weeks off to relax, and then he will research the best doctors inside and outside the country to look after him, with hopefully little distraction from his normal life. He expects the interview process to take a month especially if he needs to travel outside the country. In the meantime we are doing some overnight trips and stocking up on putting sex in the bank in case it takes a little while to get rolling again. Lydia",

      "Content": "I am new to this site, I am here to get an opinion about my husband's care. In a nut shell his psa has risen and is a cause for concern. His ex fianc√© who is an oncologist has come from San Diego to attend our meeting with his urologist(he invited her)It appears he will be having a biopsy done next week to determine if he has pc. In my opinion she is sitting to far forward in her seat and trying to take charge of his care to the point of suggesting if he does have pc then he should ignore surgery and opt for radiation treatment(her area of expertise). I have told my husband we should take no action until w meet with 2 surgeons and discuss a course of action if it turns out he has pc. I think most men have the surgery versus radiation for treatment of pc, am I right in this assumption or is radiation more often the choice, and are there hard numbers available to compare somewhere?
