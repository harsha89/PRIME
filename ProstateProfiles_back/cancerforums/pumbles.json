      "Content": "I will be 60 in September and after having problems with slow flow when urinating, I was diagnosed with PC in April with scores of 7 (4+3) and 6 (3+3) with a PSA of 7.4. Before diagnosis I had tried to imagine what my reaction would be, but I surprised myself and my wife by being cool calm and collected. So, after meeting with my consultant urologist, I preferred to go down the HT and radiotherapy route, and I am on three monthly prostap injections now and have an appointment with the Radiologist in a couple of weeks. I am in a positive frame of mind, although I do get the odd day where I get a bit down, and so far the HT hasn't caused any noticeable side effects. Having said that, not having to shave all the time would be welcome",

      "Content": "Hi Mattie1, I can sympathise with your concerns as I too didn't want to go down the surgery route as I have not been in hospital for any kind of surgery for over 45 years, and after discussions with my urologist and radiotherapist, radiotherapy was seen as a viable route for me, and I would certainly recommend you explore the radiotherapy alternatives. Good luck with whichever path you choose.",
