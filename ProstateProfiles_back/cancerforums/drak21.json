      "Content": "Thanks for the reply Lance. His PSA is 9.4 He is a bit on the frail side (120lbs). His biopsy doctor did not think that the radiation therapy would be a good option. One of my relatives just emailed me a link about this doc who recommends sodium bicarbonate treatment, which I question. Any thoughts on whether this is has any merit? Thanks. Lee",

      "Content": "Hi everyone. My father (age 84) just received the results of his biopsy and he has prostate cancer. On the list of 9 \"Final Path Diagnosis\" items, the Gleason score is 9 (5+4). The prostatic endocarcinoma is 25% of the tissue for three items, 20% for one item, and 10% for the others. What are the best treatment options for his age? He is scheduled to do the bone test in a few days. Thanks for any advice you can offer. Lee",
