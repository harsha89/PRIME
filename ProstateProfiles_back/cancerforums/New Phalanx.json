      "Content": "Hey everybody! I'm one of the new guys on the block. I've just been diagnosed with prostate cancer - just three days ago - PSA 5.68, T1c, Gleason 3+4=7, Grade Group 2, Polaris Score 2.7. The first thing the urologist scheduled is CTT, a cooled thermotherapy treatment. Although I have an enlarged prostate, it's not excessive and I generally have no difficulty in urination. So why is this being scheduled? As you can imagine I was in a little of a fog from the unexpected diagnosis at the time, but I seem to remember the doctor saying it would help with the placement of radio active pellets, even though I still haven't selected what type of treatment I'm going to pursue yet. Does any of this make sense to you? I don't seem to see anybody else that had this type of a treatment right out of the gate... I always worry that the medical industry starts making decisions for me based on their revenue stream rather than my health. I'm anxious to learn as much as I can from you guys, and will try and contribute as positively as I can. Still in a bit of a fog... NP",
