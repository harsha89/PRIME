      "Content": "Sorry I have not been on or responded to everyone's posts. I love everyone's honesty and some sense of humor. I went in for surgery. Was a breeze. Woke up with no pain and was up and walking soon after and left hospital at 11:00AM. I had my doctor take a picture of my prostate. Was very surprised. I will post it if it is not against any policy here if anyone is curious. It is gross. I have had no problem with catheter except I want it out which I go back today for removal and pathology report. I will update everyone on what I find out.",

      "Content": "I am 48 years old and for the last 5 years I have had only prescribed testosterone injections because my body quit producing it naturally. I was diagnosed with HIV in 2010. In September of this year, my blood work showed high PSA count, Specific PSA count was alarming so had biopsy. Wow, what a pain. Showed that 6 on right side was cancer. Had MRI and confirmed that 90% cancer and beginning to protrude. Spoke with Oncologist and Surgeon and have decided to have prostate removed upon both of their recommendations. He said Erections are possible but takes therapy and exercises which I am doing now. However because of no testosterone, I have no desire for sex and think I will just feel like giving up on all that. I am wondering as far as pain, catheter and recovery what is realistic from someone who has gone through it. Surgery is December 22.",
