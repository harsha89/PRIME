      "Content": "Thank you all for your responses and concerns. We have spoken with great surgeons and great radiologists and have faith in their abilities but hate the side effects. We are still looking into the costs. But the costs of repairing surgery and radiation side effect damages is probably high as well. We will speak with two more HIFU doctors and I will report to you! Meanwhile, there is new research evidence that HIFU works really well. So far, the HIFU specialist we just spoke with is interested in doing the entire prostate and not just the side where we have discovered the tumors and cancer cells. At this time, I see no reason why not to do it, if it kills the entire prostate. I am grateful for all of your responses and attention! Kumquat",
