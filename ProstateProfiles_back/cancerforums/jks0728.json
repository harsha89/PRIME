      "Content": "Greeting all, I found this forum after researching elevated PSA levels and looking for some thoughts and guidance. I'm 33, and recently visited a Low T center after an instance of ED with my girlfriend. Upon completion of the bloodworm it was determined that my testosterone was low but they referred me to a urologist as my PSA was high. After visiting the urologist earlier this week he did rectal exam (didn't say anything so assuming no problems) and another PSA test that came back at 2.5. When the nurse called and told me my level she asked about family history of prostate cancer (none) and told me they want to do an MRI. This has me nervous as I've dealt with thyroid cancer at the age of 19 and have been clean over 11 years. I do also have bouts of hemmorhoids as well as edema in my legs that I thought was a result of not having a thyroid anymore but now has me concerned it could be linked to prostate cancer. I don't experience any pain in the groin area other than the occasional twinge in a testicle. Am I being overly concerned or have reason to worry? Anyone have any wisdom they can share with me? I could use some.",

      "Content": "Bike riding is a no as haven't been on one in years but while I didn't have sex there was some heavy petting within 48 hours that caused some some pre-ejaculate fluid but no full release. The blood test was done after the DRE and not certain the PSA level from the first test but have a call into the clinic to check. I appreciate all the positivity you've given, it's eased my tension quite a bit.",
