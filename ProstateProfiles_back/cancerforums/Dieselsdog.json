      "Content": "Michael, The pain was their fault and mine .. First, they didn't numb the area enough. I felt the first staple and the pain was unbelievable. It didn't get any better...five more staples and they were done. Then the nurse removed the catheter when she should have left it in. You have to pass urine prior to them removing the catheter. I was passing blood, not urine. The blood coagulated, blocking all urine from leaving my body. I figured not being able to urinate was normal for the first couple days...man, I was wrong. This went on for 5 days before I called the doctor. A quick trip to the emergency room and a new catheter all pain was gone. About a week later the catheter was removed and things have been great ever since. I would do it again if I needed it. I would just make sure they knocked me out.",

I was referred one time to VA urology and I refused treatment. I wouldn't even let them do a DRE. Within 2 weeks I was at an outside specialist. I did use the head of the VA urology department for a second opinion. They recommend RP (always). I was told they just want to cut the cancer out. As far as your PSA level and still being 100%. You will continue to be 100% as long as you have PC. PSA levels mean nothing (to the VA)..my PSA is only 1.81. After 6 months of treatment (radiation/surgery/whatever) they will reevaluate you, then rate whatever side effects you may have. If you still have PC you will continue the 100% plus any special ratings for side effects. Joe's right about mixing Medical with Choice/VA. I think you'll end up with a large bill. Remember to be assertive with your VA doctors....know one cares more about your health that you. If the VA gives you any static go to the patient advocate office. Best of luck, Dog",

My doctor assured me (after a CT scan) I just had a small cyst in my kidney and it was nothing to worry about. I wasn't happy with my doctor's evaluation so I started digging into my medical records. I found my PSA went from .07 to 2.54 in 6 months. I then went to a Urologist who discovered I had a enlarged prostrate. Making a long story short after a biopsy(2 week's ago) my Gleason scores are three 6's and one 7. I decided AS was the right thing for me. My doctor did send my specimen out for Polaris testing .

Most of the time the urgency is nothing but a few drops and starting takes forever. Also, there's the fun of getting up 3 or 4 times a night to try and urinate. My urologist has recommended a procedure call \"Urolife\". I wanted to know if anyone can tell me if the procedure is worth it. Again, thanks to all. D.",
