      "Content": "I'm a 24 year old male, and I had been to 2 different gastroenterologist recently because of some 'discomfort' I've been having for the past 6-7 months or so; it basically feels like there is a golfball or something stuck in my colon 24/7, and like I constantly need to go to the bathroom. Even after a bowel movement, there is no relief from the feeling. Anyway, after having 2 colonoscopys done that showed nothing abnormal, I had a pelvic CT scan, and the report showed everything normal except for the following: \" The prostate is heterogeneous and measures 4.1 x 2.8 cm.\" \"There is a sclerotic density in the left sacrum and a punctate sclerotic densities in bilateral femoral heads which are nonspecific and may represent bone islands.\" The gastroenterologist didn't mention either of these points (I saw it on the report afterwards), he just said the CT was normal and referred me to a rectal surgeon to see if my problem is muscle related. When I search 'heterogeneous prostate' on the internet, the results are almost exclusively about prostate cancer. Is this a cause for concern, or can it be a normal result on a CT scan?",
