      "Content": "History: First PSA 30 years ago was 9.8 with negative biopsie. Extremely large prostate. PSA continued to rise over 30 years with 6 negative biopsies reaching 44.6 two years ago, this time with a positive biopsie. Fourt y external beam radiation treatments and PSA dropped to 3.6 three months after radiation. Remained at 3.6 until two full years after EBR. Now has risen to 5.1 and Urologist assistant has scheduled me with my Urologist next week to discuss further treatment. He mentioned homone injections. My question: Does one rise in PSA over two years warrant further treatment. That 5.1 reading is till far below the 9.8 thirty years ago. Of Course, I will get a second medical opinion if he suggest that treament. Just wondered if anyone has had a similar experience.",

      "Content": "Pulled my records..actually first PSA was 22 years ago. I am 76 years old, active, involved in my community, no other health issues. My biopsie which reveled the cancer was the \"saturated\" procedure under sedation in the hospital. Not sure of how many samples were taken, but cancer was found in only one sample which my urologist said was on the \"front\" side of the prostate. He was originally concerned that the cancer had been missed on previous biopsies done in his office over the years thus the \"saturated\" session in the hospital. He was pleased that their were no postive results from the \"back\" side of the prostate. Thanks for the replies. Just preparing for my Monday visit and want to ask as many questions as I can. Your comments have helped a lot.",
