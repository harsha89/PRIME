      "Content": "Received my second 45 gm (six month) Lupron injection today in hip. Side effects so far are similar to what others have experienced: hot flashes, low energy, weight gain, loss of libido, and brain fog. The brain fog thing bothers both me and my wife more than the other things. It remains to be seen if my A1C and lipids have changed since being on Lupron. I have a primary care physician appointment next month and will see how my regular blood work turns out. I'm diabetic, have high cholesterol, and high blood pressure. My oncologist suggested stopping the Lupron after the first six months, the urologist wants me to go at least 18 months and preferably 36 months. I kicked the can down the road today and went ahead with another injection.",

The plan at this time to have ADT using Lupron and External Beam Radiation Therapy with a minimum of a month of ADT prior to the radiation. Got the first injection of Lupron today, the 45 mg six month shot. My doctors would prefer me to do three years of the ADT, but they allow that we'll see how things go after a year and a half.

      "Content": "Originally Posted by HighlanderCFH Hi Ozarks, Did the uro give any reason for apparently not offering surgery as a treatment option? With a T2 staging, the biopsy is estimating that the tumors are still all confined to the prostate. Perhaps, with so many positive cores, the uro feels that radiation might be more appropriate in case the T2 is actually aT3. In any case, you would still appear to have a curable case, so hang in there. I looked online and the \"focal increased uptake\" in the bone scan can be caused by other things, such as: infection, fractures or synovitis. Let's see what the others have to say as I also wish you the very best! Chuck Thanks for the encouragement and questions. My uro only performs open surgery. With my additional health risks factors, he said that he would not perform open surgery as he felt that it would be very difficult to perform successfully. He said that he would refer me to surgeons who perform robotic surgery, but in his opinion, they would likely not perform surgery either. I had already researched this myself and was prepared for this direction, so I was not surprised. I have diabetes, sleep apnea, an enlarged heart, degenerative bone disease that has affected my joints and vertebrae, kidney cysts, atrophied pancreas, and am obese at 6'0\" and 325#. The uro said that he felt that it would be extremely difficult to ensure removal of all the cancer through surgery.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by OldTiredSailor Guess I have to jump in here having just gone thru the agony of deciding surgery or radiation in August of this year. The FIRST question that came to mind when I read the OP was \"I wonder why he chose RT rather than RP?\" His choice was also my initial chose but not my final choice. So - it is only natural for someone who has gone the RP/RALP route to quickly ask \"What led you down the decision path to the treatment you chose\" and then compare that reasoning to the reasoning that let me, and many others to RP. Absolutely, great question, and I fully understand the difficult process of deciding which way to go. I researched online, read books, and talked face-to-face with four persons I know what have had prostate cancer. Three went RP and one went EBRT. The one that happened to go EBRT was one of my brothers, two years ago. He was an excellent resource for me. In the end, we make our choice and hope it is the correct one.",
