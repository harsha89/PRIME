Is a wierd situation, you hate the waiting for the result, but also dread having your suspicions confirmed.

      "Content": "Hi My partner is being tested for prostate cancer, I have been doing some research (mainly on this forum). Which has proved to be very informative and very supporting. Will briefly explain the current situation. My partner is 77, very fit for his age. He had a psa blood test which came back at 17. Doctor did rectal exam and commented that he felt a growth and would refer to a urologist. Urologist did rectal exam and said half of prostate was hard, so arranged a biopsy. Had biopsy, I spoke to Dr that did the biopsy, I said the 2 dr's had stated growth and hardness which did he find, he said both of those being the same thing. So now waiting for biopsy results. I suspect this biopsy is going to come back as cancer, although obviously keeping everything crossed that it doesn't So wondering the thoughts of you guys of this situation. Thank you for reading.",

      "Content": "Hi to All It has been a while since you kindly helped me before, regarding my partner, he opted for radiotherapy (after the hormone injection) which he completed, without too many issues, not as bad as he had expected. He had a PSA test I think was about 2 months after completing the radiotherapy and the oncologist said it was undetectable I believe 0.01 He is now due a 6 month follow up, we have received the PSA result before his appt next week, it is 0.3, did call again to make sure we had got it right that is was 0.3 and not 0.03. Am I right in thinking that this is not brilliant news? Obviously will get to discuss at his appt next week, but I wondered if I am being concerned unnecessarily?

It is good to hear all views, I guess there is no definitive answer with considering all things, I guess the best attitude to take is to not get stressed at this time. Something has surprised me, I spoke to a man who did radiotherapy at the same time as us he was slightly ahead of us and Has had his 2nd PSA test, which did come back as 0.01, which is great news, he has been told to have 3 monthly PSA tests, But what has surprised me is that he was told that only if his PSA ever reaches 2.2 or above should he be referred back to the hospital. That seems really high, but I'm no expert. Will update on here after the appointment and thank you once again for your interest and help.",
