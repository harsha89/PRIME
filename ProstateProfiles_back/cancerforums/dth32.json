      "Content": "What does that mean? Well, we have been tracking my PSA for nearly a year now and it has not dropped below 14 during that time. In September I had an MRI that found two nodules in the right portion of my prostate. In November I had an external biopsy and from what I have read from others experience this seems to be the way to go. I was asleep and then I woke up. I had the blood in the urine of course but didn't have to go through being awake with the noises and knowing others were in the room with everything in the open Well my results came back and they found the two nodules that were Gleason 6 3+3. I think my signature explains it. Now to the unicorn.. My doctor hasn't seen anyone with my results, meaning my PSA is so high and my Gleason is 6. This is very abnormal, maybe a 1% or less of cases and he hasn't seen it. He performs the surger 5-7 times a week and has seen countless patients but hasn't seen someone my age(49) with these symptoms. So, I am a bit of a Unicorn. My wife and I went in today fully expecting to opt for surgery but the doctor wants to bring the case to his whole department. I feel like an episode of House honestly. We told him that our choice is for surgery and he said that is one of the options and one he would be leaning towards. I am just rambling on now because I just wanted to put things down in words here. Maybe someone else has seen something like this on this forum. I suppose I have a little more stress since a doctor that has seen thousands of these cases has never seen this before. What is lurking in me that they haven't seen before?
