      "Content": "My husband was recently diagnosed with prostate cancer. He is 63 yrs of age. He had a Gleason 8, 5+3=8, PSA 9, bone scan and CT scan were relatively clear of cancer. He will be scheduling robotic removal of the prostate today. What are the chances that the cancer is contained in his prostate? I would like to hear from others who have had experience with a Gleason 8. Wondering what we can expect. I don't see a lot of posts from others with Gleason 8. We do have the book written by Dr Walsh, 3rd edition.",

      "Content": "I don't have any questions, answers, or words of wisdom, just need a little support. I posted here a month ago or so. My husband at that time was a Gleason 5+3=8. Right: 4 cores of 6 positive, 25% involved by tumor. Left: 3 cores of 6 positive, 2.0% involved by tumor. Prostate size 75 grams.. Bone scan and CT were negative. Da Vinci surgery on Nov 23. Final Path; 1) Left peripheral margin, biopsy; positive 2)Apical margin, positive 3) Posterior apical margin, negative 4) Left peripheral margin, negative, 5) apical margin, negative 6) prostate gland, Adenocarcinoma, Gleason score 4+5=9. Tumor quantification; right and left lobes, percentage of prostate involved by tumor 80% Extraprostatic extension: present. Seminal vesicle invasion: present, right and left Margins: Focally positive for malignancy (apical, bladder neck, anterior lateral) 7)Right lateral biopsy: negative Lymph nodes, (4) right pelvic, 1 node positive (3.8 MM) 9)Lymph nodes, (7) left pelvic, 4 nodes positive (largest focus 10MM) Prostate size 82 grams. Pathologic staging: pT3b pN1 We are in for a battle! We have not made a plan written in stone just yet. We will wait for husband's body to heal and for a 3 month PSA to really develop the plan. Dr said with this path. report, he doubts that his PSA will be 0 in three months. He will more then likely will be starting ADT. Words of encouragement needed!",
