      "Content": "Hi Ron, My husband started Chemo October 1st and he is also stage 4. They used Taxotere (6 rounds every 3 weeks) and the side effects were tolerable. Our doctors also said that new studies show adding Chemo and radiation with hormone therapy is showing great results. The side effects from the hormones will get better. He also had a lot of joint and leg pain (he also has fibromyalgia). Anyway, with the chemo, he lost his hair within the first two weeks... all of it. And he is Italian, so it was a shock. The first treatment was tolerable, but as time went on, the first week of getting the chemo, he would be down for the count. Not too much of an appetite and LOTS of diarrhea. He said it felt like fire coming out of him. The two weeks prior to chemo, he started to feel more human. With the Taxotere, he lost his sense of taste and every finger and toe nail. Now, all of these are growing back and he is able to taste again, but it was really annoying for him. One thing to keep in the back of your head... each person is different of the steroids. My husband was a BEAR when he took them (day prior, day of chemo, and day after). Just remember.... chemo is temporary. Side effects are temporary. It was difficult but a necessary evil.",
