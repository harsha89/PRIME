    "Content": "Hi Mike. I\u0092m Thario and I to was diagnosed at an early age...42. My dad also had PC. I have had the Rodotic surgery and healed very well but am experiencing ED and incontinence I love being above ground and the issues I am having is a fact of life for me. I wear pads and use penile injections to assist with the ED. I was depressed and in a bad way. I am somewhat coping with it now. I am glad I found this forum. It awesome to talk to other men whom are experiencing the same issue I am.",
