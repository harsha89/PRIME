      "Content": "Hi all, In my last biopsy to lymph node mets I was told that I have prostate adenocarcinoma with neuroendocrine differentiation (focally positive for PSA and synaptophysin, and strong for chromogranin). Because my huge lymph node mets (9cm x 5cm) i'm in radiotherapy treatment seeking for less back pain and met shrinkage before go in Cabazitaxel treatment. My doubts: - It is usual to have such a big mets (biggest with 9cm x 5cm, but have others with 3/4 cm) and until now I have no visceral mets or bone mets? - Because my mets have neuroendocrine differentiation it worth to go on enzalutamide? - Why docetaxel was so efective (I really felt greate through the whole treatment) and abireterone didn't work absolutely? Thanks.",
