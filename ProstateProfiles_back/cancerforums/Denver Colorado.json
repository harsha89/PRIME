      "Content": "Have been reading your insights since I was diagnosed last month, am impressed and confused! I have to make the decision between surgery and RT, and although I've met with Oncologists and Prostate Surgeons, I'm as unsure as ever as to what to do. By the numbers: I'm 64 with T2a. Gleason left - 6(3+3) in 2/6 cores 10%, right - 7(4+3) in 4/7 cores 10% PSA scores have gone from 2.59 in 2010 to 12.83 on 6/1/17 (big gap in testing), 14.42 on 6/8/17, and 16.9 on 7/13/17. Besides the obvious Surgery vs. RT question, I have other \"factors\" to think of. I'm with Kaiser and not that impressed with their surgical staff. I turn 65 in October so I can move into the Medicare and supplemental insurance group in a couple of months. Because of my reluctance to have Kaiser do the surgery (I felt good about their RT people), I have priced out self pay and as you all know, it's crazy expensive (but I could do it if I had to). I know my PSA scores and its upward pace is concerning, but the rise could be attributed to lots of things (a fair amount of sex, countless prostate exams, the biopsy that was done on 6/22) Based upon those factors, the two surgeons I've met with out of the Kaiser network felt that I could wait until Medicare kicked in in October, but it's not their life. Also, if there is anyone out there from Denver, I would certainly love to hear recommendations. I have met with a Dr. Mark Jones, who I like but can't find anything out there about him. Obviously, I'm pretty confused, so any suggestions would be well received!",

      "Content": "Thanks for all your feedback. It's good to talk with people who have been through what I'm about to go through! I'm doing my research and will continue to speak with surgeons and RT oncologists. Due to the high cost of self-pay, I will probably spend the next month or so doing some soul searching, make a decision, and find the best person to start the journey with. Narnar, looking at your numbers, it seems we have a lot in common. Thanks for your advise - radiation and hormone therapy might be right for me too. I'll let everyone know how all this shakes out, so if I can be of help for the next guy, all the better!",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by HighlanderCFH Hi Denver, Just wanted to add my own warm welcome to the forum. As you can see, there are a lot of good people here who want to help in any way they can. As you go forward, it would not be a bad idea to grab a copy of the 3rd edition of the Guide to Surviving Prostate Cancer by Dr Pat Walsh. It will be a very helpful reference source for you. Good luck, Chuck Thanks for the words of support! I'm reading about Cyberknife, and although I haven't spoken with anyone who has had it done, the articles make it sound like a safer, more successful form of treatment. Anyone know of this procedure?",
