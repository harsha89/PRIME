You WILL need a prescription from your physician, and be sure that he/she states \"generic substitution allowed\". You'll be able to save quite a bit by ordering in quantity so ask your physician to write the prescription for a 3 month supply and specify the daily dosage. Note that some prescription orders coming to you by mail from outside the US will get caught and seized by US Customs, so order well in advance of your needs. The supplier WILL re-ship at no cost to you but they usually make you wait 3 weeks before re-shipping.",
