      "Content": "I've read and learned enough. My decision is to go HIFU, it came when I took my wife in for her mamogram. The doctor showed us the photo and pointed out the area of possible cancer, or calcification, as they both show up as little diamonds, shiney dots. then she had the biopsy, and it was ultra sound guided, because the ultrasound can indeed show the cancer spots. thank God it was calcification, not cancer. But, I now acknowledge the value of the simple ultra sound machine. Maybe it hasn't been proven to work 10 years out, but nothing has. I just called international HIFU and am gathering up all my data for review by the doctor. I feel very relieved. It's only money afterall, and it's my future I am gambling with. And I have heard that Aetna pays, that's what I have. BTW, thanks lauriejo for your posts, although I've found many people at other sites talking with glowing remarks about their HIFU experience as well. Here is what I found helpful: HIFU for prostate cancer utilizes high intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) to ablate/destroy the tissue of the prostate. During the HIFU procedure, sound waves are used to heat the prostate tissue thus destroying the cancerous cells. Essentially, ultrasonic waves are precisely focused on specific areas of the prostate to eliminate the prostate cancer with minimal risks of effecting other tissue or organs. Temperatures at the focal point of the sound waves can exceed 100oC In lay terms, the HIFU technology is similar to using a magnifying glass to burn a piece of paper by focusing sunlight at a small precise point on the sheet. The ability to focus the ultrasonic waves leads to a relatively low occurrence of both incontinence and impotence. (0.6% and 0-20%, respectively. According to international studies, when compared to other procedures, HIFU has a high success rate with a reduced risk of side effects. HIFU was first used in the 1940s and 1950s in efforts to destroy tumors in the central nervous system. Since then, HIFU has been shown to be effective at destroying malignant tissue in the brain & prostate. Today, the HIFU procedure for prostate cancer is perfomed using a transrectal probe. This procedure has been performed for over ten years and is currently approved for use in Japan, Europe, Canada, and parts of Central and South America. It is completely non-invasive, except you do need a supra pubic catheter installed for 2 to 3 weeks.",

Here is what I found helpful: HIFU for prostate cancer utilizes high intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) to ablate/destroy the tissue of the prostate. During the HIFU procedure, sound waves are used to heat the prostate tissue thus destroying the cancerous cells. Essentially, ultrasonic waves are precisely focused on specific areas of the prostate to eliminate the prostate cancer with minimal risks of effecting other tissue or organs. Temperatures at the focal point of the sound waves can exceed 100oC In lay terms, the HIFU technology is similar to using a magnifying glass to burn a piece of paper by focusing sunlight at a small precise point on the sheet. The ability to focus the ultrasonic waves leads to a relatively low occurrence of both incontinence and impotence. (0.6% and 0-20%, respectively. According to international studies, when compared to other procedures, HIFU has a high success rate with a reduced risk of side effects. HIFU was first used in the 1940s and 1950s in efforts to destroy tumors in the central nervous system. Since then, HIFU has been shown to be effective at destroying malignant tissue in the brain & prostate. Today, the HIFU procedure for prostate cancer is perfomed using a transrectal probe. This procedure has been performed for over ten years and is currently approved for use in Japan, Europe, Canada, and parts of Central and South America. It is completely non-invasive, except you do need a supra pubic catheter installed for 2 to 3 weeks.",

This procedure has been performed for over ten years and is currently approved for use in Japan, Europe, Canada, and parts of Central and South America. It is completely non-invasive, except you do need a supra pubic catheter installed for 2 to 3 weeks.",

      "Content": "I've read and learned enough. My decision is to go HIFU, it came when I took my wife in for her mamogram. The doctor showed us the photo and pointed out the area of possible cancer, or calcification, as they both show up as little diamonds, shiney dots. then she had the biopsy, and it was ultra sound guided, because the ultrasound can indeed show the cancer spots. thank God it was calcification, not cancer. But, I now acknowledge the value of the simple ultra sound machine. Maybe it hasn't been proven to work 10 years out, but nothing has. I just called international HIFU and am gathering up all my data for review by the doctor. I feel very relieved. It's only money afterall, and it's my future I am gambling with. And I have heard that Aetna pays, that's what I have. BTW, thanks lauriejo for your posts, although I've found many people at other sites talking with glowing remarks about their HIFU experience as well. Here is what I found helpful: HIFU for prostate cancer utilizes high intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) to ablate/destroy the tissue of the prostate. During the HIFU procedure, sound waves are used to heat the prostate tissue thus destroying the cancerous cells. Essentially, ultrasonic waves are precisely focused on specific areas of the prostate to eliminate the prostate cancer with minimal risks of effecting other tissue or organs. Temperatures at the focal point of the sound waves can exceed 100oC In lay terms, the HIFU technology is similar to using a magnifying glass to burn a piece of paper by focusing sunlight at a small precise point on the sheet. The ability to focus the ultrasonic waves leads to a relatively low occurrence of both incontinence and impotence. (0.6% and 0-20%, respectively. According to international studies, when compared to other procedures, HIFU has a high success rate with a reduced risk of side effects.

      "Content": "I've read and learned enough. My decision is to go HIFU, it came when I took my wife in for her mamogram. The doctor showed us the photo and pointed out the area of possible cancer, or calcification, as they both show up as little diamonds, shiney dots. then she had the biopsy, and it was ultra sound guided, because the ultrasound can indeed show the cancer spots. thank God it was calcification, not cancer. But, I now acknowledge the value of the simple ultra sound machine. Maybe it hasn't been proven to work 10 years out, but nothing has. I just called international HIFU and am gathering up all my data for review by the doctor. I feel very relieved. It's only money afterall, and it's my future I am gambling with. And I have heard that Aetna pays, that's what I have. BTW, thanks lauriejo for your posts, although I've found many people at other sites talking with glowing remarks about their HIFU experience as well. Here is what I found helpful: HIFU for prostate cancer utilizes high intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) to ablate/destroy the tissue of the prostate. During the HIFU procedure, sound waves are used to heat the prostate tissue thus destroying the cancerous cells. Essentially, ultrasonic waves are precisely focused on specific areas of the prostate to eliminate the prostate cancer with minimal risks of effecting other tissue or organs. Temperatures at the focal point of the sound waves can exceed 100oC In lay terms, the HIFU technology is similar to using a magnifying glass to burn a piece of paper by focusing sunlight at a small precise point on the sheet. The ability to focus the ultrasonic waves leads to a relatively low occurrence of both incontinence and impotence. (0.6% and 0-20%, respectively. According to international studies, when compared to other procedures, HIFU has a high success rate with a reduced risk of side effects. HIFU was first used in the 1940s and 1950s in efforts to destroy tumors in the central nervous system. Since then, HIFU has been shown to be effective at destroying malignant tissue in the brain & prostate. Today, the HIFU procedure for prostate cancer is perfomed using a transrectal probe. This procedure has been performed for over ten years and is currently approved for use in Japan, Europe, Canada, and parts of Central and South America. It is completely non-invasive, except you do need a supra pubic catheter installed for 2 to 3 weeks.",

Here is what I found helpful: HIFU for prostate cancer utilizes high intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) to ablate/destroy the tissue of the prostate. During the HIFU procedure, sound waves are used to heat the prostate tissue thus destroying the cancerous cells. Essentially, ultrasonic waves are precisely focused on specific areas of the prostate to eliminate the prostate cancer with minimal risks of effecting other tissue or organs. Temperatures at the focal point of the sound waves can exceed 100oC In lay terms, the HIFU technology is similar to using a magnifying glass to burn a piece of paper by focusing sunlight at a small precise point on the sheet. The ability to focus the ultrasonic waves leads to a relatively low occurrence of both incontinence and impotence. (0.6% and 0-20%, respectively. According to international studies, when compared to other procedures, HIFU has a high success rate with a reduced risk of side effects. HIFU was first used in the 1940s and 1950s in efforts to destroy tumors in the central nervous system. Since then, HIFU has been shown to be effective at destroying malignant tissue in the brain & prostate. Today, the HIFU procedure for prostate cancer is perfomed using a transrectal probe. This procedure has been performed for over ten years and is currently approved for use in Japan, Europe, Canada, and parts of Central and South America. It is completely non-invasive, except you do need a supra pubic catheter installed for 2 to 3 weeks.",
