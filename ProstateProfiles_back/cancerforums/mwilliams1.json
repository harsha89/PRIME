      "Content": "Hi all. We just came from the screening process for the Tyme prostate study. Wow what a very pleasant group of people. The data from the first study is very promising. We were told about a therapeutic treatment, SM88, with little side effects like tanning. No hormonal effects. We now have to wait to see if he meets the criteria of the study. I also called the company directly and spoke with a staff member. The information was amazing and an overload at the same time. On a separate note, I will get the details of my friend's original diagnosis and post it later. Thank you everyone for allowing me to share and thank you for responding. We are very excited about the opportunity. Have a wonderful day. Footnote: Tom's side effects from adt- loss of libido, weight gain and early stage gynecomastia. His blood pressure increased as well causing him to have a redder face. Not a great look for an Irishman (kidding).",

The questionnaire we filled out did ask why he had stopped ADT therapy. Honestly, he could not tolerate it. His BP skyrocketed on ADT and his face went red. His libido was destroyed. We are committing to this opportunity. PSA lowering and disease regression appear to be very promising from the first study. Thank you all caring and responding.
