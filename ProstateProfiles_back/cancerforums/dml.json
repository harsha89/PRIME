I would be very surprised if the testosterone had anything to do with the cancer. I think it's just that the people most likely to use testosterone and the people most likely to get prostate cancer are two groups with a large intersection. And, I say this as someone who was diagnosed with PCa while on TRT. My PSA when I started TRT was 2.7, which, while technically normal, is above the 2.5 value that some providers use to take further action. Fifteen months into TRT, my PSA was 5, a biopsy confirmed PCA, and I had surgery in January of this year. In July of this year, after 6 months of undetectable PSA levels, I resumed TRT. The older theories, from a single study in 1941, with very few subjects, seem to be very much in doubt now. It seems true that castrate levels of testosterone do prevent (at least temporarily) the advancement of PCa. But, a theory known as the \"saturation theory\" posits that even at a T level as low as 80 ng/dl, the cancer will have all of the testosterone it needs to thrive. So, taking the level to 1080 is not much different than having it at 80. So, unless your levels were under 100 when you started TRT, current theories would say that the TRT had nothing to do with the cancer. I highly suggest you read the book Testosterone for Life, but the link below contains the key final chapter of that book: http://www.lef.org/magazine/2008/12/...cancer/page-01 My surgeon and endocrinologist were both fine with me returning to TRT at 6 months. I self-inject, and if you do return to using it at some point in time, I'd suggest looking at more frequent injections. Even going every 2 weeks, T-cypionate has a half life of 5-7 days and you'll end up on a roller coaster. I inject a mixture of T-cypionate and T-propionate every 4 days and I feel fantastic using that protocol. In some ways, I think that my TRT may have helped me out with the prostate cancer. My PCP no longer routinely does DREs or PSA tests. It was my endocrinologist who performed both (DRE was normal, PSA was not), which led to my cancer being detected and treated.",

I have zero insurance coverage at all, despite many appeals to the insurance company. My price was about $200 per month, but I found an alternative source that is saving me a lot of money. What is infuriating to me is that my insurance company provides great coverage for these meds to their employees, but not to their customers. Well, when they manage plans for self-insured employers, it is up to the employer. But, under the ACA plans in my state, PDE5 inhibitors are not covered at all for help in gaining erections.",

      "Content": "I re-started TRT about 6 months after surgery, with the concurrence of my surgeon and my endocrinologist. The opinions are slowly changing, but it seems to be mostly younger docs who are more open to TRT after PCa. I was the first patient that my endocrinologist and surgeon approved at six months rather than one year. If I'd done radiation, they said they would not have approved it until we had established a PSA nadir after treatment, which can take 2 years or so. Knowing that up front helped me to decide on surgery vs. radiation. The urologist said that my pathology report was good enough (3+4, but low volume and a very low volume of Gleason pattern 4, clear margins, non SVI, EPE, etc.) that he just didn't think I have much to worry about. He also said that maybe there are still cancer cells in there and maybe not, and that resuming TRT won't make any difference at all. The last chapter in the book Testosterone For Life is worth reading. It's on the web at Life Extension Foundation. I thought I posted that URL recently, but maybe not.",

      "Content": "I think the waiting period has been very arbitrary, but it is now gradually shrinking with many docs. For years, it was \"never again\" for TRT. Then, it was 3-5 years post-op for low risk cases with no detectable PSA. Lately, it seems that I hear 1 year as the standard, but I've recently heard of multiple cases that re-started at 3 months after a single non-detectable PSA. My docs compromised with me - going to half of their standard 12 months because of favorable pathology. If they'd left it purely up to me, I might have taken TRT the entire way through my treatment. Regretfully, I think a lot of the reticence these days is the fact that lawyers are now jumping on TRT as evil based on one questionable study released earlier this year, and there are lawsuits (mostly against big pharma so far) out there. I'm guessing the docs are afraid they will be the next targets of the lawyers, and there really are not a lot of quality studies showing long term safety. There are some studies that are supportive though, and Morgentaler mentions them in his book: http://www.lef.org/magazine/2008/12/...Cancer/Page-01",

      "Content": "I have used clomiphene in the past as part of testosterone replacement therapy. My doctor started me on TRT with a protocol similar to what bodybuilders might use. I would use testosterone, arimidex and tamoxifen for about 3 months, and then switch to HCG and clomiphene for a month. To be honest, while I loved the clomiphene, I didn't like using the TRT intermittently, so I've switched to a different protocol. The main side effect I saw from clomiphene was an increased volume of ejaculate, which made orgasms more fun, for me at least. Now that I don't have a prostate, and I'm on continuous TRT, I don't really have a need for clomiphene. But, there are some people for whom clomiphene is sufficient to raise T levels. I wasn't one of those people, due to the cause of my hypogonadism. If clomiphene does work for you, there is no difference in the end result. Clomiphene tells your body to produce more testosterone, if it is capable. Exogenous testosterone also increases T levels. The end effect is the same. In reality, the current saturation theories pretty much say that unless you have castrate levels of testosterone, neither endogenous or exogenous testosterone is going to increase PCA recurrence risk. But, the saturation theory, despite many studies to support it, is still a theory, and I don't think anyone considers the use of TRT to be completely risk free. I feel so much better on TRT that I decided it was a risk I was very willing to take. My surgeon and endocrinologist have previously used one-year post op as the earliest time to re-start TRT. Even then, it had to be done with undetectable PSAs using the ultra-sensitive assay, and there needed to be very unambiguously good post-op pathology reports. In my case, they allowed me to resume at 6 months and my last PSA was < 0.006. Good luck.",

      "Content": "Less than 2 years after my PCa diagnosis and treatment, I was treated for retroperitoneal dedifferentiated liposarcoma. It was suspected to be kidney cancer, but after surgery, the pathology was different than expected. There are only 2000 or so cases of liposarcoma in the US each year and maybe 250 or so that fit my exact diagnosis. So, this will never be on a list of SPCs. I cannot fathom that there is a connection between the two. I was treated for the PCa via RALP and my PSA remains undetectable after 21 months.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by Frenchy Historically, it seems that it is not done. Whether prescribed by a doctor or using an over the counter supplement of some kind, there is research showing opinions are mixed, perhaps even changing. If one thinks about it, if the prostate is no longer there, why would it matter in terms of recurrence? Here is a Harvard link with a sample piece. Let's face it, as we age we no longer have the energy we once had. I was on TRT when my PCa was discovered. I had surgery, a favorably pathology (I had a single small focus of Gleason Pattern 4, the rest was 3, clean margins, etc. Six months after my RALP, I resumed TRT and the QOL that goes with it (for me). 15 months later, my PSA remains undetectable. My doc told me that the earlier TRT did not cause my PCa. He also said that if I have a recurrence, it won't be due to the TRT. Trust me, I have read and researched extensively in this area, as have my surgeon and endo. I was the first person either allowed to resume TRT at 6 months post-op. For me, the QOL gained is worth any potential/perceived risks. Please remember that my body is considered to be completely clear of PCa at this point in time. If I have a recurrence, I imagine the TRT will end at that point in time. I will have my 21 month PSA today. Normally, my docs would have switched me to every 6 months by now, but they were a bit more cautious and I've been tested quarterly since my surgery. Everyone needs to decide what risk they think exists. And, what benefit does the TRT bring. Does one outweigh the other? Taking testosterone \"just because\" makes no sense, IMO. I have a deficiency and it is resolved and I feel so much better with the medication.",
