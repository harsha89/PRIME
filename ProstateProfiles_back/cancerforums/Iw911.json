      "Content": "Hello, I'm looking to see whether anyone on these forums has had any experience or has gone through Proton Therapy for Prostate cancer. I've only been reading positive news of it on the internet and would like to know if these positive results are for real or a load of hogwash. In particular are there any lingering side effects or down sides and if there is a relapse can surgery still be performed after proton therapy. Thank you and looking forward to hearing some good news.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by HighlanderCFH Hi Iw, Welcome to the forum. Like lancepeace, I have to personal experience with proton therapy, but stick around as others here might be able to shed more light on it. The one thing that stands in my mind is that, I believe, this treatment option is still too new to have a track record of success or failure. Lancepeace also gives a good hint to check it out and see if salvage surgery is still a viable possiblity if PT should fail. Good luck! Chuck Hi! Thank you for the welcome. Though I'd rather not be here honestly if you know what I mean. May I know why salvage surgery is harder after PT? What is the reason behind this? Best regards.",
