      "Content": "Earlier this year my PSA tested 4.62, then a new test a few days later tested 4.41. I went to my urologist and he wasn't to concerned. I told him that I was a bit nervous so he recommended a biopsy. I had my biopsy on 6/12 taking 12 cores, and you can see the results down below. Long story short, I have Gleason 7 3+4 in all positive cores. I have a consultation with my urologist on Tuesday. I am new to this, only 56 years old, and would like to hear advise and experience on best treatment for my age and condition. Thanks! 6/14/15 PSA 3.37 4/06/17 PSA 4.62 4/10/17 PSA 4.41 6/12/17 Biopsy Left base negative Left mid negative Left apex negative Right base Gleason 3+4, Grade Group 2, 2 of 2 areas cores involving 95% biopsy tissue.

      "Content": "Update on my surgery: Robotic Radical Prostectomy on 8/9. No lymph nodes taken, nerve sparing, one seminal vessels taken. Foley was taken out on day 6. 100% full bladder control since removal, and no issues since returning home. I have been experiencing pain just below my hips and down into my legs. I believe it is restless leg syndrome. Does anyone have any experience with this? My surgeon expects a full recovering as all margins were negative. Very thankful for the support from this forum.",
