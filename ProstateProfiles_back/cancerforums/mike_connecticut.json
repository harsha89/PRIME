      "Content": "We refused the Lupron and will just \"ride it out\". Dr has given him life expectancy of 6 mos-1 year. His main compliant is that he is dizzy most of the time. Does anyone have any input on that? I was thinking maybe the PC is starting to go to the brain...expecially since sometimes he sees people who arent there. Anyone who has any input would help. I know treatment options at 96 are very limited so I am just bracing for the next few months. At some point I assume he will go to hospice, All infomation/experiences appreciated.",

      "Content": "medicines are flomax, proscar, toprol and norvasc and lexipro. i believe first 2 are for prostate issues. 2nd two are for high blood pressue (he had a stroke 2 years ago) lexipro is for his mood which is generally very bad/combative without it. He probably has had slow moving PC for years...the kind where they say watch and wait and something else will get you first. Except at 96 all the something elses and PC are all coming together now. As i said earlier his weight has gone from 185 to 135 in a year. are there certain criteria when they decide it is time for hospice?",
