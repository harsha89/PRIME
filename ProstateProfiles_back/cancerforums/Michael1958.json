      "Content": "Originally Posted by Michael F Hi M58! I am sure Chuck is going to \"relocate\" your message to a new \"thread.\" A couple of observational points: - Kudos to you for closely monitoring your PSA and overall prostate status - Your prostate is 2 1/2 x \"normal\" sixe of 25 cc. This is a likely cause of your elevated PSA - Your PSA trend is bouncing up and down. PSA increases resulting from PC tend to be a consistent increasing levels vs a bouncing. - Your PSA-free is not suggestive of PC Ask about having a PCA3 test (which requires a DRE). It will provide additional PC risk stratification. This may be the same or similar to the MiPS test. IMO, getting as many \"indicator\" tests is very wise. The only way that PC can be diagnosed is through prostate biopsy. Obviously your urologist has discussed doing a biopsy. Is he convinced it is time to do a biopsy? Your MRI showed a lesion within the capsule. Ask your Uro if he/she can accurately biopsy the lesion (these are like shooting a dart at a small target in a very dimly lit room). The biopsy is no big deal if they use a numbing gel in the rectum followed by lidocaine injections into the prostate. I drove alone to the biopsy appointment and straight home after. I did not have any sedatives, anxiolytics or mood relaxers. IMO, go ahead and get the MiPS test and discuss all of the results with your Team at UM and arrive at a consensus decision if a biopsy is currently indicated or is continued monitoring a better course of action. Good luck and keep us updated! Michael F Hi Michael. Thanks for your response. Your observational points are very helpful. And yes, the MiPS includes PCA3. I think that piece of information will be very helpful. I think even if the MiPS score is low, at this point he will want to do a biopsy. My doctor did say (before I had the MRI) that he thinks the elevated PSA is due to the size of my prostate. Based on my PSA density, if my prostate were normal size my total PSA would be around 1.2-1.4 (assuming same PSA density, but that is probably not a good assumption to use). My urine stream is weak if I do not take Tamsulosin (0.8 mg). I was on Flomax several years ago but my insurance company would no longer pay for Flomax, which is, for me, quite superior to Tamsulosin. Many nights I can sleep through the night or only get up to use the bathroom once. I notice in your case that your total PSA was still not very high, at 2.98 in December 2011. Did your doctor do the biopsy because of your DRE result or because your % free PSA was < 25%? Thank you, Michael",

      "Content": "Hello, first time visitor. Any advice/comments would be appreciated. I have not had a biopsy yet but it is looking like that is the next course of action. I am 57; Caucasian; family history of prostate cancer (father and brother). Normal DRE exam (done 1-2x/year for the past 10 years). Recent elevation of PSA (my baseline is around 2.2-2.4) in the past 10 months: 3.26; 2.96; 4.35; 3.74. My prostate volume shown to be 91 cc (ultra sound) and three weeks later, 81 cc (MRI). Diagnosed with BPH and have been for about 6-7 years. Prostate density based on US: 0.048 Prostate density based on MRI: 0.046 % free PSA: 34.6% The PSA density and % free PSA are a little bit of good news (I think). The PSA velocity (up 0.48 in 10 months) concerns me. MRI PI-RAD score is 3 (presence of significant clinical cancer is equivocal). Range is from 1 (highly unlikely cancer is present) to 5 (highly likely cancer is present). A lesion was found, within prostate capsule. A score of 3 basically means it is still indeterminate. I am considering MiPS testing which measures two urine cancer biomarkers. MiPS testing was created by researchers at the University of Michigan - Ann Arbor. UM is the only lab in the country which does MiPS testing. The MiPS score can help determine if there is an aggressive cancer or low likelihood of finding any cancer at biopsy. Any advice from men who have been through this? Also, how best to prepare for the biopsy? I have a fairly high pain tolerance and needles do not scare me, but frankly, I am very anxious about a prostate biopsy. My doctor said he'd give me something to calm me prior to the procedure (valium or similar). Thank you, Michael",

PHI stands for Prostate Health Index. There are limited number of Uros that do it, its fairly new but from what i've heard, its better than PSA. Its a combination of a number of different tests, but its just a blood draw, like PSA is. If you google \"prostate health index\" you'll get a ton of information Thank you, Pratoman. I did google PHI and will gather some information to take to my Uro. If he does not do the test I will see where I can have it done. From what I have read here thus far, some of you men have been through a lot but it seems you are doing well post-surgery. Michael",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by Ron_G Hi Michael. I'd suggest scouring through the 'sticky' regarding prostate biopsy if you haven't done so already. It's not a big deal though. Was your MRI of the '3T' multiparametric variety? They appear to be the latest models out there. Will your urologist be using your MRI images with the ultrasound images from your biopsy so as to perform a 'fusion guided' biopsy? Most TRUS biopsies seem to be the standard '12 core' variety, however a fusion biopsy may require a couple more needles, but you'll be numb, so don't sweat it! You'll get a valium or something similar for the morning of, as well as an antibiotic. You'll probably be instructed to use a Fleets enema a couple hours before hand to clean your lower colon out (helps prevent infection). At the facility you'll swap out your clothes for a gown (open in the back, LOL!), lie on the table on your side with your legs drawn up towards your rear end. The doc will likely insert the lubed wand/probe for an 'ultrasound-only' look first and take some measurements of your 'parts.' Then comes the numbing needle via the probe (some docs use a numbing gel prior to the needle. I recommend this if it's an option), and then the biopsy needles, which are spring-loaded into a gun of some type. It goes pretty quickly at this point and it didn't really hurt or anything. Afterwards I had to wait in the recovery area until I could pass urine so the nurse could check it for anything unusual before I was released. Hardly any blood back there to speak of! And that's pretty much it. You'll have a little red-tinged blood for a few days and may see a small clot or two pass, but that's normal. Warning! Your seminal fluid will be pretty gross for a little while afterwards, Think TAR! Unfortunately, it's normal too. It'll eventually pass out of your system, after a while. My MRI score was a '3' also and indeterminate. And mine also showed there was no evidence my lesion had escaped the capsule, which made me feel somewhat relieved heading up to my surgery date. Has your urologist had you do a PCA3 test? I ask because of the tests I had, that's actually the one that came back with the best chance that cancer would be found on biopsy. My 'Free PSA' as well as a 'PHI' test weren't particularly favorable for cancer, the PCA3 was. P.S., can you advise your location and/or where you're getting treatment? Ron, thank you for all of your helpful information and comments. You very much helped put me at ease. The MRI was T1-weighted and T2-weighted (unsure what that means), with and without IV contrast. The report says that the lesion \"abuts the capsule but does not show definite capsular disruption.\" I have to say, that worries me the most. MRI findings are \"compatible with benign prostatic hypertrophy\" and \"T2 hypointense lesion with obscured margins at the base of the transitional zone, consistent with PI-RADS 3 category assessment (intermediate). The presence of clinically significant cancer is equivocal.\" The MiPS test includes the PCA3 and the TMPRRS2:ERG urine biomarkers. I haven't discussed with my doctor yet but am going to suggest we do these ASAP. I live in IL. My options were Loyola, RUSH University or Northwestern. I picked RUSH. I like my doctor. I doubt I can afford to go to Mayo or Johns Hopkins. But Chicago does have good hospitals. Michael",

Range is from 1 (highly unlikely cancer is present) to 5 (highly likely cancer is present). A lesion was found, within prostate capsule. A score of 3 basically means it is still indeterminate. I am considering MiPS testing which measures two urine cancer biomarkers. MiPS testing was created by researchers at the University of Michigan - Ann Arbor. UM is the only lab in the country which does MiPS testing. The MiPS score can help determine if there is an aggressive cancer or low likelihood of finding any cancer at biopsy. Any advice from men who have been through this? Also, how best to prepare for the biopsy? I have a fairly high pain tolerance and needles do not scare me, but frankly, I am very anxious about a prostate biopsy. My doctor said he'd give me something to calm me prior to the procedure (valium or similar). Thank you, Michael",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by Michael F Hi M58! I am sure Chuck is going to \"relocate\" your message to a new \"thread.\" A couple of observational points: - Kudos to you for closely monitoring your PSA and overall prostate status - Your prostate is 2 1/2 x \"normal\" sixe of 25 cc. This is a likely cause of your elevated PSA - Your PSA trend is bouncing up and down. PSA increases resulting from PC tend to be a consistent increasing levels vs a bouncing. - Your PSA-free is not suggestive of PC Ask about having a PCA3 test (which requires a DRE). It will provide additional PC risk stratification. This may be the same or similar to the MiPS test. IMO, getting as many \"indicator\" tests is very wise. The only way that PC can be diagnosed is through prostate biopsy. Obviously your urologist has discussed doing a biopsy. Is he convinced it is time to do a biopsy? Your MRI showed a lesion within the capsule. Ask your Uro if he/she can accurately biopsy the lesion (these are like shooting a dart at a small target in a very dimly lit room). The biopsy is no big deal if they use a numbing gel in the rectum followed by lidocaine injections into the prostate. I drove alone to the biopsy appointment and straight home after. I did not have any sedatives, anxiolytics or mood relaxers. IMO, go ahead and get the MiPS test and discuss all of the results with your Team at UM and arrive at a consensus decision if a biopsy is currently indicated or is continued monitoring a better course of action. Good luck and keep us updated! Michael F Hi Michael. Thanks for your response. Your observational points are very helpful. And yes, the MiPS includes PCA3. I think that piece of information will be very helpful. I think even if the MiPS score is low, at this point he will want to do a biopsy. My doctor did say (before I had the MRI) that he thinks the elevated PSA is due to the size of my prostate. Based on my PSA density, if my prostate were normal size my total PSA would be around 1.2-1.4 (assuming same PSA density, but that is probably not a good assumption to use). My urine stream is weak if I do not take Tamsulosin (0.8 mg). I was on Flomax several years ago but my insurance company would no longer pay for Flomax, which is, for me, quite superior to Tamsulosin. Many nights I can sleep through the night or only get up to use the bathroom once. I notice in your case that your total PSA was still not very high, at 2.98 in December 2011. Did your doctor do the biopsy because of your DRE result or because your % free PSA was < 25%? Thank you, Michael",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by Pratoman Michael, welcome to the forum, sorry about your situation, but lets hope it turns out to not be cancer and you are out of here in short order. PHI stands for Prostate Health Index. There are limited number of Uros that do it, its fairly new but from what i've heard, its better than PSA. Its a combination of a number of different tests, but its just a blood draw, like PSA is. If you google \"prostate health index\" you'll get a ton of information Thank you, Pratoman. I did google PHI and will gather some information to take to my Uro. If he does not do the test I will see where I can have it done. From what I have read here thus far, some of you men have been through a lot but it seems you are doing well post-surgery. Michael",
