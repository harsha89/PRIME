      "Content": "Hi 1outof6. I had LDR Brachy done in September of 2012, below is a summary I did after I got home from my implants. It's now some 11 months later and I am doing absolutely great. During the first several weeks post implant, while the seeds are \"hot\" I experienced what I would call a \"slow flow\" when urinating. That was it as far as SE's go, and within a couple of months that too went away. I am fully continent, no issues, and have full sexual functions, no issues - other than reduced fluid at ejac which comes with any of the treatments. 3 weeks after my implants I was back to my routine of 40 minutes of cardio in the morning and an hour of weight training after work. I am absolutely ecstatic with my choice of LDR Brachy, and would be happy to share more details with you if you want to e-mail me. So then here's my dialog of how my day went: Hi everyone - I'm back after my LDR Brachytherapy today. Right off the top, I feel, incredible - physically and mentally! Here's the rundown of my day: Arrived at the XXX Prostate Center in XXX, IL at 11:00 a.m. Was given the paperwork to read and sign in the waiting room, and then Dr. XXX came out to welcome us and bring us in. Nancy the pre-op nurse took all the vitals and so forth, and explained what would be happening. She then hooked up the three-mix cocktail I.V. and we waited for Dr. XXX to come back in. Dr. XXX then also explained what would be happening and as always reassured me that everything would be fine; he also engaged in small talk that was very calming overall - and as I have come to know is simply what he is all about. At 12:30 I was wheeled into the OR where a full staff including the anesthesiologist , nurses and technicians (including Michael and Sonia!) and of course Dr. XXX. I'm not sure but less than 10 minutes later I was in ga-ga land. Next thing I know I'm looking up and asking the staff what time it was - 1:20 p.m.! I was given a total of 61 Iodine 125 seeds at 0.382 mCi per, for a total seed activity of 23.30 mCi. After coming back around for about 10 minutes the urologist / Jane took me down to radiology to perform a cystoscopy to ensure correct placement and quantity of seeds - but first I was shown to the men's room and asked to pee in a bottle so they could observe that I could pee o.k. and also review the volume and color. My first pee after procedure was totally normal - no frequency, burning or uncomfort at all; my results were almost 500 cc's and light, which was my \"get out card.\" The cystoscopy was quick, some scans on my back and more on my side. Jane showed me both views and explained things to me on the spot, everything good and as expected. I requested a copy of the scans and she gave me one on the spot, pretty cool stuff. At 1:40 I was taken over to the recovery room and hooked up with my wife and friend who had accompanied me today. Post Op nurse Susan spent a significant amount of time with us, explaining everything that had occurred, what to expect today, tomorrow, two weeks and answering the \"50-questions\" I posed. We of course were given copies of everything. I was also given post-op meds that included Medrol 4mg (steroid to help in reducing the swelling of the prostate from procedure) - 21 tablets that start out at three a day and over the course of 12 days is weened down to 1 per day; Rapaflo 8mg - 1 tablet daily to assist in urinary function, and even though my initial post-procedure pee was uneventful I'm still going to take this one as cheap insurance. It is supposedly the newest version of Flomax and Susan was good enough to give me a one month supply; Cipro 500 mg - antibiotic 2 per day for 2 days. Dr. XXX gave me his home phone and cell phone and told me to call at anytime with any questions or concerns. I will get a follow-up call on Monday and then the next visit will be in about 12 weeks for a follow up with Dr. XXX and a PSA draw. After all the explanations were given I decided to pee again before leaving, this time about 275 cc's and light colored and again no issues. On the way out I signed out and then asked the receptionist Lili for copies of all of my records to date for my files, which she printed out for me on the spot. So then I guess in summary - qualifying this with I do not yet know how this will all come out - I am beyond appreciation for how this entire process went today with Dr. XXX and his staff. You may have noticed I used everyone's name in this summary - it's because that is exactly how they make you feel, incredibly comfortable both in the professionalism and experience each of them provide for this process as well as how they treat/interact with you. As we left we decided to stop next door at Pappadeaux's Seafood Kitchen, which is essentially next door to the XXX Prostate Center. Had an awesome dinner of fresh grilled fish-kabob and other than some very minor dull pain in the perineum it was like any other out to dinner. . . . some 2 hours post procedure. Best to you, and congrats on making your decision on treatment.",
