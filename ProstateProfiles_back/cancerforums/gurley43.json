      "Content": "As an update and an opportunity to thank all of you for taking an interest and responding to my post here is what has happened since my original post. Sent my biopsy information to Johns Hopkins and they lowered the 8 to a 7. Also, I have decided not to chance the spread of the cancer and have scheduled for Nov 7th to have my prostate removed using the DaVinci robotic process. I chose the Celebrations unit of Florida hospital with Dr Patel who has done over 6000 procedures. My only concern at this point is incontinence and other side effects. Dr Patel is highly recommended but I still think about the risks and after affects of a surgery vs doing nothing at my age.",

      "Content": "I started my prostate cancer awareness completely by chance with a urinary track exam in 2010 and decided to have biopsies. Can't remember any thoughts or concerns about cancer at that time and the biopsy was recommended as precautionary due to my age. Had the 12 part test and 2 cells of the 12 came back with slow growth non aggressive results. First urologist said remove the prostate now. 2nd said with my results and low PSA recommended the watchful wait. In the 2010 time frame my pas was 1.6. PSA test have been conducted every 6 months. All around 2 with little change. 2 months ago I had the second biopsy and 2 cells came back active one with a gleason score of 8 and my PSA rose to 2.6, still fairly low. But with the gleason score I know something should be done. I just cant seem to come to a conclusion on what would be best. I will be 70 in Oct and am healthy and enjoy a good life with my children who live close by and my wife of 33 years. Of course, I want to live as long as possible but I worry about the side effects of the various treatments. Any thoughts on my situation would be appreciated. I wanted to mention too that I had a bone scan and complete MRI and both came back favorable with no cancer detection beyond the prostrate.",
