      "Content": "I had my annual physical yesterday and found out today my PSA is elevated to 11.7. DRE was normal. Last year's physical PSA was .5, and the year before .4. I have spent a lot of time researching Prostate info today. I read the increase could be caused by an enlarged prostate or by an infection. Wouldn't the DRE discover if my prostate was enlarged? My Dr is referring me to a urologist. I'd appreciate any input on what I can expect and what questions I should ask. Trying not to prematurely panic too much. thanks,",
