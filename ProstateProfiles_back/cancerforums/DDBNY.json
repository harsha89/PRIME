      "Content": "Thanks, that could be. He did say 1 of 2 his two tumors are large. I believe Doctor said aggressive. I also think that he could be forgetting or confusing info, which is why I wanted to go with him. I wonder if he has made a decision quickly without researching much.",

      "Content": "Unfortunately as of this week. Luckily he finally listened to me and got checked as he had frequent movements which he just attributed to sugar. He is very stubborn/private so I am doing all homework needed to get a better idea. I believe (could be reversed as he didn't want someone with him at consulation) that his PSA is 6 and his Gleason is 4.2. However his DR. did say 2 tumors, one is larger and \"aggressive\" He is 59 and in good health/shape. He begins radiology on monday which is scary because from what Ive read here, most effected usually have more time to wait. Any thoughts/info appreciated.",

      "Content": "Thanks for the replies. I guess based on previous PSA it was detected. Tumor 1 is large. I'm guessing he has his scores confused and will try to locate them for myself. Doctor is well respected and is an Oncologist.",
