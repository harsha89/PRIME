I can't figure how cancer could cause your PSA to shoot up and then go down since I don't suspect cancer just came and went. If it was me I would research things that cause prostate problems, stop anything that might be causing prostate irritation and get my PSA checked again after 6 weeks or so.

      "Content": "I had my prostate out August 6 with a Da Vinci machine operated by Dr. Ash Tewari at New York Presbyterian Hospital in New York City. I'm 59 years old, had a PSA of 4.9 and a gleason score of 3+3, with two of twelve core samples having cancer cells . The post-op pathology report on the prostate confirmed the cancer hadn't spread out of the prostate. I don't know how many arms the machine had. I had six holes in my belly, and one of them was used for a fluid drain post-op. I was in significant pain after the surgery in the recovery room, but extra doses of drugs stopped that. I was up and walking about 7 hours after the surgery. I walked out of the hospital about 35 hours after the surgery. I've been walking for about a hour a day every day since the surgery. Doctor Tewari has performed over 2000 prostate removals and uses a somewhat unique procedure to reconnect the urethra to the bladder that reduces the incontinence problems. You can read about it on the doctor's website. http://www.theehealth.com/2005art/ I had small urine leaks for the first 5 days but after that I haven't had to use any pads during the day. At night I've had 3 cases of leaking in 25 days. It happens when I'm sleeping very deeply, I've drunk lots of liquid, and the bladder pressure doesn't wake me up. So now I'm trying to make sure I don't drink much before bedtime, and I'm using a pad and sleeping on a couple of small towels at night. I'm doing the kegal exercises everyday and I'm hoping this night time problem goes away. I'm able to get an erection, but it is slower and takes much more stimulation, as well as 20 mg Cialis. I was able to get an erection and masturbate to orgasm on day 8, the day they took out the catheter. I just had to find out if everything still worked. I felt I was healed up enough to try intercourse on day 24. Again it took lots of stimulation to achieve a firm enough erection for penetration but we did accomplish full satisfaction for both partners. After making penetration when the arousal was high the erection was as firm as ever. I've talked to 3 other patients of Dr Tewari and they reported similar results to mine. All of them were 65 to 70 years old. They all encourage me to go to Dr Tewari. They really liked the doctor and his staff. It is strange having an orgasm and not ejaculating. It is a satisfying orgasm, but possibly not as earth shaking as prior to the surgery. From what I've read and what doctors have told me the experience and expertise of the doctor is all important in the out come of your surgery. Research the doctors extensively and get specific data form them on how many surgeries they've performed, and the percentages of patients and over what period of time it took them to regain continence, and obtain erections sufficient for intercourse. My doctor has all this data posted on his website. Check it out. I traveled from Arizona to New York because I wanted the best surgeon possible. I highly recommend him and his staff. A good book to read about prostate cancer is \"Surviving Prostate Cancer, by Dr. Patrick Walsh. Although Dr. Walsh isn't a proponent of the robotic procedures I got the impression he and his staff were somewhat behind the times on robotics. But the book is still a great book to read to know all about this type of cancer. Best of luck with the cancer. Don't settle for just any doctor. Find the best. My neighbor settled for a well meaning local surgeon and a year and a half later he still struggles to get an erection and has more incontinence problems than I do. He's upset with his results.",

I'm able to get erections sufficient to have a sex life. My wife and I are thrilled with the overall results. I want you to know that some things are actually better after having your prostate removed. No more prostatitis, no more difficultly urinating, no more BPH and the medications for it, no more mess during sex from semen. Your wife might think you are an even better sex partner because you most likely will take longer to reach orgasm, there won't be any mess to clean off afterward, and no need for a condom for birth control. I also found that after doing Kegal exercises for months that I am able to delay orgasm by contracting the pelvic floor muscles when I feel and orgasm coming, extending our sexual experiences. Many years ago in my youth I read about men that could indefinitely delay orgasm by doing something like Kegal contractions but it didn't work when I tried it. Now I know I should have practiced the exercises to develop the ability. Oh the pleasure that could have been achieved had I known about Kegals as a young man. So look at the bright side. Some things about your life might actually get better after surgery. I hope no one was offended by any of my comments. I tried to avoid offensive terms and descriptions while telling you some positive stuff that I thought it might be helpful for you to know. I wish everyone the best with their battle with prostate cancer. I hope you can resume a normal life quickly,",

      "Content": "I'm moved by the good experience and results I had with my prostate surgery to tell others with prostate cancer to investigate all your treatment options and to find the best doctors you can. I searched this forum and the internet to find out all I could, and it paid off. On this forum I found out about the amazing results achieved by Dr. Ash Tewari and his robotic procedure. He uses a unique procedure to reconnect the bladder that reduces incontinence. I went to the extra trouble and expense to travel to New York from Arizona to have Dr. Tewari perform the prostate removal at NewYork-Presbyterian Hospital/Weill Cornell Medical Center, located in New York City. I had the surgery on August 6th and was out of the hospital on August 7. I was up a walking about 7 hours after the surgery. I felt good enough on August 8th to walk around New York for about an hour, per doctors orders. The catheter was removed after only 7 days. I had a little incontinence at first during the day but that went away after a couple of weeks. And I've had some leakage at night on 3 nights in the 2 weeks since taking out the catheter. I've been able to achieve erections sufficient for intercourse and had orgasms. But the erections are slower to develop and take more stimulation than before. It's been 3 weeks since the surgery and I expect things to improve over time. The biopsy for the removed tissue indicates the cancer was probably contained to the prostate and I have a 95% chance of it not reoccurring. I'll have a PSA test at 6 weeks. It hasn't all been easy or fun, but I'm thrilled with the results so far because I've heard so many tales of men fighting incontinence and struggling with sexual function for long periods after prostate surgery. I'm 59 years old, had a gleason score of 3+3, 6 total, and a PSA of 4.9. I highly recommend Dr. Tewari. His internet URL is http://www.theehealth.com/2005art/ His web page is very informative. I wish you all the best. If you have questions I'll respond.",
