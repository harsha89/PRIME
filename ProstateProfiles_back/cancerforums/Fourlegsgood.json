      "Content": "My father has prostate cancer and he recently got a swelling in one leg. It came up quite quickly and has stayed. The Dr says that my fathers is due to the enlarged prostate pressing on the lymph system and stopping the drainage of the lymph fluid from one leg. I have tried to get my father to walk to see if that helps but he also gets very tired very quickly and the doctor told him that exercise will not help the swelling and to put his leg up to help ease the swelling. My experience with horses is that exercise does help get rid of swelling due to lymph fluid but my father will not even try to walk a bit due to his fatigue. Do not take what I am saying as being what is happening with your father but I just wanted to let you know of my similar observations with my father. My fathers prostate is advanced but has not metasised. Nick",

      "Content": "Hi, I am a visitor from over in the CRC forum. My 85 year old father has prostate cancer (Gleeson 4+4) and although the prostate is very significantly enlarged it is believed that the cancer is still confined within the prostate. The size of the prostate is such that it has moved on from just pressing on the urethra to where it is now affecting the flow in the ureters from the kidneys into the bladder. A stent was tried with some success for a while but the eventually the flow through that got impeded and the consultant decided that long term nephrostomies are the way forward. He has now had these fitted for 10 days and is at home. So far he seems very much better off. It is hoped that these will also help with his UTI problems which had started to be rather too regular. My father's request via me is whether there are any tips for dealing with the bags and pipes whilst in bed because he is finding them very restricting and is worried about trying to sleep any other way than on his back. In bed he leaves his leg bag on and then attaches that to a night bag on a stand on the floor beside the bed. (all x 2 of course). It's trivial stuff but it helps with the quality of life. Any thoughts? Many thanks, Nick",

      "Content": "Hi guys, My father passed away two years ago due to prostate cancer. His consultant advised me to get my PSA checked when all the dust had settled down. I was my fathers carer right up until the bitter end. Indeed he died in the room where I am typing this. It has taken two years for the dust to well and truly 'settle down' and for my life and brain to return to normal. I take my hat off to anyone who cares for another loved one. So I went to see the nice nurse today and gave the blood sample. Also handed over a urine sample that passed the dip test with no markers present. I go to see the doctor on Friday to get the results and to discuss anything that needs discussing. Hopefully it will be a passing acquaintance with this part of the forum but what will be will be.

Specific to you, staying out of the saddle prior to a PSA test is also advisable. Glad you are vigilant. Remain so! MF I gave it just under 48 hrs of no riding. If a retest is on the cards I'll give it 72 hrs! Nick",
