      "Content": "Thank you guys for the quick and helpful responses. My free PSA came back at 13%. I will follow up on Prostate issues (I took some BPH oriented survey ((maybe at the GreenLight site?)) and got a 19 score) soon plus I don't think the Flomax does much BUT right now I have to focus on the muscle/joint pain. It would be nice to get my shirt and socks on by myself again. The current hurdles are, despite living close to a major teaching med. ctr. (Dartmouth), getting app'ts. with specialists or even my primary. My urology consult was scheduled yesterday for March 27th. So today I enter what my buddies and I call PB mode..pushy bastard. Again, thanks...be well",

      "Content": "I\"m new to this forum and forums in general. I'm also almost totally a technological idiot so please excuse any errors. Anyway, I'm a male, 70 with a current problem of severe pain in shoulders, neck, hips, and legs. So far, all tests for lupus, Lyme, rheumatic arthritis, etc. are negative but my PSA is up to 7 from 4.4 last year. A free PSA is being done now...we will see. My question is this. Can severe muscle/joint pain as I am experiencing be CAUSED by the prostate? Seems illogical to me, especially the shoulder issues but stranger things have happened. Any helpful information out there? Thanks.",
