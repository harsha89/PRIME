      "Content": "G'day Ron, You are justified in being concerned about your low 8% free PSA, because single digit free PSAs are a real warning. Fairwind suggests that the PSA from a 55 cc benign prostate would be between 3.5 and 5.5. From the work I have done on this topic (which is extensive), the PSA produced by a benign prostate is a function of both the prostate volume AND the patient's age. A study by Claus Roehrborn et al identified the importance of patient age. I believe the 0.66 x volume formula by Strum and Pogliano is overly simplistic and only somewhere near accurate for a man in his seventies. For a 57 year old man, I think the PSA of a benign prostate is more like 0.40 x volume. That would mean your PSA should be something like 2.8, and the 4.8 is a bit high, but not overly so. Another comment I'd like to make is to do with trans rectal biopsies. Fairwind is right when he says \"there are areas of the prostate that the trans-rectal probe can not reach\". I am absolutely adamant that if a biopsy is worth doing, it should be at least 20 cores through the perineum by a surgeon experienced in that procedure. It involves a general anaesthetic and a few more dollars, but it gives far superior sampling and a much more accurate result. If it comes up negative, then you are probably negative. The results of a 12 core trans rectal biopsy can mean almost anything. To expand on some of these comments, here is a story about a good mate of mine. He had three negative trans rectal biopsies over a period of about 5 years. However, during that time his PSA continued to rise from about 5 and was up around 13 at the time of his third negative biopsy. His free PSA continued to fall and was down around 9%, but his urologist blindly accepted the last negative biopsy as fact. I felt really concerned about this and counselled him to have yet another biopsy, but this time a 20 core procedure through the perineum. He did so and it came back positive with 3+4 in 5 cores. A few months later he had a da Vinci prostatectomy and the pathology came back showing \"extensive extraprostatic extension\". And this was just within 6 months of the \"negative trans rectal biopsy\". As for Fairwind's suggestion that you could do a course of Avodart and monitor the % PSA reduction, unfortunately a meaningful PSA reduction takes 12 months or more, rather than the sometimes suggested 3 to 6 months. As an example, my own PSA reductions since taking Avodart were 22% at 4 months, 33% at 8 months, 38 % at 11 months, 42% at 14 months and 56% at 18 months. I tend to think that (at this stage in your story) using an \"Avodart challenge\" to test for possible cancer presence is a bit late, although would be a very worthwhile exercise if you didn't have an 8% free PSA. Ron, I'm sorry to be longwinded, and I'm trying not to lecture you, but I really feel that you should consider a trans perineal biopsy with at least 20 cores. If this comes back negative, then you could be pretty sure of being OK. All the best from Brian.",

      "Content": "G'day Fellers, Just been outside laying some pool pavers, but it got too hot in the sun, and with 34°C forecast, it is inside for the rest of the day. It has been a while since I have posted on this Board and since then have had da Vinci robotic surgery after 7 years on AS. Am going great with 99% continence since day one, now 100%. Post surgery PSA was 0.02 and due for my 6 month follow up PSA next month. But still have some work to do with ED. Daily Cialis doesn't do much and Viagra just gets me over the line. So five weeks ago decided to give injections a try. Never thought I would ever do that, but it is amazing how strong the male carnal desire and instinct can be. Started off with Caverject, but too much pain, so changed to Trimix. Took about 8 to 10 injections to get the dose right (have now settled on 10 units) including a few late nights with ice packs and Sudafeds. Also, now after a total of 15 injections, am still not totally comfortable with the injection process, but am getting better. Regardless of that, the experience of having a real erection again after 6 months is worth it. Now for the questions: 1. Being retired and doing plenty of travel, needing a fridge is a problem. Here in NSW, there is a pharmacy that does a three compound mix without Prostaglandin (Alprostadil) especially compounded for travel. It is available in two strengths and has the usual Papaverine and Phentolomine, but has another ingredient called Atropine. Does anyone have any experience with a mix like this without the Prostaglandin? If so, how did it go? 2. There is plenty written about injecting a maximum of 3 times a week, 10 or 12 times a month, etc. and it seems that the restriction is due to minimising scaring, fibrosis, curvature, Peyronies, etc. But what causes these dreaded side effects? Is surely can't be due to the size of the dose, otherwise they would say don't inject more than a certain total number of units per week or month. So the only other thing that can be relevant is the size of the needle itself and the number of times one pokes it into himself. Caverject has a 12.7 mm long x 29 gauge (0.337 mm dia) needle. I am using (and so are a lot of men) an 8 mm long x 31 gauge superfine (0.26 mm dia) needle . Well, the 8 mm superfine needle has 49% of the surface area and only 38% of the volume of a Caverject needle. Is it the surface area and/or bulk volume of the needle that is causing the ill-effects? If so, and if it is OK to stick a Caverject needle into yourself 3 times a week, what is wrong with using an 8 mm long superfine needle every day? Just wondering. Wishing everyone a happy and healthy new year.",

      "Content": "G'day trb, There is almost no-one on the planet less likely to recommend an unnecessary repeat biopsy than me. The main reason for this is my first biopsy nearly six years ago gave me an infection that turned into an abscess which was unsuccessfully treated and that turned into a fistula which took several operations to get fixed. I am now partially incontinent as my anus is not tight enough for adequate control. My second biopsy four years ago was 20 cores through the perineum and that was a much more satisfactory experience, but more importantly, it gets to sample the whole prostate. A mate of mine had three negative biopsies over about five years, but because of a continuing rise in PSA to 12, and a 9% free PSA, he wasn't convinced and finally had a perineal biopsy which was positive with 3+4 in several cores. A subsequent da Vinci procedure found a largish tumour with extraprostatic extension and extensive margin involvement. trb, your free PSA of a low 8% seems like a warning to me (high free PSA is good), and because of that alone, I would have a repeat biopsy in November, but would insist on a 20 core procedure through the perineum carried out by a surgeon experienced in that procedure. It will be a few more dollars, but will give a much more definite and satisfactory result. If that biopsy comes up clean, or maybe a measly one core of small volume 3+3, I reckon you could postpone another biopsy for four or five years, unless there is a unexplained rapid increase in your PSA. All the best from Brian in Australia.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by OTCHU Hello everybody So I am 4 weeks after my surgery. Since 2 weeks I am using Cialis 5mg daily. My Doctor gave me a one month sample for free. My assurance (that I will lose at the end of this month anyway (my wife will be unemployment)) doesn't cover them. Because money situation, I will have a hard time to afford this pills .... I heard about Cialis you can buy online .... Does somebody can help me to found for reasonable price this pills online (PM me if needed) ?? I did fill up already the paper from Cialis.com for another one month supply G'day OTCHU, For nearly four years I have been buying generic Cialis (Tadalafil) from Secure Tabs in India. I have never had a problem with any of my three previous orders, and they always shows up within about 10 days. I have been buying 20mg pills and cutting them into four pieces using scissors, and having one 5mg fragment every day. They work great. This not a back-yard deal, the pills are manufactured by Cipla, one of India's largest pharmaceutical companies. At present, 120 pills plus a bonus 10 pills are US$169.20, with free postage. That means 33¢ per 5mg fragment. And reorders offer a 15% discount. Go to mysecuretabs.com and I'm sure you won't be disappointed. Good luck, Brian in Australia.",
