      "Content": "Hi All, I'm 28 years old and seem to have most symptoms of PC. My Primary doctor thinks I may have a severe prostatitis, but has not done any exams on me for this, and suggested I go see a Urologist. I have an appointment with a Urologist tomorrow to do the rectal exam. My symptoms are: About 2-3 years ago, I noticed I could no longer drink a lot of water before having to go to the bathroom. If I drink a bottle of water right now 500ml , I will have to pee 5 times in order to get rid of that water, and it will be 5 times in the course of about 2 hours. I have a fairly weak urine stream. I have to wait about 20-30 seconds in order for my urine stream to get going. I have back pain all over, but it is very mild and only a minor annoyance right now. Sometimes I feel a stinging sensation from my anus all the way to the tip of my penis. A few weeks ago, I pushed really hard to go to the bathroom, and I think I hurt myself. I felt a surge of pain from my leg to my anus and a few days after, my pelvis area and testicles hurt a lot. I have varicose veins on one of my testies, but they both ended up hurting. Currently I have almost no pelvic pain anymore or testicle pain, but I do have mild back discomfort, and the continued frequent urination and inability to hold my urine. Sometimes I feel pain in my upper back as well (I'm worried if it is cancer, it spread to the liver and other organs now). The back pain began about 10 days ago, when the pelvic pain was at its worse, but unlike the pelvic pain, the back pain has gotten worse. I sometimes have trouble pooping, and take thin stools, sometimes stools that are very flat. I have zero history of PC in my family, I don't smoke, I never drink, I don't do any drugs, and I'm in good shape for my age. I have had a blood test and 2 urine tests including a culture test done, everything came back negative for STDs and other bacteria. What do you guys think? I'm so afraid of having PC at 28 ... I'm in the middle of graduate school, and am now considering dropping my program as the fear didn't allow me to finish my exams this semester, and I have to now take an incomplete. I can't sleep because of the fear, my mother is panicing with me, and so is my girlfrined of 7 years. We are preparing to hear the worse news from the exam tomorrow. .... Any words would be appreciated. Thank you.",
