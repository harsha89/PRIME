      "Content": "Diagnosed in 2008 with prostate cancer. 68 at the time. Gleason 7 with 5 of 12 biopsies cancerous. Underwent 6 weeks of Radiation and seed implants (66) PSA went from 5 to 9 six weeks prior. Post Treatment PSA went down to 0.2 within 3 months. Gradual increase until it reached 1.5 Jan 2014 and then 2.8 in June 2014. Oncologist prescribed full bone scan which showed 3 minor hot spots (hip, pelvis, rib) Discussions concluded that hip and pelvis likely advanced arthritis and rib spot likely due to broken rib/calcification 8 years ago. Prescribed Lupron Depot (22.5) 3 doses- 3 months apart. Have completed 1 had 2nd injection last week. QUESTION: Has anyone else out there had similar treatment and does this prescription sound OK?",
