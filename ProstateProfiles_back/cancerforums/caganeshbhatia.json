      "Content": "Dear All, Thanks a lot for this valuable suggestions. Doctor suggested not to to Chemo due to his ill/weak health. Here, I would like to ask one more question that, Is PSA below 4.0 ng/ml to be considered as normal?? Also whether this increases in multiplication (e.g. 2 to 4, then 8,16,32,64,128 etc.) or any other base & with what kind of time gap? Thanks alot dear friends.",
