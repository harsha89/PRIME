A bit hard to describe, but instead of a good strong erection, it seems like there is something inside the penus that is hard, as opposed to a solid penis. Cannot effect a penetration.

      "Content": "Originally Posted by MartyAtx Yes, less pain with Edex but the results aren't good enough. I was getting great erections with the Trimix, but was too painful for me. Marty I'm curious what you are doing now then. Edex not good enough, Trimix too painful. FYI...i've been doing a lot of reading, and I've read several times that when the pain is too much (not from needle, but from Trimix), it is often a sign of too high a dose. What does your Dr. think about it? Also, some reading I've done has indicated many are getting better results if using a C Ring too. Although, I'm a bit confused as to when you put that on. I have ordered a couple different ones to try.",

In Jan PSA was .01; Apr was .01; Just got another and it is .02. I am presuming that is still not of concern, but just curious if others are seeing no increase at all. I will be seeing my Dr. later this month. But curious what folks are seeing.",
