They have a lot of good info. I had my RALP on December 29 and I was back to work after 3 weeks. Recovery is pretty painless except for the catheter which is a pain in the ass! But it will be out after about a week and it is downhill from there. Hang in there and Happy Easter!",

Only used one pad/day from the beginning and could probably get along without one but I use it just in case of small leaks when lifting. I do however still get up 3 times/night. I am now 2 years post surgery. Don't think that will change. I think the bladder size was reduced or something during the surgery.",

      "Content": "Mike, my continence was good as soon as I had my catheter out. Only used one pad/day from the beginning and could probably get along without one but I use it just in case of small leaks when lifting. I do however still get up 3 times/night. I am now 2 years post surgery. Don't think that will change. I think the bladder size was reduced or something during the surgery.",

      "Content": "RedBull, I am 7 months post-op and 2 months post radiation and have had no erections. It does get depressing and at times I feel like I am letting my wife down but I know she doesn't think that way. It is just hard to accept that life has changed for me forever. I used to have so much energy and since finishing the radiation treatments I can barely mow the yard anymore. I go back to see my urologist today and get my first PSA results post radiation. I will bring up these issues with him and see what I can do about it. Trying to stay positive and hope that in time I can return to a fairly normal life.",

      "Content": "Hi Busby, I was 52 when I had my surgery 3 years ago. I pretty much agree with everyone else on here. I had very minimal pain from the surgery. Spent most of my time on the sofa but made sure to get up and walk around every so often. I only used Aleve for the pain. The prescription meds do cause constipation and you don't want that. I left the large bag on the whole time and only switched to the small leg bag when I went to my apt to have the catheter removed. I found the catheter to be the worst part of the whole ordeal also. I had a lot of pain at the tip where the catheter went in whenever I would move around. If I was sitting still it was fine. I did find that lubricating the tube at the tip helped. Also be sure to pull the tip back a little ways and clean it with a warm rag often. I was marking the days on my calendar to get the damn thing removed and it was a great day! It is a little scary when they are getting ready to pull it out but honestly it wont hurt. Good luck to you and keep us posted.",

I was home alone most of the time but had no problems. I binge watched 5 seasons of Game of Thrones and ate whatever I wanted. The catheter was uncomfortable at the tip of the penis but if you keep it lubricated it is bearable. I had no spasms or excruciating pain. I slept in bed just kept the big catheter bag below me on the floor. Some good advice I got is be careful around door knobs,etc. You don't want to catch that tube on anything and have it pull! My continence came back almost immediately after catheter was out (BTW that is scary when they get ready to pull it out but it really doesn't hurt). It was nice because after surgery I could pee like I was 18 again! Good luck on your surgery you will get through it just fine.",

      "Content": "I have been dealing with some depression and anxiety since this whole PC thing started. Two weeks ago I told my regular doctor about it. He prescribed me some medicine for it. I'm already feeling a little better. On a lighter note, when I asked about any possible side effects of the medication he said \"you may experience some ED\". I just had to laugh!",

I was home alone most of the time but had no problems. I binge watched 5 seasons of Game of Thrones and ate whatever I wanted. The catheter was uncomfortable at the tip of the penis but if you keep it lubricated it is bearable. I had no spasms or excruciating pain. I slept in bed just kept the big catheter bag below me on the floor. Some good advice I got is be careful around door knobs,etc. You don't want to catch that tube on anything and have it pull! My continence came back almost immediately after catheter was out (BTW that is scary when they get ready to pull it out but it really doesn't hurt). It was nice because after surgery I could pee like I was 18 again! Good luck on your surgery you will get through it just fine.",

It seems like it will be excruciating but in fact it was a piece of cake! My continence was good from the start. Just slight dribbling. I wear 1 pad a day and some days I even forget and never had a problem. ED has been a problem for me but I had the 1-2 punch of surgery followed by radiation so that was expected. I just want to stress that even though you may be feeling back to normal, DO NOT do anything strenuous for a while. I tried to move a dresser a couple weeks after surgery and immediately felt it inside my stomach. Good luck to you on the rest of your journey!",

The radiation was really no problem except for some fatigue near the end. I am hoping that the combination of the surgery and radiation has knocked the cancer out. I just want to let you know that the radiation was very easy and not to worry about it.",

I had 38 rounds of adjuvant radiation after I had healed from surgery and as you can see from my signature my PSA has been undetectable since then. I was pretty scared to hear gleason 9 at first but I am feeling pretty much back to normal and am starting to think they may have gotten it all. Hang in there and just make sure your father weighs all of his options. The worst part of this disease for most of us is the side effects from the surgery/radiation/HT, but you learn to deal with them. Just keep giving him your support.",

      "Content": "Hi Smasherie , I am near your fathers age (56) and was also diagnosed as a gleason 7 but upgraded to gleason 9 after surgery. I had 38 rounds of adjuvant radiation after I had healed from surgery and as you can see from my signature my PSA has been undetectable since then. I was pretty scared to hear gleason 9 at first but I am feeling pretty much back to normal and am starting to think they may have gotten it all. Hang in there and just make sure your father weighs all of his options. The worst part of this disease for most of us is the side effects from the surgery/radiation/HT, but you learn to deal with them. Just keep giving him your support.",
