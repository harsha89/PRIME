I began my process on Monday April 10th with infusions of my cells on Thursdays of each week. April 27th was my last day and I was able to complete the process in 3 straight weeks. Reason being, my veins were not good enough to handle the process so they put in a temporary port which allowed me to go each week instead of every other week. My only side affects was being very tired and fatigued after having the white cells removed and also on the days I received my infusions. Removing the port was somewhat strange. I chose not to receive anything to take off the edge. They put a lot of pressure in the area the port, pulled really hard, heard a pop and out it came. They also took blood for a PSA which they called this morning and said it was 4.54. I was expecting much higher if you read my stats and also many patients have much higher PSA with Provenge. Have an appointment the end of May which they may prescribe additional meds. I have a lot of hope the Provenge will work for me and others who decide upon this treatment.

      "Content": "Just a quick update. I was approved for the Provenge therapy which I will start in a couple of weeks. It appears my veins can't support the procedure so they must connect a apheresis catheter in my chest. When I read about Provenge, you really get a mixed bag of comments. In turn, you begin to question whether this treatment is right for your situation. It reminds me of movie Forrest Gump and his quote of \"Mama always said life is like a box of chocolates. You never know what you're gonna get.\" In my case and others like myself, we have to hope we made the right choice. After reading Todd Seals blog, \"Living with Prostate Cancer\", I decided I wanted to use every bullet in my arsenal to defeat this disease that we all hate. If you haven't read his blog, I urge everyone to do so. Lee",

      "Content": "Dave, good to see someone from my neck of the woods with a inspiring message. I lived in Bartlett for years until a divorce. I presently live in Cordova with my Fiancee' of 18yrs. Your message was very uplifting. When I received my biopsy 2&1/2 yrs ago., I was shook up. This time it really rattled my cage. My first thoughts were what did I do wrong? How can all this blow up the way it did in a matter of a few weeks? My Urologist is McSwain @ Conrad Pearson Group. He did the surgery and has been treating me. I have an appointment with him and Dr. Eber today. It was going to take 2 weeks to see him with my bone scan results, and my Internist pursued my bone scan results with a followup CT Scan for their records. They also made an appointment for me @ West Cancer Clinic with Dr. Tian on the 27th. Want to hear what my Urologist has to say and let him know I am getting a second opinion for treatments. We should get together and have a cup of coffee sometime when it's convenient. I will also keep you in my prayers. God can heal us of this dreaded disease if it is his will. Amen",

      "Content": "Dave, good to see someone from my neck of the woods with a inspiring message. I lived in Bartlett for years until a divorce. I presently live in Cordova with my Fiancee' of 18yrs. Your message was very uplifting. When I received my biopsy 2&1/2 yrs ago., I was shook up. This time it really rattled my cage. My first thoughts were what did I do wrong? How can all this blow up the way it did in a matter of a few weeks? My Urologist is McSwain @ Conrad Pearson Group. He did the surgery and has been treating me. I have an appointment with him and Dr. Eber today. It was going to take 2 weeks to see him with my bone scan results, and my Internist pursued my bone scan results with a followup CT Scan for their records. They also made an appointment for me @ West Cancer Clinic with Dr. Tian on the 27th. Want to hear what my Urologist has to say and let him know I am getting a second opinion for treatments. We should get together and have a cup of coffee sometime when it's convenient. I will also keep you in my prayers. God can heal us of this dreaded disease if it is his will. Amen",
