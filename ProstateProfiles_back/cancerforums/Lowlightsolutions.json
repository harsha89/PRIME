      "Content": "There are many here with so much experience. It all seems co complicated. I have not had my biopsy yet. Background: 53 years old Urine flow has been slowing for a period of years. Saw my family physician a few years ago, say 4 years ago. He indicated, you're 50 ish and that's normal. Did a prostate check, identified it as somewhat larger, but perhaps not out of the norm, PSA uncertain. Paid for some private medical tests last June. PSA came out at about 3.53 I think. Was sent to a urologist. He said, I feel a little firmness or something, stay off caffeine, and we'll do a blood test Sep 1st and bring you back in. Had the blood test and returned in September. Was shocked to discover my PSA had jumped to - trying to remember, around 6.87 I think. Can't find my notes. He mentioned a drug but that conversation did not lead anywhere. He indicated that I should get a biopsy. He does the biopsies every two weeks on a tuesday. The next date would be Sept 25th, or two weeks later. I was supposed to be in Montreal that day, then two days later on the 27th I have a public presentation to a couple of hundred people. The doctor indicated that I should likely wait two further weeks as if I came down with an infection, it could be challenging to complete the presentation. So I am currently booked in for two weeks after the 25th. I am now sufficiently stressed by all of this. My questions are as follows. I have not been that comfortable with this urologist. He's not providing me with the high level I need to walk away with. I am not speaking ill of him Seems a good man and a knowledgable fellow, but I still do not feel that comfortable. I must travel from my work, in DT Toronto to east Toronto and complete a hefty walk into an older medical building that feels very cost conscious. A friend who is a nurse indicates that if I am uncomfortable, I should contact the original doctor and get him to make a recommendation to get me into Toronto General hospital, which has a solid reputation. I leave that thought for comment. What if doing this meant a delay. Upon reflection, I now believe that I should cancel my trip to Montreal and take the earlier appointment. It was a senior gathering in my company, but perhaps I ditch it anyway. The increase in PSA worries me and I don't know what it all means, but it seems that sooner is better than later to get the biopsy results. Do you also feel that I should take care of business as soon as possible. Do you feel that getting the biopsy two days before a major presentation is a bad risk. My stress level regarding this is high. Are there any thoughts regarding why the sudden rise in PSA. That's why the biopsy I guess. By the look in the doctor's eyes, I kind of know that he feels it pretty important we move forward. At this point, your general thoughts. Slightly overwhelmed, but still in early stages of examination. Stu",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by akai Hi: I think you already are aware that high PSA score does not mean you have cancer. That said, 3.35 at 53 yrs old is a bit high, hopefully it was caused by the enlarged prostate. There are other tests such as PCA3 that is more cancer specific than PSA. If you are not comfortable with your Uro you should find another one. Biopsy, while extremely uncomfortable, is not that painful. You may not want to travel right after biopsy as you will see blood in your urine, stool, and semen that may freak you out. Find the best care possible, do not compromise, best of luck. Keep us posted. Ask more questions if you need to. thanks very much for responding, PSA actually closer to 7 now. Yes biopsy does not sound pleasant. I may post another question as I'm thinking of changing doctors and there are minor complications.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by johnT I would not get a biopsy just based on a psa. Free psa would have to be abnormal and PCA3 would have to be high. Also I would repeat psa after two weeks of antibiotics to rule out infection. Most doctors are too quick to biopsy before eliminating other more common reasons for psa increases. Considering that out of 1,000,000 biopsies a year, 75% turn out to be negative, it is easier for a doctor to biopsy than to go through the additional steps to confirm that a biopsy is truely necessary. Thank you John T. I do not know PCA3 or what free psa means, but will look it up. Bought the book that was recommended. Will post another question about changing doctors, look forward to your reply.",

      "Content": "I've modified my signature now, but it's based on memory. Will try to confirm these facts. I'm 55 now, with an elevated PSA of about 6.5. It has come down marginally from a peak of about 8.5. First biopsy where 16 cores taken had all negative results. MRI showed no evidence of cancer based on whatever it tells you. Now I'm getting some new doctors and they are recommending some drugs. Avodart and or Flowmax. I know I need to do some research, which I will dig into (part of avoidance while working a million hrs a day), but my initial reaction was twofold. First, putting a 55 year old on drugs that he may have to take for 30 years (if avoid cancer), makes little sense to me. Why would I not investigate surgical solutions to improve urine flow (which is getting worse by the year and is fairly poor now). I think my prostate was 50cc 18 mths ago. Second, I don't really know what a high PSA does tell you, but having an elevated number seems to suggest a higher risk of Cancer, and I believe I should probably get another biopsy, though this has not yet been recommended. I don't know if a big prostate can account for such a high PSA. My father had a very large prostrate with no cancer at 86 years of age currently, but his PSA was really low. So a response to the above thoughts would be appreciated. I was thinking of making a call, or paying the clinic a visit and getting them to schedule another biopsy. Given they just switched me to yet another doctor due to my doctor of choice becoming ill again (feel terrible for him, and he was a recognized expert in Canada on prostrate), I presume I should also investigate this new doctor, find out how many surgeries he has completed, and make a decision on whether to remain with him or change doctors. Any thoughts would be welcome. Meanwhile, I'll confirm my numbers above and revisit my signature as I'm able. I had another doctor pushing drugs as well, but I just don't buy into it, unless it makes sense based on age and situation. The first time it was to relax the prostate, which made some sense, but this time it was as I understand it, to shrink the prostate. thx, Stuart",

      "Content": "Unfortunately I've had a few doctors, particularly because my doctor of choice became ill himself, so they've bumped me around a bit. So fast forward, and I'm uncertain of the confidence level I have of my current doctor but will investigate. I've another six month appointment coming up. It has been about 2.5 years since my initial biopsy. My PSA remains elevated and will get new results soon. It's bounced a bit, but I think it's rising slowly again. Have been on antibiotics twice - early on - does not appear to be due to an infection. Good advice seems to be to keep on top of things. Make sure if there is cancer, it doesn't progress too far. Take the necessary steps etc., How do you know when it's a good time to get a second biopsy. Can you keep receiving biopsies. Another thread as I recall suggested there is a maximum number. I don't see how else I can confirm if there is a real issue. That's question one. Second question. It seems to me that a rebore is a better approach than drugs, given I'm 56, but why would I do a rebore without confirming I am cancer free.

I do feel my prostrate related symptoms are worsening and I know I can't sit back and do nothing. I wish there was a definitive way of testing that didn't involve sticking 20 inch needles up my ass. But that is life I guess. I've very glad your results remain so positive. As I dig in further I'll likely have more questions. thx again, Stuart",

      "Content": "Unfortunately I've had a few doctors, particularly because my doctor of choice became ill himself, so they've bumped me around a bit. So fast forward, and I'm uncertain of the confidence level I have of my current doctor but will investigate. I've another six month appointment coming up. It has been about 2.5 years since my initial biopsy. My PSA remains elevated and will get new results soon. It's bounced a bit, but I think it's rising slowly again. Have been on antibiotics twice - early on - does not appear to be due to an infection. Good advice seems to be to keep on top of things. Make sure if there is cancer, it doesn't progress too far. Take the necessary steps etc., How do you know when it's a good time to get a second biopsy. Can you keep receiving biopsies. Another thread as I recall suggested there is a maximum number. I don't see how else I can confirm if there is a real issue. That's question one. Second question. It seems to me that a rebore is a better approach than drugs, given I'm 56, but why would I do a rebore without confirming I am cancer free. How to I know whether I should advocate for another biopsy, if it is not suggested by my Doctor. Your thoughts are welcome, thx, Stuart",

      "Content": "I've modified my signature now, but it's based on memory. Will try to confirm these facts. I'm 55 now, with an elevated PSA of about 6.5. It has come down marginally from a peak of about 8.5. First biopsy where 16 cores taken had all negative results. MRI showed no evidence of cancer based on whatever it tells you. Now I'm getting some new doctors and they are recommending some drugs. Avodart and or Flowmax. I know I need to do some research, which I will dig into (part of avoidance while working a million hrs a day), but my initial reaction was twofold. First, putting a 55 year old on drugs that he may have to take for 30 years (if avoid cancer), makes little sense to me. Why would I not investigate surgical solutions to improve urine flow (which is getting worse by the year and is fairly poor now). I think my prostate was 50cc 18 mths ago. Second, I don't really know what a high PSA does tell you, but having an elevated number seems to suggest a higher risk of Cancer, and I believe I should probably get another biopsy, though this has not yet been recommended. I don't know if a big prostate can account for such a high PSA. My father had a very large prostrate with no cancer at 86 years of age currently, but his PSA was really low. So a response to the above thoughts would be appreciated. I was thinking of making a call, or paying the clinic a visit and getting them to schedule another biopsy. Given they just switched me to yet another doctor due to my doctor of choice becoming ill again (feel terrible for him, and he was a recognized expert in Canada on prostrate), I presume I should also investigate this new doctor, find out how many surgeries he has completed, and make a decision on whether to remain with him or change doctors. Any thoughts would be welcome. Meanwhile, I'll confirm my numbers above and revisit my signature as I'm able. I had another doctor pushing drugs as well, but I just don't buy into it, unless it makes sense based on age and situation. The first time it was to relax the prostate, which made some sense, but this time it was as I understand it, to shrink the prostate. thx, Stuart",

      "Content": "I've modified my signature now, but it's based on memory. Will try to confirm these facts. I'm 55 now, with an elevated PSA of about 6.5. It has come down marginally from a peak of about 8.5. First biopsy where 16 cores taken had all negative results. MRI showed no evidence of cancer based on whatever it tells you. Now I'm getting some new doctors and they are recommending some drugs. Avodart and or Flowmax. I know I need to do some research, which I will dig into (part of avoidance while working a million hrs a day), but my initial reaction was twofold. First, putting a 55 year old on drugs that he may have to take for 30 years (if avoid cancer), makes little sense to me. Why would I not investigate surgical solutions to improve urine flow (which is getting worse by the year and is fairly poor now). I think my prostate was 50cc 18 mths ago. Second, I don't really know what a high PSA does tell you, but having an elevated number seems to suggest a higher risk of Cancer, and I believe I should probably get another biopsy, though this has not yet been recommended. I don't know if a big prostate can account for such a high PSA. My father had a very large prostrate with no cancer at 86 years of age currently, but his PSA was really low. So a response to the above thoughts would be appreciated. I was thinking of making a call, or paying the clinic a visit and getting them to schedule another biopsy. Given they just switched me to yet another doctor due to my doctor of choice becoming ill again (feel terrible for him, and he was a recognized expert in Canada on prostrate), I presume I should also investigate this new doctor, find out how many surgeries he has completed, and make a decision on whether to remain with him or change doctors. Any thoughts would be welcome. Meanwhile, I'll confirm my numbers above and revisit my signature as I'm able. I had another doctor pushing drugs as well, but I just don't buy into it, unless it makes sense based on age and situation. The first time it was to relax the prostate, which made some sense, but this time it was as I understand it, to shrink the prostate. thx, Stuart",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by Pratoman Lowlight - welcome. Was your MRI a 3tesla multiparametricMRI ? Those things are, from what I understand , about 90% accurate in picking up more aggressive tumors.if you have it done by a skilled radiologist. So it's a good sign that it picked up nothing You should talk to your URO about getting a saturation biopsy which takes many more samples with lower chance of missing something. Don't be too lax on this, being vigilant can make the difference between catching something in time, or not. But again, negative MRI is a good sign. More accurate than a CT scan Well, that's more than I know about MRI's but I'll look it up and then ask the question. I think you're right about being vigilant. I listened to a radio program interview with someone who did wait too long and is paying a very big price in terms of his battle with a very aggressive prostrate cancer. After his initial biopsy, he waited a few years also, and very much regrets it. Are there not some blood tests that can help identify if cancer is there. What about Free PSA or PCA3. Do you know about these tests. thx, and will continue to research all of this. I think this is very much stress related and I have a fairly high stress job. This doesn't change anything, but I think my work life is overdue for change also. thx for posting. Stuart",

Fred, I'm sympathetic to the 6 biopsies thing. Yikes. Wishing you the best. Michael, if you don't mind, what is multiparametric mean. Heck the spell check doesn't recognize it either. I'm having a 3T on May 19 followed by a biopsy, though they did not call it a fusion biopsy, they called it by a different name - Toronto Princess Margaret's hospital. My PSA has jumped again (I refuse to write it down because then it might not be real). When my doctor recommended another biopsy, after getting over a little shock from my newest PSA number, I suggested - would it not make more sense to do an MRI first and then do a Fusion biopsy since they detected nothing the first time through - and saw nothing with the MRI first time though. The last time they did it in reverse order, MRI last, which makes no sense to me. Anyway, he looked over and said, yah, if you want we can do that. OK. I mean I was thinking at the time, I get that it's my life and not yours, but why would he not think that through before making the recommendation. So I booked my MRI and once set, I tracked down the biopsy booking buy, and booked the biopsy to happen soon after the MRI. I did have a pretty good doctor, but he became ill himself I believe, and so I've been bounced around a bit. Finally, I did a little research and chose new doctor, as my last one did not seem to be engaged in my situation at all.

I don't mind MRI's at all. They sound fascinating actually, though I don't care for biopsies. They'd be sticking needles up someone else's ass if I had a choice, but, ce la vie for now. Stuart",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by newporter Here is a look at your PSA history: Based on Memory with some help PSA 3.53 Jun 12 Age 53 (in 2012) PSA 5.5 Aug 12 PSA 6.83 Sep 12 PSA 7.5 Oct 12 Biopsy Oct 12 16 Cores taken all negative PSA 8.5 Jan 13 MRI Apr 13 Negative for signs of Cancer PSA 7.5 Jun 13, PSA 6.4 sept 14, PSA 6.54 Oct 14 I calculated your PSA doubling time to be about 9 years! And if I removed the first reading of 3.53 in Jun 12, your PSA has not change over almost three years! Meaning your PSA is actually very stable, unlike when cancer is present where mostly PSA increases monotonically. I suspect you either have a chronic inflammation of the prostate or an enlarged prostate? Perhaps if you get another negative biopsy, you may want to ask your urologist about it. In addition it might make sense to send your biopsy slides to JH or Mayo for a second read. Most negative biopsies that leads to eventually a positive one have some abnormal cells present like HGPIN, or atypical cells (look at Ray61's signature and mine). Also, did you have any symptoms of BPH or infections and did your urologist prescribed a long course of antibiotics to see if the PSA would come down? Best wishes and hope we can reject your application for membership. Cheers. Well now you're trying to cheer me up, and you succeeded, though my last reading, which was 9.5, I have not posted yet as saying it out loud is putting the fear of you know what in me. They tried one or two short antibiotic sessions as I recall, but not longer ones. I've also had pain in the testicles, the right one in below the prostate in the right leg, but whenever I mention this, doctors don't seem to know how to respond. Tomorrow's the results. I'll cross my fingers that I get an honest result, and some wise feedback and a course of action from my new doctor. thanks Newporter, I appreciate the effort. Stuart",

Fred, I'm sympathetic to the 6 biopsies thing. Yikes. Wishing you the best. Michael, if you don't mind, what is multiparametric mean. Heck the spell check doesn't recognize it either. I'm having a 3T on May 19 followed by a biopsy, though they did not call it a fusion biopsy, they called it by a different name - Toronto Princess Margaret's hospital. My PSA has jumped again (I refuse to write it down because then it might not be real). When my doctor recommended another biopsy, after getting over a little shock from my newest PSA number, I suggested - would it not make more sense to do an MRI first and then do a Fusion biopsy since they detected nothing the first time through - and saw nothing with the MRI first time though. The last time they did it in reverse order, MRI last, which makes no sense to me. Anyway, he looked over and said, yah, if you want we can do that. OK. I mean I was thinking at the time, I get that it's my life and not yours, but why would he not think that through before making the recommendation. So I booked my MRI and once set, I tracked down the biopsy booking buy, and booked the biopsy to happen soon after the MRI. I did have a pretty good doctor, but he became ill himself I believe, and so I've been bounced around a bit. Finally, I did a little research and chose new doctor, as my last one did not seem to be engaged in my situation at all. I have not seen the new doctor yet, but based on my research, he seems to know what he's up to, so I am hopeful. Anyway, I didn't mean to barge in. Just moving through a similar process. I don't mind MRI's at all. They sound fascinating actually, though I don't care for biopsies. They'd be sticking needles up someone else's ass if I had a choice, but, ce la vie for now. Stuart",

      "Content": "Another 20 needles stuck up the old bazooka. This was to be a fusion biopsy. The doctor who performs the biopsy began by telling me that the results from the 3T MRI which I had a week ago last Tuesday (the day before the biopsy), was pretty much identical to the first. In other words, no indication of changing densities or lumps/prospective tumours. But he said he had some experience reading the MRI himself and spotted one small dot, a potential target say, the size of a bean or something like that. Now at this point he suggested that he could probably hit it himself, without using the fusion machine. He mentioned that if he used the machine I'd be much more uncomfortable for a longer period of time (20-25 more minutes). I asked him how much more accurate was the Artemis machine and he said about 10%. Anyway, I only tell you this because I was a little shocked that he would suggest not using this Atremis fusion machine, even if there was only one target. The fact that it was a small target seemed to suggest to me all the more reason to let the machine target it. I told him that he should proceed with the fusion biopsy, even if it was only for the single target. He did so and then switched machines. So he did comply and it took some time to get the disk information into the machine etc. but finally got completed. So only the first four needles were guided as there were no more targets. This is the machine they used. http://urology.ucla.edu/body.cfm?id=550 So twenty needles in total. I didn't care for it. It felt like a staple gun being blasted off. Anyway, you guys know the drill. It finally ended and now - wow - nine days later, Anyway, I have my appointment on Monday with my new doctor, a surgeon, to discuss the results. If they find something - should I be very familiar with the Gleason rating system and what the results might suggest - in order to understand what questions to ask. It is tough to get regular doctors appointments with such specialists, so you have to be fast on your toes when they happen. It was only through this site that I became aware of fusion biopsies, and recommended it to my last doctor, who agreed to comply. Strange system. They are thinking how to save money, and I am thinking how to save my life. If they don't find anything, I still have a pretty darn high PSA. I forgot to take another PSA test when I went in for my MRI. Because of that I took a blood test today, but 9 days after the biopsy. Will the results still be whacked out because of the biopsy? First, if they don't find anything, what should I be asking, and what can I recommend they do. Has anyone ever had surgery when they have not found cancer just to reduce the chances of it spreading because they can't hit it. Is microscopic cancer another form of the same cancer where there are no tumours, and are there different ways of confirming it's presence? Anyway, if there is an area or two that I should read up on before going in, or if there are suggestions as to what I might do next or recommend in the case of negative, or positive results, please jot down your thoughts. It will be a hull of a day no matter what way it goes, and obviously, if I have cancer, I hope they have found it. My meeting is Monday at 3pm. Your thoughts, as always, will be well received. all the best, Stuart",

      "Content": "thanks Jersey Guy and HMS. I've been stressed. As we all get during these trying times. I wish getting good advise from doctors themselves was easier, but this forum is a remarkable place, with more combined knowledge than I could hope for. One of the issues with the way prostate cancer seems to be dealt with, is - if you don't fall into the normal slow cancer growth scenario, they seem to have a much harder time dealing with the situation. Or perhaps it's when there are no tumours but rather the cancer is microscopic that may be adding to the challenge. I may learn the answers to these things, but right now, just feel like I want a definitive shot at life. But waiting for six months, then six months etc, before anything more is done seems so lame. Here's to getting needles stuck up the back side!! My favourite new hobby. Others can still chime in, but I think you've convinced me. Though if frightens me to wait. Stuart",

Then I would have the biopsy two weeks later after ultrasound - if that makes sense. So I'd be waiting a bit. If I just did the biopsy, I could get it done in two weeks and get results much sooner. It appears this is my choice. Your advice is welcome. FYI I was in the process of changing doctors - as I've been bounced around a bit - when I got this PSA result. I've found a solid doctor based on some research. Talked to his secretary today and I'd see him after the results. What are your thoughts on doing the MRI first and waiting six or seven weeks before all is done, or just going straight to biopsy. thx a bunch, Stuart",

I wish getting good advise from doctors themselves was easier, but this forum is a remarkable place, with more combined knowledge than I could hope for. One of the issues with the way prostate cancer seems to be dealt with, is - if you don't fall into the normal slow cancer growth scenario, they seem to have a much harder time dealing with the situation. Or perhaps it's when there are no tumours but rather the cancer is microscopic that may be adding to the challenge. I may learn the answers to these things, but right now, just feel like I want a definitive shot at life. But waiting for six months, then six months etc, before anything more is done seems so lame. Here's to getting needles stuck up the back side!! My favourite new hobby. Others can still chime in, but I think you've convinced me. Though if frightens me to wait. Stuart",

Results all negative. Oct 31 12 PSA 7.5 Told to come back in six months. Had them schedule a blood test on Jan 1.

Urologist and others feel something feels abnormal in digital exam. Meanwhile, second time an antibiotic has been prescribed. Will start it later today. Needed my Tim Horton's coffee this morning. But also apo Alfuzosin prscribed. I have not started taking it. I have the pills but an investigating what this drug is all about and side effects. Now, I don't really like drugs. I'm 54 years old, so this issue will hopefully be dealt with and many years left and all that. I get up to urinate about 3 times at night. Flow is weak no doubt. Side effects and longer run impact of this or other drugs concern me. What is your take on using these drugs. What about this drug as opposed to others. Anyone else had an MRI to look at the prostate. Other thoughts. S.",

      "Content": "thanks for responding LP. I don't know what size it is. Not sure what they do to measure it. No doctor has mentioned anything about size. I know it's been getting bigger for about six years as I've noticed its impact on urine flow. You bring up an interesting thought. What other information could be gathered to prove that I have cancer (given it sort of looks that way). What other non-invansive tests could more or less conclusively support it's existence - as opposed to or in conjunction with a biopsy. I mean if the biopsy misses, then you hang around waiting for time to pass. My PSA is getting kind of high. I will look up free psa blood test to undestand its purpose. I think the MRI is to look at changing densities in the prostrate to allow more focused attack when doing the biopsy. Stuart",
