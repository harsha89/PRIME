      "Content": "Originally Posted by ASAdvocate If I'm reading your number notations correctly, you have a psa of 1.16 ; a free psa of 0.16 ; and a percent free ratio of 13.7. While the 13.7 might be suspicious, the free psa test is not valid for a psa below 4, so you can't dwell on that. In summary, you have a good psa (even for your age), and imaging negative for lesions. If you have not discussed the test with your doctor, do so and consider his/her advice. Otherwise, don't rush ahead and worry yourself needlessly. Thank you very much , for the quick reply...I didn' t know that my free ratio was 13.7 , cause ı do not know how to calculate. As ı understand that reading is not so good but ,not diagnostic un less your readings are between 4 - 10 mg. Well , like you mentioned my total psa reading is quite ok even with my age. But maybe doc will order additional follow up because of my father's aggrressive disease. By the way , my prostate is 27 gr. according to the ultrasound , and there was evidence of ongoing edema , because of my probable prostatities.",

      "Content": "Hi guys, I ' ve been a member at this site for nearly 5 years...But no activites lately. Because of my father's prostate cancer , I used to hang out here ,for gathering information and talking with other people who have more experience about the disease. My father is doing ok , despite a gleason of 4+5 , hanging around for nearly 6 years. Now it ' s about me and my condition...I' ve been having constent back pain and urinery disconfort in my pelvic area and sometimes at my stomach. The pain goes away very rarely , but very mild indeed. I went to see a doctor after 6 months...He asked for complete blood tests ( which was all ok. ) , and urinery test , than an ultrasound. The urinery test and blood tests were all normal , ultrasound was ok, too...But he radiogolojist asked me whether ı had a prostatities or not. He told me that there are some calcification marks on the prostate gland , but then mentioned nothing seems important. After the test result , ı went to se the doc who performed my father' s surgery. I told him what was going on...He listened carefully , and then said , those calcifications seem very minor to me ,and even didn't have the need to check my prostate ( the finger ). He only wanted blood tests of total PSA , free Psa and free/ total PSA . I got the test results today , Total PSA : 1, 16 - Free PSA : 0,16 - Total/ Free PSA : 0,14. Until today , I only cared about total PSA , but from what ı read lately , the less you have a Total / Free PSA , the more likely you might have a prostate cancer. Yet , it is said that when the PSA range is between 4- 10 mg. ,the total/ free psa is much more important...But still ,it made me unconfortabe anyway. So do you guys have any information about this researches , if you do, I ' d like to hear some thoughts and opininions...By the way I 'm 40 years old.",

I am confused about the doubling time, as far as ı know the reading of 0, 198 should be around 0, 400 or something if it's doubled, and if it happens in 6 months, we could call, the doubling time as 6 months !...at least that's what ı know But doc said that the doublıng time is 4 months, and it's even not close to 0,400 mark...but he was tested back to back for 3 months...2013 december ( 0,246 ) , 2014 January ( 0,243 ) , 2014 February ( 0,220 ) and finally 2014 March ( 0,279 )...but at the end if we wouldn't have seen the rise and fall of the number in 3 monts period, we wouldn't have known it...so it would have been 0, 198 and 0,279 in 6 time periods...and in my knowledge it wouldn't have been doubled...so am ı right, or am ı missing something important in this story !!",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by Fairwind Hi Sapporo...Maybe you could put together a brief \"Signature\" to add to your posts so everyone would know your treatment history... Only a few types of PC can spread without leaving a substantial PSA marker..But if you have had recent surgery and these are your last 3 PSA tests, then yes, a visit with a Radiation Oncologist to discuss Salvage Radiation treatment might be in order..Bone scans, at least the ones insurance companies are willing to pay for, seldom show anything until the PSA is north of 50 or so....I would let the R/O make the decision on whether a bone scan would be worthwhile at this point... Fairwind, than you for all the info you've been given, ı hope you're doing well with your treatment too. Unless it's small cell carcinoma or another rare type of pc, it unlıkely to met the bones, but at the end of the night it's G-9. Well ı think doc made the decision, friday is scheculed for the bone scan, hope we don't see any suprises. Anyone who have no clue about my father pc, here is the summary. He has been diagnosed on early june of 2011, and had surgery on march 4 2011. The biopsi showed melignancy on 9 of 12 samples from the prostate, and gleason was 8 by then. But after the surgery it upgraded to G-9 ( 4 + 5 ) the path report wasn't that bad, but surely it had something....no seminal or lymph node invasion, positif margine, and also identified micro meth on the bllader neck. Then first psa came...it was 0,009, then the second one 0,012, then lıke that...0,009, 0,017, 00,25, 00,45, 00,64, 00,85, 0,112, 0,135, 0,198, 0,243, 0,240, 0,220 and finally as you know 0,279 it's been 3 years...he has come this far without any further treatment but operation...",
