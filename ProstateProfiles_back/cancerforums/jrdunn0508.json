    "Content": "Hi, I am the son of a cancer survivor who had stage 4 prostate cancer that spread to his bones. He successfully completed radiation and chemo and was doing well but now spread to the lymph nodes. He is an inspiration to me and shows me what it means to be strong. Since his diagnosis, I have seen just how many people have been affected by prostate cancer and it is astonishing. Over 1 in 7 men are effected by it! I really wanted to do something to help and I signed up for my first charity road race, the ZeroProstate 5K in Massachusetts. I would love if you would like to donate in somebodys memory or honor! MODERATOR'S NOTE: WELCOME ABOARD, JRDUNN. AS THE RELATIVE OF A PC SURVIVOR, WE ARE GLAD TO HAVE YOU WITH US. HOWEVER, I HAD TO REMOVE THE LINK YOU PROVIDED BECAUSE THE SITE'S POLICY DOES NOT ALLOW SOLICITATIONS FOR DONATIONS, ETC. BUT IF YOU EVER WANT TO TALK ABOUT YOUR DAD'S CASE, OR ASK ANY QUESTIONS ABOUT IT, WE'RE MORE THAN HAPPY TO HELP IN ANY WAY WE CAN. THANKS FOR YOUR UNDERSTANDING, CHUCK",
