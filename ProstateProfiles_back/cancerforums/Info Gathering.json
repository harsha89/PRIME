      "Content": "Thanks, keeptrying, that's helpful. It also sparked me to look at manufacturers' pages. Just as a general FYI to the forum: another one called Artemis has a single device (for the biopsy only), not two. There's a company called United Medical Systems that drives around an Artemis with a tech to various hospitals that don't own a fusion biopsy device. I'll keep trying to get in touch with various facilities... one didn't call back on Friday, surprisingly. Btw, the Invivo site has a handy facility-locator that I used to find two within 50 miles. But for some reason that doesn't show yours at Princeton. SubDenis, your experience seems to show that mix & match is quite possible without the specially set up cooperation as with Princeton. That gives me confidence that this can work out, thanks.",

      "Content": "Hi, does anybody know if the MRI can be done at one facility and then the MRI Fusion TRUS biopsy be done at another facility? My understanding is that technologically it's possible, but there might be a problem with insurance paying or else possibly from doctors/med-groups cooperating. It's Saturday and I can't get anyone at hospitals on the phone. Also, I'm not the patient so I can't ask the Uro. I'm trying to take the stress off the family members by doing the initial info gathering for them. Why even want to mix & match? One hospital has a 3T MRI but only does blind TRUS Bx, and the other one only has 1.5T but does Fusion TRUS Bx. Long distance travel is not really in the options. If no one knows, what is your guess? Thanks.",

      "Content": "Another point is this: if somebody can't get a Fusion biopsy for any reason, they don't have to necessarily think they are getting shortchanged on detection by having only a blind TRUS. Both are equal. That's if this study is really describing the correct situation and isn't somehow an anomaly, which it doesn't seem to be. The downside to not having Fusion Bx is that getting more needles means more risk which can be especially important for anybody susceptible to infection - and even more important if a person can be susceptible to sepsis. I've been wondering if some people somehow have a greater susceptibility to bacteremia and sepsis.",

      "Content": "MRI/US fusion-guided prostate biopsy allows for equivalent cancer detection with significantly fewer needle cores in biopsy-naive men 2018 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5951198/# CONCLUSION In biopsy-naive men, MRI/US fusion-guided prostate biopsy offers equal prostate cancer detection compared with systematic TRUS-guided biopsy with significantly fewer tissue cores using the targeted technique. This approach can potentially reduce morbidity in the future if used instead of systematic biopsy without sacrificing the ability to detect prostate cancer, particularly in cases with higher grade disease. RESULTS The average number of cores taken for MRI-targeted biopsies was 4.42 compared with 11.93 for systematic biopsies... Note that this is in men with no prior biopsy. The discussion also mentions some other studies in which Fusion is not better than blind. This is surprising to me because everything I've been reading up until today convinced me that Fusion is dar superior at detection. The rationale for it seems really good, too. It's from University of Alabama, depts of Uro, Path, Radio. There were only 69 subjects that qualified.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by DjinTonic If a uro suspects PCA in a biopsy-naive patient and the MRI is negative for PIRADS 3 and up, are you saying not to biopsy? Well, I'm not advocating; I'm reporting on what I've been discovering while researching. As or not biopsying? I have no opinion at this point. Also, I haven't seen any study saying that a 3T mpMRI followed by Fusion Bx is inferior at detection to 12 or more core TRUS. Here is Princeton Radiology: Now, due to the precise targeting provided by MRI, many fewer biopsy samples are needed for accurate diagnosis \u0096 sometimes 80 to 90% fewer. https://www.princetonradiology.com/p...prostate-care/",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by DjinTonic Those standard cores can reveal lesions too small for MRI. From what I've been reading, that is considered a desirable feature of Fusion Bx. Insignificant tumors are undiscovered and so can't lead to unnecessary treatment (or worry, etc). ------- Here's a paper on how many cores per Region Of Interest, which is a separate matter but still of interest. I would have guessed that only one was used per region. http://ascopubs.org/doi/abs/10.1200/...36.6_suppl.134 For PI-RADs 4 and 5 lesions, additional sampling up to 4 cores significantly improves Gâ‰¥3+4 detection, while for PI-RADs 1-3 lesions sampling up to 2 cores improves detection. Conclusions: On a per-lesion basis, sampling two cores of mpMRI-evident lesions at the time of fusion biopsy misses nearly one-quarter of clinically significant PCa that would be detected on additional sampling.",
