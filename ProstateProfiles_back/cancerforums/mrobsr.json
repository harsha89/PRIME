Do some research on your own, ask questions, come here often and voice your concerns but most of all be there for your husband. For as much as you want to break down and cry I know from my own experience that I did a ton of crying when I found out. My emotions were all over the place and sometimes I just was angry and shouted a lot for no serious reason. My wife kept me focused and keep telling me it was going to be alright. That helped me keep calm and push forward. I learned during this time that although I was the one diagnosed with cancer it affected my whole family. We had to help each other every day to stay positive and keep smiles inside and out. Talk with your husband and tell him how this makes you feel. Listen to him and let him tell you how he feels. Like it was said by Pratoman educate yourselves and gain a sense of control and don't throw stop being positive!",

The Cialis I don't feel worked and the fact that it is going to be generic in the coming month or so I'm not sure it's my answer.

      "Content": "Just to get some feel for what can I do to ward off this depression that keeps smothering me more than I can take at times? I had my first PSA reading come back at a 3.1 after going to a urologist because of bladder problems. I was never called back to know that it was a concern of the dr so I didn't find out until I went back for a follow up a couple months later. We did another PSA test it came back 4.5. Went to another doctor to get a second opinion after 2 months. Numbers came back 5.2 did the biopsy and found I was a high 7 on the Gleason scale with aggressive . Surgery was scheduled for Nov 29, 2016 and other than the machine failing during surgery all seems to have went well. The stomach pains and the constipation after I can honestly say was the worst part. The scariest part was going for a CT scan and being told I had a blood clot and needed to rush straight to the ER. Thankfully nothing was found. I am now 2 months post op and now this depression. Part is sexual function is diminished, having sex has been able to work but not even 20% erection. My wife has been real supportive but at age 47 to feel so \"inadequate\" in this capacity has played a number on my head. I need to get over this and I was hoping for some ideas for the depression that doesn't involve pills. Thanks in advance!",
