      "Content": "Originally Posted by Sw1218 my prostate volume is 31mL. this was noted in may of 2017 on my MRI. if 90% of prostate inflammation cases do not involve bacteria and do not respond to antibiotics, then why am i being prescribed with cipro? it seems to be a waste of time to take the drug. it would seem that i am just taking it to have something written on paper. i'm not saying this at you, but that doesn't help my anxiety. Table 1, Category 3 of this Harvard Medical School Article cites the 90 percent statistic. But, as you read the article, you see how complex and varied prostatitis is. Prescription of antibiotics could maybe help in some cases, so they do it. https://www.harvardprostateknowledge...e-for-optimism",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by HighlanderCFH With four positive cores, Active Surveillance is probably not the best way to proceed. I respectfully disagree with the Cyberknife suggestion for 2 reasons: 1- it is a relatively new treatment technique that probably does not have a lengthy track record yet 2- A biopsy can only sample about 1/100th of the prostate. This is a reason why around 28% of surgery patients end up with a higher Gleason score than detected by the biopsy. In other words, there could be other tumors in there that were missed by the biopsy -- and a focal treatment suck as cyberknife (as far as I know) only hits the known tumors. If there are other tumors in there, they would go untreated. My personal suggestion would be for you to consider external beam radiation, brachytherapy (radioactive seeding) or surgery. Any of these three options would involve the ENTIRE prostate and, thus, any other tumors that might be in there. Fortunately, your low PSA \"suggests\" that there is probably nothing more than Gleason 3+3 in there, so you should be just fine no matter what treatment you might choose -- as long as there are no higher Gleason tumors in there. Good luck! Chuck Two facts: 1. SBRT/Cyberknife is a whole gland treatment. It uses a precision targeting system to deliver highly focused radiation dosages. It is no more \"focal\" than a surgical cut, an EBRT beam, or a brachy seed. All whole gland treatments involve a series of local actions. 2. SBRT/Cyberknife is not new. It was FDA approved in 2001, and has treated over 40,000 patients, with the numbers sharply increasing in recent years. http://meetinglibrary.asco.org/record/119573/abstract https://www.sciencedaily.com/release...0418145458.htm",

If there are other tumors in there, they would go untreated. My personal suggestion would be for you to consider external beam radiation, brachytherapy (radioactive seeding) or surgery. Any of these three options would involve the ENTIRE prostate and, thus, any other tumors that might be in there. Fortunately, your low PSA \"suggests\" that there is probably nothing more than Gleason 3+3 in there, so you should be just fine no matter what treatment you might choose -- as long as there are no higher Gleason tumors in there. Good luck! Chuck Two facts: 1. SBRT/Cyberknife is a whole gland treatment. It uses a precision targeting system to deliver highly focused radiation dosages. It is no more \"focal\" than a surgical cut, an EBRT beam, or a brachy seed. All whole gland treatments involve a series of local actions. 2. SBRT/Cyberknife is not new. It was FDA approved in 2001, and has treated over 40,000 patients, with the numbers sharply increasing in recent years. http://meetinglibrary.asco.org/record/119573/abstract https://www.sciencedaily.com/release...0418145458.htm",

On April 2017, my doctor suggested me to take Hormone Therapy (3 Zoladex Injection). Already I have taken two injections. He also suggested me to take Calutide tablets 50mg per day without any surgery. On June 17, 2017, again I have checked my PSA found 1.37 ng/ml. And one month later, on July 20, 2017, I found my PSA Level 0.57 ng/ml. Could you please give me your opinion or advice at my present situation? Kind Regards, M. A Zaman Hi Akhlak, I recall posting a comment on one of your previous posts on some forum. Glad to hear that your psa is now so low, but Those drugs are approved for advanced prostate cancer...and they are being prescribed for you as a first line treatment? Zoladex was approved by the FDA for prostate cancer in 1989, but I never read about anyone taking it. Are you in southeast Asia? Are these drugs considered mainstream treatments in your country? I can appreciate your not wanting surgery, but how effective is this treatment in the long term? Sorry that I don't have an answer for you, but I hope that another member with knowledge of these drugs can comment.",

      "Content": "Fred, In 2015, the World Health Organization adopted new risk classification criteria for prostate cancer, which was developed by Johns Hopkins using decades of data. The primary revision in the new standards is the separation of G 3+4 into a new, \"low intermediate\" class, and G 4+3 as \"high intermediate\". So, that doctor's comment seems out of date. As far as the time for a G 3+4 to grow and escape the capsule, there is no certain data. There are G 3+4 men who have been in active surveillance for many years, although they do have a higher risk than the G 3+3 men. Their fifteen year survival rate without treatment is 84 percent in the latest Sunnybrook study. Not great, but worth knowing. Have you had genomic tests done on your biopsy slides? These tests, like OncotypeDX and Prolaris, can help predict the future aggressiveness of the cancer. Mine were a decisive factor in my going on AS. In my limited knowledge, you have a mixed bag of factors that could justify treatment now, or holding off for more testing, consultations, and research. Only one small lesion being seen on an MRI could argue in favor of not rushing to a decision. Will there be a magic vaccine out next year? ...probably not, but you need to be fully comfortable in calculating your decision. Good luck.",

Djin, The 2108 Guidelines for Clinicians published by the AUA/ASTRO/SUO have combined Gleason 8 men into the same \"high risk\" category as G9-10. Accordingly, they now fall into the same treatment options as G 9-10 cases. There is no \"very high risk\" classification. High risk now includes \"PSA ≥20 ng/ml OR Grade Group 4-5 OR clinical stage ≥T3\". Gleason (4+4) is Grade Group 4.",

Regarding intermediate-risk PCa and Active Surveillance, I just received a publication from my specialist, H. Ballentine Carter, MD, who pioneered AS in the United States. He concluded that men with low-intermediate-risk (G3+4) prostate cancer were 4.5 to 5 times more likely to have aggressive tumors requiring immediate treatment than men in lower-risk groups. Also, that the research did not find any \"favorable\" sub-group among low-intermediate-risk patients who would benefit from active surveillance. So, yes, the time for inaction is past. You need to research and select a type of treatment.",

I would suggest another blood draw, this time using the PHI test, which is more accurate than psa. (It does also provide psa and free psa numbers). And, no sex of any kind, bike riding or working out for at least 2-3 days before the draw. Good luck.",

What are the side effects of Cyber Knife? A. The negative side effects of CyberKnife® can be expected to mirror those of other targeted radiation therapies. Over the short term, radiation therapy for prostate cancer can cause: Urination problems including burning and blood in the urine Urinary urgency and frequency Weakened urinary stream Incomplete emptying of the bladder Anal and rectal irritation, rectal bleeding, hemorrhoids, and stool problems Fatigue and nausea Long-term CyberKnife® and prostate cancer radiation side effects may include: Sexual impotence and/or erectile dysfunction for up to 2 years after treatment Delayed orgasm or ejaculation Temporary or permanent reduction in sperm count; fertility should be discussed with your physician prior to CyberKnife® treatment Impaired bowel function Potential increased risk of bladder or rectal cancer by 5% And post-treatment patient satisfaction surveys repeatedly show Cyberknife as the LEAST popular method of treating prostate cancer, primarily due to radiation burns from the massive doses of radiation versus the decades-old gold standard of 35 - 40 sessions of EBRT. Jim, Samadi is super-arrogant. I saw him on a TV news show a couple of years ago, and he was seriously bad-mouthing Dr. Patrick Walsh and open prostatectomy in general. If you were to take Samadi's advice, every treatment besides RALP is invalid. Well, he is entertaining Michael, I like your humor, but I hope to not have to change my handle anytime soon.",

      "Content": "N.A.H, I am very surprised at the advice that you received from that radiation oncologist. There are five very different types of primary radiation therapy: IMRT, SBRT, LDR-BT, HDR-BT, and PBT (Proton Beam). What was his specialty? It sounds like he maybe was doing IMRT on salvage patients after RP failed. His reasoning about radiation after surgery is an expected talking point of surgeons, and is highly misleading. There are actually several salvage options should a primary radiation treatment fail. These include HIFU, SBRT, HDR-BT, FLA, and IRE. All have studies proving their efficacy. And, you would do well to compare the recent studies on the failure rate of surgery versus SBRT and HDR-BT. The results may get you thinking twice about consulting with more RO's. Just my input. Take it as you wish. Good luck to you.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by HighlanderCFH With four positive cores, Active Surveillance is probably not the best way to proceed. I respectfully disagree with the Cyberknife suggestion for 2 reasons: 1- it is a relatively new treatment technique that probably does not have a lengthy track record yet 2- A biopsy can only sample about 1/100th of the prostate. This is a reason why around 28% of surgery patients end up with a higher Gleason score than detected by the biopsy. In other words, there could be other tumors in there that were missed by the biopsy -- and a focal treatment suck as cyberknife (as far as I know) only hits the known tumors. If there are other tumors in there, they would go untreated. My personal suggestion would be for you to consider external beam radiation, brachytherapy (radioactive seeding) or surgery. Any of these three options would involve the ENTIRE prostate and, thus, any other tumors that might be in there. Fortunately, your low PSA \"suggests\" that there is probably nothing more than Gleason 3+3 in there, so you should be just fine no matter what treatment you might choose -- as long as there are no higher Gleason tumors in there. Good luck! Chuck Two facts: 1. SBRT/Cyberknife is a whole gland treatment. It uses a precision targeting system to deliver highly focused radiation dosages. It is no more \"focal\" than a surgical cut, an EBRT beam, or a brachy seed. All whole gland treatments involve a series of local actions. 2. SBRT/Cyberknife is not new. It was FDA approved in 2001, and has treated over 40,000 patients, with the numbers sharply increasing in recent years. http://meetinglibrary.asco.org/record/119573/abstract https://www.sciencedaily.com/release...0418145458.htm",

Djin, The 2108 Guidelines for Clinicians published by the AUA/ASTRO/SUO have combined Gleason 8 men into the same \"high risk\" category as G9-10. Accordingly, they now fall into the same treatment options as G 9-10 cases. There is no \"very high risk\" classification. High risk now includes \"PSA ≥20 ng/ml OR Grade Group 4-5 OR clinical stage ≥T3\". Gleason (4+4) is Grade Group 4.",

      "Content": "N.A.H, I am very surprised at the advice that you received from that radiation oncologist. There are five very different types of primary radiation therapy: IMRT, SBRT, LDR-BT, HDR-BT, and PBT (Proton Beam). What was his specialty? It sounds like he maybe was doing IMRT on salvage patients after RP failed. His reasoning about radiation after surgery is an expected talking point of surgeons, and is highly misleading. There are actually several salvage options should a primary radiation treatment fail. These include HIFU, SBRT, HDR-BT, FLA, and IRE. All have studies proving their efficacy. And, you would do well to compare the recent studies on the failure rate of surgery versus SBRT and HDR-BT. The results may get you thinking twice about consulting with more RO's. Just my input. Take it as you wish. Good luck to you.",

      "Content": "There have been recent studies showing no difference in recurrence between high risk men who had immediate surgery, and those who waited for six months. So, don\u0092t be panicked into treatment before you have your thoughts clear. You mentioned protons. They have excellent outcomes, with five year recurrence rates of less than ten percent for intermediate risk men like yourself. Cyberknife/SBRT has similar statistics. The recurrence rates for surgery run from 25 to 40 percent, depending on which study. Surgery first, followed by radiation is what many surgeons recommend. But, that subjects you to the side effects of both treatments, and it is radiation that finally stops the cancer. Think that over. And, if there should be a failure of primary radiation, there are several effective non-surgical treatments available to you. Keep asking, and certainly have more consultations. You have to be fully confident with your choice of treatment.",

While I rarely comment there, I do read and appreciate that many men are happy with that choice (and fear radiation). So, while there are no perfect treatments yet, we learn all we can, and ultimately try to support each other. Back to the subject, the new book should be very valuable for all of us.",

One of my lesions was reclassified from 4 to 3 with the newer version, and possibly the same could happen with you. Your doctor is giving you good advice. Maybe do PHI rather then just psa as part of your monitoring. Also, were there genomic tests on your biopsy slides? The OncotypeDX or Prolaris assays can provide more information in predicting the future aggressiveness of the cancer that was found. When you are on AS, you want all the tests that are reasonable to arrange.",

So, don\u0092t be panicked into treatment before you have your thoughts clear. You mentioned protons. They have excellent outcomes, with five year recurrence rates of less than ten percent for intermediate risk men like yourself. Cyberknife/SBRT has similar statistics. The recurrence rates for surgery run from 25 to 40 percent, depending on which study. Surgery first, followed by radiation is what many surgeons recommend. But, that subjects you to the side effects of both treatments, and it is radiation that finally stops the cancer. Think that over. And, if there should be a failure of primary radiation, there are several effective non-surgical treatments available to you. Keep asking, and certainly have more consultations. You have to be fully confident with your choice of treatment.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by akhlak Dear Sir, I am 45 years old. On February 2017, I checked my PSA level found 6.83 ng/ml and Gleason\u2019s Grade 3+3=6/10 by biopsy test. On April 2017, my doctor suggested me to take Hormone Therapy (3 Zoladex Injection). Already I have taken two injections. He also suggested me to take Calutide tablets 50mg per day without any surgery. On June 17, 2017, again I have checked my PSA found 1.37 ng/ml. And one month later, on July 20, 2017, I found my PSA Level 0.57 ng/ml. Could you please give me your opinion or advice at my present situation? Kind Regards, M. A Zaman Hi Akhlak, I recall posting a comment on one of your previous posts on some forum. Glad to hear that your psa is now so low, but Those drugs are approved for advanced prostate cancer...and they are being prescribed for you as a first line treatment? Zoladex was approved by the FDA for prostate cancer in 1989, but I never read about anyone taking it. Are you in southeast Asia? Are these drugs considered mainstream treatments in your country? I can appreciate your not wanting surgery, but how effective is this treatment in the long term? Sorry that I don't have an answer for you, but I hope that another member with knowledge of these drugs can comment.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by Jim215 While I am not a fan of super-star Dr. Samadi, just to throw a little gasoline on the Cyberknife discussion, here are his thoughts on the subject from his website: Q. What are the side effects of Cyber Knife? A. The negative side effects of CyberKnife® can be expected to mirror those of other targeted radiation therapies. Over the short term, radiation therapy for prostate cancer can cause: Urination problems including burning and blood in the urine Urinary urgency and frequency Weakened urinary stream Incomplete emptying of the bladder Anal and rectal irritation, rectal bleeding, hemorrhoids, and stool problems Fatigue and nausea Long-term CyberKnife® and prostate cancer radiation side effects may include: Sexual impotence and/or erectile dysfunction for up to 2 years after treatment Delayed orgasm or ejaculation Temporary or permanent reduction in sperm count; fertility should be discussed with your physician prior to CyberKnife® treatment Impaired bowel function Potential increased risk of bladder or rectal cancer by 5% And post-treatment patient satisfaction surveys repeatedly show Cyberknife as the LEAST popular method of treating prostate cancer, primarily due to radiation burns from the massive doses of radiation versus the decades-old gold standard of 35 - 40 sessions of EBRT. Jim, Samadi is super-arrogant. I saw him on a TV news show a couple of years ago, and he was seriously bad-mouthing Dr. Patrick Walsh and open prostatectomy in general. If you were to take Samadi's advice, every treatment besides RALP is invalid. Well, he is entertaining Michael, I like your humor, but I hope to not have to change my handle anytime soon.",

His conclusion was that PSA testing was only saving one man per one thousand tested.. The men in the room were pretty much in an uproar, as they respected that doctor, but refused to accept the conclusion. It was a quite a meeting. I recall that everyone agreed with testing, and blamed the urologists for being too eager to rush men into surgery. The presenter assured them that AS was on dramatic recent rise, and that more options were being discussed, at least in larger practices.",

      "Content": "Nice to know, but I have to question their data for long-term membership in those AS programs. For example, the article says that they mostly had one core of G6, and the long term results were : \"After 5, 10 and 15 years of follow-up, respectively, 58%, 39% and 23% of men were still on AS.\" But, these are the results from the Sunnybrook AS program, which included more positive cores, and intermediate risk men: \"At 5, 10, and 15 years, 75.7%, 63.5%, and 55.0% of patients remained untreated and on surveillance.\" So, while it's great to have a consolidated database of many AS programs' data, I have to admit that I am confused by what other groups were included, and how they selected their men. Also, why did the men leave the group?",

I guess that they just considered themselves cured and move on. Also, many men don't naturally share intimate medical details, so it's not something they feel comfortable hanging around and discussing. The same thing with local support groups, there are new guys, and there are those veteran members who have developed strong opinions and advocacies. There is an advantage to not acting impulsively after diagnosis, or just accepting the advice of that doctor without more consultations and research. Here is a study of men who had RT that shows that an informed selection of treatment results in less regret afterwards. https://pcnrv.blogspot.com/2017/01/l...-sbrt-and.html",

That belief has now been overtaken by the proven efficacy of salvage SBRT radiation. These links will display three recent scholarly articles that show the feasibility and efficacy of salvage SBRT after primary radiation: https://pcnrv.blogspot.com/2016/08/s...nce-after.html https://ro-journal.biomedcentral.com...014-017-0833-9",

I guess that they just considered themselves cured and move on. Also, many men don't naturally share intimate medical details, so it's not something they feel comfortable hanging around and discussing. The same thing with local support groups, there are new guys, and there are those veteran members who have developed strong opinions and advocacies. There is an advantage to not acting impulsively after diagnosis, or just accepting the advice of that doctor without more consultations and research. Here is a study of men who had RT that shows that an informed selection of treatment results in less regret afterwards. https://pcnrv.blogspot.com/2017/01/l...-sbrt-and.html",

My friends keep asking me \"why aren't you in the hospital yet getting that cut out!\". I guess you've all heard that. As far as my family history, my Dad had his PC back in the early 90's and had 30 external radiation treatments. He was then about 70. He lived until he was 94 and died of complications of dementia. His younger brother contracted PC at age 74 and had Brachy therapy and is 82 now, doing fine. His other brother contracted PC when he was about 65 and this was in the early 70's. he wound up dying from it as there was no PSA test then (as I recall) and his PCP didn't recognize the symptoms until it was too late. I'm a bit leery of radiation treatment in any form, since my understanding is once you have that you can no longer have prostate region surgery should you need to. Supposedly, they only option is \"salvage\" which does not sound too attractive. I don't know if my reasoning makes sense. By the way, my doctor is affiliated with UPMC (University of Pittsburgh) and can refer me to an RO, robotic surgeon (he only does open). if I wish. Anyway, I'll let you know what my plans will be. Thanks again. Why would you need salvage surgery if salvage radiation can do the job, and allow you to avoid the additional side effects of such surgery? It was widely believed that, after primary radiation, that secondary radiation was not appropriate and that salvage surgery would be very difficult.

BUT, those are the averages, and you may not want to play the odds when your life is the stake. You can certainly take your time and mull over your options. The cure rates have historically been the same between surgery and radiation, but now the SBRT type of radiation is reporting cure rates and low sides effects that \"may\" be a game-changer. Others will attest to the efficacy of what treatments they had. There are several similar forums and an infinite amount of data, studies, and opinions out on the internet.

      "Content": "Originally Posted by caddy2507 Gentlemen, thanks for all your opinions and advice. I really need \"somebody to talk to\" about my situation that understands. My friends keep asking me \"why aren't you in the hospital yet getting that cut out!\". I guess you've all heard that. As far as my family history, my Dad had his PC back in the early 90's and had 30 external radiation treatments. He was then about 70. He lived until he was 94 and died of complications of dementia. His younger brother contracted PC at age 74 and had Brachy therapy and is 82 now, doing fine. His other brother contracted PC when he was about 65 and this was in the early 70's. he wound up dying from it as there was no PSA test then (as I recall) and his PCP didn't recognize the symptoms until it was too late. I'm a bit leery of radiation treatment in any form, since my understanding is once you have that you can no longer have prostate region surgery should you need to. Supposedly, they only option is \"salvage\" which does not sound too attractive. I don't know if my reasoning makes sense. By the way, my doctor is affiliated with UPMC (University of Pittsburgh) and can refer me to an RO, robotic surgeon (he only does open). if I wish. Anyway, I'll let you know what my plans will be. Thanks again. Why would you need salvage surgery if salvage radiation can do the job, and allow you to avoid the additional side effects of such surgery? It was widely believed that, after primary radiation, that secondary radiation was not appropriate and that salvage surgery would be very difficult. That belief has now been overtaken by the proven efficacy of salvage SBRT radiation. These links will display three recent scholarly articles that show the feasibility and efficacy of salvage SBRT after primary radiation: https://pcnrv.blogspot.com/2016/08/s...nce-after.html https://ro-journal.biomedcentral.com...014-017-0833-9",

      "Content": "I recently had a discussion with an Interventional Radiologist while sharing a dinner table on a cruise ship. He was talking about his profession, and I asked him if he worked on prostate issues. He said that his practice has had great success with prostate artery embolization (PAE), in which needles are used to inject plastic blocking materials into the arteries supplying blood to the prostate gland. They are able to reduce the gland size up to 85 percent with this procedure, which he considered a game-changer for men with enlarged prostates. Here is a typical description of the procedure. Note the impressive before-and-after images. http://www.inova.org/healthcare-serv...paign=prostate My question for the forum: This procedure is designed to relieve the symptoms of benign prostatic hypertrophy (BPH), but can it be used for men with BHP who also have diagnosed prostate cancer? My prostate isn't getting any smaller with age, and this option would be great to have available, if it is not contraindicated. Anyone know the answer?",

Multiple studies have shown that the recurrence rate after surgery for a Grade Group 3 risk like you is 35 percent.

IMHO, overtreatment is the result of either the diagnosing urologist pushing his cure, and/or the patient panicking at the thought of cancer in his body. But I see a distinction between diagnostic tools and the decision to (over) treat. When I got \"the call\" I was told \"You can take this biopsy report to any surgeon or radiologist in the country and schedule their services. But, given your age and the small amount of cancer we found, I am going to recommend you for a program we have here at Hopkins.\" He could have said \"I'll schedule surgery for next month\"...But, he didn't. If he had, and I had been overtreated it would have been his and my fault, not the psa tests, the MRI, or the biopsy. As Michael F said, we need liquid biopsies and other more perfect diagnostic tools. They are arriving, all the time. Meanwhile, I support psa testing, and also better communications about options from diagnosing urologists.",

      "Content": "Caddy, Please take your time. I was diagnosed with Gleason(3+3) eight years ago, and there has been no progression of my cancer, which I hope to die with, not of. However, the five cores is a bit more than mine, and I would think it prudent that you begin to educate yourself on the pros and cons of eventual treatment. The long term studies of the active surveillance groups at Sunnybrook, and at Johns Hopkins, as well as the statistics of the American Cancer Society do not support your doctor's statement that your cancer would be beyond treatment in 10 years. BUT, those are the averages, and you may not want to play the odds when your life is the stake. You can certainly take your time and mull over your options. The cure rates have historically been the same between surgery and radiation, but now the SBRT type of radiation is reporting cure rates and low sides effects that \"may\" be a game-changer. Others will attest to the efficacy of what treatments they had. There are several similar forums and an infinite amount of data, studies, and opinions out on the internet. Attending some monthly local prostate cancer support groups is another way to learn of experiences and side effects face-to-face. Good luck to you.",

I guess that they just considered themselves cured and move on. Also, many men don't naturally share intimate medical details, so it's not something they feel comfortable hanging around and discussing. The same thing with local support groups, there are new guys, and there are those veteran members who have developed strong opinions and advocacies. There is an advantage to not acting impulsively after diagnosis, or just accepting the advice of that doctor without more consultations and research. Here is a study of men who had RT that shows that an informed selection of treatment results in less regret afterwards. https://pcnrv.blogspot.com/2017/01/l...-sbrt-and.html",

This trial intends to mimic SBRT, but using protons, and complete the treatment in only five sessions. This is being done at the Mayo Clinic, but also other institutions. Faster, more powerful, easier ... technology goes racing ahead. And, we won't know for many years what the end results are. Two men that I know from elsewhere have already started in this same trial, but not at Mayo. Pioneers ... hope that it works for them.

      "Content": "Originally Posted by Southsider Proton Therapy has been demonstrated to be very effective with certain tumors particularly in childhood cancer. But the machines are very expensive and they'd like to show that it has advantages in treating other cancers. Prostate cancer is pretty popular- if they can demonstrate the advantage of protons in treating PC, they can get more patients. In this recent study, PBRT had a five year non-recurrence rate of almost 97 percent for intermediate risk men. That result is higher than any other prostate cancer treatment. If they can both produce more studies like this, and also decrease the number of sessions and the cost, protons can become a serious choice for men with PCa. http://ascopubs.org/doi/abs/10.1200/....36.6_suppl.97",

Studies have shown that it is possible, but extremely rare, like one in thousands. The general consensus is that if you need a biopsy, you should not let that remote possibility stop you. As Chuck mentioned, you may want to consider active surveillance. Still, an AS protocol would require another, confirming, biopsy within the next year. Those are usually 12 core, with another 2 to 4 in areas targeted by the MRI.",

Those Canadian pharmacies are the most cost-effective way to buy Viagra (sildenadfil) and other ED meds. Well, at least until 2020, when Pfizer's last USA patent finally expires. The Canadian Supreme Court unanimously invalidated Pfizer's patent in 2010 because of deliberate gaming of their formulary application.",

My partner had a stage 3 melanoma removed almost 40 years ago. She has mandatory appointments every year to monitor for recurrence.

But, regardless, you have some time on your side, and doing this type of research can only help you sort through your future options, should you ever need intervention.

My partner had a stage 3 melanoma removed almost 40 years ago. She has mandatory appointments every year to monitor for recurrence. Now, she is a Canadian, and their health care is quite different, but it all shows that once you are diagnosed with a cancer (other than a really indolent skin type), you are NEVER free from being on a surveillance regimen.",

My only concern is that I am still unclear if it can treat the entire gland or is it more focal therapy targeting know tumors? SBRT, as a primary treatment, is a whole gland therapy. Also, it has recently been used for salvage therapy after either surgery or primary radiation. I believe that it is used focally in those salvage applications, as it can direct a lot of radiation at known targets, like lymph and bone nodes. The studies for both primary and salvage treatments show impressive results. SBRT was purposely designed to be the external beam equivalent of HDR-BT. I have read that the total dosages are the same.

What complications did you have if you don't mind me asking. I am a little hesitant to wait as I have insurance through the ACA and I'm uncertain if it will be available nest year. My biopsy complications included hemorrhages and other structural damage to the prostate, as well as groin pain and a tripled psa that lasted for six months. Only sitz baths, an ancient remedy, were helpful in healing the damage. A free psa of 10 is not good, but I would still want more testing, especially an mp-MRI, before any biopsy, if I were you.",

Interventional radiologists are essentially surgeons who use needles rather than knives.

We know that 5-year results with low-risk PCa don't mean much, as other studies have shown no difference in mortality after 10 years, regardless if they did RP, RT, or AS. But, the intermediate-risk patients are what makes this study interesting. Ninety-seven percent were recurrence-free after five years. That, IMHO, is super-impressive, and with few side effects. \"For the 137 patients with intermediate risk disease (T1B-T2b, Gleason = 7, and PSA of 10 or less, or Gleason 6 or lower with a PSA between 10 and 20), 97% were recurrence-free at 5 years, a result \u201cthat matches the best results in radiotherapy for intermediate-risk patients, and matches the best results for, for example, dose-escalated IMRT [intensity-modulated radiation therapy],\u201d https://www.mdedge.com/oncologypractice/article/114784/genitourinary-cancer/prostate-cancer-recurrence-rates-low-sbrt Now, it's on to the high-risk patients, since SBRT delivers the same total dosage as a HDR brachy boost.

      "Content": "Ready, I'm certainly no expert, but I have had six of these MRI assessments with varying results, so I'll try to make a general guess on this one. Was PIRADS 2.0 used? That is the latest and greatest version of the scoring software, and it would be good if that was used. My index lesion was actually downgraded from 4 to 3 with the latest version. A PIRADS 5 is obviously not good, but it is not absolute. I have seen posts by two or three men recently who had targeted biopsies on PIRADS 5 areas, with negative findings. BUT, that lesion must be biopsied, which apparently you are awaiting the results for. You must be prepared to hear that some form and extent of PCa will be found. And, the biopsy report will contain all the relevant data, and you should post that here when you have it. Good luck.",

Usually, even for the lowest-risk patients, which he appears to be, the AS protocols define that choice as best for those 65 and over. That's usually coupled with a life expectancy of 20 years or less, which is statistically correct, even for healthy men. Now, certainly he has time to ask and learn and perhaps gain some additional insights. You have come to a great forum with many fellow patients glad to share their wisdom.",

Hi ChiGuy, I was reading your signature and my mindwheels were churning. Four low risk biopsies, and yet your psa keeps rising, up and up. Two questions: (1) Imaging. When have you had MRI's? What Telsa strength machines and what PIRADS results? (2) What is your current prostate size/volume? The larger the prostate, the higher a normal psa can be expected. Hopefully, that could be your case. If there has been am ultrasound or an MRI, there should be volume cited on the report.",

Brachytherapy had an 82 percent recurrence-free rate, which would make it clearly superior.

Usually, even for the lowest-risk patients, which he appears to be, the AS protocols define that choice as best for those 65 and over. That's usually coupled with a life expectancy of 20 years or less, which is statistically correct, even for healthy men. Now, certainly he has time to ask and learn and perhaps gain some additional insights. You have come to a great forum with many fellow patients glad to share their wisdom.",

They are not risk or pain free, and there really hasn't been any red line crossed that would suggest that one is required. A PSA less than 4 for your age sounds pretty normal. I would suggest that your next blood test be Prostate Health Index (PHI), which includes PSA, Free PSA, and a biomarker for prostate cancer. It is more accurate than PSA alone. Have you had a recent mp-MRI of your prostate? That would be useful in helping determine if there are any suspicious areas that would justify a biopsy.",

      "Content": "Don't know how I missed this in 2016, but here is an article about the results of both low and medium-risk patients having SBRT radiation treatments at the Swedish Cancer Institute in Seattle. We know that 5-year results with low-risk PCa don't mean much, as other studies have shown no difference in mortality after 10 years, regardless if they did RP, RT, or AS. But, the intermediate-risk patients are what makes this study interesting. Ninety-seven percent were recurrence-free after five years. That, IMHO, is super-impressive, and with few side effects. \"For the 137 patients with intermediate risk disease (T1B-T2b, Gleason = 7, and PSA of 10 or less, or Gleason 6 or lower with a PSA between 10 and 20), 97% were recurrence-free at 5 years, a result \u201cthat matches the best results in radiotherapy for intermediate-risk patients, and matches the best results for, for example, dose-escalated IMRT [intensity-modulated radiation therapy],\u201d https://www.mdedge.com/oncologypractice/article/114784/genitourinary-cancer/prostate-cancer-recurrence-rates-low-sbrt Now, it's on to the high-risk patients, since SBRT delivers the same total dosage as a HDR brachy boost.

      "Content": "I would resist having a biopsy at this time, if I were you. They are not risk or pain free, and there really hasn't been any red line crossed that would suggest that one is required. A PSA less than 4 for your age sounds pretty normal. I would suggest that your next blood test be Prostate Health Index (PHI), which includes PSA, Free PSA, and a biomarker for prostate cancer. It is more accurate than PSA alone. Have you had a recent mp-MRI of your prostate? That would be useful in helping determine if there are any suspicious areas that would justify a biopsy.",

      "Content": "Djin, Good information. But, while BT (both LDR and HDR) has impressive results, their usage has declined sharply over the past dozen years. There was a detailed discussion about this trend on another forum last week. It appears that the use of both types of BT fell between 50 to 70 percent from 2004 to 2014. That would be about the time that RALP skyrocketed into popularity. Why? Especially since RALP has not proven to have better outcomes than BT? Well, it seems that providers can make a lot more money by doing RALP (and IMRT) than either form of BT. At least, that was the opinion of this other forum's posters. In a perfect world, a comparatively good technology would continue to gain market share. That has not been the case with BT, which continues to lose practictioners.",

      "Content": "Maverick, With only a small amount of G6 cancer found on biopsy, you don't have to rush into treatment, if you don't want to. As Pratoman suggested, a second opinion on your slides and a 3T mpMRI will provide more assurance of the true amount of cancer. Also, there are at least three genomics tests, like Prolaris and OncotypeDX, which help predict the likelihood of the cancer spreading. I had a biopsy result exactly like yours a few years ago, and the advice I received was to go on Active Surveillance. Now, because you are 47 and I was then 68, that probably influenced that decision. There is a lot of information for you and your wife to become aware of and compare. There are also other, newer options in addition to surgery and radiation, although those don't have much long term data yet. Keep asking all the questions you can think of. Ultimately, you have a big choice to make, and any choice, even not treating now, is something that you must be confident is right for you.",

I have not decided on treatment yet and am meeting with radiologic oncologist tomorrow. Any help would be appreciated. Thank you Why are you considering treatment? Gleason 6 is considered low risk, and every medical association suggests active surveillance as the course of action. Are there some other factors, such as high number of positive cores, or core percentages that suggest treatment is needed?

      "Content": "Maverick, With only a small amount of G6 cancer found on biopsy, you don't have to rush into treatment, if you don't want to. As Pratoman suggested, a second opinion on your slides and a 3T mpMRI will provide more assurance of the true amount of cancer. Also, there are at least three genomics tests, like Prolaris and OncotypeDX, which help predict the likelihood of the cancer spreading. I had a biopsy result exactly like yours a few years ago, and the advice I received was to go on Active Surveillance. Now, because you are 47 and I was then 68, that probably influenced that decision. There is a lot of information for you and your wife to become aware of and compare. There are also other, newer options in addition to surgery and radiation, although those don't have much long term data yet. Keep asking all the questions you can think of. Ultimately, you have a big choice to make, and any choice, even not treating now, is something that you must be confident is right for you.",

In answer to a couple of the questions posed: -- Appointment for biopsy results is this Wednesday afternoon. -- PSAs for the past three years: 3.8 (10/16); 3.2 (3/17); and 5.2 (not 5.7 as I mistakenly put in my introduction, this past January). I will follow-up here after I have my appointment on Wednesday. -Moe Moe, Those PSA results are exactly what mine were...in 2007. I was later found to have some prostate cancer, but luckily (so far), my specialists at Johns Hopkins have not seen any need for treatment, other than regular active surveillance. So, take some deep breaths and wait to see what the biopsy results are. Even if the doctor says \"we found some cancer\", he may next say \"we have a program here that would be a good fit for you\". Hopefully, in your case, nothing problematic will be found. Good luck to you.",

I recall seeing some stats that were 60 percent surgery, 25 percent radiation, and the other unknown. But, also, I have seen recent stats showing 50 percent of newly diagnosed low risk men are choosing active surveillance, especially those being treated at large institutions. I suspect that the large numbers for surgery are because the diagnosis is always made from a biopsy performed by a urologist, who may be quick to suggest \"I can cure you\". Who could resist that offer at that moment? The statement about \"there is no chance to do surgery after radiation\" is mostly true, but a radiation proponent will reply \"so what?\". Radiation appears to have a lower incidence of BCR than surgery, and cryotherapy, FLA, HIFU, and now SBRT and HDRBT are all being used to do local salvage treatments should primary radiation fail. So, that pro-surgery talking point would be quickly challenged on a pro-radiation forum. My former specialist at Johns Hopkins, who is widely published and considered among the 'best and brightest\" in the field of prostate cancer, told another patient that radiation was overtaking surgery in efficacy, and that studies would soon show that.

That's the price we pay for monitoring our cancer, rather than deal with the downsides of possible overtreatment. In your case, a confirmatory follow-up biopsy is required by some AS programs to better assure that the first one did not miss anything more significant. So, that is a prudent test, in any event. As for waiting for test or pathology reports, try to enroll in a patient portal at that practice. I usually get all my results online within three days, usually before the doctors contact me.",

      "Content": "Denis has asked an excellent question that it is difficult to find hard numbers for. I recall seeing some stats that were 60 percent surgery, 25 percent radiation, and the other unknown. But, also, I have seen recent stats showing 50 percent of newly diagnosed low risk men are choosing active surveillance, especially those being treated at large institutions. I suspect that the large numbers for surgery are because the diagnosis is always made from a biopsy performed by a urologist, who may be quick to suggest \"I can cure you\". Who could resist that offer at that moment? The statement about \"there is no chance to do surgery after radiation\" is mostly true, but a radiation proponent will reply \"so what?\". Radiation appears to have a lower incidence of BCR than surgery, and cryotherapy, FLA, HIFU, and now SBRT and HDRBT are all being used to do local salvage treatments should primary radiation fail. So, that pro-surgery talking point would be quickly challenged on a pro-radiation forum. My former specialist at Johns Hopkins, who is widely published and considered among the 'best and brightest\" in the field of prostate cancer, told another patient that radiation was overtaking surgery in efficacy, and that studies would soon show that. So, past and current statistics, whille interesting, may not be the best guidelines for the future. Hopefully, in the future, immunotherapy will make all these treatments obsolete...hopefully.",

Regarding reference books, while Dr. Patrick Walsh was the dean of prostate surgeons in the 1980\u0092s and 1990\u0092s, he did not write the chapters on other treatments in his new edition. They were written by a medical writer. So, I would suggest that you read the following new book before making a decision on which treatment. Dr. Mark Scholz\u0092 \u0093The Key to Prostate Cancer\u0094 for which he interviewed 30 other prostate cancer experts. Scholz, himself a surgeon, presents a cautionary theme that men need to fully explore ALL their options. Good luck, and keep asking.",

Keep in mind that about 35-50 percent (depending on which study) of prostate cancers will never need any type of treatment. Even if he is diagnosed with a Gleason 7 or higher grade of PCa, there is usually a pause of six weeks or so before surgery is scheduled, to allow for the biopsy trauma to subside. Meanwhile. that time should be used to consult with various specialists to make sure that whatever treatment is chosen is a choice that he and you are most confident with. You can google \"prostate treatment regret\" to see what I am referring to. Also, attending local PCa support groups, where you can hear the advice of men who have had different treatments, can be enlightening. Good luck.",

Two hospitals near me in the D.C. Area were part of a highly successful clinical trial a few years ago, and the procedure is now available to the public. Plastic balls are placed into the arteries supplying the prostate, causing it to dramatically shrink. It is an outpatient procedure performed by a interventional radiologist. I also had a chance meeting with a radiologist with a large practice in Los Angeles, and he said that PAE was revolutionizing prostate therapy. Some more info for you to absorb.",

Were the two positive cancer cores on the same side, or bilateral? Were any genomics tests run on those slides? What advice is your urologist giving you. A negative biopsy after a positive one is an indicator of an indolent cancer IF the suspect areas were identified by a 3T MRI, and the last biopsy was fused with those images. What kind of imaging have you had? Have all three biopsies been \"blind\"? More detail of your psa history for the past five or ten years would also be very helpful in determining doubling time and other trends.

      "Content": "PCASpouse, There is an exciting new solution for BPH issues. It does not require surgery, yet it reduces the prostate size by 85 percent. It's prostate artery embolization (PAE). Two hospitals near me in the D.C. Area were part of a highly successful clinical trial a few years ago, and the procedure is now available to the public. Plastic balls are placed into the arteries supplying the prostate, causing it to dramatically shrink. It is an outpatient procedure performed by a interventional radiologist. I also had a chance meeting with a radiologist with a large practice in Los Angeles, and he said that PAE was revolutionizing prostate therapy. Some more info for you to absorb.",

Dr. Mark Scholz\u0092 \u0093The Key to Prostate Cancer\u0094 for which he interviewed 30 other prostate cancer experts. Scholz, himself a surgeon, presents a cautionary theme that men need to fully explore ALL their options. Good luck, and keep asking.",

Keep in mind that about 35-50 percent (depending on which study) of prostate cancers will never need any type of treatment. Even if he is diagnosed with a Gleason 7 or higher grade of PCa, there is usually a pause of six weeks or so before surgery is scheduled, to allow for the biopsy trauma to subside. Meanwhile. that time should be used to consult with various specialists to make sure that whatever treatment is chosen is a choice that he and you are most confident with. You can google \"prostate treatment regret\" to see what I am referring to. Also, attending local PCa support groups, where you can hear the advice of men who have had different treatments, can be enlightening. Good luck.",

No regrets, thankful every day that they put me under AS from day 1 of suspected PCa. My uro-oncologist is Ashley Ross, and I recommend him as among the \"best and brightest\" of the younger generation of PCa authorities. Generally, bilateral involvement is now a disqualifier from their AS program. But, that is only for newly-diagnosed. If you have a history of stable AS monitoring, they may recommend that you stay with it. One of my biopsies showed a small amount of bilateral involvement, and my case was sent to a review committee which recommended that I stay in the program. My last biopsy was negative...so, all good. Given all the posts that I have read on various prostate cancer forums about the side effects of some treatments, I believe that a man should stay on AS until (1) he psychologically HAS to try to get rid of the cancer; or (2) he is presented with results that his risk classification has significantly increased.

I have seen references to this type of study recently, with positive initial comments. In fact, the chief radiologist at a local hospital told me two years ago that insurance payments were the main reason it was not widely done. As far as your urologist wanting 20 year+ studies on radiation, you should have asked where they are for RALP? Of course, they don't exist. That logic reminds me of an exchange with a surgery advocate who told me a few years ago that SBRT was suspect because it did not have 10 year results. Recently, He made some claim against SBRT, and I replied with some 10 year results, which were impressive. He then responded that only 12 year studies were valid. What a joke! I guess that I should have asked him for the 3,000 year studies on basic surgery",

But, the institutions found the shiny new toy of robotic surgery to have a great marketing appeal and profitability. I had a social conversation with a professor of radiology a few months ago, and he he stated that low profitability due to insurance guidelines had caused the decrease of BT usage, and was retarding the popularity of SBRT, which was growing, but more slowly than expected.",

That is because the cancer eventually mutates to defeat the chemical regimen being used. This is not gloom and doom. There are currently several clinical trials, not only of additional chemical regimens that go beyond those now used, but also of genomic and vaccine therapies that might actually kill the cancer cells and be a real \"cure\". The goal of the game is to keep buying time while progress on various fronts is being made every month. Please try to constantly research what clinical trials are open and where. Last month, I checked the website for Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center (MSKCC). and they had 43 open clinical trials for prostate cancer. That's very encouraging.",

Radiation can target a wide margin around the prostate if there is a concern of the cancer escaping. This is early in your learning process. There are hundreds of men here who have been through the decisions and the aftermaths, and they will certainly chime in with their great advice. Good luck.",

In your case, with a 9/20 biopsy result, the only possible third choice would be full cryotherapy. But, I don't know what data exists at this time to recommend that option.

Don't have links to cite, but I recall that both the articles were to show the non-inferiority of PBT and also SBRT when compared to IMRT in limited patient trials. PBT is certainly more expensive than IMRT, as others have mentioned. An advantage to SBRT would be the far fewer number of sessions.

Heard all the pro's/cons of biopsy at this stage but for me, knowing if PCa is a reality is better than Being on hold. Is there any value in pushing for another PSA before biopsy? Would be ~3 months since last test. Yes, I would suggest another round of testing before a biopsy (unlike the others, I have suffered the long lasting negative effects of two biopsies). But, not just another psa test, which is the least accurate measure. You should have either PHI or PCA3. Both are more accurate than psa alone, and not as affected by prostatitis. PHI uses a blood draw, and PCA3 uses urine after a vigorous DRE. PHI is used at Johns Hopkins, where it is a mandatory part of my surveillance program. Both tests have cut-off ranges to help in the decision to proceed to biopsy or not. Do you have any free psa results? Those are included as part of a PHI assay.",

There must be more serious reservations. LDR BT has been performed for over 25 years, so \"long term results\" are certainly available. NYC mayor Rudy Giuliani had LDR BT in 2000. I have heard the payments issue from three radiologists. Both types of BT peaked in 2004, and usage and practitioners have decreased since then. The low rates of payment have impacted its availability. Its efficacy has not been an issue, to my knowledge.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by mamadeesix Hubby's MRI showed several suspicious areas. So on to biopsy on April 20th. So far in this journey, I have been hoping that everything could be explained away with his enlarged prostate. After all, bph can cause increasing and higher psa numbers and even low free percentage numbers, if I understand right. Although the 9.5 free psa was a bit more concerning than the 6.7 psa alone, it could still be affected by bph, I think. Maybe I'm wrong there, or maybe it's just wishful thinking. Anyway..... I am thinking that finding suspicious areas on an MRI cannot be explained away by bph. It seems a bit of a game changer, considering the bph basket I put all our eggs in, so to speak. Any thoughts on this? Anything I should be asking at this point? I know nothing more than the suspicious areas....don't know if the doc. actually said more than that. Hubby is not nearly as obsessive about asking questions and trying to understand things as I am. He just knows he has to have another biopsy and what's more to know at this point. Is there any other reason for suspicious areas on an MRI than cancer?

Can you get an OncotypeDX, Prolaris, or ConfirmMDX assay run on your biopsy slides? That may help determine if there is a risk of higher grade cancer. The next specialist may need to order a targeted biopsy. A PIRADS 5 could be nothing significant. It happens. But, it must be taken very seriously, and more tests are now needed.",

As others have noted, a psa rise can have other causes. Relax, and see what the next test results are. Also, as noted above, the T3 MRI is an excellent pre-biopsy tool.",

From what I have read, that happens in 1 to 3 cases out of 100, and about 1 out of 1400 biopsy patients die from the procedure. They are not to be taken lightly, and hopefully will be replaced by non-invasive blood or urine assays in the near future. You have already received valuable advice. Chuck is correct that you should demand a copy of your biopsy pathology report NOW. Many practices have an online patient portal where you you can see your test results as soon as they are processed. You should ask if that access is available, In any, case, that office should be able to email you the report today. Many low risk cases of prostate cancer are indolent and will never need treatment, and can be safely monitored, avoiding the side effects. Yours may be one of those cases. Please provide us the data when you get it so that all the options can be discussed. Like the others said, your urologist has not served you well, and you should find another one.",

From what I have read, that happens in 1 to 3 cases out of 100, and about 1 out of 1400 biopsy patients die from the procedure. They are not to be taken lightly, and hopefully will be replaced by non-invasive blood or urine assays in the near future. You have already received valuable advice. Chuck is correct that you should demand a copy of your biopsy pathology report NOW. Many practices have an online patient portal where you you can see your test results as soon as they are processed. You should ask if that access is available, In any, case, that office should be able to email you the report today. Many low risk cases of prostate cancer are indolent and will never need treatment, and can be safely monitored, avoiding the side effects. Yours may be one of those cases. Please provide us the data when you get it so that all the options can be discussed. Like the others said, your urologist has not served you well, and you should find another one.",

Most initial biopsies do not find prostate cancer, so try to calm down and not get too far ahead of yourself. Seeing a urologist is your next step. He/she will recommend what tests you need. If you don't like or trust that one, go to another one. Regarding MRI vs. color Doppler, I believe that color Doppler is an older technology, as I rarely hear anyone mention it anymore. The 3Telsa MRI's are the standard imaging machines for prostate exams.",

Outcomes were better.\" The only downside that I have heard about this triple whatever of ADT, EBRT, and BT is that the ADT has very serious effects on QOL which may lead the patient to think over the choice, regardless of how effective.

If you are Risk Grade 1 or 2 on the new WHO grade scale, then your default action is AS, according to the current NCCN guidelines. Anything else is overtreatment, unless you demand it, But that doesn't change it from being overtreatment. Of course a uro will recommend surgery, that's what they do. There are many outdated myths regarding radiation, and many uro's repeat them. The radiation types receiving the latest good reports are SBRT and HDR brachytherapy. You should be aware of them. Walsh's book is fine for someone planning on surgery. Instead, I would suggest Mark Scholz' \"Invasion of the Prostate Snatchers\", also written by a prostate surgeon, but warning about unnecessary overtreatment.",

The usual reaction to a 47 yo with 3 or 4 cores of G7 would be \"surgery, get it out!\". But, that second reading of 3 cores of G 3+3 makes me want to caution you. Yes, you will hear from others that the younger, you are, the better you can recover from surgery. The flip side of that coin is those could also be more years to suffer with an unexpectedly lower quality of life. The percent of core involvement does not matter under the Johns Hopkins AS criteria revised in 2014. They are also working to prove that the number of cores also does not matter. If cancer is found on both sides, that would matter, but does not appear to be your case. I would suggest that you seriously reconsider your decision to rush into surgery. Things will never be the same, and it may not be necessary, at least at this time. If you are adamant that you want surgery, then go for it, and don't look back. But, you've only had a month to reflect on what the future could be for you. I would recommend that you read this recent article.

And, it certainly cannot be helpful to newbie's facing life-altering decisions. Of course, that's because there is no definitive cure-all yet, and very few are one hundred percent happy with the solutions today. I spend a lot of time on Facebook, and recently joined two groups there. One is for prostate cancer guys who have chosen surgery. The group rules state that the purpose is to support men who are about to have, or have had RP. No discussion of any other treatments are allowed. Very clear, got it! The second FB group I recently joined is for \"non-surgical prostate cancer treatments\". Everything about PCa is welcome, except the mention of surgery, which will result in immediate banning. OMG! That division is...what can I say? I participated in political forums, even with dial-up access, for over 30 years (gave it up after the 2016 elections), and am afraid that I am seeing the same tribalism develop with PC advice. I even see this at my local support meetings. Diet vs. surgery vs. radiation. And, on the radiation front, IMRT vs. SBRT vs. BT (two types) vs. PT. Yes, I also see this at face-to-face seminars. Thank you for allowing me to vent. But, we must do better. ALL the above-mentioned treatments have cured and saved innumerable men.

However, With your young age, some G4, and multiple pre-cancerous lesions, you may not have the option of being on AS for a long time, so continue asking and researching your future options. One suggestion I would add is that you have a genomics test, like OncotypeDX, Prolaris, Decipher, etc., done on your biopsy slides.

If cancer is found on both sides, that would matter, but does not appear to be your case. I would suggest that you seriously reconsider your decision to rush into surgery. Things will never be the same, and it may not be necessary, at least at this time. If you are adamant that you want surgery, then go for it, and don't look back. But, you've only had a month to reflect on what the future could be for you. I would recommend that you read this recent article. Be sure to consider the \"Conclusions\" section. https://prostatecancerinfolink.net/2...-surveillance/ Good luck to you.",

If you are Risk Grade 1 or 2 on the new WHO grade scale, then your default action is AS, according to the current NCCN guidelines. Anything else is overtreatment, unless you demand it, But that doesn't change it from being overtreatment. Of course a uro will recommend surgery, that's what they do. There are many outdated myths regarding radiation, and many uro's repeat them. The radiation types receiving the latest good reports are SBRT and HDR brachytherapy. You should be aware of them. Walsh's book is fine for someone planning on surgery. Instead, I would suggest Mark Scholz' \"Invasion of the Prostate Snatchers\", also written by a prostate surgeon, but warning about unnecessary overtreatment.",

His stats were similar to mine at that point, but, two years later he was actually a G(4+5). This certainly shows the imperfection of genomic testing. But, I noticed one big difference between the NYU AS protocol and Johns Hopkins'. At JH, you must have an mp-MRI and a confirmatory fusion biopsy within six months of the first positive biopsy. That did not happen in his case. And, it was the PIRADS 5 seen on his MRI two years later that signaled his more serious PCa. So, this unfortunate case also demonstrates the value of a very strict AS protocol.",

      "Content": "Mic, The fpsa is accurate enough to warrant further testing, in your case. I was sent to a urologist about ten years ago, when my psa jumped about three points, to 5.2. The uro did a DRE, which was unremarkable, then took a blood sample for fpsa, and booked an appointment for a biopsy. A few days later, his office called and cancelled the biopsy. My fpsa came back at 25, and he had enough faith in the fpsa result to not see me further. So, just as a high fpsa can often rule out significant PCa, so can a low reading, like yours, demand a next step. Today, there are more comprehensive and accurate blood tests, like PHI and 4K Score, and also a urine test, PCA3. All of them are used to eliminate or justify biopsies. You could ask for one of them. But, probably, there is enough suspicion at this point to justify a biopsy. If you can arrange an MRI first, it can be very helpful in focusing the biopsy needles on any abnormal-appearing areas. Good luck to you.",

The best of luck to you in your follow-up testing and recovery. But, as Pratoman noted, the roiling debate concerning overtreatment continues, if not so much on this forum as on others (I participate in four). The problem is that the diagnostic tools are always \"just ahead\" of what we all need to be confident and comfortable in our decisions. Certainly, had you deferred treatment, and entered a strict AS program, there would have immediately been more intensive imaging, biomarker, genomics, and biopsy confirmations. Maybe in your case, they would have pointed out the greater danger ... or failed. No one knows for certain. Maybe in X years, one simple test will tell us everything with 100 certainty. Maybe, but not today. I hope that your recovery and cure are quick and complete.",

      "Content": "Mic, The fpsa is accurate enough to warrant further testing, in your case. I was sent to a urologist about ten years ago, when my psa jumped about three points, to 5.2. The uro did a DRE, which was unremarkable, then took a blood sample for fpsa, and booked an appointment for a biopsy. A few days later, his office called and cancelled the biopsy. My fpsa came back at 25, and he had enough faith in the fpsa result to not see me further. So, just as a high fpsa can often rule out significant PCa, so can a low reading, like yours, demand a next step. Today, there are more comprehensive and accurate blood tests, like PHI and 4K Score, and also a urine test, PCA3. All of them are used to eliminate or justify biopsies. You could ask for one of them. But, probably, there is enough suspicion at this point to justify a biopsy. If you can arrange an MRI first, it can be very helpful in focusing the biopsy needles on any abnormal-appearing areas. Good luck to you.",

      "Content": "Dan, Glad to hear that you have a definitive pathology, and that you are totally justified in your decision and action. The best of luck to you in your follow-up testing and recovery. But, as Pratoman noted, the roiling debate concerning overtreatment continues, if not so much on this forum as on others (I participate in four). The problem is that the diagnostic tools are always \"just ahead\" of what we all need to be confident and comfortable in our decisions. Certainly, had you deferred treatment, and entered a strict AS program, there would have immediately been more intensive imaging, biomarker, genomics, and biopsy confirmations. Maybe in your case, they would have pointed out the greater danger ... or failed. No one knows for certain. Maybe in X years, one simple test will tell us everything with 100 certainty. Maybe, but not today. I hope that your recovery and cure are quick and complete.",

      "Content": "Searcher, In response to those who may conjure that current forms of RT do not have 25 year histories, I would remind them that robotic surgery had almost NO clinical history when it was approved for general usage in the early 2000's. In fact, neither surgery (2000+ years) nor radiation (since 1895) went through ANY such trials before being widely accepted. Here is a 27 minute video interview with a well-known radio/TV personality who had Gleason 6 PCa and was persuaded to have RP by the best known (most boastful) RALP surgeon in the world. He totally regrets the operation and his quality of life since then. Watch it all. Interestingly, I found this video on a \"surgery support\" website, which is paid for by the surgeon who is being criticized.

I would suggest another opinion on this point. Salvage radiation is the standard treatment for locally-recurrent prostate cancer. It can be combined with HT for additional effect, if recommended. However, just going to HT is not curative, while RT can possibly cure him. You really need more consultation with other specialists if more treatment is eventually needed.",

I'm surprised that your urologist offered you an option of active surveillance with three cores having some G4. That would be outside even my comfort zone. You mention that you have already selected surgery, but then ask about a second opinion. OK - my advice for a second opinion is that you look into SBRT/Cyberknife radiation treatment. Recent studies have shown it to be producing higher cure rates and fewer side effects than surgery. In this case, your consult should be with a radiation oncologist whose facility offers that treatment. Any event, your stage of cancer should respond well to either radiation or surgery.

I would suggest another opinion on this point. Salvage radiation is the standard treatment for locally-recurrent prostate cancer. It can be combined with HT for additional effect, if recommended. However, just going to HT is not curative, while RT can possibly cure him. You really need more consultation with other specialists if more treatment is eventually needed.",

I'm surprised that your urologist offered you an option of active surveillance with three cores having some G4. That would be outside even my comfort zone. You mention that you have already selected surgery, but then ask about a second opinion. OK - my advice for a second opinion is that you look into SBRT/Cyberknife radiation treatment. Recent studies have shown it to be producing higher cure rates and fewer side effects than surgery. In this case, your consult should be with a radiation oncologist whose facility offers that treatment. Any event, your stage of cancer should respond well to either radiation or surgery. Good luck to you.",

There is way too much living to enjoy than to spend too much time thinking about what we don't know that may harm us.

I'm surprised that your urologist offered you an option of active surveillance with three cores having some G4. That would be outside even my comfort zone. You mention that you have already selected surgery, but then ask about a second opinion. OK - my advice for a second opinion is that you look into SBRT/Cyberknife radiation treatment. Recent studies have shown it to be producing higher cure rates and fewer side effects than surgery. In this case, your consult should be with a radiation oncologist whose facility offers that treatment. Any event, your stage of cancer should respond well to either radiation or surgery. Good luck to you.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by Dogdays I went into this with a GS9 DX. Having heart and COPD problems compounded things. I met with a surgeon and a radiation oncologist at MSKCC. As a GS9, the chances of the cancer escaping the capsule were higher. Even the surgeon at MSK recommended radiation. Their theory was, why go through two teatments (surgery followed by radiation) when one treatment would suffice. I had LDR brachy at MSK in July by Dr. Zelefsky, followed by SHARP (SBRT) in August. I also started ADT hormone treatments in April. Make sure you do yourself a favor and meet with a radiation oncologist at MSK. IMO, you are more a candidate for radiation and ADT treatment. Keep us up to date Hi Dogdays, Glad that you have joined this forum, as you have recent experience with MSK and Dr. Zelefsky, which can be informative for those interested in state-of-the-art radiation techniques. But, let me ask, did you have LDR brachytherapy followed by SHARP? Really? Usually, I have read about HDR brachy being used before external beam radiation (including SBRT/SHARP). So, did you have seeds implanted? I know that Dr. Zelefsky is often trying new techniques, but this combination seems different. Can you give us some more detail on your treatment?",

      "Content": "Welcome Mark, I fail to see how a biopsy can be justified for PIRADS 2 results. The MRI did not find any lesions, and your psa fell after a course of antibiotics. My experiences with biopsies were far from trauma-free; two of them resulting in pain that lasted for six months. Still, Chuck is correct that biopsy is the only current test for determining the presence and risk grade of any prostate cancer. The key point here is whether the testing done so far justifies the risk inherent in the biopsy procedure. Have you had other blood or urine tests like PHI, 4Kscore, or PCA3? These are more accurate than psa alone, and less affected by infections. Keep asking questions and learning your options. Good luck.",

I'm surprised that your urologist offered you an option of active surveillance with three cores having some G4. That would be outside even my comfort zone. You mention that you have already selected surgery, but then ask about a second opinion. OK - my advice for a second opinion is that you look into SBRT/Cyberknife radiation treatment. Recent studies have shown it to be producing higher cure rates and fewer side effects than surgery. In this case, your consult should be with a radiation oncologist whose facility offers that treatment. Any event, your stage of cancer should respond well to either radiation or surgery.

How can you compare treatment outcomes when robotic surgery, laproscopic surgery, image-guided radiation, and hypofractionated radiation were not yet in use? Same for SBRT and HDRBT.

As life expectancy increases and the cancer expands to more and younger men and more aggressive forms public perception will change. I think that about 220,000 men are diagnosed with PCa in the USA every year, and about 28,000 will die each year. That would tell me that most do die from something else. A month or two ago, Djin published a new nomogram for PCa survival. I plugged in my data, and it said that my chances of dying from PCa were only 1 percent over the next 10 years. But, it also said that my overall survival was less than 36 percent. And, it assumed otherwise good health. Bummer, ruined my day! But, those numbers would prove that \"dying from something else\" is not a myth with this disease. I've been betting on that for a long time.",

Inflammation is often the cause of psa rises. If any cancer is found, what you decide for treatment should depend on the risk level of the pathology. The cure rates for surgery and radiation are the same, and the percentage of low risk men choosing active surveillance is now approaching 50 percent. That's up from near zero 12 years ago, as more and more men learn that their indolent prostate cancer may never need any treatment. But, here's hoping for a negative pathology in your case. Please let us know your results, if positive, as the men here have many experiences and recommendations to share with you.",

As a GS9, the chances of the cancer escaping the capsule were higher. Even the surgeon at MSK recommended radiation. Their theory was, why go through two teatments (surgery followed by radiation) when one treatment would suffice. I had LDR brachy at MSK in July by Dr. Zelefsky, followed by SHARP (SBRT) in August. I also started ADT hormone treatments in April. Make sure you do yourself a favor and meet with a radiation oncologist at MSK. IMO, you are more a candidate for radiation and ADT treatment. Keep us up to date Hi Dogdays, Glad that you have joined this forum, as you have recent experience with MSK and Dr. Zelefsky, which can be informative for those interested in state-of-the-art radiation techniques. But, let me ask, did you have LDR brachytherapy followed by SHARP? Really? Usually, I have read about HDR brachy being used before external beam radiation (including SBRT/SHARP). So, did you have seeds implanted? I know that Dr. Zelefsky is often trying new techniques, but this combination seems different. Can you give us some more detail on your treatment?",

There was a article just published by US TOO that contrasted the results from PHI and 4K tests, and all that study did was add to the confusion and lessen confidence in such tests. Biopsies are not risk or pain free. Three out of 100 result in hospitalization for sepsis, and one in 1400 is fatal. Two of mine resulted in pain that lasted for six months, while tripling my psa. That said, I am not against biopsies if other tests are ominous for cancer. I would have another one if, lets say, I had a PIRADS 5 lesion on an MRI. Keep asking and questioning.

Inflammation is often the cause of psa rises. If any cancer is found, what you decide for treatment should depend on the risk level of the pathology. The cure rates for surgery and radiation are the same, and the percentage of low risk men choosing active surveillance is now approaching 50 percent. That's up from near zero 12 years ago, as more and more men learn that their indolent prostate cancer may never need any treatment. But, here's hoping for a negative pathology in your case. Please let us know your results, if positive, as the men here have many experiences and recommendations to share with you.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by mitchden I\u0092ve been on AS for 2 years - my PSA is stable. My AS protocol is a PSA every 6 months, DRE every year and biopsies every 2-3 years -based on the PSA results. I can\u0092t have an MRI because of my defibrillator. I know that MRI\u0092s are part of the standard AS protocol. I asked my doctor(s) \u0096 local urologist and MSKCC consult about an MRI workaround and I was told there isn\u0092t any. My urologist told me that he would take 16 samples during the next biopsy. I was awake for the first 2 biopsies and although it wasn\u0092t fun, it wasn\u0092t too bad. I already told my doctor that I want to be knocked out for the next biopsy \u0096 especially if he is going to take additional samples. Question: Being knocked out; with a TRUS biopsy, will my doctor be able to take samples from areas of the prostate that he wouldn\u0092t otherwise \u0093reach\u0094 if I was awake? I really don\u0092t want a saturation biopsy or a template mapping biopsy \u0096 although I may ask my doctor about them. For low and intermediate grade cancer, I understand that the cure rate for surgery, IMRT and SBRT is the same \u0096 around 75%. Therefore, the probability for recurrence would be 25%. Questions: Assuming that HT/SRT is the follow-up treatment for recurrence after surgery, what is the cure rate after HT/SRT? I understand that an MRI is done as part of the simulation for SRT. For men that can\u0092t have an MRI, is there a work around? If radiation (IMRT or SBRT) is done as the primary treatment, if there is a recurrence, what is the secondary treatment and what are their respective cure rates? mitchden, I think that the \"equivalence\" of non-recurrence between various treatments needs to be updated in light of recent studies. The rates for SBRT, HDR-BT, proton beam (PBT) for low and intermediate cases appear to be around 94-99 percent after five years. That is significantly above previous stats on PCa treatments. I say this after a lengthy exchange with some PBT advocates on another forum. They had posted how PBT was superior to any other interventional PCa treatment. I challenged that, and posted a very recent study showing a 97 percent non-recurrence rate after five years for SBRT. They replied with a large PBT study showing 99 percent for low risk, and 94 percent for intermediate risk men. Both the SBRT and PBT studies had urinary and gastro side effects at 3 percent or below. Plus, they personally said that the two of them had had ZERO side effects from PBT. I think (based on a long thread on yet another forum) that we agreed that the recurrence rate was about 35 percent for ALL cases of men having RP. While RP non-recurrence rates for only low and intermediate cases would probably be lower than 35 percent, it would appear that the more recent RT treatments (SBRT and PBT) are now the ones setting the \"gold standard\". Regarding salvage treatments should there be a failure of primary radaition, there are several available, as described in this article: https://pcnrv.blogspot.com/2017/09/f...for-radio.html",

The newest combinations of RT are showing very impressive results against high risk PCa. https://prostatecancerinfolink.net/2...ostate-cancer/ Also, many cases of high risk PCa require adjuvant or salvage radiation after surgery. Why have the SE's of surgery, if you are going to need radiation anyway to kill the cancer? Perhaps having a second opinion on your biopsy slides from the experts at Johns Hopkins would be wise to confirm that G10? Many men use their service.

The newest combinations of RT are showing very impressive results against high risk PCa. https://prostatecancerinfolink.net/2...ostate-cancer/ Also, many cases of high risk PCa require adjuvant or salvage radiation after surgery. Why have the SE's of surgery, if you are going to need radiation anyway to kill the cancer? Perhaps having a second opinion on your biopsy slides from the experts at Johns Hopkins would be wise to confirm that G10? Many men use their service.

What is your free psa? Do you know you prostate size and psa density? There was a article just published by US TOO that contrasted the results from PHI and 4K tests, and all that study did was add to the confusion and lessen confidence in such tests. Biopsies are not risk or pain free. Three out of 100 result in hospitalization for sepsis, and one in 1400 is fatal. Two of mine resulted in pain that lasted for six months, while tripling my psa. That said, I am not against biopsies if other tests are ominous for cancer. I would have another one if, lets say, I had a PIRADS 5 lesion on an MRI. Keep asking and questioning. IMHO, there is no immediate need to rush into a biopsy at this time, given what you have told us.",

Why is that??? They do play favorites, blocking foxnews and drudge, while allowing cnn and msnbc. But, those are political, and, while cancer treatment discussions can sometimes have the tone of politics, the blocking of the site is puzzling. Other, similar PCa forums are allowed.

      "Content": "Dan, We are seeing the thread through our different perspectives. I see the research as showing that younger men who are low risk do not gain any healing advantage by choosing immediate surgery over active surveillance. That plays to my bias against overtreatment. In your history, you were under-diagnosed before your RP, and so having that surgery and the resultant pathology, was none-too-soon for you. Your choosing immediate treatment was proven critical to your getting cured. Maybe the issue keeps coming back to more and better initial diagnostic tools, Who is really low risk, and who has a more serious instance of PCa? Those tools are coming, and being tested, but not in popular use, yet. In the meantime, all our opinions and advice are often best-intended assumptions.",

That seems to be a widely held consensus, except by PBT advocates, some of whom are almost evangelical in recommending the treatment.

      "Content": "Originally Posted by mintlatte Thanks guys - I wish the PSA was a typo - but we ran twice first time - 6812, second 6815. At any rate that was my first understanding of that number as well - aggressive prostate cancer - HOWEVER - the next scan we did was the CT scan - at that point the radiologist instead indicated we were working with Lymphoma - so the biopsy result is actually from the lymph node - All we have from the Dr. so far is that is stage 4 prostate cancer. I expect when we meet with the Dr. tomorrow I will get some information regarding the gleason score - (it is one of the questions on my list) and hopefully some treatment options. The real kicker here is that they thought that because the prostate looked pretty OK on the imaging scan. In terms of Cancer centers - I may look for a 2nd opinion from one, but our insurance does not cover any of the cancer centers. I have not ruled it out yet - but I want to see if I can get the same treatment options from within the system, but I have started to make some contacts along those lines. We are in Colorado - so if you know of a place I could go for a good 2nd opinion - I would appreciate the recommendation. I will post more tomorrow after I get the rest of the information we want from the Dr. but I appreciate the responses - I am doing my best to be optimistic and look at the best case scenarios - but I don't want to pretend the worst doesn't exist - The best comment that I can add here is that I have read posts by men with psa's of 6000, 7200, and 8000 (two of them), who were posting TEN YEARS after those diagnoses. And, their cases involved the meds and chemo that were available then, while more capable ones have been invented since. So, while his case is very serious, and those treatments are not a picnic, there are reasons to be hopeful.",

That was a man whose psa then dropped back below 5, and subsequent tests found no prostate cancer.

I attended a local prostate cancer support group last night, where there were presentations by a urologist, radiologist, and a chemo doctor. They have a lot of \"tricks\" to prolong life, even with very advanced prostate cancer. And, new clinical trials for a spectrum of treatments are available in most areas. A question was asked about \"just letting go\", and not dealing with the side effects of the advanced treatments. All three specialists became grim faced. Finally, after looking at each other, the urologist said that death from prostate cancer was slow and painful. It was something to be fought against as long as possible. That was a powerful moment, and something for you think about. Always try to be optimistic, breakthroughs are happening.",

Now comes what is often the most challenging part, which is to choose a treatment. The issue with prostate cancer is that there are about a dozen different ways to cure a case like his. There are three types of surgery (open, laproscopic, and robotic): five types of radiation (intensity modulated \"IMRT\", stereotactic \"SBRT\", low dose brachytherapy \"LDR-BT\", high dose brachytherapy \"HDR_BT\", and proton beam \"PBT\"). All have been in use for more than a decade, and all have studies supporting their effectiveness. Further, there are more treatments, like Cryotherapy, High Intensity Ultrasound (HIFU), and various focal laser treatments. They have their advocates. The good part is that all of them have cured men of prostate cancer. The tough part is researching and deciding which is best for him, as all have some side effects.

      "Content": "Originally Posted by mintlatte Thanks guys - I wish the PSA was a typo - but we ran twice first time - 6812, second 6815. At any rate that was my first understanding of that number as well - aggressive prostate cancer - HOWEVER - the next scan we did was the CT scan - at that point the radiologist instead indicated we were working with Lymphoma - so the biopsy result is actually from the lymph node - All we have from the Dr. so far is that is stage 4 prostate cancer. I expect when we meet with the Dr. tomorrow I will get some information regarding the gleason score - (it is one of the questions on my list) and hopefully some treatment options. The real kicker here is that they thought that because the prostate looked pretty OK on the imaging scan. In terms of Cancer centers - I may look for a 2nd opinion from one, but our insurance does not cover any of the cancer centers. I have not ruled it out yet - but I want to see if I can get the same treatment options from within the system, but I have started to make some contacts along those lines. We are in Colorado - so if you know of a place I could go for a good 2nd opinion - I would appreciate the recommendation. I will post more tomorrow after I get the rest of the information we want from the Dr. but I appreciate the responses - I am doing my best to be optimistic and look at the best case scenarios - but I don't want to pretend the worst doesn't exist - The best comment that I can add here is that I have read posts by men with psa's of 6000, 7200, and 8000 (two of them), who were posting TEN YEARS after those diagnoses. And, their cases involved the meds and chemo that were available then, while more capable ones have been invented since. So, while his case is very serious, and those treatments are not a picnic, there are reasons to be hopeful.",

For what it is worth, I have been trying to get an answer to the question \"how high can a psa rise from non-cancerous causes?\", for a couple of years, and have never seen an authoritative statement. Just recalling the posts by members of various prostate cancer forums, the highest I have read about was 58. That was a man whose psa then dropped back below 5, and subsequent tests found no prostate cancer. While my above remarks are anecdotal, and probably any urologist has a better reply, it indicates that your dad is likely dealing with cancer. As he receives more testing and feedback, there are members here who have experienced the full range of choices and treatments, who will be glad to try to advise and assist you and him/",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by DjinTonic ddayglo, this \"margin of error\" between biopsied tissue and the whole prostate is a problem for those who could do AS. Perhaps your 3+4 is the hardest case. Trying to put myself in that position, I might well feel with AS I'm just waiting for a repeat biopsy to find a lesion with 4+3 that may have been there from the onset. Then I would worry that a biopsy with a 4 + 3 core has missed a 4 + 4. Of course you could be downgraded after RP too, but this is a risky enterprise. Djin, That is why a strict AS protocol like Johns Hopkins requires confirmatory biopsies when you enter the program. I had to have THREE biopsies within two years to make certain that I was properly placed. That really drives down the chances of missing more serious cancer.",

Advanced cancer and extending life is where all the intense research and out-of-the-envelope creativity are happening. Many different approaches. Things that were thought to make no sense, like ADDING testosterone, are now being tested to defeat advanced cancer. There are publications weekly, if not daily, of articles by specialists around the world announcing some new understanding of how PCa works. while some other group reports amazing results in mice with human stage IV genes.

I\u2019ve been off the TRT for about 2 1/2 weeks and definitely feel the loss of energy even on the super low dose I was on. I will go and pay for my own lab work next week to check my regular and free PSA. Can anyone explain the free PSA and what are considered good and bad numbers? Thanks for everything. You\u2019ve been a big help... For free PSA, anything under 15 is suspicious for cancer, and anything above 25 makes it unlikely that a biopsy would find significant cancer. Why not order a PHI test, which will give you the PSA and fPSA numbers, but has an additional test, and it will provide a more accurate result? It costs about $115, from what I've heard.",

      "Content": "For the past four years, my specialist at Johns Hopkins had been Ashley Ross, MD, PhD, Assistant Professor of Urology, Oncology, and Pathology, Johns Hopkins School Of Medicine. His phone number was the same as Dr. Ballentine Carter, which shows how highly his potential was regarded. I found Dr. Ross to be among the \"best and brighest\" of the younger generation of prostate cancer luminaries, and he seemed to be constantly publishing articles exploring new approaches to treating PCa. His wife is also a urologist, who recently took a position in Texas, and Dr. Ross left JH to join a private practice there. My point in this thread is a reference to comments by Dr. Ross that were reported by a poster on another forum: \"Also spoke on phone with Ashley Ross who used to be PCa director at JH, urologist and one of the few people there involved with focal treatments. My sense is that JH is still pretty conservative and I think since RP pretty much started there they still cling to that as gold standard treatment. Going with the random sampling of a TRUS biopsy versus MRI targeted biopsy would be philosophically consistent with that. That said, Ross did say that he felt that radiation therapies were about to overtake RP in efficacy the next few years and that RP would likely be left for only the more \"difficult\" cases.\" Hmm, knowing Dr. Ross, he is the ultimate researcher. I would wager that that he is waiting for and anticipating the 10 year results from major SBRT practitioners like King, Katz, and Zelefsky. Their results through 8 or 9 years are impressive, but 10 years seems to be a benchmark. The SBRT and also HDR BT techniques are already in place, and it's just the 10 year results that are needed to tie the ribbon on the package. Something more for you to consider.",

If the cure rates would be comparable to other treatments and both short term and long term side effects reduced, then it may prove to be additional option for primary treatment. Jazz, Here is a comparison of Cryo versus other salvage treatments for failed radiation therapy. Check the Summary Table.

Federal CDC statistics indicate that his chances of dying from prostate cancer within the next ten years are less than one percent. That is an overview of ALL new cases, and his is low risk, driving the odds even lower. His case has set two new records for what I've read: (1) 8 biopsies before any cancer was found; and (2) a spike of 53 from a BHP infection. That must have been very worrisome for the both of you. At this point, all options of treatment, as well as surveillance, are on the table for you and he to research and select from. There is no need to rush in deciding what to do. However, the size of his prostate, and the existing urination problems, might be a factor to choose surgery, but that is something to very carefully think over. Good luck.

This approach is new to me, but it makes sense if they want to reduce the size of your prostate before certain types of radiation treatment. That thermotherapy is FDA approved for treating BPH. And, since the prostate must be under 40-50cc in volume for certain treatments, they are reducing its volume as a preparatory step. Placement of fiducial markers is typical of several types of external beam radiation, as it helps position the beam despite your movements on the table. Have they discussed what type of radiation is being proposed? Have you consulted more than one specialist regarding your treatment options?

      "Content": "For the past four years, my specialist at Johns Hopkins had been Ashley Ross, MD, PhD, Assistant Professor of Urology, Oncology, and Pathology, Johns Hopkins School Of Medicine. His phone number was the same as Dr. Ballentine Carter, which shows how highly his potential was regarded. I found Dr. Ross to be among the \"best and brighest\" of the younger generation of prostate cancer luminaries, and he seemed to be constantly publishing articles exploring new approaches to treating PCa. His wife is also a urologist, who recently took a position in Texas, and Dr. Ross left JH to join a private practice there. My point in this thread is a reference to comments by Dr. Ross that were reported by a poster on another forum: \"Also spoke on phone with Ashley Ross who used to be PCa director at JH, urologist and one of the few people there involved with focal treatments. My sense is that JH is still pretty conservative and I think since RP pretty much started there they still cling to that as gold standard treatment. Going with the random sampling of a TRUS biopsy versus MRI targeted biopsy would be philosophically consistent with that. That said, Ross did say that he felt that radiation therapies were about to overtake RP in efficacy the next few years and that RP would likely be left for only the more \"difficult\" cases.\" Hmm, knowing Dr. Ross, he is the ultimate researcher. I would wager that that he is waiting for and anticipating the 10 year results from major SBRT practitioners like King, Katz, and Zelefsky. Their results through 8 or 9 years are impressive, but 10 years seems to be a benchmark. The SBRT and also HDR BT techniques are already in place, and it's just the 10 year results that are needed to tie the ribbon on the package. Something more for you to consider.",

But, you should take some time now, and keep asking and learning. Several types of treatments should cure you. Just be comfortable with the one you choose.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by hopeful65 Chuck, First I'd like to say thank you for taking the time to reach out to me, I feel so overwhelmed with different emotions. I have two young kids, a beautiful family who depend on me, I saw my brother and my dad pass away from cancer, they had different, more serious types. It's very scary and very confusing, I don't know which path to take. I just turned 52, I'm in good shape, work out an average of two times a week, eat healthy, my work consists of manual labor so other than injury pains I feel pretty good. My PSA history, 11/14 - 4.8, 7/15 - 6.2, 11/15 - 3.6, 4/16 - 4.9, 10/16 - 5.9, 3/17 - 7.5, then again 3/17 - 8.2 Out of all of the samples taken, two were found to have a Gleason score of 7, (3 + 4), and the other three areas were a Gleason 6, (3 + 3). The two areas of Gleason seven were found on the right base lateral, 70% of the tissue sample, and right lateral mid, 15% of tissue sample. Thank you, Eddie Eddie, thanks for providing these details. While I try to suggest active surveillance for those men who might safely benefit from not having treatment at the present time, I would rather recommend that you need to research and select a form of treatment.

It was tried in the 1970's for prostate cancer, without good results due to lack of modern imaging for placement. Ultrasound changed that, and LDR has been in regular use since the late 1980's. There is a \"sticky\" thread near the top of this webpage that has a discussion on the \"two types of brachytherapy\". That should be valuable for you. However, there are not many regular members of this forum who have had brachytherapy, but they are elsewhere on internet forums, so you may have to search beyond any one forum to get the feedback that you want.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by wbigs As someone who has recently joined the active surveillance club, I read all 3 articles and Im still not sure how I feel. While I think that its trying to convey that AS is a viable option for early cancer, I tend to pick out the negatives from the articles just as Michael has in the previous post. I think the hardest part is trying to be patient, which isn't one of my strong points. It doesn't help when you are telling people about your prostate cancer who aren't familiar with treatment options and you tell them that you are just going to keep and eye on things for a year or two and they look at you like your f-ing nuts. wbigs, The key statement in your post is \"telling people about your prostate cancer who aren't familiar with treatment options\" I had the same reaction in 2009. I am now entering my eighth year of Active Surveillance, with my assessment unchanged. Just had MRI and other tests last week. No changes at all. And, no negative changes to my quality of life due to radical treatments. Seek out informed medical advice, and dismiss the well-meaning, almost common-sense concerns of those who are not familiar with low risk prostate cancer. Join a local support group if you need people to talk with one-on-one. They are all aware of AS, and many wish that their doctors had recommended it to them.",

No problem with AS, especially when the people telling you this are the ones who review the data and make those recommendations for national adaption. Now, the OncotypeDX genomics test can be done by sending your biopsy slides to that company. That checks about 20 genetic markers within the cancer to predict its aggressiveness. Also, the ERG and pten tests can be done on those slides. The PHI and PCA3 blood and urine tests are also widely used.

The Precision Point system requires only local anesthetic, and no antibiotics. They have had zero cases of serious infections by going through the perineum. The pain and cancer detection results are about same as a TRUS, but the zero infection rate is a big deal. No more fears of antibiotics and sepsis.",

Maybe I don't see it, but can you explain how they measure urinary toxicity and how the different grades are determined? Jazz, there are standards for grading urinary and gastro toxicities. I can't explain exactly how they do it, but this quote and the link to the article I extracted it from, should point you in the right direction for further research. \"RTOG toxicity grades were assigned prospectively for genitourinary (GU) and GI toxicity at the date of each follow\u2010up visit by the attending physician. More detailed Common Toxicity Criteria (CTC) version 3.0 toxicity grades were then assigned retrospectively by chart review. \" https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/....1002/cam4.261",

      "Content": "Welcome, and sorry that you have to be here. This approach is new to me, but it makes sense if they want to reduce the size of your prostate before certain types of radiation treatment. That thermotherapy is FDA approved for treating BPH. And, since the prostate must be under 40-50cc in volume for certain treatments, they are reducing its volume as a preparatory step. Placement of fiducial markers is typical of several types of external beam radiation, as it helps position the beam despite your movements on the table. Have they discussed what type of radiation is being proposed? Have you consulted more than one specialist regarding your treatment options? You have time to explore all your options and feel comfortable with what you choose.",

The 2015 FDA approval basically classifies it as a scalpel for cutting prostate tissue, not a method to cure prostate cancer.

I guess they made the determination that almost any man who hasn't been diagnosed by age 70, and has normal PSA/no symptoms, is \"in the clear\" and its extraordinarily unlikely that they will live long enough for PC to kill them. Assuming that is what they were thinking, it makes a lot of sense. Most American men who see a doctor every year have had many psa tests by age 70. When I was 51, with no symptoms or family history, and doctor said it was wise to start psa testing. BUT, there are some guys, and I know some, who have an abject fear of doctors. For that minority, who have not had multiple previous tests, there probably should not be an upper age limit. They need a baseline number. Whether they should be treated or not is not the question at hand.",

I also have been told I have three positive cores. No problem with AS, especially when the people telling you this are the ones who review the data and make those recommendations for national adaption. Now, the OncotypeDX genomics test can be done by sending your biopsy slides to that company. That checks about 20 genetic markers within the cancer to predict its aggressiveness. Also, the ERG and pten tests can be done on those slides. The PHI and PCA3 blood and urine tests are also widely used.

I have several friends with psa histories higher than your husbands, and they have had multiple negative biopsies over many years. Please do not assume that he has cancer; the greater likelihood is that he has BPH. I am also surprised that his urologist is doing a biopsy without an fpsa or PHI or other preliminary test. I once had a biopsy cancelled because of a high (good) fpsa result. Biopsies are not risk-free. I know; painfully know. Please take your time, catch your breath, and read as much as you can comfortably absorb. There are several types of treatment, if that is even necessary. make sure that you and he fully comprehend the possible side effects of each. Good luck.",

      "Content": "Kevin, Sorry that you received this news, and have to join us here. Among the best advice right now is for you to get a second reading on the biopsy slides. Many men take advantage of the services offered by Johns Hopkins, whose chief pathologist is considered the world authority on interpreting prostate biopsy slides. From the above report, you would be risk category 2 out of 5 on the new World Health Organization guidelines. No need to rush into a decision. Both surgery and radiation can effectively treat you. There are variations of both those therapies, and you need to learn about them. The side effects are especially important, and you need to thoroughly understand them before making a choice. I would suggest that you attend some local prostate cancer support groups, and talk with men who have had various treatments. Whatever you do, do not make a treatment decision after talking to only one specialist. Make sure that you consult with both surgeons and radiologists. The cure rates are about the same between both methods, but side effects may vary. Others will be along with more advice. Good luck to you.",

And, \"Another\" has once again replied with his insightful and concise reassurance. But, I must interject that one of the primary qualifications for active surveillance is peace of mind. Once you make your choice, you should not torture yourself by re-analyzing that process on a daily basis. My credo in making choices has three steps: Decision, Resolution, Closure. Make the choice, do what it takes to effect the choice, and don't keep re-thinking the choice. For AS, that would mean settling on a protocol of follow-up appointments and tests. But, you owe it to yourself not to constantly question your decision. If you won't be able to stop questioning, then, IMHO, AS is not a good choice for you. I hang around forums and meetings because I have an advocacy for AS and against overtreatment. I do not re-examine if my choice was correct. This factor needs to be included in your calculus.

Just one example.... Regards, DD dog, You may have trouble finding up-to-date numbers. I attended a local PCa support group recently, and heard presentations from a surgeon, a radiologist, and a chemo doctor. The surgeon showed statistics that the rate of choice of AS for newly diagnosed patients had risen from 10 to over 50 percent in three years. That's an amazing change! He was also adamant that G6 cases should not have intervention. That surely would not have been common advice five or ten years ago. So, the available statistics for \"overtreatment\" may not be accurate in light of this rapidly changing environment.",

      "Content": "Kevin, Sorry that you received this news, and have to join us here. Among the best advice right now is for you to get a second reading on the biopsy slides. Many men take advantage of the services offered by Johns Hopkins, whose chief pathologist is considered the world authority on interpreting prostate biopsy slides. From the above report, you would be risk category 2 out of 5 on the new World Health Organization guidelines. No need to rush into a decision. Both surgery and radiation can effectively treat you. There are variations of both those therapies, and you need to learn about them. The side effects are especially important, and you need to thoroughly understand them before making a choice. I would suggest that you attend some local prostate cancer support groups, and talk with men who have had various treatments. Whatever you do, do not make a treatment decision after talking to only one specialist. Make sure that you consult with both surgeons and radiologists. The cure rates are about the same between both methods, but side effects may vary. Others will be along with more advice. Good luck to you.",

Hi RobLee, Things are changing rapidly in the world of advanced radiation applications, and the old wisdom of salvage radiation not being used if it was the primary treatment may be outdated. https://pcnrv.blogspot.com/2016/08/s...nce-after.html",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by mikesimm This raises an interesting element... Is it the prostate that is \"producing\" the threes and fours - and is not producing 5's? Or do the threes and fours replicate themselves and perhaps morph/multiply into a higher number? In other words, where is the factory? All of this is just academic, but it's how I think. I'm of the view that nobody knows anything, including me. Remember when the earth used to be flat? My biopsy results just got changed (for the worse) after being reviewed at MD Anderson. I'm still leaning heavily toward Proton treatment, assuming I'm a candidate. Mike in Kerrville Mike, The question of \"can Gleason 3 cells morph into higher grade?\" is a regularly discussed topic on PCa forums. The general conclusion is usually \"yes, it's possible, but the odds of it happening are insignificant, like 1 out of 2000\". The research was based on the Johns Hopkins and Sunnybrook As groups which have over 3,000 patients and over 20 years history on some of them. I recall there were 2 cases where the DNA analysis seemed to prove morphing was possible, but not frequent enough for patients to worry about.",

      "Content": "Cathy, I'm not sure why he is being sent for those scans with only G6 cancer being found. As the others have said, that is the lowest grade of PCa, and often, as in my case, does not require treatment, but rather close monitoring. What is most helpful for us in providing advice is for you to obtain the biopsy pathology report (he paid for it, and owns it), and write up some of the findings in a signature, as you will see on the posts here. Yes, getting guys to open up is sometimes difficult, but prostate cancer boards are a big exception. People do not hold back their private details when they want and need to exchange advice. The most important thing now, is that he gets multiple opinions, and is NOT pressured into surgery or another (possibly unnecessary and damaging) treatment without a full understanding and discussion of all his options.",

The difference is the side effects, and, being only 55, you could have many years to regret making the wrong choice. See the RO, and hear what they have to say. But, equally as important, ask what types of radiation therapy they offer. There are IMRT, SBRT, LDRBT, HDRBT, and Proton Beam. I'm not aware of any one RO who performs all of them. And, some of the least practiced may have the best results. So, if the RO you see only does IMRT, you have only been told a fraction of the offerings, and need to consult further. Certainly a major center such as Anderson or MSKCC would afford you a range of options. Hopkins is renown for their surgery, but I rarely hear of their other offerings.",

The difference is the side effects, and, being only 55, you could have many years to regret making the wrong choice. See the RO, and hear what they have to say. But, equally as important, ask what types of radiation therapy they offer. There are IMRT, SBRT, LDRBT, HDRBT, and Proton Beam. I'm not aware of any one RO who performs all of them. And, some of the least practiced may have the best results. So, if the RO you see only does IMRT, you have only been told a fraction of the offerings, and need to consult further. Certainly a major center such as Anderson or MSKCC would afford you a range of options. Hopkins is renown for their surgery, but I rarely hear of their other offerings.",

As the others have said, that is the lowest grade of PCa, and often, as in my case, does not require treatment, but rather close monitoring. What is most helpful for us in providing advice is for you to obtain the biopsy pathology report (he paid for it, and owns it), and write up some of the findings in a signature, as you will see on the posts here. Yes, getting guys to open up is sometimes difficult, but prostate cancer boards are a big exception. People do not hold back their private details when they want and need to exchange advice. The most important thing now, is that he gets multiple opinions, and is NOT pressured into surgery or another (possibly unnecessary and damaging) treatment without a full understanding and discussion of all his options.",

I commented that he needed to choose a treatment that he was comfortable with and then proceed with it. I was then criticized by several men adamantly insisting that \"Gleason 6 is not cancer\". Whew! That surprised me. All the other comments agreed with them. That is a viewpoint, a theory, that some specialists and patient advocates have. I think that it is dangerous until proven.

The additional testing is what has contributed to JH's AS men having no greater risk of mortality if they later need treatment than men who had immediate treatment.

      "Content": "Two points - IMHO, a man is never really qualified for AS after one biopsy. At Johns Hopkins' very successful program, you must have an mp-MRI and a confirmatory biopsy within six months. Plus, whichever genomics or blood/urine tests they are currently using with newly-diagnosed men. The additional testing is what has contributed to JH's AS men having no greater risk of mortality if they later need treatment than men who had immediate treatment. Point 2 - Basal cell carcinoma - Just diagnosed with a spot on my leg. With reddish hair and easily sunburned, this was no surprise. Mohs surgery set for the end of August. No concerns about the cancer, or having it \"cut out\". That's truly a low risk cancer and the surgery has no significant side effects. I have no worries about that issue at all.",

Far from it. I have read the journals, on other forums, of those who lost long fights with PCa. The last months' accounts were written by their relatives.

Some points for you to consider. None of the RT techniques used today existed 25 years ago, which is when such studies would have started. That includes IMRT, IGRT, SBRT, and Photon Beam. Brachytherapy (both types) did exist then. But, the precision focusing of Varian Truebeam and Cyberknife devices, with all their sophisticated targeting of possibly moving organs, did not exist. Years ago, the overreach from the CDRT radiation at that time caused the bowel and bladder issues. Those problems are far less frequent today than in 1993. Also, you may want to explore proton beam therapy. I am hearing from patients (elsewhere on the internet) who say it has cured them with zero side effects. Yeah, I know that sounds like hype, and requires skepticism, but their comments sound consistent, and perhaps you should talk with a center that offers that service. Anyway, you are proceeding to a cure, whichever path you now choose. Good luck.",

You have been through the usual AS first-year protocol of biopsy diagnosis, MRI, and fusion biopsy, with only insignificant cancer being found. The fact that no cancer was found on the second biopsy is a good indicator of indolent PCa. You have already had the confirmatory biopsy, so I don't see a reason why another MRI would be needed anytime soon. A possible regimen for you would be six month psa/fpsa or PHI tests, annual DRE's, and MRI's or biopsies every 2-3 years, or as required by the other test results. You are the first poster that I seen comment on the Urolift. Others will probably find your experience of interest.

If those tests all show negative at this time, you are probably like many of my friends dealing with BPH, and possible infections. High PSA's, up to 8 seem to be common with BPH.

Get yourself to a major cancer center and into professional care. Or, update your signature if you have been watching it because I'm worried for you. Another, Multiple positive cores of G6 do not disqualify a man from AS. Some guidelines want 2 or less, some want a percent threshold, like 35 of the total number of cores, and some, like Sunnybrook, have no limit. What is confusing to me is guessing how many cores were taken during that biopsy, 12, 6, or less? We need more info on the total number of samples involved.

It is based on PSA, and is considered more accurate than PSA alone, for a PSA range between 4 and 10. PHI (prostate health index) is a blood test that has been in use for about five years now. It is based on PSA, and includes results for PSA, Free PSA, and a cancer biomarker. So, PHI gives you three scores, and is that considered more accurate than just having PSA and/or Free PSA results. It costs about $110, the last that I heard. That's good input on the Urolift device. So many men are suffering with BPH, so your success with that product should be helpful to others.",

The typical protocol, after the first biopsy, is to have an MRI, and then have a confirmatory fusion biopsy within a year. The second biopsy greatly reduces the chances of a significant cancer being missed by the first one. The risk is not from Gleason (3+3) lesions, as these have never been shown to metastasize. The issue is that nearby high grade lesions were missed. As Pratoman stated, it\u0092s time to have the MRI and fusion biopsy now.",

If only 5 to 10 percent of the men who had RP suffer from incontinence after 12 months, then all of them must be on internet PCa forums. Seriously! I have somehow managed/mismanaged to belong to EIGHT different prostate cancer forums (I do have a life, and travel constantly, but the internet is always available). There are so many, many posts from men complaining and seeking advice about post-RP incontinence, that I would believe a percentage above 60, if you told me that. One forum is subsidized by Dr. Samadi to support men having/had RP, and it seems that many of those men are back on the forum months, or a year, later complaining about incontinence. Yes, I know that unsatisfied customers of any product or service are the ones most likely to complain on Yelp or other feedback forums....But, there is a real disconnect between those low RP/incontinence numbers quoted by medical practices, and the posts I see on PCa forums from (some of) the men who were operated on.",

All those studies used SBRT to target the area(s) of recurrence. So, the old wisdom of primary surgery offering a salvage advantage may no longer apply.

If only 5 to 10 percent of the men who had RP suffer from incontinence after 12 months, then all of them must be on internet PCa forums. Seriously! I have somehow managed/mismanaged to belong to EIGHT different prostate cancer forums (I do have a life, and travel constantly, but the internet is always available). There are so many, many posts from men complaining and seeking advice about post-RP incontinence, that I would believe a percentage above 60, if you told me that. One forum is subsidized by Dr. Samadi to support men having/had RP, and it seems that many of those men are back on the forum months, or a year, later complaining about incontinence. Yes, I know that unsatisfied customers of any product or service are the ones most likely to complain on Yelp or other feedback forums....But, there is a real disconnect between those low RP/incontinence numbers quoted by medical practices, and the posts I see on PCa forums from (some of) the men who were operated on.",

      "Content": "Zen, Reading the recent posts on this thread, I now agree with Michael F that treatment is needed, and that your thought process should be on what form of treatment will both stop the cancer and provide the least lifelong side effects. There are prostate cancer forums that tend to favor surgery as the gold standard for fighting PCa; there are others that don't like surgery and favor radiation, especially SBRT/Cyberknife. There are others that promote newer, less invasive therapies, like FLA and TOOKAD, and offer a chaos of sincere and conflicting opinions. At this point, maybe your time is best spent sorting out all the varied experiences and opinions of the men that have \"gone before\" you. Not an easy task...but one you may be glad you attempted. You may want to attend a local prostate cancer support group. They are in all areas, and are wonderful places to frankly exchange experiences and knowledge. I didn't know if I would fit in, but everyone, from the G 3+3 to the G 5+5, is accepted with great interest and support. The US TOO groups organize many of these.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by DjinTonic ASA, do we know if the RP vs RT percentages of AS men who go on to need/opt for treatment is also about 1:1? Also, do you think the 2018 Guidelines for AS we discussed in another thread will change the percentage of AS-eligible men compared to the previous criteria? Djin, I do not know the breakdown in treatment preferences for men who move from AS to treatment. I would suspect that it is possibly more towards non-surgical treatments since men on AS often search for other options and opinions, and not automatically follow the advice of their diagnosing urologist. The new 2018 Guidelines for Clinicians have widened the criteria for very-low-risk and low-risk men and made AS the default recommendation. I was very pleased to see that they jettisoned the \"no more than two positive cores\" rule, which was created when six core biopsies were standard. Also, no mention of bilateral involvement. The addition of PSA Density is fine with me, as that allows for normal aging and BPH to be factored into your risk. So, I do see the new criteria as making more men safely eligible for AS, and the percentage should continue to increase. Last year, the chief urologist at a large area hospital told my support group that he did not want to perform any more RP's on G(3+3) men, and that 50 percent of newly diagnosed men were choosing AS.",

PSA is an indicator of prostate activity, and is not diagnostic for cancer. You could have an inflammation, and those are difficult to treat as most do not respond to antibiotics. They just come and go with time. Instead of just another PSA test, I would suggest a PHI instead. That includes PSA, free PSA, and a prostate cancer biomarker. It is more accurate and less affected by inflammation than PSA alone.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by DjinTonic ASA, do we know if the RP vs RT percentages of AS men who go on to need/opt for treatment is also about 1:1? Also, do you think the 2018 Guidelines for AS we discussed in another thread will change the percentage of AS-eligible men compared to the previous criteria? Djin, I do not know the breakdown in treatment preferences for men who move from AS to treatment. I would suspect that it is possibly more towards non-surgical treatments since men on AS often search for other options and opinions, and not automatically follow the advice of their diagnosing urologist. The new 2018 Guidelines for Clinicians have widened the criteria for very-low-risk and low-risk men and made AS the default recommendation. I was very pleased to see that they jettisoned the \"no more than two positive cores\" rule, which was created when six core biopsies were standard. Also, no mention of bilateral involvement. The addition of PSA Density is fine with me, as that allows for normal aging and BPH to be factored into your risk. So, I do see the new criteria as making more men safely eligible for AS, and the percentage should continue to increase. Last year, the chief urologist at a large area hospital told my support group that he did not want to perform any more RP's on G(3+3) men, and that 50 percent of newly diagnosed men were choosing AS.",

Another, I understand what your experience was, and that the current diagnostic tools for AS are not perfect. That is why it is incumbent on both the doctor and the patient to see that a G6 diagnosis is followed up by an MRI and targeted fusion biopsy, to minimize the chances of under-diagnosis. To fill out the lecture by that Chief Urologist, he did kept using the phrase \"puny Gleason 6\", so most likely he would not have thought that your findings of eight positive cores to be \"puny\". He probably would have been willing to discuss surgery with you.",

There is a lot of controversy about \"overtreatment\" of G3+3 cancer, where the treatment has serious side effects, yet the cancer may never become life-threatening. In certain areas, the rate of new low risk patients choosing AS has skyrocketed from almost none to over fifty percent in less than five years. In Sweden, over 90 percent of new low risk cases are on AS. Please do research on \"active surveillance\", and learn about your options.

But, here is more fuel for the fire in the debate about alternative medicine and prostate cancer. A Yale study published by the NCI states that that was no increased mortality for prostate cancer when comparing usual treatments and alternative methods over a 5-1/2 year followup. Other cancers showed dramatically high adverse statistics, but not PCa. http://www.cnn.com/2017/08/17/health...udy/index.html IMHO, this may be due to the long period it takes for PCa to kill. Other studies have shown no difference between treatment and no treatment for the first 10 years. But, we may expect this study to heat up the discussion on allowing posts for those medicines.",

The 39 psa, 4.3 fpsa, and 97 PHI (mine is 29, and I have cancer) would almost certainly indicate a serious level of PCa. But, as you know, blood tests don't diagnose PCa, and you have had two 3T MRIs and two saturation biopsies, which are essentially negative. With those drastically conflicting results, I wouldn't know if I should cry or sing. Hopefully, the next responders may offer some better insight. Also, keep trying as many forums as you can find, as this puzzle may need a lot of exposure to find the guidance that you need. Good luck to you.",

Is this for \"any\" G6 patient, or just this individual and others like him. G6 is the majority of prostate cancer out there, this would be big economic news if G6 patients could no longer get surgery and radiation. He's 53, and no mention of other issues. His RO at MSKCC said that this notice appears to be generic, rather then specific to him. Where this is really wrong is that they are denying him coverage for an MRI and a genomics test which are part of MSKCC's AS protocol to be more certain that he is properly placed. He wants to be in AS, but this interferes with their testing. I could imagine that this would play havoc with the thinking of those men who can't deal with AS and want the cancer gone. Their choices are being restricted.",

Also, it is much more costly, and there are frequent comments (elsewhere on the internet) from patients saying that their insurance will not pay for it.

The 39 psa, 4.3 fpsa, and 97 PHI (mine is 29, and I have cancer) would almost certainly indicate a serious level of PCa. But, as you know, blood tests don't diagnose PCa, and you have had two 3T MRIs and two saturation biopsies, which are essentially negative. With those drastically conflicting results, I wouldn't know if I should cry or sing. Hopefully, the next responders may offer some better insight. Also, keep trying as many forums as you can find, as this puzzle may need a lot of exposure to find the guidance that you need. Good luck to you.",

The suggestion of augmenting uPSA testing with PET scans and MRI's, certainly would constitute a more intensive level of \"watching\". Many men want as much early warning of recurrence as possible, and all want the peace of mind of stable, negative tests. Call this scheduling what you want, that is secondary to its value.",

But, your idea and intent is very valid, and \"AWW\", or whatever you decide to call it, can define a very pro-active monitoring for recurrence. The suggestion of augmenting uPSA testing with PET scans and MRI's, certainly would constitute a more intensive level of \"watching\". Many men want as much early warning of recurrence as possible, and all want the peace of mind of stable, negative tests. Call this scheduling what you want, that is secondary to its value.",

I would agree with you that AS is not likely to a good a course of action for you. At age 50, with a positive DRE, treatment would seem advisable. I'm not sure how serious a GPS of 37 is, but I can tell you that mine is 2. You may also seek out some additional forums. I participate in three, and find that one leans towards surgery, another towards radiation, and a third towards focal therapies like FLA and HIFU. When I was on another forum, I mentioned comments identical to yours regarding the side effects of surgery and radiation. I was strongly reprimanded by the moderator, who insisted that such data on radiation side effects was very old, and that radiation had far fewer and less serious SE's than surgery. So, you need to also hear those experiences and viewpoints as you make your decisions. There are also new clinical trials using Prostvac and other non-invasive vaccine treatments. The future may belong to vaccine and genomic therapies, which offer the hope of no side effects. You can do some research on those. Much to learn, but you are certainly asking good questions.",

If he has PCa, and it is of a stage that requires treatment...well, there are several types of treatments available, and the urologist is probably only really knowledgable about surgery. Consulting with a radiation oncologist would provide a second opinion. There is a new sticky at the top of the main page for \"Books on Prostate Cancer\". Reading some of them will provide some perspective beyond Dr. Walsh's book, which has been criticized as out-of-date and biased towards surgery. In any event, you will soon have facts in front of you, and then you can begin to determine what to do next. Good luck.",

This is especially true for the ultra sensitive psa tests. You will have a number, but if it is < .02, then you are fine.

From what I've read of the testing that JH did with that product, it's predictive percentage is impressive. Your wonderful natural gifts of intellectual curiosity and probing may not have been a good fit for AS in any event, IMHO. Dr. Leapman's slide presentation was most impressive. You are very fortunate in having him as your specialist. Now, I have to ask, will you go with his recommendation, or will you seek out prominent practitioners of other therapies, such as Alan Katz with SBRT, or Josh Yamada at MSKCC with HD Monotherapy, or Zelefsky at MSKCC, who has been reporting great results with radiation protocols BEYOND SBRT? In any event, my best wishes to you. You deserve the best outcome because you have done an amazing amount of research, which has benefited...everybody!",

      "Content": "Bernard, As the others have noted, you have time to research, ask, consult, and finally be content with whatever course you choose. I recently had an online exchange with a man who was 51, and had, as I recall, three positive cores each with a higher percentage of G3+3 cancer. He went to see the top doctor at a leading prostate cancer center. This doctor had founded what is probably the strictest and best known active surveillance program in the nation. After a discussion with the patient and his wife, this well known specialist signed him up for the AS program. That certainly surprised me! But, the reasoning is now clear to me. (1) his risk of mortality will not be increased if he is monitored closely. Studies have proved that. (2) This doctor is very aware of the ongoing research...maybe there will be a noninvasive cure in a few years. (3) the patient was simply not mentally ready to have surgery. So, the rules can be flexed, probably without risk. The lesson here is not to feel rushed, and the time that you can safely delay radical treatment both increases your \"normal\" years, and allows for new treatments to be developed. Good luck to you.",

      "Content": "Had a nice Christmas present today. The results of a 3T mp-MRI that was done at Johns Hopkins last week. I was in the tube for an hour as they did a 3D reconstruction study. The previous three MRI's had shown three lesions. The index one was first scored as a PIRADS 4 and the others as PIRADS 3. Then, later MRI's downgraded the 4 to a 3. This new result downgraded the original 4 to a 2 , and did not see the other two lesions. So, over the past ten years, my prostate cancer appears to have shrunk and regressed. This is not what I expected when I started out on this journey, but I'll gladly take it. Have to discuss having future biopsies with Dr. Carter. He insists on his protocol scheduled biopsies, and believes I need (a sixth) one for that reason. But I'm not sure that I see any benefit in having anymore, at least until other testing demonstrates a concern.",

I have seen some imaging centers boasting 98 percent accuracy in finding significant lesions, so having a prostate scan with 3T mp-MRi using PIRADS 2 software is about as definite as current technology can be. Also, from what I've read, most cases of prostatitis are not caused by bacteria, so antibiotics such as Levaquin and Cipro will not have any effect.

I would agree with you that AS is not likely to a good a course of action for you. At age 50, with a positive DRE, treatment would seem advisable. I'm not sure how serious a GPS of 37 is, but I can tell you that mine is 2. You may also seek out some additional forums. I participate in three, and find that one leans towards surgery, another towards radiation, and a third towards focal therapies like FLA and HIFU. When I was on another forum, I mentioned comments identical to yours regarding the side effects of surgery and radiation. I was strongly reprimanded by the moderator, who insisted that such data on radiation side effects was very old, and that radiation had far fewer and less serious SE's than surgery. So, you need to also hear those experiences and viewpoints as you make your decisions. There are also new clinical trials using Prostvac and other non-invasive vaccine treatments. The future may belong to vaccine and genomic therapies, which offer the hope of no side effects. You can do some research on those. Much to learn, but you are certainly asking good questions.",

The changes have eliminated the use of percentage of a core's involvement, and increased the value of unilateral/bilateral involvement. I was verbally told that the number of cores involved was also being de-emphasized, but that was not changed in this notice. \"In a study published in 2014 the original criteria have been modified with the presence of a unilateral cancer (cancer on only one side of the prostate either right or left) replacing the percentage of the tissue core involved with cancer. The current criteria that are referred to as very low risk include a PSA density below 0.15, Gleason score 6 on prostate biopsy, no more than 2 cores of tissue with cancer that is located on one side of the prostate on biopsy. Men who meet these criteria are considered at very low risk of harboring aggressive prostate cancer and could be considered the most ideal candidates -but not the only candidates -for active surveillance.\"",

The recommendations from your doctors reflect the recent guidelines published by the American Urological Association and the three other organizations that represent the American medical establishment regarding prostate cancer. They endorse active surveillance as the default treatment for your pathology. The MRI, and confirmatory fusion biopsy are essential requirements for determining that you are correctly placed in AS. There are several optional genomics tests that could be run on your biopsy slides. Among those are OncotypeDX, Prolaris, SelectMDX, and Decipher. They can cost up to several thousand dollars, but my knowledge is out of date, and you may need to contact the various companies and practices to shop prices. There are also studies comparing them that may be found online. Stay calm and focused. You need to be informed, and follow your testing protocol, even with low risk prostate cancer. Good luck.",

So, that means that the machine was approved as a type of surgical knife, but did not address its effectiveness for cancer. Now, of course, because the process is \"approved\" for removing all prostatic tissue, that includes cancer.

However, the latest advice from the American Cancer Society suggests that the evidence is not strong. I have read that antibiotics only work on a small percentage of prostatitus cases. Most cases of prostate inflammation are non-bacterial, and come and go away on their own. If his basic issue is a greatly swollen prostate, there are two non-radical interventions to shrink/alleviate that condition. These are implantation of the Uro-lift device, and also Prostate Artery Embolization (PAE). Just some suggestions.",

Surgery is one, radiation is another, various focal interventions are gaining in use, and Active Surveillance (in a formal program) is certainly reasonable with your known pathology at this time. There are studies showing that about 66 percent of those enrolled in Johns Hopkins AS program since 1994 have never had treatment. So, the G3+3 cancers may never become more dangerous. However, at age 55, you are younger than most of those men, and need to be aware that their outcomes may or may not apply to you. Certainly, if you are going to not seek treatment at this time, then you need to be under a structured AS program with all the testing and protocols that it requires.

      "Content": "He may do want to attend some local prostate cancer support groups. These usually meet once every month under the patronage of a hospital or a national support group. Men are there to share their experiences, and many of them would not do their method of treatment again, if they could turn back time. Much to learn if you find a good group. About a year ago, I attended such a meeting where three MD's did a presentation. A urologist, who did surgery several times every week, a radiation oncologist, and a medical oncologist, who specialized in chemotherapy. The urologist was interesting, in that he said that he did not want to operate on any more Gleason 3+3 cases, as that was overtreatment. The chemo guy was a lab type who knew his stuff, but wasn't good at translating his points in patient terms. The radiation guy had the greatest impact, as he presented comparative results for surgery, EBRT, IMRT, and seeds at their hospitals. The results were strongly favorable to seeds + IMRT. They had stats for several hundreds of patients and the \"cure\" rates and side effects for that combination of radiation methods had VERY impressive results. The two other specialists agreed, and were happy to share the good results as a team. You will hear that there WERE issues with radiation causing secondary cancers, but that data was from 30 years ago, and should not be applicable to today's technology. Also, there are several treatments like SBRT, HIFU, and FLA available if there is a recurrence after primary radiation treatment. If he is going to prefer radiation, then I would suggest that he research SBRT/Cyberknife, which is a type of radiation treatment that is having great recent results. So much to learn, so much at stake ... he is doing the right thing by taking some time to carefully and thoughtfully examine what choices he has. Keep asking, and the members here will try to answer and assist as best we can.",

      "Content": "Bernard, As the others have noted, you have time to research, ask, consult, and finally be content with whatever course you choose. I recently had an online exchange with a man who was 51, and had, as I recall, three positive cores each with a higher percentage of G3+3 cancer. He went to see the top doctor at a leading prostate cancer center. This doctor had founded what is probably the strictest and best known active surveillance program in the nation. After a discussion with the patient and his wife, this well known specialist signed him up for the AS program. That certainly surprised me! But, the reasoning is now clear to me. (1) his risk of mortality will not be increased if he is monitored closely. Studies have proved that. (2) This doctor is very aware of the ongoing research...maybe there will be a noninvasive cure in a few years. (3) the patient was simply not mentally ready to have surgery. So, the rules can be flexed, probably without risk. The lesson here is not to feel rushed, and the time that you can safely delay radical treatment both increases your \"normal\" years, and allows for new treatments to be developed.

      "Content": "Originally Posted by DjinTonic ASA, it's hard to imagine a better MRI and I understand your reluctance to biopsy again. Having had no complications from my biopsies, I never balked when a uro wanted yet another because of a jump in my PSA (the question always being was the rise due solely to my BPH?). But you are justifiably wary with your different biopsy track record. If a 6th biopsy found one 3+4 core with a small percentage of 4, would you treat? 4+3 ? Your genomics test was pretty good, but does leave the door open. I know you'll weigh everything carefully, including your doc's opinion, and make an informed decision. As was discussed, if you go ahead, I would ask about needle washing between cores, as well as colon prep and antibiotic choice (I wonder if the choice is also influenced by geographic location as well as an institute's experience and patient's history). I know little about transperineal biopsy other than I read it has a near zero sepsis rate. My uro mentioned it when we chatted about post-biopsy infection and it seems to be becoming more popular. Best Wishes to you and all Forum Brothers for a Happy and Healthy New Year! Djin Hi Djin, A few years ago, I set a threshold for treatment at \"two cores with more than ten percent of Gleason 4\". That is certain. One core with ten percent or less? Probably not, especially as I'm looking at age 75 around the corner. While I am very active and agile, the mortality tables and seeing what's happening with people not much older than I would persuade me to take the risk of continuing monitoring. Before the MRI report was posted on MyChart, I went through the normal \"what if?\" anxieties and watched some videos on SBRT, which would be my favored choice of a treatment. Two take-aways were (1) that it was not totally side effect free, and (2) that the specialists setting up the machine better be in top form all the time, as they are wielding a lot of radiation with very close margins. So, I would not jump to treatment without a significant risk of not treating. Another patient of Dr. Carter told me that he recently had a biopsy using a Precision Point transperineal device operated by another doctor at Hopkins. I will ask about that, as well as your research on the needle cleaning. But, enough of that thought process. Today is a day for family, and all of mine will be together at my son's house. My best wishes to you, and the others who have commented. Have a loving Christmas, and a healthy and happy new year.",

After that initial positive biopsy, additional MRI's, biopsies, genomics tests, specific blood and urine tests, etc., will further filter those men to see who are correctly placed on AS. The probability is that any upgrade is not due to your G6 itself morphing, but the discovery of previously undetected G7 or higher cells. Each new test drives down those odds.

      "Content": "Welcome, Mainer, You have asked the most-debated question about prostate cancer - which treatment is better - especially between surgery and radiation? I see this question fought over, again and again, everyday, between advocates of surgery and those of radiation. The primary reason for this conflict is that there about a dozen types of treatments that can cure your husband's low-intermediate risk PCa. These treatments include 3 types of surgery (ORP, LRP, RALP), at least 5 types of radiation (IMRT. SBRT, LDR-BT, HDR-BT, and PBT), plus several other methods (Cyro, HIFU, FLA, VDT, etc.) ALL have records for curing prostate cancer. The differences are in recurrence-free and side effects severity statistics. Regrettably, one study of results may be different than another. This leads to confusion and \"taking sides\" This is a well-moderated forum with mature commentators. Some others I know are openly partisan, one side or the other. You need to try to sample the various opinions and the facts that different sources offer. Your doctor recommended 40+ days of radiation. That is IMRT, which is the most profitable treatment for the providers. I would suggest that you also consider SBRT (Cyberknife) which only requires 5 treatment days, and also High Dose Brachytherapy, which requires two days. Do not make the mistake of asking a surgeon about RT, and as they are often not informed (and, vice versa). Also, a radiologist usually only is well educated on the type of treatment they offer. You need to consult with each specialist, if that treatment interests you. The huge SEER database shows that newly-diagnosed men are choosing AS, surgery, and radiation in equal numbers. While I am an advocate for AS, the G7 would make me agree with the others that treatment may be needed.

      "Content": "Welcome, Mainer, You have asked the most-debated question about prostate cancer - which treatment is better - especially between surgery and radiation? I see this question fought over, again and again, everyday, between advocates of surgery and those of radiation. The primary reason for this conflict is that there about a dozen types of treatments that can cure your husband's low-intermediate risk PCa. These treatments include 3 types of surgery (ORP, LRP, RALP), at least 5 types of radiation (IMRT. SBRT, LDR-BT, HDR-BT, and PBT), plus several other methods (Cyro, HIFU, FLA, VDT, etc.) ALL have records for curing prostate cancer. The differences are in recurrence-free and side effects severity statistics. Regrettably, one study of results may be different than another. This leads to confusion and \"taking sides\" This is a well-moderated forum with mature commentators. Some others I know are openly partisan, one side or the other. You need to try to sample the various opinions and the facts that different sources offer. Your doctor recommended 40+ days of radiation. That is IMRT, which is the most profitable treatment for the providers. I would suggest that you also consider SBRT (Cyberknife) which only requires 5 treatment days, and also High Dose Brachytherapy, which requires two days. Do not make the mistake of asking a surgeon about RT, and as they are often not informed (and, vice versa). Also, a radiologist usually only is well educated on the type of treatment they offer.

Chuck Chuck, All due respect, I truly believe that neither the same side effects, nor the same rate of incidence, is found with surgery and radiation. Radiation patients, for example, do not complain about penis shortening or retrograde ejaculations. I am out the country and only have my iPhone and spotty connectivity this week.

Djin From what I have read from FT patients, all lesions are treated, which includes bilateral cases. The patient is in the 3T MRI throughout the focal ablation process, which can last for several hours. The posts I have read were from men during the time that they were diagnosed through a year or more after treatment. They were happy with that choice. The practitioner whom I see mentioned/recommended most is a Dr. Joseph Busch in Chattanooga. Perhaps you can google him for more derailed info.",

The recommendations from your doctors reflect the recent guidelines published by the American Urological Association and the three other organizations that represent the American medical establishment regarding prostate cancer. They endorse active surveillance as the default treatment for your pathology. The MRI, and confirmatory fusion biopsy are essential requirements for determining that you are correctly placed in AS. There are several optional genomics tests that could be run on your biopsy slides. Among those are OncotypeDX, Prolaris, SelectMDX, and Decipher. They can cost up to several thousand dollars, but my knowledge is out of date, and you may need to contact the various companies and practices to shop prices. There are also studies comparing them that may be found online. Stay calm and focused. You need to be informed, and follow your testing protocol, even with low risk prostate cancer. Good luck.",

Your husband\u0092 s prostate cancer will require treatment, and either surgery or radiation can cure him if the cancer is still confined to the prostate. I would like to address the bladder mass, as I have large kidney cysts, which have been stable for many years, but look scary on imaging. I think they were caused by a rust dissolver chemical I was using to restore a car. Anyway, when they were first noticed on a ultrasound, the technician was alarmed, and brought the chief radiologist in to see the images. The radiologist quickly diagnosed them as cysts, I think she said that was because the fluid filled cysts appeared as black, where solid tumors would appear as white. At least that I what I can recall from 15 years ago. So, in my experience, a skilled doctor should be able to distinguish a cyst from a tumor,",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by mags1310 I am a little bit more confused now that we have left the doc. He did the \"cancer talk \" with us and answered many questions. He does about 25-35 of the Da Vinci Robotic surgeries per year so he seems quite experienced at it. A question for ASA - my husband also has a left upper pole cortical simple cyst measuring 3.6 x 3.6 x 2.8 in his kidney. Dr. did not mention to this but I had requested a copy of the cat scan and it is the number one diagnosis on it. Is that what you have also? Is that big? And to clarify the cyst/tumor in bladder what he has is prostatic utricle projecting into the urinary bladder 1.7 x 1.4cm. The Dr says that IF we decide on surgery this would be removed and sent to pathology along with the prostate. Can anyone give me any insight into a cortical cyst in kidney and a prostatic utricle projecting into urinary bladder? Anything we need to worry about? Thanks!! mags, what the nephrologists and urologists at Johns Hopkins told me is that they saw no need to surgically remove cysts, as they were unlikely to become cancerous. Now, kidney cysts CAN be very dangerous, even fatal, if they become so large that they crowd out the nephrons that provide the filtering function, and cause the kidney to fail. In my case, I had the interventional radiologists at a local hospital drain the largest cysts (17cm and 15 cm) in both kidneys to relieve that pressure. That was just before I consulted at JH. But, you have to understand that I had a one-time chemical exposure, not a hereditary cyst disease, so the one-time draining worked for me.",

OK - I will post those two links for those debating this decision. But, what struck me was the statement by the urologist that: \"Our group recently reported that over 60% of contemporary men who had a Gleason score of 8 on prostate biopsy were downgraded at the time of radical prostatectomy.\" That runs counter to what I usually read about upgrades often being an unwelcome result of post-RP pathology.

      "Content": "Originally Posted by Jim215 So often you hear that there is no need to act on the discovery of prostate cancer because \"...it's likely something else will kill you first\". But prostate cancer is the second leading cause of cancer deaths among men in the U.S. (estimated 29,480 deaths in 2014). That's a pretty impressive number. If you have the opportunity to catch it early and get rid of it, it just seems logical that you would want to do that. Because, as you get older, if nothing else DOES kill you first, then the prostate cancer absolutely will be your demise. If I had it to do over again, I would LEAP onto the operating table. With all respect for your blunt and honest opinions, Jim, yours is not the only opinion in this matter. I have been under advisement for over five years, and certain for 30 months that I have some PCa. Yet, with the advice of my uro-oncologists at Johns Hopkins, and my own readings, I am quite comfortable to NOT jump onto an operating table unless there is a change in the pathology of my case. Now, you see things your way, and I see things mine. I understand your ardor and wanting to make sure that a new poster is aware of the potential danger of this disease. Still, he may be \"wired\" more like me, and want to wait before seeking an intervention that may unnecessarily harm his quality of life without prolonging it.",

Think of the challenges that Bal faced in 1994 when proposing to defer treatment some men with proven cancer. For a young surgeon, that must have been heresy to his colleagues. Malpractice, credibility, not using your skills, and loss of income. He, and Laurence Klotz in Toronto were the pioneers of active surveillance for prostate cancer. They have had a respectful rivalry for years. Many thousands of men, including myself, are grateful for Dr. Carter's vision and advocacy.

By \"significant downgrades\" downgrading, I assume ASAdvocate means a significant percentage of men and not significant Gleason downgrades for each man in the downgrade group.

About a year ago, I attended such a meeting where three MD's did a presentation. A urologist, who did surgery several times every week, a radiation oncologist, and a medical oncologist, who specialized in chemotherapy. The urologist was interesting, in that he said that he did not want to operate on any more Gleason 3+3 cases, as that was overtreatment. The chemo guy was a lab type who knew his stuff, but wasn't good at translating his points in patient terms. The radiation guy had the greatest impact, as he presented comparative results for surgery, EBRT, IMRT, and seeds at their hospitals. The results were strongly favorable to seeds + IMRT. They had stats for several hundreds of patients and the \"cure\" rates and side effects for that combination of radiation methods had VERY impressive results. The two other specialists agreed, and were happy to share the good results as a team. You will hear that there WERE issues with radiation causing secondary cancers, but that data was from 30 years ago, and should not be applicable to today's technology.

      "Content": "Denis, Thank you for joining these forums and including many of us in your thought process. It has been very beneficial. Two months ago, you were reciting the usual talking points in favor of surgery, so I guessed that your mind was made up, but that your inquisitive impulse couldn't resist the mental flagellation of pondering more choices that you would not take seriously. I would have bet money on your doing surgery. Obviously, I would be a failure as a gambler. But, while I have been firmly in favor of SBRT, should I ever need treatment, you have caused me to also consider HDRBT, and I can see its advantages. Thanks. As a far as RALP being so popular, I would think that men just like the idea of high tech automatically being infallible, and promising a great result. What will be interesting is the narrowing of the risk classes for RP. It would seem that only G7 and 8 may be the best applications for RP, as AS is now the standard (by the NCCN, AUA, and ASCO) for very low and low risk men, and the triple play of HT, Brachy Boost, and IMRT or SBRT appear to be producing the best results for G9+. And, RP would be in competition with various forms of radiation even within the G7 and G8 risk classes. Anyway, your journey has been fascinating to follow. Best wishes for total success.",

I fully understand that the 2012 panel was trying to prevent unnecessary worry, biopsies, and men with indolent cases being rushed into surgery. There are now several alternatives/augmentations to psa tests, and more are coming down the pipeline. Some look to have VERY high confidence levels, but they aren't on the market today. When they are, and are accepted, hopefully within the next 5 to 10 years, we can put these concerns to rest. For now, psa testing, with all its flaws, is absolutely better than no testing at all.",

Djin, I re-read sections 3 and 4 of the article, and, while I would like to agree with you, it appears that what they have analyzed so far does not indicate that RP has the same improvements with systemic treatments included, that EBRT has demonstrated.",

At this point, all that needs to be done is to determine if you possibly have any actual prostate cancer. The MRI is an excellent idea, as it will allow the doctor doing the biopsy to precisely target any suspicious areas of your prostate. And, if you DO have some PCa, only a minority of cases are high-risk. Prostate cancer has a spectrum of risk classifications, and perhaps half or more of the cases will never be life threatening. The number of men newly diagnosed with PCa every year is eight times the number of men who die from that disease. Those statistics should help relax you. Follow your doctor's advice and try to enjoy life without letting your fear get ahead of what is known. Good Luck.",

I'm always reading about men trying to make decisions based on just one 12 core TRUS biopsy. It seems to me that they need more tests, an MRI and a confirmatory fusion biopsy, and genomics testing, before they can have a decent guess as to whether AS is a good option for them.",

      "Content": "Caddy, As your doctor advised, you don't need to be in any rush to make a decision. Every treatment technique that I can think of has undergone almost day-and-night changes over the past 20 years. So, advice on outcomes and side effects has to be as current as possible, as the old stories and statistics aren't applicable to those treated today. On the surgery side, robotics are now close to 90 percent of the operations. The small incisions, faster recovery times, and precision accuracy would seem to be tremendous improvements over open RP. But, all the scholarly studies I've seen keep saying that the patient outcomes have not changed, and that the skill of the surgeon is more important than the method. On the radiation side, there have recently been reported improvements in both the outcomes and side effects. This is happening as the technologies evolve to fewer sessions and more precise focusing and tracking. SBRT/Cyberknife and HDR monotherapy are the methods receiving the most notice for fewer cancer recurrences and also fewer and lower toxicity side effects. There are advocates for Proton beam, HIFU, FLA, and Cryotherapy. Their supporters can be adamant, but don't have the statistics (yet), in my opinion. You will likely receive some great advice on this thread. Please read them all carefully.",

Some men prefer what they assume is the finality of surgery. Regrettably, quite a few of them seem to be back online the next year asking about salvage RT. Some men advocate for focal therapies that target and destroy imaged lesions. But, minimal side effects matter little if the cancer keeps coming back. My readings bias me towards SBRT or HDRT-BT, two types of specifically targeted high-dosage radiation. They are actually designed to provide about the same toxicity to the cancer cells, but one therapy is external, and the other internal, to the body. One treatment I would advise that you look at would be proton beam therapy. I know, up to now its been expensive, required 44 sessions, and not shown superior results. But, some recent exchanges I have had with PBT advocates state that they are reducing the number of sessions to five, just like SBRT, and these advocates (I've now counted about a dozen of them online) are all claiming ZERO side effects, with no recurrences. That's worth checking out. As above, you have the time to get this right.",

Now, here we have a guy who does RP's for a living making a defense for no psa testing. Well, he did it to show us that there was a strong case to be made against over treatment, which was a driving force 10 years ago. Now, as he discussed with us, things have changed. He counsels his G6 patients to go into AS, for example. While there is still a concern that urologists in small practices will still push patients into unnecessary treatment, that trend is sharply decreasing. It was an interesting and lively discussion. I'm glad that I was diagnosed, and am aware of my status. I see the overtreatment issue as one of doctors' advice (motivated by greed or firm belief), not of diagnostics.

      "Content": "Bernard, As the others have noted, you have time to research, ask, consult, and finally be content with whatever course you choose. I recently had an online exchange with a man who was 51, and had, as I recall, three positive cores each with a higher percentage of G3+3 cancer. He went to see the top doctor at a leading prostate cancer center. This doctor had founded what is probably the strictest and best known active surveillance program in the nation. After a discussion with the patient and his wife, this well known specialist signed him up for the AS program. That certainly surprised me! But, the reasoning is now clear to me. (1) his risk of mortality will not be increased if he is monitored closely. Studies have proved that. (2) This doctor is very aware of the ongoing research...maybe there will be a noninvasive cure in a few years. (3) the patient was simply not mentally ready to have surgery. So, the rules can be flexed, probably without risk. The lesson here is not to feel rushed, and the time that you can safely delay radical treatment both increases your \"normal\" years, and allows for new treatments to be developed. Good luck to you.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by DjinTonic ASA, it's hard to imagine a better MRI and I understand your reluctance to biopsy again. Having had no complications from my biopsies, I never balked when a uro wanted yet another because of a jump in my PSA (the question always being was the rise due solely to my BPH?). But you are justifiably wary with your different biopsy track record. If a 6th biopsy found one 3+4 core with a small percentage of 4, would you treat? 4+3 ? Your genomics test was pretty good, but does leave the door open. I know you'll weigh everything carefully, including your doc's opinion, and make an informed decision. As was discussed, if you go ahead, I would ask about needle washing between cores, as well as colon prep and antibiotic choice (I wonder if the choice is also influenced by geographic location as well as an institute's experience and patient's history). I know little about transperineal biopsy other than I read it has a near zero sepsis rate. My uro mentioned it when we chatted about post-biopsy infection and it seems to be becoming more popular. Best Wishes to you and all Forum Brothers for a Happy and Healthy New Year! Djin Hi Djin, A few years ago, I set a threshold for treatment at \"two cores with more than ten percent of Gleason 4\". That is certain. One core with ten percent or less? Probably not, especially as I'm looking at age 75 around the corner. While I am very active and agile, the mortality tables and seeing what's happening with people not much older than I would persuade me to take the risk of continuing monitoring. Before the MRI report was posted on MyChart, I went through the normal \"what if?\" anxieties and watched some videos on SBRT, which would be my favored choice of a treatment. Two take-aways were (1) that it was not totally side effect free, and (2) that the specialists setting up the machine better be in top form all the time, as they are wielding a lot of radiation with very close margins. So, I would not jump to treatment without a significant risk of not treating. Another patient of Dr. Carter told me that he recently had a biopsy using a Precision Point transperineal device operated by another doctor at Hopkins. I will ask about that, as well as your research on the needle cleaning. But, enough of that thought process. Today is a day for family, and all of mine will be together at my son's house. My best wishes to you, and the others who have commented. Have a loving Christmas, and a healthy and happy new year.",

      "Content": "Fairwind has summed it up well. The 30 percent upgrade number is likely from the selection of AS after just one TRUS biopsy. After that initial positive biopsy, additional MRI's, biopsies, genomics tests, specific blood and urine tests, etc., will further filter those men to see who are correctly placed on AS. The probability is that any upgrade is not due to your G6 itself morphing, but the discovery of previously undetected G7 or higher cells. Each new test drives down those odds. At my age and testing history, I MAY (pray) be able to avoid more biopsies IF all other tests stay relative stable.",

Prostate cancer is slowing growing, and, only one person out of 100 who is diagnosed with it today, will die from it within 10 years, according to the American Cancer Society statistics. So, if he takes a few months to research, consult, and ask, it is unlikely to affect his longevity. There are several forms of treatments, available, with surgery and different forms of radiation being the most chosen. There are also focal therapies like HIFU and FLA which are growing in use. Clinical trials of different immunotherapy drugs are available, at least in the US, and may also be found in India. Please make sure that he is fully aware of the side effects of the different types of treatments, and seeks a second opinion. Attending a local prostate cancer support group and seeking advice from other men who have had treatment, can also be very helpful. In any event, it does appear that his cancer is certainly curable.

      "Content": "In addition to Chuck's always good advice, it should be noted that he should be in no rush to decide on a form of treatment. Prostate cancer is slowing growing, and, only one person out of 100 who is diagnosed with it today, will die from it within 10 years, according to the American Cancer Society statistics. So, if he takes a few months to research, consult, and ask, it is unlikely to affect his longevity. There are several forms of treatments, available, with surgery and different forms of radiation being the most chosen. There are also focal therapies like HIFU and FLA which are growing in use. Clinical trials of different immunotherapy drugs are available, at least in the US, and may also be found in India. Please make sure that he is fully aware of the side effects of the different types of treatments, and seeks a second opinion. Attending a local prostate cancer support group and seeking advice from other men who have had treatment, can also be very helpful. In any event, it does appear that his cancer is certainly curable. Good luck to him.",

I'm not an expert but my experience with my biopsy was that it was much easier than I expected and it would not have kept me from driving 9 hours three days post. That said why not reschedule to reduce any concern. The only way to diagnose PCa is a biopsy. I think either the Dr. misspoke or was misinterpreted. There are other causes for an increase in PSA besides PCa so don't get ahead of yourselves. And even if the biopsy is positive for most men the challenge is deciding how best to weigh through all of the options. All the statistics are still in your favor. Terry is right on about the doctor either being misspoken or misinterpreted. That's a pretty bold statement for him to make, and outside of his guidelines. I have had a couple of very painful biopsies with long lasting effects, and I could not imagine driving for that time. Terry's other suggestion about rescheduling sounds prudent.",

That writer stated that the two manufacturers had been trying to get approval for eleven years, but could not satisfy the volume of patient data that the FDA wanted to see. So, a few months ago, one of the companies submitted a different application asking that their machine be certified for removing prostate tissue. It was. So, that means that the machine was approved as a type of surgical knife, but did not address its effectiveness for cancer. Now, of course, because the process is \"approved\" for removing all prostatic tissue, that includes cancer. So, yes, there is more legitimacy in using the device and process, but the patient has no more assurance of long term outcome than before.",

I was on \"unofficial\" active surveillance for 20 months, and have been part of an \"official\" program for the past 29 months. The unofficial monitoring was a psa every six months, and a DRE and free psa every year. A prostate MRI would be called for if there were significant changes. The official AS is a study group that I joined at Johns Hopkins Medical School, which has very specific protocols. These include psa/fpsa every six months, and an annual DRE and biopsy. Also, MRI's as necessary. Yes, an annual biopsy regardless of any other test. As I am now over 70, and had a negative last biopsy, they may just do the MRI next year and skip the biopsy, unless there are changes.

      "Content": "He may do want to attend some local prostate cancer support groups. These usually meet once every month under the patronage of a hospital or a national support group. Men are there to share their experiences, and many of them would not do their method of treatment again, if they could turn back time. Much to learn if you find a good group. About a year ago, I attended such a meeting where three MD's did a presentation. A urologist, who did surgery several times every week, a radiation oncologist, and a medical oncologist, who specialized in chemotherapy. The urologist was interesting, in that he said that he did not want to operate on any more Gleason 3+3 cases, as that was overtreatment. The chemo guy was a lab type who knew his stuff, but wasn't good at translating his points in patient terms. The radiation guy had the greatest impact, as he presented comparative results for surgery, EBRT, IMRT, and seeds at their hospitals. The results were strongly favorable to seeds + IMRT. They had stats for several hundreds of patients and the \"cure\" rates and side effects for that combination of radiation methods had VERY impressive results. The two other specialists agreed, and were happy to share the good results as a team. You will hear that there WERE issues with radiation causing secondary cancers, but that data was from 30 years ago, and should not be applicable to today's technology. Also, there are several treatments like SBRT, HIFU, and FLA available if there is a recurrence after primary radiation treatment. If he is going to prefer radiation, then I would suggest that he research SBRT/Cyberknife, which is a type of radiation treatment that is having great recent results. So much to learn, so much at stake ... he is doing the right thing by taking some time to carefully and thoughtfully examine what choices he has. Keep asking, and the members here will try to answer and assist as best we can.",

      "Content": "Denis, Thank you for joining these forums and including many of us in your thought process. It has been very beneficial. Two months ago, you were reciting the usual talking points in favor of surgery, so I guessed that your mind was made up, but that your inquisitive impulse couldn't resist the mental flagellation of pondering more choices that you would not take seriously. I would have bet money on your doing surgery. Obviously, I would be a failure as a gambler. But, while I have been firmly in favor of SBRT, should I ever need treatment, you have caused me to also consider HDRBT, and I can see its advantages. Thanks. As a far as RALP being so popular, I would think that men just like the idea of high tech automatically being infallible, and promising a great result. What will be interesting is the narrowing of the risk classes for RP. It would seem that only G7 and 8 may be the best applications for RP, as AS is now the standard (by the NCCN, AUA, and ASCO) for very low and low risk men, and the triple play of HT, Brachy Boost, and IMRT or SBRT appear to be producing the best results for G9+. And, RP would be in competition with various forms of radiation even within the G7 and G8 risk classes. Anyway, your journey has been fascinating to follow. Best wishes for total success.",

But, bilateral involvement is now considered a higher risk than those two factors.

Surgery is one, radiation is another, various focal interventions are gaining in use, and Active Surveillance (in a formal program) is certainly reasonable with your known pathology at this time. There are studies showing that about 66 percent of those enrolled in Johns Hopkins AS program since 1994 have never had treatment. So, the G3+3 cancers may never become more dangerous. However, at age 55, you are younger than most of those men, and need to be aware that their outcomes may or may not apply to you. Certainly, if you are going to not seek treatment at this time, then you need to be under a structured AS program with all the testing and protocols that it requires.

Think of the challenges that Bal faced in 1994 when proposing to defer treatment some men with proven cancer. For a young surgeon, that must have been heresy to his colleagues. Malpractice, credibility, not using your skills, and loss of income. He, and Laurence Klotz in Toronto were the pioneers of active surveillance for prostate cancer.

      "Content": "Bernard, As the others have noted, you have time to research, ask, consult, and finally be content with whatever course you choose. I recently had an online exchange with a man who was 51, and had, as I recall, three positive cores each with a higher percentage of G3+3 cancer. He went to see the top doctor at a leading prostate cancer center. This doctor had founded what is probably the strictest and best known active surveillance program in the nation. After a discussion with the patient and his wife, this well known specialist signed him up for the AS program. That certainly surprised me! But, the reasoning is now clear to me. (1) his risk of mortality will not be increased if he is monitored closely. Studies have proved that. (2) This doctor is very aware of the ongoing research...maybe there will be a noninvasive cure in a few years. (3) the patient was simply not mentally ready to have surgery. So, the rules can be flexed, probably without risk. The lesson here is not to feel rushed, and the time that you can safely delay radical treatment both increases your \"normal\" years, and allows for new treatments to be developed. Good luck to you.",

Its one thing to want the cancer out and/or hit it as hard as possible. Its another thing to consider the long term quality of life issues.

This new result downgraded the original 4 to a 2 , and did not see the other two lesions. So, over the past ten years, my prostate cancer appears to have shrunk and regressed. This is not what I expected when I started out on this journey, but I'll gladly take it. Have to discuss having future biopsies with Dr. Carter.

      "Content": "Originally Posted by mags1310 I am a little bit more confused now that we have left the doc. He did the \"cancer talk \" with us and answered many questions. He does about 25-35 of the Da Vinci Robotic surgeries per year so he seems quite experienced at it. A question for ASA - my husband also has a left upper pole cortical simple cyst measuring 3.6 x 3.6 x 2.8 in his kidney. Dr. did not mention to this but I had requested a copy of the cat scan and it is the number one diagnosis on it. Is that what you have also? Is that big? And to clarify the cyst/tumor in bladder what he has is prostatic utricle projecting into the urinary bladder 1.7 x 1.4cm. The Dr says that IF we decide on surgery this would be removed and sent to pathology along with the prostate. Can anyone give me any insight into a cortical cyst in kidney and a prostatic utricle projecting into urinary bladder? Anything we need to worry about? Thanks!! mags, what the nephrologists and urologists at Johns Hopkins told me is that they saw no need to surgically remove cysts, as they were unlikely to become cancerous. Now, kidney cysts CAN be very dangerous, even fatal, if they become so large that they crowd out the nephrons that provide the filtering function, and cause the kidney to fail. In my case, I had the interventional radiologists at a local hospital drain the largest cysts (17cm and 15 cm) in both kidneys to relieve that pressure. That was just before I consulted at JH. But, you have to understand that I had a one-time chemical exposure, not a hereditary cyst disease, so the one-time draining worked for me.",

Do not take biopsies lightly. If you have a small amount of low-risk cancer, I would caution you not to give in to a \"get it out\" reaction. You need to carefully read about the side effects of treatments, which often have seriously negative impacts on one's quality of life. Your doctor sounds like he is giving you great advice.

PHI (which includes PSA and Free PSA plus a PCa biomarker), 4K Score, PCA3, and SelectMDX are all done BEFORE a biopsy to help determine if one may be necessary. OncotypeDX, Prolaris, ConfirmMDX, and Decipher are all run AFTER a biopsy to determine the genomic aggressiveness of the cancer samples found. That is done to help determine what, if any, treatment may be recommended. Hope this helps.",

Some people will tell you that biopsies are no big deal, that was the case with three of mine. But, two caused pain that lasted for months, and temporarily tripled my psa. Do not take biopsies lightly. If you have a small amount of low-risk cancer, I would caution you not to give in to a \"get it out\" reaction. You need to carefully read about the side effects of treatments, which often have seriously negative impacts on one's quality of life. Your doctor sounds like he is giving you great advice.

This suggested that family history does not increase the risk of prostate cancer aggressiveness.\" https://prostatecancernewstoday.com/...ggressiveness/",

      "Content": "Chris, Calm down. You've gotten way ahead of the known facts in your situation. As Chuck has pointed out, your data is far below what would be expected for advanced prostate cancer. At this point, all that needs to be done is to determine if you possibly have any actual prostate cancer. The MRI is an excellent idea, as it will allow the doctor doing the biopsy to precisely target any suspicious areas of your prostate. And, if you DO have some PCa, only a minority of cases are high-risk. Prostate cancer has a spectrum of risk classifications, and perhaps half or more of the cases will never be life threatening. The number of men newly diagnosed with PCa every year is eight times the number of men who die from that disease. Those statistics should help relax you. Follow your doctor's advice and try to enjoy life without letting your fear get ahead of what is known. Good Luck.",

I had a X-ray on my back was giving me more pain than usual and was told I had it in my spine and pelvis, went for my blood check up a few days ago told them and they said it was in most of my bones from the early scan when diagnosed 20 months ago, at the time I was only told it was in my shoulder which I had RT on and my upper rib. To say I was taken back was an understatement, I go for an MRI tonight on my back see if there's any damage. My PSA is still very low at 0.07 a slight rise from 0.04 with all my organs still in good shape although liver very slightly higher but still within normal range. Thanks for looking if you have any info would be grateful Joe Possibly Nanoknife (irreversible electroporation) would qualify, as it uses electric pulses to destroy tumors.

      "Content": "Caddy, As your doctor advised, you don't need to be in any rush to make a decision. Every treatment technique that I can think of has undergone almost day-and-night changes over the past 20 years. So, advice on outcomes and side effects has to be as current as possible, as the old stories and statistics aren't applicable to those treated today. On the surgery side, robotics are now close to 90 percent of the operations. The small incisions, faster recovery times, and precision accuracy would seem to be tremendous improvements over open RP. But, all the scholarly studies I've seen keep saying that the patient outcomes have not changed, and that the skill of the surgeon is more important than the method. On the radiation side, there have recently been reported improvements in both the outcomes and side effects. This is happening as the technologies evolve to fewer sessions and more precise focusing and tracking. SBRT/Cyberknife and HDR monotherapy are the methods receiving the most notice for fewer cancer recurrences and also fewer and lower toxicity side effects. There are advocates for Proton beam, HIFU, FLA, and Cryotherapy. Their supporters can be adamant, but don't have the statistics (yet), in my opinion. You will likely receive some great advice on this thread. Please read them all carefully.",

One of the conclusions states that active surveillance is the preferred treatment for low-risk men, who were most of those involved in these studies. That removes most of the arguments in favor of FT. as these men probably never should have had FT. There is a new type of HIFU, which its advocates say is far superior.

      "Content": "Hi Ha, Welcome the forum. Hopefully, the biopsy will be clear (about 65 percent of new biopsies are), and you won't have to be here long. Your uro is doing standard practice protocol. Initial biopsies are usually done with US, although there is much discussion that a prior MRI would lead to more specific targeting of suspect areas. Please try not to think too far ahead. We all have been guilty of that. You only need to be concerned if cancer is found on the biopsy slides. But, keep in mind, that prostate cancers run the spectrum from indolent to aggressive. I was diagnosed eight years ago, and so far it appears to be indolent, and not needing treatment. A different diagnosis could lead to having to research and choose from a menu of treatments. But, again, that's getting ahead of what you know. When you receive the post-biopsy lab report (if any cancer is found), then try to paste as much of the report's findings as possible. That would allow us to provide you with informed opinions for your consideration. Good luck.",

Now, here we have a guy who does RP's for a living making a defense for no psa testing. Well, he did it to show us that there was a strong case to be made against over treatment, which was a driving force 10 years ago. Now, as he discussed with us, things have changed. He counsels his G6 patients to go into AS, for example. While there is still a concern that urologists in small practices will still push patients into unnecessary treatment, that trend is sharply decreasing. It was an interesting and lively discussion. I'm glad that I was diagnosed, and am aware of my status. I see the overtreatment issue as one of doctors' advice (motivated by greed or firm belief), not of diagnostics.

      "Content": "Hi Ha, Welcome the forum. Hopefully, the biopsy will be clear (about 65 percent of new biopsies are), and you won't have to be here long. Your uro is doing standard practice protocol. Initial biopsies are usually done with US, although there is much discussion that a prior MRI would lead to more specific targeting of suspect areas. Please try not to think too far ahead. We all have been guilty of that. You only need to be concerned if cancer is found on the biopsy slides. But, keep in mind, that prostate cancers run the spectrum from indolent to aggressive. I was diagnosed eight years ago, and so far it appears to be indolent, and not needing treatment. A different diagnosis could lead to having to research and choose from a menu of treatments. But, again, that's getting ahead of what you know. When you receive the post-biopsy lab report (if any cancer is found), then try to paste as much of the report's findings as possible. That would allow us to provide you with informed opinions for your consideration. Good luck.",

So, you COULD get PCa, but it might not be life-threatening. What testing have you had done, besides this genomic assay? What has been your psa history, and MRI results? Prostate size, any biopsies?

Any book dealing with sexual effects from prostate cancer treatment that was written ten years ago would, IMHO, not have much value today. That's because of all the emphasis on penile rehab that exists now, but not then. And, from what I have read, his expertise is in dealing with the after effects of RP. But, now there are impressive studies showing the efficacy and low side effects of certain RT therapies such as SBRT and Proton beam. So, even with better rehab practices, RP is not your only option.

      "Content": "Excellent points, Terry. Yes, the changes in radiation technology and possibilities are moving faster than the insurers can adjust. Medicare and insurance companies want lengthy periods of proven performance, and the radiations guys are seeing such positive results with small samples that they want to keep leapfrogging ahead. I recently have heard and read that IMRT can be done in as few as 10 or 12 sessions, and SBRT in 1. ONE! The major obstacle is the payment puzzle. Is this a reality to make happen now, or optimistic arrogance and gambling by the radiologists pushing it? That answer is surely above my pay grade, but you can bet that more studies will be posted soon, and the debate will be in full swing.",

It is also common for a biopsy to find no cancer in areas seen as probable cancer on an MRI.

I had an MRI that reported a PIRADS 4 lesion, but then when they upgraded the equipment to PIRADS 2.0, the next report concluded that same lesion was a 3. So, nothing is written in stone.

Some men prefer what they assume is the finality of surgery. Regrettably, quite a few of them seem to be back online the next year asking about salvage RT. Some men advocate for focal therapies that target and destroy imaged lesions. But, minimal side effects matter little if the cancer keeps coming back. My readings bias me towards SBRT or HDRT-BT, two types of specifically targeted high-dosage radiation. They are actually designed to provide about the same toxicity to the cancer cells, but one therapy is external, and the other internal, to the body. One treatment I would advise that you look at would be proton beam therapy. I know, up to now its been expensive, required 44 sessions, and not shown superior results. But, some recent exchanges I have had with PBT advocates state that they are reducing the number of sessions to five, just like SBRT, and these advocates (I've now counted about a dozen of them online) are all claiming ZERO side effects, with no recurrences. That's worth checking out. As above, you have the time to get this right.",

      "Content": "Glad, Many men would love to have that biopsy path report. PIRADS 4 is simply a higher liklihood of cancer, it does not mean that the lesion is cancer. There are at least six other benign causes that I could cite that can cause a PIRADS 4 score. I had an MRI that reported a PIRADS 4 lesion, but then when they upgraded the equipment to PIRADS 2.0, the next report concluded that same lesion was a 3. So, nothing is written in stone. Two questions: (1) what is the size of your prostate? The MRI should have that measurement; And, (2) has your psa been steadily rising, or, has it \"peaked and valleyed\" over the years.",

Don't panic. You are doing the right thing, with one of the best doctors. Maybe you should just chill. If you are really strung out about it, and that's just a factor of personalties, there is a new enhanced MRI feature called RSI (restricted spectrum imaging) that is being touted at UC-san Diego as being significantly more precise and predictive than 3T mpMRI.

      "Content": "Bradb, As in Chuck's case, many men do not have any incontinence issues after RP. Some do, and it's very hard to get solid statistics on how many. I've seen numbers from single digits to over 35 percent. Surgeons report glowing results, and some men appear not to want to be honest about their situations, at least in personal interviews. Men have two urinary sphincters, an external one (like females), and an internal one that is removed during prostatectomy. The internal one is also responsible for preventing urine flow during ejaculation. I attended a lecture by a prominent RALP surgeon who made a point of stating that the loss of the internal sphincter will weaken urine control. In contrast, men still have both sphincters following radiation. Still, studies show about 10 percent have some incontinence issues three years later. Now, incontinence after RT is not the same as after RP. With RP, men can have stress incontinence, where they leak when coughing, laughing, lifting, etc. This is not typical of RT, where men could have urgency incontinence. In those cases, irritation of the urinary tract causes frequent urination, which can be annoying. Radiation advocates will claim that \"incontinence is almost non-existent\" following RT. They are only partially correct, as that may mostly be true for avoiding full loss of control following primary RT, but there are still urinary issues for some men. As others have noted, you have a highly curable case. The SEER database of 400,000 PCa patients shows that newly diagnosed men are choosing surgery, radiation, and active surveillance is equal numbers. There are three types of surgery (ORP, LRP, RALP), at least five types of radiation (IMRT, SBRT, LDR-BT, HDR-BT, PBT), and many other types of treatments (HIFU, FLA, Cryo, VTP), ALL of which can cure your G7 prostate cancer. That last group of focal treatments will claim NO urinary side effects, but they don't have a long history of results in curing the cancer. So, take your time and investigate your options. One piece of advice would be not to take the opinions of a specialist in one area about other treatments, as they often don't know much about the other, and tend to promote their own.

      "Content": "Djin, Thanks for this. It helps to further flesh out the facts regarding radiation as a primary treatment, and what is possible if it fails? From what I thought I read, The various non-surgical salvage treatments have a composite 5 year non-BCR rate of 64 percent. That ranges from cryo at 54 percent to BT at 69. The study also notes that salvage RP after RT has a 5 year non-BCR range from 47 to 82 percent, which would give a composite score of about 64 percent, equal to the non-surgical treatments. So, if you have RT, and need salvage treatment of any type, your chances of being BCR-free 5 years later is roughly 64 percent. So, while this is, of course, spaceship to earth level analysis, what is the comparable 5 year non-BCR percentage following RP and then SRT? That question seems to come up frequently in various \"have to make a decision\" threads. I know that every case has many, many different variables (ADT, etc.), but some overall framework of comparison is useful.",

      "Content": "Bradb, As in Chuck's case, many men do not have any incontinence issues after RP. Some do, and it's very hard to get solid statistics on how many. I've seen numbers from single digits to over 35 percent. Surgeons report glowing results, and some men appear not to want to be honest about their situations, at least in personal interviews. Men have two urinary sphincters, an external one (like females), and an internal one that is removed during prostatectomy. The internal one is also responsible for preventing urine flow during ejaculation. I attended a lecture by a prominent RALP surgeon who made a point of stating that the loss of the internal sphincter will weaken urine control. In contrast, men still have both sphincters following radiation. Still, studies show about 10 percent have some incontinence issues three years later. Now, incontinence after RT is not the same as after RP. With RP, men can have stress incontinence, where they leak when coughing, laughing, lifting, etc. This is not typical of RT, where men could have urgency incontinence. In those cases, irritation of the urinary tract causes frequent urination, which can be annoying. Radiation advocates will claim that \"incontinence is almost non-existent\" following RT. They are only partially correct, as that may mostly be true for avoiding full loss of control following primary RT, but there are still urinary issues for some men. As others have noted, you have a highly curable case. The SEER database of 400,000 PCa patients shows that newly diagnosed men are choosing surgery, radiation, and active surveillance is equal numbers. There are three types of surgery (ORP, LRP, RALP), at least five types of radiation (IMRT, SBRT, LDR-BT, HDR-BT, PBT), and many other types of treatments (HIFU, FLA, Cryo, VTP), ALL of which can cure your G7 prostate cancer. That last group of focal treatments will claim NO urinary side effects, but they don't have a long history of results in curing the cancer. So, take your time and investigate your options. One piece of advice would be not to take the opinions of a specialist in one area about other treatments, as they often don't know much about the other, and tend to promote their own.

      "Content": "Bradb, As in Chuck's case, many men do not have any incontinence issues after RP. Some do, and it's very hard to get solid statistics on how many. I've seen numbers from single digits to over 35 percent. Surgeons report glowing results, and some men appear not to want to be honest about their situations, at least in personal interviews. Men have two urinary sphincters, an external one (like females), and an internal one that is removed during prostatectomy. The internal one is also responsible for preventing urine flow during ejaculation. I attended a lecture by a prominent RALP surgeon who made a point of stating that the loss of the internal sphincter will weaken urine control. In contrast, men still have both sphincters following radiation. Still, studies show about 10 percent have some incontinence issues three years later. Now, incontinence after RT is not the same as after RP. With RP, men can have stress incontinence, where they leak when coughing, laughing, lifting, etc. This is not typical of RT, where men could have urgency incontinence. In those cases, irritation of the urinary tract causes frequent urination, which can be annoying. Radiation advocates will claim that \"incontinence is almost non-existent\" following RT. They are only partially correct, as that may mostly be true for avoiding full loss of control following primary RT, but there are still urinary issues for some men. As others have noted, you have a highly curable case. The SEER database of 400,000 PCa patients shows that newly diagnosed men are choosing surgery, radiation, and active surveillance is equal numbers. There are three types of surgery (ORP, LRP, RALP), at least five types of radiation (IMRT, SBRT, LDR-BT, HDR-BT, PBT), and many other types of treatments (HIFU, FLA, Cryo, VTP), ALL of which can cure your G7 prostate cancer. That last group of focal treatments will claim NO urinary side effects, but they don't have a long history of results in curing the cancer. So, take your time and investigate your options. One piece of advice would be not to take the opinions of a specialist in one area about other treatments, as they often don't know much about the other, and tend to promote their own. Stayed tuned, and let us know what questions you are having. Good luck.",

      "Content": "Djin, Thank you very much for posting these new guidelines. There are two points that stood out for me, and may settle long-running debates about qualifications for low-risk men, and also the primacy of AS as the choice of treatment for those men: 1) \"Very Low Risk PSA <10 ng/ml AND Grade Group 1 AND clinical stage T1-T2a AND <34% of biopsy cores positive AND no core with >50% involved, AND PSA density <0.15 ng/ml/cc. \" This is a serious change, as it supercedes the old Epstein criteria of \"no more than two positive cores\". That finding goes back to the 1990's and was based on six core biopsies. Now, with this new criteria, a man can have FOUR positive cores out of 12, and still be \"very low risk\". 2) \"7. Clinicians should recommend active surveillance as the best available care option for very low risk localized prostate cancer patients. (Strong Recommendation; Evidence Level: Grade A)\" This places AS as the default treatment option for those men described in point 1). This guideline should (hope/pray) discourage what overtreatment pressure may still be applied by some doctors. All good. Great work, Djin.",

Newer options like Focal Laser Ablation, and the trials of immune therapy treatments, which promise fewer side effects, may be attractive to you. Also, try to have some additional tests run, like the PHI and/or 4K Score blood tests, the PCA3 urine test, and, especially, the OncotypeDX and/or Prolaris tests on your biopsy sldes.

I have read in many articles that the long term survival rates are the same for surgery and radiation, but that the side effects happen in different time phases. The side effects of surgery are immediate, and things usually improve with time. With radiation, the issues of incontinence and impotence may not be significant when you finish the therapy, but then the radiation seeps further, and those side effects may appear after a year or two. So, the two therapies sort of equal out. Many of the posters on this forum are glad that they did surgery, as the removed prostate can be fully assessed and that gives them peace of mind.

I have read in many articles that the long term survival rates are the same for surgery and radiation, but that the side effects happen in different time phases. The side effects of surgery are immediate, and things usually improve with time. With radiation, the issues of incontinence and impotence may not be significant when you finish the therapy, but then the radiation seeps further, and those side effects may appear after a year or two. So, the two therapies sort of equal out. Many of the posters on this forum are glad that they did surgery, as the removed prostate can be fully assessed and that gives them peace of mind. I also do some hiking, and relieving yourself behind a tree in the woods is not an issue with other hikers, especially if they are about your age. Good Luck with your consultations.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by DjinTonic Here is one news report, which also says: \"... For patients who don't fall into these risk categories, fluoroquinolones may still be a good option. They have been helping patients with bacterial infections for more than 30 years. ... In July, the agency sent a notice that these drugs may significantly decrease blood sugar and negatively impact mental health. In 2016, the FDA said that the drugs may have a disabling side effect on muscles, nerves, joints and the central nervous system and should be restricted for use in some simpler infections.\" I would point out that some studies have shown that the post-biopsy sepsis rate can be drastically reduced by washing the biopsy needle in a disinfectant between cores -- isopropyl alcohol being perhaps the safest and most efficacious. My uro uses this (plus antibiotics) and says he hasn't had a case of sepsis since he started. He also fears some of the other compounds some uros are using are perhaps too strong: the effect of their contact with tissue isn't know. One study I came across with a large number of men had a sepsis rate of 0 in the antibiotics + alcohol washing cohort. Thank you very much, Djin, I am facing a sixth biopsy simply because Dr. Carter runs the strictest AS program on the planet, and I am really concerned about sepsis since two of my past biopsies caused long term pain. Knowing this information about the alcohol cleansing, I may decide to challenge the plan for the next biopsy, or not have it, and risk moving to another program. We will see. This point will be raised and discussed.",

My case is something similar, but I was much older when diagnosed, so my options and choice may be not be the same as yours. You are not in a position where you need to act quickly, but you might start researching all the treatment options available, and their side effects. Newer options like Focal Laser Ablation, and the trials of immune therapy treatments, which promise fewer side effects, may be attractive to you. Also, try to have some additional tests run, like the PHI and/or 4K Score blood tests, the PCA3 urine test, and, especially, the OncotypeDX and/or Prolaris tests on your biopsy sldes. The purpose of those tests in to try to predict if your cancer is likely to be aggressive, or not. That type of information is what you need right now.",

I have known men who were rushed into surgery with Gleason 5... yes, that's right G (2+3) before the guidelines changed in 2005, and one of them wrote several books to try to keep incontinent and impotent men from giving up on life. We still have a way to go with developing better diagnostics. That is indisputable.

That has a high likelihood for containing Gleason 7 or higher disease. I would suggest that you have a genomics test done on your biopsy slides. There are assays like OncotypeDX, Decipher, Prolaris, and others. That would provide more certainty that your lesion is not more serious. In my case, an MRI interpreted to have a PIRADS 4 lesion caused a lot of concern for my medical team, and more intensive tests for me. But, when the PIRADS version 2 guidelines were published, that lesion was re-classified as a 3. So, having frequent and appropriate testing going forward is always in your best interest. Good luck.",

Three biopsies found a small amount of Gleason (3+3), and three found nothing. So, what this tells us is that the PIRADS assessments of low grade cancer is not that accurate. By definition, a lesion is anything seen somewhere in the body where it is not expected. A pimple is a lesion. Prostate lesions are often benign, and can caused by inflammation scarring, hemorrhage, cysts, etc. Wait until you know more before getting ahead of yourself. In addition to the Walsh book, I would recommend Mark Scholz' The Key to Prostate Cancer. He interviewed 30 prostate cancer experts, and presents their views on the appropriate treatment choices for each patient's pathology. A very balanced book and easy to get through.",

One point that I did understand is that the study had an age cutoff of 65. He made the point that men who have RT are typically ten years older than men who have RP. Therefore, they must have had other health issues which precluded surgery. That fact alone could account for the overall mortality finding.",

The VA's 72 percent of low risk men choosing AS is way ahead of any other organization in the USA, although still below the amazing 91 percent rate in Sweden. The problem remains the private practices, where the uro's still tend to herd men into unnecessary surgery. I say \"surgery\" simply because that is what the diagnosing physicians practice. I have known men who were rushed into surgery with Gleason 5... yes, that's right G (2+3) before the guidelines changed in 2005, and one of them wrote several books to try to keep incontinent and impotent men from giving up on life. We still have a way to go with developing better diagnostics. That is indisputable. But, IMHO, the problem with the diagnosing doctor saying \"you have cancer\", and then \"I can cure you\" within 5 seconds, has to be broken. There needs to be a separation of practitoners between those statements.",

How about a PHI blood test test? That's quick and simple. The PCA3 urine test, mentioned above, is also worthwhile. You need to keep on top of this with as much testing as is reasonable.

      "Content": "From the November AARP Bulletin: \"The facts: While PSA testing has been shown to reduce deaths from prostate cancer, no study has shown a decrease in overall mortality with PSA screening for men of any age, says Kenneth Lin, M.D., professor of family medicine at Georgetown University Medical Center in Washington, D.C. Any prostate cancer benefit was offset by deaths and complications from biopsies, surgery, radiation and chemotherapy. And screened groups had much higher rates of complications, including impotence and incontinence. Indeed, diaper manufacturers are frequent sponsors of PSA screening drives, says Otis Brawley, M.D., chief medical and scientific officer at the American Cancer Society, who, at age 59, declines PSA screening for himself. The truth is, about half of men will have some cancer cells in their prostate by age 60, and 70 percent of them will develop prostate cancer by age 80. Yet only 3 percent of men actually die from it, Lin says.\" This article, reaching 35 million people, doesn't help the PSA screening debate, which has been ongoing for years. But, the statements from the ACS's top doctor surprised me. Diaper makers sponsor PSA screening drives?",

Of all men diagnosed with prostate cancer today, less than two percent of them will die of prostate cancer within ten years (American Cancer Society stats) Now, calm down. The odds are that your psa is being raised by benign causes like prostate inflammation, infection, sex, bike riding, etc. And, even if you have some PCa, many cases are indolent, and may never need any type of treatment. Get another blood test, preferably a PHI test, which also will include your free psa number. Your reaction is typical of almost all of us.

But you should slow down and use the next several months to ask, consult, research, and soul search as to what you want to do. All treatments have side effects, some of which can seriously impact your quality of life. So, you should know all the facts. Active surveillance could last until you die of something else, or it could lead to a future upgrade, and the need to treat then.

IF he receives a second opinion that rates all his slides at 3+3, that might open a possibility for AS, as JH has just de-emphasized the percentage of core criterion, and maybe be moving to increase or disregard the number of positive cores. BUT, that is offset if any cancer is found bilaterally, which raises the risk classification. Also, a PSA over 10, or age under 65 would largely rule out AS. He has a very slim hope of avoiding intervention. But, why discourage him from getting more advice? If he has unsettled questions in his mind, that may bother him the rest of his life. At least, after he gets the extra input, he will be certain that he did the right thing by having intervention.",

If the psa appears high, a follow up test should be PHI, which includes psa, free psa, a marker for prostate cancer, and an algorithm that predicts if prostate cancer would be found by biopsy. That blood test is more accurate than psa alone, and less influenced by infections.

      "Content": "Originally Posted by garrjim I am 64 this month. My PSA was always normal until 2015 when it registered 8 from a 4. I get an annual physical every year. I took antibiotic and it jumped to 12. Did the biopsy and found Gleason 6 and was put on active servalience. PSA then went back down to 8. Physical in 11/2017 showed PSA at 17. Did MRI and biopsy and then rated Gleason 7 3+4. Doctor is recommending treatment of surgery or radiation High Dose Rate Prostate Brachytherapy Treatment (which requires no hormones). I have also researched a new procedure by Dr. Sperling which treatment is done by laser. (which looks very promising). My local friends that I have talked with were Gleason 8 or higher and with PSA of 43 or better. Plus some had treatments over 10 years ago which are not very relevant to my situation. I am interested in hearing from others who have had more recent treatments. HDTBT is not a new technology, as it has been used for prostate cancer for over twenty years. What is more recent is it's use as a monotherapy, and not to boost other treatments. Forum member subdenis recently had HDRBT after six months of intense research. I would advise you to read his posting history.",

Also, be sure to check out the \"stickies\" at the top of this menu.

      "Content": "Originally Posted by wtdedula Hi Consult1; I actually had surgery at the Cleveland Clinic about 1-1/2 weeks ago (August 1, 2017) by Dr. Andrew Stephenson and am recovering at home now. I found that surgery was a breeze with very little to no pain but the catheter (which I thankfully only had for 8 days) was a major pain (literally) - it hurt so bad. Some men don't experience pain like I did, guess I was just unlucky. You will have to put up with sleeping on your back for only a week. Interestingly, I always sleep on my back so wasn't a problem for me but many men who need a catheter don't and they still manage to get through the week OK. Obviously, sleeping on your stomach isn't an option with a catheter. You can read about my complete day-to-day experiences before and after surgery here ... https://www.cancerforums.net/threads...Some-questions As I have learned, most of the people on this forum are pro-surgery. In my case, I wanted to just get rid of the cancer rather than just burn it out with radiation. Plus, Radiation has the potential to lead to secondary cancers. In addition, if you have surgery and your PSA comes back, then you can be treated with radiation to knock out the rest of the cancer. But if you're treated with radiation, and you have a reoccurrence, you generally can't go back and have surgery. So in other words, if your cancer comes back following treatment, you get a second shot at a cure with surgery but not so with radiation. So just my opinion, I think you shouldn't fear surgery and give it a consideration. I am not really familiar with the lab test results you got but I'm sure others will chime in here too with additional insight. A few studies and information seem to indicate that Gleason 6 is not capable of spreading, but some men with Gleason 6 are found to actually have a higher grade of cancer once the full prostate is examined by a pathologist (If you opt for surgery - which is another benefit to having surgery that isn't available with radiation). Fortunately for me, that didn't happen and I remained the same gleason grade that I was on biopsy but others on this forum have been upgraded following surgery when they received the results of their final pathology. It is said to happen in about 20% of cases. Tim There are a number of outdated statements in this post. The possibility of secondary cancers from radiation was true in the 1980's and maybe 1990's, but is insignificant today due to improved technology. Also, if there is a recurrence after primary radiation, that can now be successfully treated by SBRT radiation. So, many of the talking points about surgery having advantages over radiation are no longer true. As Tim admitted, this is a pro-surgery prostate cancer forum. There are others that favor radiation, and still others that favor an alphabet soup of lesser known treatments. You owe it to yourself to get as many opinions as you can. Good luck.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by wtdedula Hi Consult1; I actually had surgery at the Cleveland Clinic about 1-1/2 weeks ago (August 1, 2017) by Dr. Andrew Stephenson and am recovering at home now. I found that surgery was a breeze with very little to no pain but the catheter (which I thankfully only had for 8 days) was a major pain (literally) - it hurt so bad. Some men don't experience pain like I did, guess I was just unlucky. You will have to put up with sleeping on your back for only a week. Interestingly, I always sleep on my back so wasn't a problem for me but many men who need a catheter don't and they still manage to get through the week OK. Obviously, sleeping on your stomach isn't an option with a catheter. You can read about my complete day-to-day experiences before and after surgery here ... https://www.cancerforums.net/threads...Some-questions As I have learned, most of the people on this forum are pro-surgery. In my case, I wanted to just get rid of the cancer rather than just burn it out with radiation. Plus, Radiation has the potential to lead to secondary cancers. In addition, if you have surgery and your PSA comes back, then you can be treated with radiation to knock out the rest of the cancer. But if you're treated with radiation, and you have a reoccurrence, you generally can't go back and have surgery. So in other words, if your cancer comes back following treatment, you get a second shot at a cure with surgery but not so with radiation. So just my opinion, I think you shouldn't fear surgery and give it a consideration. I am not really familiar with the lab test results you got but I'm sure others will chime in here too with additional insight. A few studies and information seem to indicate that Gleason 6 is not capable of spreading, but some men with Gleason 6 are found to actually have a higher grade of cancer once the full prostate is examined by a pathologist (If you opt for surgery - which is another benefit to having surgery that isn't available with radiation). Fortunately for me, that didn't happen and I remained the same gleason grade that I was on biopsy but others on this forum have been upgraded following surgery when they received the results of their final pathology. It is said to happen in about 20% of cases. Tim There are a number of outdated statements in this post. The possibility of secondary cancers from radiation was true in the 1980's and maybe 1990's, but is insignificant today due to improved technology. Also, if there is a recurrence after primary radiation, that can now be successfully treated by SBRT radiation. So, many of the talking points about surgery having advantages over radiation are no longer true. As Tim admitted, this is a pro-surgery prostate cancer forum. There are others that favor radiation, and still others that favor an alphabet soup of lesser known treatments. You owe it to yourself to get as many opinions as you can. Good luck.",

These other situations of de-bulking before surgery or radiation are not applicable to \"non-aggressive\" cases, which IMHO, should not need treatments. That's it in a nutshell, my friend.

      "Content": "I don't see any fault in your wanting an mp-MRI and more testing (like PHI, 4K, Exo dx, etc.) to better determine your risk before having a biopsy. The MRI should give you the prostate size, and you can use that to calculate your prostate density. Prostate density is being increasing used as an indicator for further action, especially at Johns Hopkins, where I am in an observational study. The above forum brothers are all correct that ONLY a biopsy can diagnose prostate cancer. But, that doesn't mean that one should be scheduled without a good basis of suspicion for PCa. Two of my five biopsies caused pain for six months, and a tripling of my psa due to swelling and damage. Three out of 100 biopsies result in hospitalization for sepsis, and one of 1400 is fatal. So, it is not always a walk in the park. That said, if you have the MRI and other tests (that were developed to reduce the number of biopsies), and they are suspicious, you need to have one. At least, you will then know with more certainty that is your correct choice.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by DjinTonic ASA, does your problemed biopsy history affect your thinking about continuing on AS, or are you just resigned to accepting the risk of complications? I believe the some cases of sepsis that lead to death from prostate biopsies result from the symptoms being ignored for days before treatment is sought. The key is to identify the bacteria and start appropriate antibiotics as soon as possible, so each day counts. All docs should give out written post-biopsy instructions which include monitoring for fever, chills, etc. Well, at this point, with my age, years in the AS program, and stable PSA kinectics and PSADensity, I haven't been pushed into having more biopsies. So, that could change, but right now, I'm hoping to avoid future ones. My next scheduled appointment will be with Dr. Carter, and that may prove interesting, as I would resist a \"protocol\" biopsy. Don't want to think ahead...we'll see. All my biopsies were done at JH by professors of urology. They did culture swabs a month ahead to see what my gut biotics were like, and I had a very strict pre-and-post biopsy regimen of stuff to avoid and antibiotics to take. Just shows that things can go wrong even with expert precautions. You, with 10 fault-free biopsies, did extremely well, and lived to tell about it",

      "Content": "IMHO, the problems with overtreatment, which did drive the 2012 USPSTF guidelines, was never with the diagnosis, but with the subsequent advice by urologists to have radical treatment in almost all cases. The USPSTF overreacted by discouraging the diagnostics, and some men have suffered due to lack of testing. That has changed now, with active surveillance being the primary recommended \"treatment\" in both very low risk and low risk classifications. There is more balanced counseling, and less cases of rushing into treatment. I have not heard anyone recently promoting that psa tests not be given, and think that there is now broad agreement that psa screening is desirable.",

Did you say that he was diagnosed last week, has surgery scheduled for October 23rd? Has he consulted with other specialists, or only this one? I'm mentioning this because the biggest controversy about prostate cancer treatment is the need to fully explore the various types of treatments, and have consultations with multiple surgeons and radiation oncologists. If you take the time to peruse the several discussion forums for prostate cancer, you will find many comments from men regretting that they rushed into a treatment plan without taking the time to research other types of treatment. PCa is a slow growing cancer, and there is always time to stop and think and be certain that you have chosen the best course. Good luck to you both.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by wtdedula Hi Consult1; I actually had surgery at the Cleveland Clinic about 1-1/2 weeks ago (August 1, 2017) by Dr. Andrew Stephenson and am recovering at home now. I found that surgery was a breeze with very little to no pain but the catheter (which I thankfully only had for 8 days) was a major pain (literally) - it hurt so bad. Some men don't experience pain like I did, guess I was just unlucky. You will have to put up with sleeping on your back for only a week. Interestingly, I always sleep on my back so wasn't a problem for me but many men who need a catheter don't and they still manage to get through the week OK. Obviously, sleeping on your stomach isn't an option with a catheter. You can read about my complete day-to-day experiences before and after surgery here ... https://www.cancerforums.net/threads...Some-questions As I have learned, most of the people on this forum are pro-surgery. In my case, I wanted to just get rid of the cancer rather than just burn it out with radiation. Plus, Radiation has the potential to lead to secondary cancers. In addition, if you have surgery and your PSA comes back, then you can be treated with radiation to knock out the rest of the cancer. But if you're treated with radiation, and you have a reoccurrence, you generally can't go back and have surgery. So in other words, if your cancer comes back following treatment, you get a second shot at a cure with surgery but not so with radiation. So just my opinion, I think you shouldn't fear surgery and give it a consideration. I am not really familiar with the lab test results you got but I'm sure others will chime in here too with additional insight. A few studies and information seem to indicate that Gleason 6 is not capable of spreading, but some men with Gleason 6 are found to actually have a higher grade of cancer once the full prostate is examined by a pathologist (If you opt for surgery - which is another benefit to having surgery that isn't available with radiation). Fortunately for me, that didn't happen and I remained the same gleason grade that I was on biopsy but others on this forum have been upgraded following surgery when they received the results of their final pathology. It is said to happen in about 20% of cases. Tim There are a number of outdated statements in this post. The possibility of secondary cancers from radiation was true in the 1980's and maybe 1990's, but is insignificant today due to improved technology. Also, if there is a recurrence after primary radiation, that can now be successfully treated by SBRT radiation. So, many of the talking points about surgery having advantages over radiation are no longer true. As Tim admitted, this is a pro-surgery prostate cancer forum. There are others that favor radiation, and still others that favor an alphabet soup of lesser known treatments. You owe it to yourself to get as many opinions as you can. Good luck.",

MF Michael, I'm always puzzled when I read this question because my G3+3 lesions have always shown up on every ultrasound and MRI (1.5 and 3T, coil and apron, contrast and not) I have had. They register as PIRADS 3, and have been hit with many biopsy cores. Not sure if I am some type of exception, but, the outlines of my lesions are certainly picked up by the MRI's.",

      "Content": "IMHO, the problems with overtreatment, which did drive the 2012 USPSTF guidelines, was never with the diagnosis, but with the subsequent advice by urologists to have radical treatment in almost all cases. The USPSTF overreacted by discouraging the diagnostics, and some men have suffered due to lack of testing. That has changed now, with active surveillance being the primary recommended \"treatment\" in both very low risk and low risk classifications. There is more balanced counseling, and less cases of rushing into treatment. I have not heard anyone recently promoting that psa tests not be given, and think that there is now broad agreement that psa screening is desirable.",

The incontinence needs the attention of a specialist (there are some in that field of post-treatment Pca) you just have to find one. As far as diet, I am part of a PCa program at Johns Hopkins, long famous for their surgery and radiation skills.

Recent studies have shown that scaling psa by age in older men was not as accurate as hoped, and is not generally recommended. I am not aware of studies that attempted to correlate free psa and age. Yes, bph can raise psa and also lower free psa. I've experienced it myself. Also, I've seen posts from men with psa results up to 50 from bph, although that is extremely rare. A PHI test is more accurate that either psa or fpsa, but still can be influenced by bph. Having the MRI, (make sure that it is a 3-Tesla multi-parametric machine) is the logical next step. The MRI cannot diagnose cancer, but it can pinpoint suspicious areas for a subsequent fusion biopsy.",

If you take the time to peruse the several discussion forums for prostate cancer, you will find many comments from men regretting that they rushed into a treatment plan without taking the time to research other types of treatment.

And, while I have read complaints from men who were unhappy with prostate cancer treatments, others attest that they have regained satisfactory sexual function, so the results are individual. Also, keep in mind that having a psa test and confirmatory biopsy that you have prostate cancer, does not necessarily mean that you need treatment. I have an apparently indolent case, and have been watching it for eight years, with no change in quality of life. Perhaps 50 percent of newly diagnosed men are in this category. Research is fine, but IMHO, you also need to find doctor(s) that you can trust and confide in.

We don't know what the PSA did the first year after surgery (all of 2016), just that it was below 0.02. Djin, This was discussed a few years ago. Pratoman had that original pathology report, and then he sent the slides to JH. Dr. Epstein called him and discussed that he found only G (3+3). So, PM accepted that as definitive, at that time. Therefore, the post-op assessment of G(3+4) was an upstaging. Hope this helps.",

The USPSTF overreacted by discouraging the diagnostics, and some men have suffered due to lack of testing. That has changed now, with active surveillance being the primary recommended \"treatment\" in both very low risk and low risk classifications. There is more balanced counseling, and less cases of rushing into treatment. I have not heard anyone recently promoting that psa tests not be given, and think that there is now broad agreement that psa screening is desirable.",

The one question that I have is whether a brachytherapy boost was considered and discussed as part of your treatment plan? I ask this because I have read of cases where either a low-dose or high-dose brachy boost was used in higher grade RT treatments, either before ADT was included, or in addition to it. Was that treatment discussed with you by your medical team?",

Did you say that he was diagnosed last week, has surgery scheduled for October 23rd? Has he consulted with other specialists, or only this one? I'm mentioning this because the biggest controversy about prostate cancer treatment is the need to fully explore the various types of treatments, and have consultations with multiple surgeons and radiation oncologists. If you take the time to peruse the several discussion forums for prostate cancer, you will find many comments from men regretting that they rushed into a treatment plan without taking the time to research other types of treatment. PCa is a slow growing cancer, and there is always time to stop and think and be certain that you have chosen the best course. Good luck to you both.",

Gio, I am glad to see that you mentioned that there are salvage options should primary radiation fail. There seems to be a widespread misconception that you are out of luck if radiation fails, while surgery will afford you a \"second bite of the apple\". These opinions do not admit the fact that there are several post-radiation salvage treatments that are available. Cryotherapy, HIFU, FLA, SBRT, and HDRBT all have proven success in dealing with follow-up treatment. More men pondering their options need to be aware of this. Thanks.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by lexpar As a recent member of the forum, I wonder how many of us are, or were, in the same boat as I am. I want to make it absolutely clear I am not looking to pace blame anywhere. I had been asking my family Dr for two years about doing a PSA. He told me that conventional thinking about PSA's had changed; that they raised so many \"false positives\" that the thinking was now to wait until there were symptoms. (This was confirmed by a family friend, a urological surgeon with 50 yrs experience.)He did do a DRE and said everything felt as it should. My first PSA was run completely by accident. When doing pre-op lab work for shoulder surgery the lab ran a PSA without being directed to. That came back elevated; a second PSA blood test was taken which also came back elevated which led to the biopsy and diagnosis. My point is that had I waited till I was symptomatic, it may well have been too late to hope for a positive outcome. Should the collective\"we\" be pressing for some sort of diagnostic test that is more dependable that the PSA or DRE? God Bless all of the other various cancer groups pushing for $$$$, but I have been astounded by many men I know have come forward to me saying they have gone through various forms of prostate cancer. Two men I know lost their battle with the disease. And that's just in our little town. This is certainly a common condition, and one which will kill if treatment is left too late. If a PSA is not considered reliable enough, why isn't an alternative test or screening procedure being developed? If one is, how can we support it? There has been a great deal of research over the past 15 years to find a better diagnostic tool than the PSA test. There is a huge financial incentive for biomedical research companies, both large and small, to patent \"THE\" successor test to PSA. There are many contenders, from imaging to biomarker assays. Blood, urine, and mouth swabs are part of the wide array of tests that have been proposed and examined. Some have good clinical results, but then, other studies are not so sure. Better tests than psa already exist, like PHI and 4K Score. But, they are derivatives of psa. Believe me, a small army of researchers are working on finding \"the\" test that has high accuracy. It's coming...sometime.",

You have a full range of possibilities, from active surveillance to focal therapies, to types of radiation and surgery. Make sure that you are fully aware of the common side effects of surgery and radiation. Those side effects sometimes greatly impact one's quality of life, and may cause you to carefully re-think whether immediate treatment is the best course for you. There will be others along with great knowledge, experience, and opinions to share. Don't rush, or be rushed, into making a decision. Good luck to you.",

      "Content": "mitchden, Again, sorry to have you join us here. As the others have said, you have a minimal amount of less-risky cancer, so there is no rush to make any decision. My experience has been somewhat different, and I would offer a few additional suggestions for you. Genomics tests, like OncotyeDX and Prolaris, can assay specific genetic components from your biopsy slides, and calculate the probability of aggressive progression. You could consider active surveillance if those tests and confirming MRI studies support it. As to the psa rise, mine has doubled, and even tripled at times, and gone back to normal without any action on my part. It is certainly an area of concern, but psa is never determinate. With only only positive core, the focal therapies mentioned above, like HIFU, FLA, and cryotherapy, are worthwhile alternatives for you to research. Also, there are now clinical trials on vaccines, which are the holy grail of future PCa treatment. Check out what is available to you. The existing \"gold standards\" for PCa intervention are surgery and radiation, but they have side effects that impact men's quality of life in many instances. If they were perfect, there would not be all this intensive investment and research to replace them with less invasive protocols. Take your time, research, question, consult; you have to be your own advocate in getting all the correct data to make your decision for your path forward. Good luck.",

Pratoman had that original pathology report, and then he sent the slides to JH. Dr. Epstein called him and discussed that he found only G (3+3). So, PM accepted that as definitive, at that time. Therefore, the post-op assessment of G(3+4) was an upstaging. Hope this helps.",

There are also sites where types of radiation are favored. A mix of opinions and experiences is always good. As mentioned above, the number one concern is to defeat the cancer, and both major forms of treatment have good success rates. Regarding radiation, I am providing a link to an NIH study showing the superiority of combining brachytherapy (seeds) with IMRT, versus IMRT alone.

And, while I have read complaints from men who were unhappy with prostate cancer treatments, others attest that they have regained satisfactory sexual function, so the results are individual. Also, keep in mind that having a psa test and confirmatory biopsy that you have prostate cancer, does not necessarily mean that you need treatment. I have an apparently indolent case, and have been watching it for eight years, with no change in quality of life. Perhaps 50 percent of newly diagnosed men are in this category. Research is fine, but IMHO, you also need to find doctor(s) that you can trust and confide in.

We don't know what the PSA did the first year after surgery (all of 2016), just that it was below 0.02. Djin, This was discussed a few years ago. Pratoman had that original pathology report, and then he sent the slides to JH. Dr. Epstein called him and discussed that he found only G (3+3). So, PM accepted that as definitive, at that time. Therefore, the post-op assessment of G(3+4) was an upstaging. Hope this helps.",

      "Content": "mitchden, Again, sorry to have you join us here. As the others have said, you have a minimal amount of less-risky cancer, so there is no rush to make any decision. My experience has been somewhat different, and I would offer a few additional suggestions for you. Genomics tests, like OncotyeDX and Prolaris, can assay specific genetic components from your biopsy slides, and calculate the probability of aggressive progression. You could consider active surveillance if those tests and confirming MRI studies support it. As to the psa rise, mine has doubled, and even tripled at times, and gone back to normal without any action on my part. It is certainly an area of concern, but psa is never determinate. With only only positive core, the focal therapies mentioned above, like HIFU, FLA, and cryotherapy, are worthwhile alternatives for you to research. Also, there are now clinical trials on vaccines, which are the holy grail of future PCa treatment. Check out what is available to you. The existing \"gold standards\" for PCa intervention are surgery and radiation, but they have side effects that impact men's quality of life in many instances. If they were perfect, there would not be all this intensive investment and research to replace them with less invasive protocols. Take your time, research, question, consult; you have to be your own advocate in getting all the correct data to make your decision for your path forward. Good luck.",

You have a full range of possibilities, from active surveillance to focal therapies, to types of radiation and surgery. Make sure that you are fully aware of the common side effects of surgery and radiation. Those side effects sometimes greatly impact one's quality of life, and may cause you to carefully re-think whether immediate treatment is the best course for you.

BUT, a positive DRE flips the switch on the debate. A positive DRE ups the potential risk, and demands further investigation. Unfortunately, only a biopsy can make a diagnosis of prostate cancer. Also, I am not sure if the negative biopsy rate is so low when a positive DRE is involved. One thing you could request is a 3T mpMRI to map any suspicious areas in the prostate. If none are found, that could possibly justify skipping the biopsy. If areas are found, the biopsy could use that mapping as a template to target the needles. And, if the biopsy is negative, you will gain peace of mind. Good luck.",

      "Content": "mjpina, Welcome to the forum. Hopefully, your situation will prove non-cancerous, and your stay here will be short. I can follow all your reasoning, and I am no fan of biopsies. BUT, a positive DRE flips the switch on the debate. A positive DRE ups the potential risk, and demands further investigation. Unfortunately, only a biopsy can make a diagnosis of prostate cancer. Also, I am not sure if the negative biopsy rate is so low when a positive DRE is involved. One thing you could request is a 3T mpMRI to map any suspicious areas in the prostate. If none are found, that could possibly justify skipping the biopsy. If areas are found, the biopsy could use that mapping as a template to target the needles. And, if the biopsy is negative, you will gain peace of mind. Good luck.",

Am I wrong that this is another case where we don't know either when the PSA nadir occurred or what it was. We don't know what the PSA did the first year after surgery (all of 2016), just that it was below 0.02. Djin, This was discussed a few years ago. Pratoman had that original pathology report, and then he sent the slides to JH. Dr. Epstein called him and discussed that he found only G (3+3). So, PM accepted that as definitive, at that time. Therefore, the post-op assessment of G(3+4) was an upstaging. Hope this helps.",

You have a full range of possibilities, from active surveillance to focal therapies, to types of radiation and surgery. Make sure that you are fully aware of the common side effects of surgery and radiation. Those side effects sometimes greatly impact one's quality of life, and may cause you to carefully re-think whether immediate treatment is the best course for you. There will be others along with great knowledge, experience, and opinions to share. Don't rush, or be rushed, into making a decision. Good luck to you.",

      "Content": "mitchden, Again, sorry to have you join us here. As the others have said, you have a minimal amount of less-risky cancer, so there is no rush to make any decision. My experience has been somewhat different, and I would offer a few additional suggestions for you. Genomics tests, like OncotyeDX and Prolaris, can assay specific genetic components from your biopsy slides, and calculate the probability of aggressive progression. You could consider active surveillance if those tests and confirming MRI studies support it. As to the psa rise, mine has doubled, and even tripled at times, and gone back to normal without any action on my part. It is certainly an area of concern, but psa is never determinate. With only only positive core, the focal therapies mentioned above, like HIFU, FLA, and cryotherapy, are worthwhile alternatives for you to research. Also, there are now clinical trials on vaccines, which are the holy grail of future PCa treatment. Check out what is available to you. The existing \"gold standards\" for PCa intervention are surgery and radiation, but they have side effects that impact men's quality of life in many instances. If they were perfect, there would not be all this intensive investment and research to replace them with less invasive protocols. Take your time, research, question, consult; you have to be your own advocate in getting all the correct data to make your decision for your path forward. Good luck.",
