      "Content": "My strategy was similar to what's been mentioned (Da Vinci surgery Jan 2012). I hung the night bag on the side of a sturdy waste-paper basket and carried it around the house with me, and placed it beside the bed at night (a lot of sleeping on my back, which was somewhat challenging; I used extra pillows to be more comfortable). To walk around I used a pair of sweat pants with the tube coming out the bottom of my right leg. After about five days I got tired of this \"ball and chain\" and hooked myself up to the leg bag during the day (staff at the hospital was kind enough to give me about five bags and plenty of adhesive strips). Each change, both on and off, was time consuming, because I took great care to keep everything clean (a new bag every third day--both leg and night). It all worked out okay. Seeing that catheter the first time (and subsequent times) was one horrifying sight! I had to wear it for two weeks. With the leg bag I was able to drive to work; I went in most days the second week after surgery. Seems like a distant memory now! Best of luck going forward!",

      "Content": "Carlton, I would second the advice to get a very experienced Da Vinci surgeon (750+ was a figure suggested to me by doctors I consulted to indicate proper experience) --the results (cancer gone and side-effects minimized) depend more on the surgeon's skill than the machine. I had a great surgeon this past January (Jim Hu, then in Boston, now UCLA) and at the moment have no detectable PSA, no incontinence issues, and sexual function. Good luck!",
