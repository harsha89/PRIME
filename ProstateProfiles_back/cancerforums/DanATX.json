      "Content": "I will also preface that I am not a doctor, but will chuck my thoughts into the ring. I'm currently going through a similar though/decision process that you are (or have been). As you can see from my signature, my original biopsy of 3+3 was upgraded to 4+3 with tertiary 5. In my case, the more aggressive (4 with the 5) tumor(s) were near the positive margin area. The RO said that the size and location of the margins relative to tumors meant that in my case, I should consider myself stage 3 for purposes of treatment planning. The question then became whether to move forward with adjuvant radiation in the nearer term, or hold off until BR for salvage radiation, if needed. I still don't know the \"right\" answer, but I chose adjuvant for a few reasons. First, separately, both my RO and URO recommended it based on current guidance (a link, if it works). http://www.auanet.org/guidelines/rad...uideline-2013) I found similar references in Urology journals and such, too. Secondly, a big part of the recommendation, particularly from the RO, had to do with my age. He suggested that the benefits for me were further down the road, more than ten years in all likelihood. It has to do with when/how recurrence may occur and he likened it to pushing BR down the road 10+ more years. Were I not relatively young, he'd probably recommend waiting on PSA rise/BR. I am currently struggling with the side effect part of it, though. My first PSA is next week and then things start moving more quickly or I have to call a halt. I'm basically fully continent at this point. Certainly nothing that I couldn't live with. Erectile Function still on strike, however. Can't tell if that's permanent or temporary, but I had been hoping for some improvement by now. Fixing at the current level is a little \"scary\". My docs say that if it never improves there are other things we can do to try and work that problem. Hmmm. Finally, in a mention of the ugly side of things, for me doing adjuvant this year saves me and my family somewhere between $12K and $15K of our money, under our current insurance. Who knows for future depending on where insurance goes -- it's now preexisting. Unfortunately, this is not trivial for us and does enter the decision matrix, although as a secondary concern. I mention this solely in the pursuit of full disclosure about my decision process. Either way, just a point of view supporting the adjuvant idea -- many/most of the folks here seem to prefer or lean toward BR/salvage. There is a logic to both viewpoints. So I'd recommend finding the RO you trust and will rely upon and get information related to your specific situation. Good Luck!",

      "Content": "I will also preface that I am not a doctor, but will chuck my thoughts into the ring. I'm currently going through a similar though/decision process that you are (or have been). As you can see from my signature, my original biopsy of 3+3 was upgraded to 4+3 with tertiary 5. In my case, the more aggressive (4 with the 5) tumor(s) were near the positive margin area. The RO said that the size and location of the margins relative to tumors meant that in my case, I should consider myself stage 3 for purposes of treatment planning. The question then became whether to move forward with adjuvant radiation in the nearer term, or hold off until BR for salvage radiation, if needed. I still don't know the \"right\" answer, but I chose adjuvant for a few reasons. First, separately, both my RO and URO recommended it based on current guidance (a link, if it works). http://www.auanet.org/guidelines/rad...uideline-2013) I found similar references in Urology journals and such, too. Secondly, a big part of the recommendation, particularly from the RO, had to do with my age. He suggested that the benefits for me were further down the road, more than ten years in all likelihood. It has to do with when/how recurrence may occur and he likened it to pushing BR down the road 10+ more years. Were I not relatively young, he'd probably recommend waiting on PSA rise/BR. I am currently struggling with the side effect part of it, though. My first PSA is next week and then things start moving more quickly or I have to call a halt. I'm basically fully continent at this point. Certainly nothing that I couldn't live with. Erectile Function still on strike, however. Can't tell if that's permanent or temporary, but I had been hoping for some improvement by now. Fixing at the current level is a little \"scary\". My docs say that if it never improves there are other things we can do to try and work that problem. Hmmm. Finally, in a mention of the ugly side of things, for me doing adjuvant this year saves me and my family somewhere between $12K and $15K of our money, under our current insurance. Who knows for future depending on where insurance goes -- it's now preexisting. Unfortunately, this is not trivial for us and does enter the decision matrix, although as a secondary concern. I mention this solely in the pursuit of full disclosure about my decision process. Either way, just a point of view supporting the adjuvant idea -- many/most of the folks here seem to prefer or lean toward BR/salvage. There is a logic to both viewpoints. So I'd recommend finding the RO you trust and will rely upon and get information related to your specific situation. Good Luck!",

      "Content": "I will also preface that I am not a doctor, but will chuck my thoughts into the ring. I'm currently going through a similar though/decision process that you are (or have been). As you can see from my signature, my original biopsy of 3+3 was upgraded to 4+3 with tertiary 5. In my case, the more aggressive (4 with the 5) tumor(s) were near the positive margin area. The RO said that the size and location of the margins relative to tumors meant that in my case, I should consider myself stage 3 for purposes of treatment planning. The question then became whether to move forward with adjuvant radiation in the nearer term, or hold off until BR for salvage radiation, if needed. I still don't know the \"right\" answer, but I chose adjuvant for a few reasons. First, separately, both my RO and URO recommended it based on current guidance (a link, if it works). http://www.auanet.org/guidelines/rad...uideline-2013) I found similar references in Urology journals and such, too. Secondly, a big part of the recommendation, particularly from the RO, had to do with my age. He suggested that the benefits for me were further down the road, more than ten years in all likelihood. It has to do with when/how recurrence may occur and he likened it to pushing BR down the road 10+ more years. Were I not relatively young, he'd probably recommend waiting on PSA rise/BR. I am currently struggling with the side effect part of it, though. My first PSA is next week and then things start moving more quickly or I have to call a halt. I'm basically fully continent at this point. Certainly nothing that I couldn't live with. Erectile Function still on strike, however. Can't tell if that's permanent or temporary, but I had been hoping for some improvement by now. Fixing at the current level is a little \"scary\". My docs say that if it never improves there are other things we can do to try and work that problem. Hmmm. Finally, in a mention of the ugly side of things, for me doing adjuvant this year saves me and my family somewhere between $12K and $15K of our money, under our current insurance. Who knows for future depending on where insurance goes -- it's now preexisting. Unfortunately, this is not trivial for us and does enter the decision matrix, although as a secondary concern. I mention this solely in the pursuit of full disclosure about my decision process. Either way, just a point of view supporting the adjuvant idea -- many/most of the folks here seem to prefer or lean toward BR/salvage. There is a logic to both viewpoints. So I'd recommend finding the RO you trust and will rely upon and get information related to your specific situation. Good Luck!",

As I said, this is really an exploratory/planning consult designed to figure out if adjuvant is the right idea and how/when he'd proceed. Thanks in advance.",

Also, it is unlikely that insurance will cover AR/SR with an undetectable PSA It is possible that you may never experience Biochemical Recurrence (BR). In this scenario, having AR/SR would be a total waste of time, $250K and would create unnecessary radiation damage to healthy tissues. IMO, I would aim to buy as much time as possible prior to starting AR/SR in order to maximally regain functions. Simultaneously, I would fervently hope for the best = BR does not happen! Good luck! MF Thanks, Michael. The costs won't likely be crippling, especially if I can get them covered in the same year with the surgery, just \"unfortunate\". Insurance not covering is my biggest fear, really. According to my uro doc, the American Urological Assoc. and the Amer. Soc. for Rad. Oncology, plus others, the current recommendation for \"best practices\" given my pathology is to do adjuvant radiation therapy. Sort of the definition of adjuvant is post-surgery, pre-BR radiation. The PSA is expected/required to be undetectable to do it. If you wait until BR, regardless of timeframe, it is considered salvage radiation. As my doc describes it, adjuvant is a \"hit it while it's weakened and down and hasn't had any chances to grow/spread/get stronger\" approach. Given the combination of higher risk (4+3 w/5) and positive margins, the probability of BR is much higher than if I'd had clean margins. Another advantage for me is that adjuvant is generally recommended without hormone therapy (leave that bullet in the gun) where this RO already told me pre-surgery that salvage/primary would include months of HT prior to radiation to weaken the cancer. From what I've read and just imagined, hormone therapy sounds like some very undesirable side effects... Adjuvant, from what I understand, must happen within 12 months of surgery, or you default to waiting until recurrence and salvage (I think because you would then need the HT to weaken vs surgical weakening). So, this whole thing will hinge on getting the insurance coverage to do it -- who knows. However, the crux of my question was more to selecting RO. I've seen/read/participated in lots of discussions about how to select the right surgeon. Rates/numbers of procedures, etc. But I haven't seen as much, or just not found it, about how to select a RO to direct radiation therapy. I \"get\" the idea of a learning curve on surgery in general and davinci in specific. Less clear about such things on a big x-ray machine. So if anyone has thoughts about that side of things, have at it. Thanks for your rapid and, as usual, thoughtful reply. Dan",

      "Content": "Dave, As everyone has noted, you can relax until Dec. I suspect that the consult will give you a lot of information about the combination of your pathology and other disease characteristics, combined with a post-RALP PSA and how that figures in expected future risk of progression (likely very low in every case). This will simply help you make an educated and reasonable decision about future treatment planning. Remember, there's nothing to worry about until there IS something to worry about -- which it looks like you don't have right now. Adjuvant is an \"aggressive\" radiation approach that uses radiation before Biochemical Recurrence. I'm doing it based on my own slightly adverse pathology and the PSA results. It was presented to me as \"always a choice\" -- salvage, done after indications of recurrence is less of one. Good luck and just focus on recovery right now.",

      "Content": "Although my RO didn't care one way or the other, I had a relatively long overdue colonoscopy about a month prior to the onset of adjuvant radiation. They removed the polyps (I'd had some on an earlier scoping, too) and ensured benign. I think the RO wanted about 3 weeks+ between the colonoscopy and the first treatment. Although I, like RobLee, continue to suffer from the radiation proctitis, though improved, after two months post radiation. I don't think they're related, and neither does the RO. I just wanted to have a baseline and know that my colon was clear before adding the radiation to the mix. Seems a reasonable precaution to me.",

      "Content": "Djin, as one who is about to start the course of adjuvant this month, I offer the following. From discussions with both my URO and RO, as well as the research I've done myself, I think that if the ONLY adverse pathological finding was a fully contained G9, the \"best practices\" would suggest a \"salvage radiation approach\". That is, monitor PSA and only intervene if the PSA rises above the BR threshold. In my case, it was the combination of significant positive margins and much upgraded grading in the pathology, including G5 cells near the margin, that changed things. According to the RO, for treatment planning purposes, the pathology and other attributes of my disease meant treating me as Stage 3, although the final official grading was T2C. Thus, I will get Adjuvant. My own research turned up at least one of the studies your original quotes referenced.

      "Content": "Hi, Cproman, I'm probably similar to your case in many ways. I was diagnosed at 53, had surgery, then found more advanced disease on post-op pathology. Based on my positive margin, also no lymph involvment nor seminal vessicles, I was aimed at ART. My post operative PSAs were very low (see signature) but showed slight increases. I underwent IMRT last fall. I didn't consider proton, but wouldn't have had insurance coverage for it in any case. In discussions with my RO, the explanation for choice of methodology involved the nature of the target and such. The presumption was that there were limited numbers of cells left in the prostate bed in the neighborhood of the margin. The low PSA numbers and lack of any indication of vessicle/node invasion, nor any widespread extraprostatic extension, suggested a small, still somewhat localized community of cancer cells. This is sort of right in the sweet spot of how IMRT would have maximum effectiveness. With a larger, denser mass of tissue (like a prostate gland), more things would be in play as possibilities. I admit that my guy's expertise and experience was primarily in IMRT, so that may have tilted the field a bit, but he was definitely able to address SBRT and believed that in my kind of case, and where they'd be targeting (alongside colon/bladder), the spread out treatments resulted in fewer negative side effects. Like everyone, I only had the one treatment modality so cannot compare to others personally. However, my side effects were not really bad in the big picture. I had a persistent case of radiation proctitis that set in about 2/3 of the way through the treatments. It lasted nearly six months after. About a week ago it magically resolved itself, though I've now had a bit of slight stress incontinence recur. I'm kinda back where I was about a year ago, two months after surgery, on the incontinence track (fully continent, but occasional shield and thought required when lifting/laughing, etc). I now feel better than I have in forever! The good news is that my PSA appears to be effectively zero for the first time since diagnosis. I've gotten my results off the portal but won't see RO for interpretation until Wednesday, but it's the first <.01 I've ever seen on any test I've taken. So, until told otherwise, I'm considering ART completely successful and me disease free!!! So, from my perspective, you're getting solid advice and can easily look forward to a full cure. Good Luck and let me know if you have any questions I can answer or any other information that would help.",

      "Content": "I'll second the comments of Another. I don't think you necessarily have a more pessimistic outlook because of your age, but I do think it is something to be aware of. I think this puts a premium on making sure you have a physician you trust and who seems to be experienced with men with your attributes. One of the reasons I went with the guy I did for surgery was that he was able to describe a lot of surgical patients he'd had that were younger, like me. (his youngest was 41). I felt that it made him sensitive to the nuances of the disease in younger men. In fact, he spent a lot of time telling me exactly how his recommendations to me, expectations for the surgery, and other things were modified by my age and WHY (relative to what he'd otherwise suggest/expect in his older patients). While my final pathology was not what I'd hoped for, I remain convinced I made the right choices, for me, and that I had the right guy doing the surgery. Your low PSA (relatively), consistent gleason grading across a number of cores, etc., could also be a reason for optimism. Keep learning and focus on finding the right medical/treatment team for you (you might already have it). Then you can make choices in which you can have comfort and confidence. Good Luck!",

      "Content": "Well, I had my surgery last Monday. Had to spend an extra night inpatient because BP dropped to about 70/50 and freaked out hospital folks. After CT Scan, lots of blood work, and I don't know how many bags of fluids/antibiotics (I think they gave me every kind they had in stock!)...oh well, looks fine, go home. Just came back from the catheter removal and pathology visit. I'm feeling pretty validated on jumping to surgery quickly, for me. Final pathology was upgraded from 3+3=6 to 4+3=7, with some 5 aggressive stuff in there. The tumor was sneaking along the urethra and being aggressive there, apparently. 4mm wide positive margin at the apex, with striated tissue in sample (meaning my doc got all of the prostate and just into the sphincter muscles). The positive margin was at the sphincter. Vesicles and lymph nodes negative for cancer. Tumor was centrally located and growing toward the apex. Probably some adjuvant radiation in my future, doc says, after/depending on continence. While I've only been in the diaper for a couple of hours, I'm encouraged by the lack of a constant dripping feeling and the feeling that I've cut it off a couple of times. Doc said both nerve bundles looked good and were spared. There was no incursion in that direction and all margins there were solidly negative. He indicated that the conditions inside, smoothness of the surgery, how soon my urine cleared inpatient (they were pushing fluids constantly for two days for the BP scare), and looking at the CT Scan (which they normally don't have 12 hrs. post-op), he thinks I'm a good candidate for a return to continence on the shorter end of the time spectrum. So, overall, pleased with the results. Little worry with the margin/extension, but that's for another month. Just feeling thankful that I moved quickly to surgery.

      "Content": "Well, I had my surgery last Monday. Had to spend an extra night inpatient because BP dropped to about 70/50 and freaked out hospital folks. After CT Scan, lots of blood work, and I don't know how many bags of fluids/antibiotics (I think they gave me every kind they had in stock!)...oh well, looks fine, go home. Just came back from the catheter removal and pathology visit. I'm feeling pretty validated on jumping to surgery quickly, for me. Final pathology was upgraded from 3+3=6 to 4+3=7, with some 5 aggressive stuff in there. The tumor was sneaking along the urethra and being aggressive there, apparently. 4mm wide positive margin at the apex, with striated tissue in sample (meaning my doc got all of the prostate and just into the sphincter muscles). The positive margin was at the sphincter. Vesicles and lymph nodes negative for cancer. Tumor was centrally located and growing toward the apex. Probably some adjuvant radiation in my future, doc says, after/depending on continence. While I've only been in the diaper for a couple of hours, I'm encouraged by the lack of a constant dripping feeling and the feeling that I've cut it off a couple of times. Doc said both nerve bundles looked good and were spared. There was no incursion in that direction and all margins there were solidly negative. He indicated that the conditions inside, smoothness of the surgery, how soon my urine cleared inpatient (they were pushing fluids constantly for two days for the BP scare), and looking at the CT Scan (which they normally don't have 12 hrs. post-op), he thinks I'm a good candidate for a return to continence on the shorter end of the time spectrum. So, overall, pleased with the results. Little worry with the margin/extension, but that's for another month. Just feeling thankful that I moved quickly to surgery. Doc said with the grade 5 hidden in there, waiting would have been, in retrospect, not as positive an approach. Said the tumor was much more advanced and aggressive looking than the pre-surgical numbers/biopsy would have suggested.

There's a big debate ongoing on another forum, about overtreatment. I'm on the other side of it. I might have to use you as an example of a reason to be careful not to UNDERtreat. Glad you got it when you did. Feel free to use as needed. As I'm not a physician or in the medical field (except as patient), I never want to tell folks what to do. It's got to be what one is comfortable with and fits one's individual situation, including financial (which, pre-medicare, mattered a lot to me). But at 53, I was not comfortable with a strategy that rested on deferring surgery just to avoid some side effects (which admittedly don't sound that fun). I guess it's partly how you deal with probability. If the doc said, \"you choose, diapers forever or dead\" I'd quickly select diapers. Rephrasing to \"diapers for a while, maybe forever vs maybe advanced cancer treatments/dead\" didn't move the needle a lot for me. Seemed like removal would likely happen sometime, so get the sucker out now, look at what we really have (since biopsy, even guided, only samples a vanishingly small part of the organ), and start that recovery. Right now, I'm lucky enough not to have any other serious health concerns, etc. I'm not convinced I'll always be that way. This is, of course, a lot easier to say glibly since I'm feeling \"vindicated\" or \"lucky\" or whatever for choosing correctly that I was in the 28-30% \"actual worse than biopsy\" group rather than the 70% \"see, you could have safely waited 15 years\" group.

I'll add my voice to the cacophony supporting MRI/biopsy decision, especially because in my limited experience it was almost as quick and not much more trouble that drawing few tubes of blood would be. Mine was seriously simple and straightforward, nice opportunity to chat with my doc and his tech. Actually my DRE's were often more uncomfortable (some docs way better than others, in my opinion).

Unfortunately, you can't wait until something bad happens and say, \"wait, I want a do-over and do radiation back then\", nor can you get radiation and avoid BCR and say \"gee, glad I had that radiation that prevented BCR\". It kinda comes down to which risk you wanna take. Right now, there are no indications of remaining cancer (<.01 PSA), but the point of ART is to attack potential residual, weakened cancer cells in a sort of preventative manner. My RO was able to articulate the studies and pro/cons. You should be able to get similar input from any good RO. I can't speak directly to proton, but the guidance I received was there was no demonstrable benefit, especially in my ART situation. I didn't have any long-term or horrible side effects from my IMRT -- in fact the minor bowel symptoms (radiation proctitis) have resolved and I now feel back to normal in all ways. I had a slight step backward in continence (I now have a small bit of stress leakage, but only drop or two easily handled by a lightweight shield). I expect that will resolve in time. ED hasn't worsened, nor has it improved since ART. FWIW, I was told the advantages of ART were only present during the first year after surgery. If you didn't get ART by then, it offered no real advantages over wait and do Salvage after PSA rise.",

      "Content": "MM is providing his usual good suggestions. I, too, had positive margins with gleason 5 near the margins (graded 4+3, though). I'm currently scheduled for my first PSA next week, which a bit more than 90 days after surgery. I think the suggestion to go ahead and identify and meet with the RO is a good one. The URO/surgeon will likely continue to have some involvement, but for the next phase I think the RO will be your medical practitioner. I met with the RO shortly after I got my surgical pathology results, with the blessing and recommendation of the URO. He (RO) and I walked through options, side effects, timing, etc. I scheduled/reserved my block of radiation times a couple months ago. The plan for me is that if the PSA next week is undetectable, then I do \"adjuvant\" with no hormone therapy. If the PSA is detectable, then we stop and reassess, likely just moving to \"salvage\" with HT included. Meanwhile, I've just been doing my exercises, going to physical therapy, and healing up in preparation for the next step. I'm not sure exactly how to select between RO guys, but I wanted someone who does a lot of Prostate cancer treatments. The guy I selected treats primarily prostate cancers. He is practiced at both primary and adjuvant/salvage applications and is active doing research/academic work, as well. He seems very knowledgeable about current practices, and specifically issues/practices in prostate cancer treatment. It seems like meeting with potential RO's to identify the one you will use and getting information about and from him is the best option. The timing you suggested of a PSA in October with treatments after that, as indicated, makes perfect sense to me. I agree with MM that I don't know what information a PSA today really provides (I'm also NOT a doctor). My doc said there was no advantage to doing one earlier and that it just muddied the waters and worried folks with numbers that hadn't \"bottomed out\" naturally. Good luck moving forward. As others have said, cure is still very much the goal for you.",

      "Content": "Hey, Rob, I don't have the colitis, but I do have a significant, ongoing radiation proctitis thing happening. My RO was taking imaging just prior to each of my 39 tx and said the bladder/rectum were within treatment limits all but about two widely spaced days. FWIW. I don't have the diarrhea, but got all of the urgency. Also, regularity is still not normal. From all of the inflamation, I'll get a lot of discomfort and a feeling of great urgency to defecate, with a very full feeling like I'm harboring bowling balls. Then, instant relief after passing something that resembles (size) a stubby, 2 inch pencil (the thick ones we all used to write on our big chief tablets). I mean, REALLY? Then within an hour or two, recurrence. Then nothing for a day (but the discomfort) and 6 significant events one after another. Again, REALLY? I'm attributing it to having been (in a prior life -- many years ago) a redhead. Sensitive tissues! I've been prescribed hydrocortisone retention enemas (fun--not so much), which do knock it out/back. But I've heard/read a lot of bad things from ongoing use of them. Including during the treatment regimen, I've had six weeks worth of those. I spaced them out a bit (to make them last) so as not to overdo it. My surgeon says they can thin the rectum and cause other problems... I keep hearing it will improve, but it is only doing so in small fits and starts, with backsliding, and is NOT comfortable. This has been the only real impact to daily life except the immediate week or so after surgery. Gas causes rather significant pain/discomfort, and I can't seem to control both sides independently when this happens. I've been continent since just after surgery and gave away my supply of diapers with the idea of staying so. I REFUSE to wear diapers just to try farting safely. So I spend a LOT of quality time in all of the bathrooms in the neighborhood (home and every store, etc., I visit). I'm out of the enemas, so I've got to solo until my RO visit end of May. All of my docs say, \"everyone is different\" and \"just give it time\" and \"should be getting better soon\" and \"six months or so\" etc. I'm hoping they are right, but you are not alone in this. Good Luck! Hope yours subsides soon.",

      "Content": "ASA, My issue with the quoted information is one of presentation. If a person is low risk, and there is no \"reason\" to do surgery (or radiation, or whatever), then AS makes perfect sense. I just think encouraging decision making pro/con active treatment on the basis of supposed side effect mitigation is not a good approach. If one needs treatment, one should get the treatment that provides the best cure opportunity and minimizes adverse side effects. If one doesn't need treatment, getting treated now in preference to a potential future side effect seems ill advised, generally. I mean, if one defers treatment based on sound medical practice, I think we can agree that ED is not impacted (unless otherwise present in any case). Perhaps we are merely talking about the definition of risk, but I'd hate to think men are getting surgery to \"preserve\" some concept of erectile function. My understanding is surgery ALWAYS results in ED for some period of time. In my case, the argument for surgery as a young man was never presented to me, nor evaluated, as providing \"better ED recovery\". It was mentioned that a younger body tolerates surgery better than an older one, generally, but that was all. It was all about likelihood of progression and future disease outcomes. Side effects were discussed separately and no distinction was ever made for them based on age (other than to note that most men eventually suffer reduced erectile function based solely on age). There are probably folks out there being presented information that frames the decision in the manner suggested by the article. But THAT is kinda what disturbs me.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by danapoint1 Things I learned along the way, now 2 weeks after surgery: 2) Kegels, Kegels and more Kegels- when my catheter was removed I had NO incontinence, in fact I had no leakage- better than before surgery. 3) Pain after RALP was less than expected other than initial gas pain- only extra strength Tylenol. 7) My wife is a goddess- I could not have done this without her help and support. This forum is invaluable Thanks again for all the help- now on too final recovery! Congratulations. You're doing a great job of cheering me up. Just clearing the (hopefully last) nasty gas pains, on just the Tylenol now. Glad you shouted out the wife, mine's made this SO much easier, especially post op and beginning recovery. After listening to my doctor warning against incontinence excessive exuberance, and most of the cases on the forum, your immediate dryness is inspiring! I think I may be able to begin to believe in mine tomorrow. See you in the Zero Club (I hope) in a month or so.",

      "Content": "MM is providing his usual good suggestions. I, too, had positive margins with gleason 5 near the margins (graded 4+3, though). I'm currently scheduled for my first PSA next week, which a bit more than 90 days after surgery. I think the suggestion to go ahead and identify and meet with the RO is a good one. The URO/surgeon will likely continue to have some involvement, but for the next phase I think the RO will be your medical practitioner. I met with the RO shortly after I got my surgical pathology results, with the blessing and recommendation of the URO. He (RO) and I walked through options, side effects, timing, etc. I scheduled/reserved my block of radiation times a couple months ago. The plan for me is that if the PSA next week is undetectable, then I do \"adjuvant\" with no hormone therapy. If the PSA is detectable, then we stop and reassess, likely just moving to \"salvage\" with HT included. Meanwhile, I've just been doing my exercises, going to physical therapy, and healing up in preparation for the next step. I'm not sure exactly how to select between RO guys, but I wanted someone who does a lot of Prostate cancer treatments. The guy I selected treats primarily prostate cancers. He is practiced at both primary and adjuvant/salvage applications and is active doing research/academic work, as well. He seems very knowledgeable about current practices, and specifically issues/practices in prostate cancer treatment. It seems like meeting with potential RO's to identify the one you will use and getting information about and from him is the best option. The timing you suggested of a PSA in October with treatments after that, as indicated, makes perfect sense to me. I agree with MM that I don't know what information a PSA today really provides (I'm also NOT a doctor). My doc said there was no advantage to doing one earlier and that it just muddied the waters and worried folks with numbers that hadn't \"bottomed out\" naturally. Good luck moving forward. As others have said, cure is still very much the goal for you.",

      "Content": "I'm glad I read the article -- as the title of the thread was misleading to me. I chose my treatment modality and timing based solely on the expected efficacy in curing cancer/preventing significant reductions in quality of life from the cancer. Side effects were considered, but only from the standpoint of selecting between alternatives with the same expected efficacy. I personally would be horrified if people were choosing a surgical procedure they didn't need for effective treatment of their cancer only in order to control perceived side effects. I did and do believe that quicker and easier recovery from surgery would apply to me at 53 than 73, but that was also true for other surgeries I've had -- and climbing mountains, etc. Erectile recovery is a part of surgical recovery, but I suspect it is more related to the details of the surgery (amount cut, location of nerves, surgeon experience, etc) than purely age....",

      "Content": "Hey, Jake, sorry to meet you this way, but glad you found us! I'm 54yo (53 at dx), and you will probably hear a lot about age in the recommendations/decision. I know that both my surgeon and my radiation guy suggested surgery based on my age/biopsy. The RO said he'd certainly do the radiation if that was my choice, but went over a number of reasons why he felt it would not offer the best probable cancer cure/quality of life mix. There are advocates for both approaches here, each with passion and thought and consideration in his advocacy. There truly is no one right answer. As to the cancer center thing, I guess I swim a bit against the stream. I live a couple hours from MDA in Houston, so could have done that. For me, having found a surgeon/hospital/RO near me that seemed to me to be qualified and that I liked was very helpful. I understand how the major center process works, and it is different in many ways from the local practice. Some feel it's better, I just think it's different. I don't think all good docs and all good processes exist only at the big centers. I believe that the comfort and familiarity of being at home for recovery and 15 minutes from my docs if there were problems and for followups, etc., really helped me. I know I didn't miss the significant financial strain of staying in a hotel for a week or more, plus travelling, plus not having my family right there... If your case is in some way unusual, by all means head to the cutting edge experts. Otherwise, be open to a good local choice. My guy had done over a thousand and was doing 3-5 per week right here -- and did all of them himself one theater at a time... In any case, I feel like the outcome and process I'm experiencing validated my choice -- or at least didn't invalidate it...",

      "Content": "Hey, Jake, sorry to meet you this way, but glad you found us! I'm 54yo (53 at dx), and you will probably hear a lot about age in the recommendations/decision. I know that both my surgeon and my radiation guy suggested surgery based on my age/biopsy. The RO said he'd certainly do the radiation if that was my choice, but went over a number of reasons why he felt it would not offer the best probable cancer cure/quality of life mix. There are advocates for both approaches here, each with passion and thought and consideration in his advocacy. There truly is no one right answer. As to the cancer center thing, I guess I swim a bit against the stream. I live a couple hours from MDA in Houston, so could have done that. For me, having found a surgeon/hospital/RO near me that seemed to me to be qualified and that I liked was very helpful. I understand how the major center process works, and it is different in many ways from the local practice. Some feel it's better, I just think it's different. I don't think all good docs and all good processes exist only at the big centers. I believe that the comfort and familiarity of being at home for recovery and 15 minutes from my docs if there were problems and for followups, etc., really helped me. I know I didn't miss the significant financial strain of staying in a hotel for a week or more, plus travelling, plus not having my family right there... If your case is in some way unusual, by all means head to the cutting edge experts. Otherwise, be open to a good local choice. My guy had done over a thousand and was doing 3-5 per week right here -- and did all of them himself one theater at a time... In any case, I feel like the outcome and process I'm experiencing validated my choice -- or at least didn't invalidate it...",

      "Content": "Hey Puzzled, I'll differ a bit, potentially. I think you could definitely seek a bit more information. Either more detailed info or another RO opinion. I also had a 4mm positive gleason 4 (and maybe 5) margin at the base with no other negative findings (other than being bumped from 3+3 to 4+3 with 5% 5). I'm currently through tx 18 of 39 IMRT adjuvant radiation treatments. My medical team recommended this without reference to my post surgical PSA's (unless it had come back really bad, in which case HT would have been part of the plan). I think the key words that might help you refine your understanding and inform your research are \"adjuvant radiation\" and \"salvage radiation\". You are not much older than I am (I'm 54). There is industry guidance based on reputable studies that suggest a proactive radiation approach in cases with the margins/pathology you've described. As I'm sure others will point out, no two cases are the same and waiting and monitoring are valid responses. In my case, both the surgeon and RO, separately, explained that although my pathology was a final grade of T2C, for treatment planning purposes prospectively, I'm considered Stage 3. This is because (as explained to me) the 4mm margin is considered \"significant\" and should therefore be treated as if it were extraprostatic disease. As my surgeon said, it is certainly possible that the last cancer cells were actually destroyed in the cauterized tissues, it is not the only or even most likely result. So act as if there's still stuff there... There are threads and research and other stuff that explores the differences and reasons to pursue adjuvant vs salvage. Adjuvant is the more \"proactive\" or \"aggressive\" approach. It is using radiation before there is distinctive evidence of Biochemical Recurrence (elevated PSA). Theory explained to me is sort of hit the remaining cancer cells while they are weakened and shocked by the surgery and removal of the gland. In my case, this eliminates the need for HT, too. Salvage, on the other hand, is the more commonly discussed wait and watch and then jump into radiation as soon as there is an elevated PSA to show recurrence. FYI, generally, adjuvant has to occur within one year of surgery. If you wait a year or longer, it's generally suggested to just wait/monitor until BR occurs. Theory being that if everything is fully recovered at a year, the cells are no longer shocked/weakened. This is as it was explained to me by my medical folks and research... In any case, sounds like your team is suggesting adjuvant radiation. Do some research and ask some questions. Good Luck!",

      "Content": "AS, I suspect you are right on the timeframe reasoning. I was having an interesting discussion with a guy I met at a gaming group I'm part of. He has a lot of family history of PCa (Father, at least one brother, and grandfather). He'd been reading about the problems of over-treatment and not getting a PSA test (I think from a \"TV doctor\" or something). I think he wanted to feel there was nothing to worry about. He was also asking about alternative/nutritional approaches, for which I was a poor advocate. It led to a bit of interesting dialog about the difference between medical system decision making and individual decision making. I certainly fit within the parameters of someone who has been \"overtreated\" based on all indicators prior to surgery. But I can verify I feel closer to undertreated (like why wasn't this identified sooner, which it probably would have if I'd been getting PSA tests from the time BPH was identified several years ago) than overtreated. My GP was going with the \"no routine PSA\" guidance to avoid overtreatment. So nothing happened until the DRE indicated something was already there. I can't fault him in that he was just following the medical community guidance -- which often does seem to overtest, etc. But I still wish I'd had an opportunity to decide and intervene a few years ago... It makes PCa a difficult problem.",

      "Content": "Thanks for all of the advice. I haven't asked for second evaluation for the pathology because I'm not sure it would be money well spent for me. Unless it's likely to change it to \"no cancer\" (seems unlikely given three doctors noting DRE physical indications), or bump up to gleason 8 or 9, then I don't think it would significantly modify my approach. In the first instance, of course I wouldn't have any surgery if there were no carcinoma. In the second, unless it was changed to be significantly advanced (stage three or better) and aggressive, I think I'd still opt for surgery. If the pathology had originally come back 4+3 or something, it would make more sense to double check before moving forward too quickly or deciding on imaging tests. Anyway, that's why I've avoided the second opinion path right now. Also, since my pathologist does a lot of cancer (22 urologists in practice) and did the John's Hopkins fellowship, I'm hoping he's pretty good . If I ultimately decide on surveillance, there will be additional biopsy material in my future, too. Anyway, I'll update after seeing doc tomorrow. Thanks again for all of the helpful comments/advice.

      "Content": "I'm meeting with my urologist and potential surgeon (he does robotic) Monday Feb 13th. Since I kinda fell backward into this I'm looking for suggestions on choosing surgeon or specific things to watch for/ask. The story: I'm 53 and went in for my annual-ish physical in October. My GP doc found a hard spot on the left apex of my prostate during the DRE. I'd never had a PSA, and didn't really know much about it. He referred me to a nearby urology practice to \"have someone verify it/check it out\". He never mentioned cancer and I didn't really wonder or worry. The referral was for a practice and he did not offer any preference for a specific physician (I asked). It's a large practice with offices all over the city (Austin, TX). So I picked the closest office, went to my insurance carrier site and health grades and stuff and picked the guy I liked from that sort of casual review. First visit was in mid December. Recommended and did biopsy on 27th. Also did PSA draw. Got the results on Jan 6th. Two cores from twelve positive adenocarcinoma, 5 and 15 percent. Both 3+3=6. PSA came back at 7, for what it's worth. He notes same areas of hardness on DRE. I think from reading Walsh book, talking to this urologist at biopsy results visit, and after seeing the radiation oncologist for the practice, the surgery is the option I'll pursue. I meet the urologist Monday to get results of additional genetic testing on biopsy samples and to discuss next steps. My question, which I'd value the forums input on, is how to determine, if possible, if this is the right guy. I like his manner and what information I've gotten from him has been solid. He's been practicing about 20 years or so, but I won't know until Monday how many he's done. Are there questions beyond number of procedures he's done, or number per year that I should ask? I know MDA in Houston is \"close\", but that would take longer to set up and cost a lot more for travel and lodging and stuff. From what I can tell, I've been caught early and one would expect a relatively straightforward surgery based on pathology and such, so MDA might not be so \"necessary\" Anyway, any advice welcome.",

      "Content": "AS, I suspect you are right on the timeframe reasoning. I was having an interesting discussion with a guy I met at a gaming group I'm part of. He has a lot of family history of PCa (Father, at least one brother, and grandfather). He'd been reading about the problems of over-treatment and not getting a PSA test (I think from a \"TV doctor\" or something). I think he wanted to feel there was nothing to worry about. He was also asking about alternative/nutritional approaches, for which I was a poor advocate. It led to a bit of interesting dialog about the difference between medical system decision making and individual decision making. I certainly fit within the parameters of someone who has been \"overtreated\" based on all indicators prior to surgery. But I can verify I feel closer to undertreated (like why wasn't this identified sooner, which it probably would have if I'd been getting PSA tests from the time BPH was identified several years ago) than overtreated. My GP was going with the \"no routine PSA\" guidance to avoid overtreatment. So nothing happened until the DRE indicated something was already there. I can't fault him in that he was just following the medical community guidance -- which often does seem to overtest, etc. But I still wish I'd had an opportunity to decide and intervene a few years ago... It makes PCa a difficult problem.",

      "Content": "Hey, Mike, sounds like you're a potential candidate for adjuvant radiation, which I finished first of the year. Generally, from what my Uro and RO told me, IF they are gonna recommend/do adjuvant radiation, they usually wait about six months to schedule it in. Usually target doing it in the last half the year after surgery. This is to allow the body maximum time to heal, gaining 100% continence and as much erectile function as possible before beginning. Usually, the radiation will \"freeze\" in place the state you have when you begin it (or at least they will tell you that. Since adjuvant is recommended based on clinical/pathological features rather than PSA, additional PSA readings or rises are not really a factor. In my case, I was recommended and planned the radiation without regard to PSA -- they just did one right before the radiation (at six months) to have a baseline. So I wouldn't worry too much about that unless you are considering waiting until a confirmed BCR before proceeding with radiation. In that case, the routine PSA screenings and such are very relevant. Sounds to me like June would be a \"normal time\" to check in on continence and related side effects and assess for adjuvant. Good Luck!",

      "Content": "Thanks for all of the advice. I haven't asked for second evaluation for the pathology because I'm not sure it would be money well spent for me. Unless it's likely to change it to \"no cancer\" (seems unlikely given three doctors noting DRE physical indications), or bump up to gleason 8 or 9, then I don't think it would significantly modify my approach. In the first instance, of course I wouldn't have any surgery if there were no carcinoma. In the second, unless it was changed to be significantly advanced (stage three or better) and aggressive, I think I'd still opt for surgery.

      "Content": "Originally Posted by Pratoman Hello Guys, it\u2019s been a while. To those of you who have been here a while, it\u2019s good (sort of) to be back, although not for the reasons I\u2019m here. So it looks like I may very well be headed for radiation treatments. And it\u2019s been recommended I do so early. I\u2019m at .06 as of March, just to make it easy, I\u2019m going to cut and paste the post I put up on another forum, with the background, for the guys here that are new enough to not know my backstory....any comments are welcome and appreciated. At the reco of a friend/member here, I met today with the chair of RAd Onc at Cleveland Clinic in Florida. It was a long meeting, and very informative. The short version is.... He recommends treating soon (to review, I was undetectable until the 2 year post op mark, then .02, .033, .033, .046, 060, see signature below) he cited this study... /jamanetwork.com/journals/jamaoncology/article-abstract/2670381?redirect=true A multi institutional study with n=1566, it showed an advantage to treating below .1, vs treating .1 - .5. The entire cohort was adverse pathology. While I had negative final margins, the RO felt that because my frozen section intraoperative margin was positive, and at the apex, my negative final margin was questionable, and he placed a high probability on the PSA coming from cells left in the prostate bed, thus a relatively high probability of a good result. He said if I wanted to wait a few months he didn\u2019t think it would put me at increased risk. He didn\u2019t put too much weight into my low Decipher score, saying I could be one of the 3% that has recurrence, nor did he put much weight in the oncoDx Grid report that predicted poor response to SRT, saying there was not enough data to validate it yet, too small a sample. I also asked him what he thinks might happen if I decided to do nothing. His response, a 50% chance that 10 years from now I would be living a happy life with no issues related to PC. And a 50% chance that I\u2019d have some serious problems in 10 years. I don\u2019t like those odds. He said with their machine, Varian Edge, I think, the chance of permanent side effects was less than 5% (but I should expect transient side effects) I am meeting with Dr Zelefsky, RO at MSKCC, mid June. I will have one more PSA before that meeting. I am inclined to look fir one more increased PSA after the Zelefsky meeting, then taking action, although that also depends on what the pre-Zelefsky PSA shows. I\u2019ve pretty much tossed aside my Surgeons advice to do nothing until/unless i get to .2. I wish their was a black and white answer, but there apparently is not. So the beat goes on. One thing I did not ask, is whether Medicare would approve early Salvage . Anybody know the answer from experience? Good Luck Pratoman! I don't know the answer for medicare, but I'm guessing the answer is probably yes. I'm sure the RO's office will be able to tell you/preapprove. At least it will cost less than for those of us on \"regular\" insurance (about 10K for my portion). Just as a data point, I have had nothing indicating long-term or permanent side effects (my target was also the prostate bed from positive margins, with similar PSA progression after surgery, albeit faster). I have had a persistent case of radiation proctitis, which has been annoying as hell, but nothing worse. That is finally beginning to subside, I think/hope. I blame my sensitivity on being a (former) redhead! I've got my second post-radiation PSA this week, with hopefully final, followup with RO next week. First post-radiation PSA was down! I think you are correct to consider early intervention...Of course, I did the same thing!",

RO just notes that it's suggestive of something still there and move forward. Next steps are \"preplanning\" visit to RO Tuesday (gettin' the dots and imaging, etc.) October 30th the journey begins. Otherwise, also feeling a bit of validation pushing back the month to hope for erectile improvement. Not stellar, but can now occasionally manage half-staff, which is somehow more satisfying, if not more useful, than previous \"slight swelling\". Much better improvement than RO expected. Yay, me!",

      "Content": "Dave, sounds like you've got a good handle on this. I did adjuvant, within the first year, but not very different from your profile. I had a relationship with my RO from initial consultations prior to surgery/decisions. If you've seen one before, that should be an easy no-brainer to get in with him/her. You can probably even get phone referral from docs. Even if you ultimately use a different practitioner. From my discussions with my surgeon and RO, I think some of the \"wait longer\" thing is related to when you have recurrence. My surgeon was very much in favor of early/aggressive radiation for me. But he noted that if I'd gone longer before indications of adverse stuff, he'd think more about waiting. This was explained as trying to make sure you could target properly. With me, the early PSA rises and adverse pathology pointed strongly to the prostate bed as the likely location to target. He said that if it were couple years from now, they'd wanna wait and make sure there was enough to show up on scans to make sure where/what was happening. RO told similar story. In your case, I think that it sounds like the pathology you had points to the likely disease location -- so you can move ahead with alacrity. I don't think you will have any problem with insurance given the history you've provided. It's not really a question of whether this is a medical necessity, but more of a timing thing. I didn't have any issues in this regard and my RO said that wasn't any problem with insurance when I asked him.... Good Luck!",

      "Content": "Hello and Welcome to the Forum -- there's lots of great folks and helpful information here. I was in your shoes just a few months ago. I'm only 53, so just a bit older. Try and stay calm and absorb things a bit. Your Gleason of 3+3 is about the least aggressive and most easily treated, with the most options, you could have. Gleason 6 doesn't metastasize and often stays indolent for years. Gleason 6 may result in treatment, but is very very unlikely to kill you. Yours has been found early, which is great. My doc also sent my biopsy samples off for genomic testing (well, was supposed to -- mixup meant never happened) The genomic testing will not change your Gleason score. The Gleason is based on the pathologist's assessment of the appearance of the biopsy material. It is possible for different pathologists to assess the slides differently, but there's no reason at this point for you to think this has happened. Your PSA is not very high. The genomic testing is designed to provide additional information to help you refine how you respond. A score will come back that will help your Urologist assess the likelihood that your cancer will become more aggressive or stay pretty indolent. It's kinda sorta like \"what's the chance that my Gleason gets worse over time\". It's based on genetic markers in the samples and is only to help you and the doc make treatment decisions (very low scores suggest waiting a while is low risk, higher suggest slightly more urgency in deciding on treatment directions. A common genomic test is Oncotype DX, which you can google and read up on -- been used for breast cancer for a while. I think there are others, but reading about Oncotype DX should give you the idea. Once again, sorry you found us by getting a diagnosis, but there's lots of folks here with good experience who'll help and support you throughout. I'd recommend getting the Dr. Patrick Walsh book, Guide to Surviving Prostate Cancer. lots of wonderful information. I know it sounds crazy, but now's a good time to take a few deep breaths. The numbers you've described are far from an emergency and very curable. Good Luck and ask any questions you have. There's someone here who can provide good answers. Dan",

The RT was relatively uneventful, with some bothersome radiation proctitis near the end and persisting for a couple months after. That has fully resolved now. My continence slipped a bit, so I went back to a shield and briefs, but nothing serious (slight stress incontinence leakage, but nothing requiring more than just a shield). I'm now back in boxers and out of the shields again. I think carefully before lifting and other kinds of stress, but no leakage anymore. ED has begun to improve a bit more again, so I'm hopeful that will continue to improve over time. I'm at about 50% without assistance, which is the low end of functionality, better with a pump. I'm just a couple of years younger, so hopefully experiences will be similar. Sounds like you've got a really good shot at a \"cleanup\" and cure. After RT, my PSA is below the threshold of detection = zero! Good Luck.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by Pratoman Hello Guys, it\u2019s been a while. To those of you who have been here a while, it\u2019s good (sort of) to be back, although not for the reasons I\u2019m here. So it looks like I may very well be headed for radiation treatments. And it\u2019s been recommended I do so early. I\u2019m at .06 as of March, just to make it easy, I\u2019m going to cut and paste the post I put up on another forum, with the background, for the guys here that are new enough to not know my backstory....any comments are welcome and appreciated. At the reco of a friend/member here, I met today with the chair of RAd Onc at Cleveland Clinic in Florida. It was a long meeting, and very informative. The short version is.... He recommends treating soon (to review, I was undetectable until the 2 year post op mark, then .02, .033, .033, .046, 060, see signature below) he cited this study... /jamanetwork.com/journals/jamaoncology/article-abstract/2670381?redirect=true A multi institutional study with n=1566, it showed an advantage to treating below .1, vs treating .1 - .5. The entire cohort was adverse pathology. While I had negative final margins, the RO felt that because my frozen section intraoperative margin was positive, and at the apex, my negative final margin was questionable, and he placed a high probability on the PSA coming from cells left in the prostate bed, thus a relatively high probability of a good result. He said if I wanted to wait a few months he didn\u2019t think it would put me at increased risk. He didn\u2019t put too much weight into my low Decipher score, saying I could be one of the 3% that has recurrence, nor did he put much weight in the oncoDx Grid report that predicted poor response to SRT, saying there was not enough data to validate it yet, too small a sample. I also asked him what he thinks might happen if I decided to do nothing. His response, a 50% chance that 10 years from now I would be living a happy life with no issues related to PC. And a 50% chance that I\u2019d have some serious problems in 10 years. I don\u2019t like those odds. He said with their machine, Varian Edge, I think, the chance of permanent side effects was less than 5% (but I should expect transient side effects) I am meeting with Dr Zelefsky, RO at MSKCC, mid June. I will have one more PSA before that meeting. I am inclined to look fir one more increased PSA after the Zelefsky meeting, then taking action, although that also depends on what the pre-Zelefsky PSA shows. I\u2019ve pretty much tossed aside my Surgeons advice to do nothing until/unless i get to .2. I wish their was a black and white answer, but there apparently is not. So the beat goes on. One thing I did not ask, is whether Medicare would approve early Salvage . Anybody know the answer from experience? Good Luck Pratoman! I don't know the answer for medicare, but I'm guessing the answer is probably yes. I'm sure the RO's office will be able to tell you/preapprove. At least it will cost less than for those of us on \"regular\" insurance (about 10K for my portion). Just as a data point, I have had nothing indicating long-term or permanent side effects (my target was also the prostate bed from positive margins, with similar PSA progression after surgery, albeit faster). I have had a persistent case of radiation proctitis, which has been annoying as hell, but nothing worse. That is finally beginning to subside, I think/hope. I blame my sensitivity on being a (former) redhead! I've got my second post-radiation PSA this week, with hopefully final, followup with RO next week. First post-radiation PSA was down! I think you are correct to consider early intervention...Of course, I did the same thing!",

      "Content": "Jeff, I'm in a similar boat to RobLee and just finished my course of adjuvant about two weeks ago. I was completely continent when it started and my PSA was not shooting up. In my case, I elected adjuvant without reference to (before they were taken, in fact) post op PSA results. As you do your research, consider the differences in radiation techniques and technology between when your dad likely had it and now. My RO suggested that the overall increase in bladder cancer risk I'd experience from radiation was about 3-5% over 30 years or so. Seemed to me to be lower than chance of a few laggard pCa cells hanging about causing potential trouble. You're just a couple years older than me, so should have a relatively long-term outlook, too, I'd think. I know that the radiation I received was fairly precisely targeted (not to a specific tumor, but area) and they spent a lot of time trying to avoid/minimize bladder and bowel zapping. (In fact, my insurance decided not to cover the imaging they did each day to ensure proper targeting!) Recover a bit and heal a bit and do some research and talk to an RO or two before making up your mind. Pathology, especially negative margins on the removed tissues, seems a positive. Good Luck!",

I had a relationship with my RO from initial consultations prior to surgery/decisions. If you've seen one before, that should be an easy no-brainer to get in with him/her. You can probably even get phone referral from docs. Even if you ultimately use a different practitioner. From my discussions with my surgeon and RO, I think some of the \"wait longer\" thing is related to when you have recurrence. My surgeon was very much in favor of early/aggressive radiation for me. But he noted that if I'd gone longer before indications of adverse stuff, he'd think more about waiting. This was explained as trying to make sure you could target properly. With me, the early PSA rises and adverse pathology pointed strongly to the prostate bed as the likely location to target.

      "Content": "Dave, sounds like you've got a good handle on this. I did adjuvant, within the first year, but not very different from your profile. I had a relationship with my RO from initial consultations prior to surgery/decisions. If you've seen one before, that should be an easy no-brainer to get in with him/her. You can probably even get phone referral from docs. Even if you ultimately use a different practitioner. From my discussions with my surgeon and RO, I think some of the \"wait longer\" thing is related to when you have recurrence. My surgeon was very much in favor of early/aggressive radiation for me. But he noted that if I'd gone longer before indications of adverse stuff, he'd think more about waiting. This was explained as trying to make sure you could target properly. With me, the early PSA rises and adverse pathology pointed strongly to the prostate bed as the likely location to target. He said that if it were couple years from now, they'd wanna wait and make sure there was enough to show up on scans to make sure where/what was happening. RO told similar story.

      "Content": "Hello and Welcome to the Forum -- there's lots of great folks and helpful information here. I was in your shoes just a few months ago. I'm only 53, so just a bit older. Try and stay calm and absorb things a bit. Your Gleason of 3+3 is about the least aggressive and most easily treated, with the most options, you could have. Gleason 6 doesn't metastasize and often stays indolent for years. Gleason 6 may result in treatment, but is very very unlikely to kill you. Yours has been found early, which is great. My doc also sent my biopsy samples off for genomic testing (well, was supposed to -- mixup meant never happened) The genomic testing will not change your Gleason score. The Gleason is based on the pathologist's assessment of the appearance of the biopsy material. It is possible for different pathologists to assess the slides differently, but there's no reason at this point for you to think this has happened. Your PSA is not very high. The genomic testing is designed to provide additional information to help you refine how you respond. A score will come back that will help your Urologist assess the likelihood that your cancer will become more aggressive or stay pretty indolent. It's kinda sorta like \"what's the chance that my Gleason gets worse over time\". It's based on genetic markers in the samples and is only to help you and the doc make treatment decisions (very low scores suggest waiting a while is low risk, higher suggest slightly more urgency in deciding on treatment directions. A common genomic test is Oncotype DX, which you can google and read up on -- been used for breast cancer for a while. I think there are others, but reading about Oncotype DX should give you the idea. Once again, sorry you found us by getting a diagnosis, but there's lots of folks here with good experience who'll help and support you throughout. I'd recommend getting the Dr. Patrick Walsh book, Guide to Surviving Prostate Cancer. lots of wonderful information. I know it sounds crazy, but now's a good time to take a few deep breaths. The numbers you've described are far from an emergency and very curable. Good Luck and ask any questions you have. There's someone here who can provide good answers. Dan",

      "Content": "I think you're getting lots of good advice. I understand the waiting is hard -- I, too, was tempted to invent things to worry about. From what you've indicated, your docs haven't suggested there's an expectation it's left the organ. So, it's best to assume it has not. That means positive margins are not expected, either. If you have any sort of upgrade on pathology post surgery, deal with that then. Every case is different and specific, so what margins mean and such is also specific to an individual case. As Dave pointed out, positive margins, when they occur, don't always mean any changes for you anyway. You'll have seen reports of 30% of pathology is upgraded post surgery. Don't forget, that means that 70% of the time it isn't. Bet on the 70% and clean margins.",

      "Content": "I'm sure that others with more experience will chime in, but here's my two cents worth. I've looked into the same questions, just as many of us have. Hopefully, with your solid surgery and pathology results this never troubles you again! Most surgery folks gleefully watch their PSA settle at zero/undetectable after surgery. Then they monitor PSA levels to catch biochemical recurrence (BR) if it happens, showing something is happening again. At this point, they typically receive salvage radiation. This is often/usually accompanied by some level of HT, often six months prior to and 24 months post-radiation. The HT is to weaken the cancer cells to improve radiation efficacy. At least, this is what my RO tells me. Normally, BR, if it occurs, is more than two years, frequently more than five years down the road from RP surgery. Generally, BR within two years is indicative of more aggressive cancer and can result in more aggressive HT/treatment. Some folks, like myself, have post-surgical findings that suggest a more aggressive approach may be appropriate. Things like significant positive margins (especially with higher grade pathology), seminal vesicle involvement, etc. In this case, adjuvant radiation may be suggested. Adjuvant and Salvage radiation are essentially the same thing, just with different timing. Adjuvant is a course of radiation that commences, usually within a year of RP, while the tissues should be already weakened by the removal of the prostate/surgery. In this case, HT is usually not indicated (presuming PSA is undetectable after RP). If PSA does not fall to undetectable levels, or more extensive cancer is indicated, HT can be the same -- which makes it identical to salvage. Adjuvant has been shown to reduce BR, or maybe better stated, push BR into the future more. In both cases, if you have a BR after the radiation, your treatment options shift. ASAdvocate has recently provided links to studies indicating that SBRT (higher dose focused radiation in 1-5 treatments) may be effective as followup (especially where defined tumor sites can be identified, I believe). Otherwise, my understanding is that a general progression is HT as long as it is effective, followed by combinations of chemotherapy/radiotherapy depending on the cancer's location and dimensions. In any case, for most of us, the third round of treatments will not be in the picture. Keep in mind, that for most of us with Gleason grade 6/7 findings, there is a significant time lapse between surgery, possible BR, and then, IF it occurs, second BR -- on the order of ten to twenty years. For the average patient, diagnosed at 67 or so, that would mean being in your eighties or more before having to progress to the chemo-based treatments. Even then, many years of high-quality life are in store. In your case, with confined grade 6 and successful surgery, you have a very low probability of ever getting to BR, or even more remotely, a second recurrence. I hope this helps and that it's not inaccurate (I'm sure others will correct me if I've mis-spoken or erred).",

      "Content": "Jeff, I'm in a similar boat to RobLee and just finished my course of adjuvant about two weeks ago. I was completely continent when it started and my PSA was not shooting up. In my case, I elected adjuvant without reference to (before they were taken, in fact) post op PSA results. As you do your research, consider the differences in radiation techniques and technology between when your dad likely had it and now. My RO suggested that the overall increase in bladder cancer risk I'd experience from radiation was about 3-5% over 30 years or so. Seemed to me to be lower than chance of a few laggard pCa cells hanging about causing potential trouble. You're just a couple years older than me, so should have a relatively long-term outlook, too, I'd think. I know that the radiation I received was fairly precisely targeted (not to a specific tumor, but area) and they spent a lot of time trying to avoid/minimize bladder and bowel zapping. (In fact, my insurance decided not to cover the imaging they did each day to ensure proper targeting!) Recover a bit and heal a bit and do some research and talk to an RO or two before making up your mind. Pathology, especially negative margins on the removed tissues, seems a positive. Good Luck!",

      "Content": "FWIW, all of my practitioners, including the surgical URO and RO, tell me that the \"fixing\" of both continence and ED is essentially permanent. I got shown a lot of charts and such that basically said, once the RT starts, you will suffer a slight regression in both capabilities, which will bounce back some. However, after the bounce back (which takes a while), you will still be no higher/better than you were on day one of RT. That is the primary reason for the healing delay between RP and RT. In my case, I pushed the AR back an extra month (so I could finish Dec 29th, the last billing day of the year for my insurance) just to try and get a little better ED response. The RO didn't think it would really matter, but did it 'cause it wouldn't hurt, either. So far, the RO has been right -- but don't tell him, I'm still hoping.... In my case, I've been 100% continent (basically don't even think about it almost all of the time, just have to pucker up when making odd lifts suddenly and getting an almost surprise) for a couple of months -- that was the big hurdle they were tracking. So my RO says after everything, I should end up either 100% continent or virtually so, but may spend some time in pads in the interim.... Hope this helps answer the question. I'll be able to provide first hand evidence/testimony sometime after Nov 1st -- although supposedly doesn't set in immediately. Good Luck!",

I was essentially continent on day one post-catheter and there are signs of erectile function returning (don't know what I'll get before radiation next month) beginning at four months. I think it's possible to have nerve sparing and good results...",

      "Content": "As suggested, MrBaseball, now's the time to do the crash education effort. I'm a little older than you, but still on the younger end of the PCa spectrum. I know when I went to the doctor and had the biopsy and got the results, I was not really expecting to hear cancer. It takes a little time to adjust. I also generally prefer doing something, so I dove into reading the Dr. Patrick Walsh book, this and other online sources, and such to learn about the disease and a lot of the things I was hearing from my Uro and other practitioners. As mentioned above, it would seem likely that given your age, you'll hear recommendations for surgery. My age was a significant factor in me choosing surgery, too. As we'll all say, we are not medical professionals, but I think the partin information is providing some statistics from the \"Partin Tables\", which are statistical nomograms developed by (I believe) the folks at Johns Hopkins. These are basically developed by tracking a large number of patients, inputting biopsy information, age, etc., and clinical outcomes. You can then enter the known facts about your case and out pops the statistical probability of certain outcomes/findings based on the large number of patients they've tracked. It is not tuned to you personally in any way other than using your biopsy data and age, etc. In your case, it seems to indicate that based on the biopsy details and your age, the tables indicate a 25% chance its fully contained within the prostate, 44% chance that it is involved in the extraprostatic tissue (immediate prostate surroundings, like fatty tissue), and just 17% and 14% respectively for seminal vesicles and lymph nodes, respectively. The numbers in parentheses look like the actual percentage ranges. But this is a good question to ask your doc. The partin information is just one of the things you and your medical team will consider in treatment planning. There are other diagnostic things that can also be done, like genomic testing, which also just provide statistical suggestions about likelihoods of different outcomes. All of this is just information to consider. When you meet with your Uro, ask lots of questions and educate yourself about your situation in particular and why he/she's recommending what he/she is. It's also a great idea to take someone (your wife?) to the visit to listen and also ask questions. As the patient, we don't always hear everything the same way someone else would, and the different perspectives can help. Just remember, every person is different and every person's disease is different, so keep learning and you'll be fine. Good luck and keep asking questions.",

      "Content": "Hey Mike, congrats on getting through the surgery and immediate post-op period successfully. I'll second RobLee about the good chances you will have adjuvant radiation at least suggested. It will depend on exactly how they interpret the details of your post-pathology, but as Rob notes, the SVI/T3 staging is one of the indicators for adjuvant followup. The six month window is about right for that discussion. In my case (positive margin made treatment planning as if stage 3), we had the first conversations and initial scheduling about a month after surgery. All of this without reference to a PSA, which wasn't taken until 3 months out. My radiation began in Oct, about six months after April surgery. I waited until I had really good continence. The followup PSA results were used to determine that I did not need HT at this time (because it was low). You are unlikely to get a recommendation for any RT before you've done some healing and gotten your continence back. So take the next six months and just get healed. Good Luck from a fellow Texan -- you'll be going back just after the folk festival, so enjoy it!",
