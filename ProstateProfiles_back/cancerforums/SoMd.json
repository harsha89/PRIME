      "Content": "Chuck: that is exactly what the doctor told my husband; by \"roto-rooting\" the prostate, the catheter can be eliminated. That's all my husband heard and he was sold! But I'm concerned for all the reasons brought up by Newport and Reinardo. Newporter: I agree, why not a prostatectomy? When I asked I was told there is no point, because \"the horses are already out of the barn\". I just don't understand that rationale. If you have a malignant cancerous mass, it will continue to grow/spread unless you cut it out or kill it, right? So why leave it in? I intend to ask again and hopefully will get a better answer this time. Reinardo: Thank you! What you are saying is totally logical to me! If the prostate stays in and a Tur-p is done now, what's to stop the prostate from growing and blocking the urethra again? I plan on having my husband ask just that question. So the doctor told us that hormone therapy will shrink the prostrate. But from what I've read, hormone therapy doesn't work forever. The doctor also said that while he is performing the TURP, he can take out the testicles at the same time. Apparently, if the testicles are removed it will eliminate the need for the hormone shots but he will still have to take the pills. I am looking for our second opinion consultation to clear this part up. I know my husband wants the catheter out. The problem I have is they want to do the Turp right away; no time for a second opinion. I guess I would prefer if we got the second opinion first but my husband was sold as soon as soon as they said no catheter. Under the circumstances, how can I say/suggest that he wait for another opinion? I wonder, would there be any harm in letting him go ahead with ONE TURP and then getting the second opinion? Reinardo: how difficult was the TURp? How was your recovery? Thank you all for your input; it is very helpful and very much appreciated.",

      "Content": "Hi: I'm going to start with our information and hopefully my husband will join in. My has been diagnosed with prostate cancer. His problems actually started late last year when he had to get up multiple times during the night to urinate but he didn't recognize this as something to be concerned about. He thought it was old age (62) and too much beer. In October 2012 his PSA was 2.7. No test in 2013. When his bladder problem got worse in January 2014 he went to the doctor and they gave him antibiotics because his regular doctor was out of town. When he finally went to see his regular doctor, blood work was done including PSA. The PSA came back at 44. Within a week he could no longer urinate and I took him to the hospital and they inserted a catheter. From day 1 I had him use Neosporin + Pain Relief. It has bacitracin ointment and a pain reliever and he says it definitely works; allowing him to sleep. He says it also helps during the day when he gets uncomfortable. We got the biopsy results Monday (yesterday); not good. Right side has a Gleason score of 8 (4+4) involving 100% in all 7 and one was 80%. However the entire left side is benign. The CT scan and the bone scan done right after the biopsy also delivered bad news; skeletal metastases. He was in an auto accident years ago and it appears that the cancer settled where he has weakened and broken bones. We are now waiting for an appointment time to see an oncologist from John Hopkins. We had initially met with a urologist surgeon who said prostate surgery is off the table. Not sure why since I see others have had it done. Wonder why some do and others don't. Will make sure I ask. More to follow later. Thanks for the site. I didn't know about the book, intend to buy it tomorrow.",

      "Content": "Hi everyone: Thanks for your kind words. Its been a fast three and a half weeks, give or take some days. Trying to schedule an appointment with an oncologist. Will find out tomorrow if he can get in next week. If not, next opening will be in three weeks . Seems like a long time to have to wait.... So I got a call from the nurse today. She said that the surgeon (urologist) we saw Monday wants to schedule a \"TURP\" for next week. For those that don't know, I'm told and read that a Turp is a procedure where they clean out or cut out enough prostate to open the urethra so that my husband will be able to get rid of the catheter. He hates the catheter so much. But here is where I get confused; why would they perform the Turp and yet they said that they won't remove the prostate? Why not remove the cancerous part of the prostate (since only one side is malignant); or why not remove the entire prostate? I'm just not clear on the thought process of leaving the prostate in, and neither is my husband. Looks like we still have a lot of questions unanswered So I do have a funny story from today. The nurse called this morning and said \"your husband called yesterday. He left a message asking if he could start taking aspirin again (after the biopsy). Would you tell him he can go ahead?\" Then she said: He also wanted to know if he can drink beer\". I laughed and told her that she was too late. She said what do you mean? I said: He called you yesterday - He drank the beers yesterday! Oh, husband also started taking casodex, a non-steroidal androgen receptor inhibitor today. I wish for the cure so that nobody has to go through this. For now, we will take it one day at a time. Thanks for listening",
