      "Content": "Hi folks, (First time post) I don't know what to think of PSA screening. Im only 36 and my doctor accidentally checked the PSA box on my blood work and it came back 3.3. He said don't worry take the test again in about a month 'it's an infection'. So he gave me a slip for another PSA test and a Free PSA test because the free PSA 'would give him a closer look'. I went home and was mortified when I read it was a cancer test and I might have cancer. I spent 4 weeks very sick, crying, just utterly terrified. It was the worst month in my life. I took the next PSA test and its came back 2.8. I was too upset to ask about the free PSA but I was looking at his laptop and it looks like it was .22 (im guessing 22%). He told me the PSA is still a bit elevated for my age - and it is coming down on its own (he didn't prescribe antibiotics or anything he said my body will fight the infection). The only symptoms ive had is one or twice over the past couple years i've had to use the washroom a couple to 3 times at night - usually passing after a week. The odd time when i have bad anxiety a slight sting when I urinate (again usually passing after a week). My Doctor seemed more concerned with my anxiety. He recommended no more PSA tests til im 40. He said he feels 'prostatitis' is the cause. I dont know what to think. Is my doctor's reasoning sound?? Is 3.3 to 2.8 really falling? So many questions? Thanks",

      "Content": "Thanks for the comments. I have calmed down after meeting with the doctor after the second PSA test. It was the time in between the first and second that was horribly worrisome. My doctor told me cancer is pretty rare in a man my age while prostratis (prostate infection) is fairly common. He also mentioned that if it was something more serious like cancer my PSA likely would not have fallen over the month. In terms of preparing for the PSA test for the first one I didn't even know I was having it (apparently neither did my doctor) - but I didn't cycle a few days before cause we were in a rainy spell as for sex I don't recall if I had any 48 hours before I don't think so (but possibly). For the second test again I didn't cycle for a few days (cause I read it could influence the result) and no sex for 24 hours before. The only thing that worried me about the second test is due to stress I had a huge bowel movement like 30 minutes before going for the blood work and heard this could elevate the reading (but doesn't look like it did). From here I am just going to take some time to weigh my options. I think though it is very important for doctors to discuss the repercussions of this test with patients before checking the box. This is a test that is very useful and helpful for some people no question. It is also a test that can be quite dangerous and can cause harm in patients - it is not for everyone one. I guess my point it a patient should have the option to make an informed choice whether to have this test done or not - just have a doctor check it off. Thanks again for all your input I am feeling a bit better about the results now.",
