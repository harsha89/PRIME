      "Content": "... continuing a previous post ... Conventional urologists and oncologists may be reluctant to prescribe androgen blockers for this purpose. But the medications can be obtained without a prescription from an Indian Internet pharmacy, www.internationaldrugmart.com; I have used their Cytomid brand of flutamide; it works fine. IDM also supplies bicalutamide (Calutide) without a script. Somewhat off-topic, but valuable information for newbies: you would be well advised to spend time at www.yananow.org, an extraordinary website dedicated to prostate cancer education. Also, two prostate cancer specialists deserve special mention. Dr. Charles \"Snuffy\" Myers of Charlottesville, Virginia, has an encyclopedic knowledge of prostate cancer, and is himself a survivor; he has a website and an excellent video blog. Dr. Stephen Scionti is an associate professor of urology at NYU, and has performed 1000 HIFU procedures; he too has a website and a sterling reputation, and is readily approachable. Disclaimer: My MD degree is from the University of Michigan (1960), and I have had a life-long interest in cancer research. But I have never practiced medicine, nor have I been active in cancer research. I am neither qualified, nor licensed, to provide medical advice; and it is not the intention of this posting to provide medical advice to anyone. I am simply stating my modest credentials, and I am reporting my limited but nevertheless very significant experience-- because it may have great potential value for newly diagnosed prostate cancer patients. What you do with this information, if anything, is entirely your responsibility. Prostate cancer is a multi-faceted disease. Please understand that what has worked well for me may not work as well for someone else. There are some undesirable side effects of long-term androgen blockade. An Internet search will provide that information. Most of these side effects are not relevant for the short-term use that we are considering here. Nevertheless, check them out. A formal clinical trial is imperative. But that will never happen until a significant amount of informal and anecdotal evidence exists so that the truth can no longer be ignored. All medical advances start somewhere, often in unexpected and unconventional ways. This may be the start of a very significant medical advance. Time will tell. I am looking forward to the day when immediate and temporary androgen blockade will be standard initial therapy for many newly diagnosed patients with prostate cancer--to buy them time and to give them hope--as it has done for me. Once more: Gleason 8, five years post-diagnosis, untreated except for aggressive androgen blockade, current PSA 0.215. The facts speak for themselves. I have been very fortunate. I wish you well.

      "Content": "Many definitive therapies are available for prostate cancer: several types of surgery, several types of radiation therapy, several types of hormone therapy, and the new 'gold standard' for organ-confined disease: high intensity focused ultrasound. The newly diagnosed prostate cancer patient is stunned by his diagnosis; he is also overwhelmed by having to choose among these many therapies, often while being 'pressured' to limit his choice to conventional surgery versus conventional radiation. This message is intended to broaden his perspectives, and perhaps buy him some time and provide him some peace of mind. I am an 80 year old nonpracticing MD with a Gleason 8 prostate cancer diagnosed in 2008--and untreated except for aggressive androgen blockade. I should be dead. But I have never had any symptoms of prostate cancer, and my current PSA is a trivial 0.215. Let me repeat: Gleason 8, five years post-diagnosis, untreated except for androgen blockade, PSA is 0.215. I trust that I have your attention. Something very significant has been going on here. I want to share this information with you. Here is a synopsis of my relevant history: Jan 2008: PSA 11 (this was the first sign of serious trouble). Mar 2008: Prostate biopsy; positive DRE on the right side; 2 of 10 biopsy cores positive; Gleason 4 + 4 = 8. Apr 2008: Pelvic and abdominal CAT scans and whole body bone scan all negative for gross metastases. There followed several months of research on the Internet-- and worrying--about what to do. Unfortunately, there is a lot of misinformation floating around about prostate cancer, including outright nonsense from several 'official sources'; separating the truth from the fiction was a challenge. My tumor was apparently confined to the prostate gland, and so I decided on HIFU--high intensity focused ultrasound. HIFU has been in routine use all around the world for many years; most reports indicate that it has fewer deleterious side effects--i.e., incontinence and erectile dysfunction-- than conventional surgery and radiation; but HIFU has not yet been approved by the US FDA for domestic use as a primary therapy; patients have to go offshore to get it; most insurances do not cover it; and the usual cost is US$25,000--out of pocket. This was beyond my means. Feb 2009: PSA 13.9 Feb-Mar 2009: Three week protocol of the androgen blocker, flutamide, 250 mg. three times a day, prescribed by Ron Wheeler, MD, a urologist in Sarasota, FL. Mar 2009: PSA 2.6 Note this well: three weeks of the flutamide androgen blocker collapsed the PSA of this lethal Gleason 8 from 13.9 to 2.6. I am not a patient of Dr. Wheeler. I have never been examined by him, nor have I talked with him on the telephone; we have, however, exchanged emails. Since 2009, I have managed this monster myself. But Dr. Wheeler has repeatedly said that most newly diagnosed prostate cancer patients should be started immediately on an androgen blocker--to pull the legs out from under the PSA, to buy some time, and to provide some hope. Dr. Wheeler did all of that, and more, for me: He saved my life. This flutamide induced 'remission' lasted for over two years, during which the PSA fluctuated between 4 and 8. Subsequently, several more courses of flutamide were necessary when the PSA rose above 8. Beginning late in 2011, discontinuing the flutamide allowed the PSA to soar; the PSA doubling time was only two weeks, a grim reminder that my adversary is a very malignant Gleason 8. But these brief PSA excursions above 10 were immediately knocked back down to low single digits by additional courses of flutamide. The tumor is slowly 'learning' to cope with the androgen blocker; fortunately, it has not yet learned enough to be fully successful. Beginning in April of 2012, however, it became necessary to take the flutamide continuously. For the past year, the PSA has been less than 0.5; and for the last nine months, even though the dose of flutamide has been cut in half (to save money), the PSA has averaged 0.2. My case may be atypical; my tumor cell type may be unusually sensitive to the androgen blocker; but this is not a fluke; multiple tests have confirmed these results. Again, something very significant has been going on here. I have been doing the flutamide thing for over four years now. I have also been taking 0.5 mg. of dutasteride (Avodart) daily. This long course has not been intentional; it has been due to the financial constraints which have delayed my definitive therapy with HIFU. But it has, inadvertently, demonstrated the long-term efficacy of this androgen blockade protocol. Patients who may want to try androgen blockade would use it for only a short time--until they are comfortable with their decision about definitive therapy. Presumably, however, they could make this decision free from stress, being reasonably confident that a temporary delay in definitive treatment while they are considering their options would not endanger their lives. No longer would they be bulldozed into making a hasty decision between surgery and radiation that they might later regret. The cost: c. $100 for a three-week supply of the androgen blocker, and c. $100 for two (before and after) PSA tests. In my case, this $200 bought me a two year 'remission' from a lethal Gleason 8--surely, this was the best bargain of my life. The two most often prescribed androgen blockers are flutamide (brand name Eulexin) and bicalutamide (brand name Casodex). Flutamide is rapidly metabolized by the body, and so it must be administered three times a day; bicalutamide is administered once a day; but bicalutamide is more expensive than flutamide. Most references indicate that bicalutamide is pharmacologically superior to flutamide; but I have been riding a winner with the flutamide, and I have been reluctant to switch horses in the middle of this race. However, a medical professional friend of mine was on bicalutamide for several years; he had HIFU in 2009; he is now doing very well--and apparently is cured. To the best of my knowledge, this androgen blocker protocol has not been documented in the professional medical journals. Therefore, conventional urologists and oncologists may know nothing about it; they may even have a negative reaction to it. In any event, this protocol involves an 'off-label' use of these medications--which are usually administered as part of a palliative regimen for advanced cases of metastatic disease. Let this be crystal clear: We are not talking about conventional hormone therapy for advanced metastatic disease. We are talking about something entirely different: an unconventional, immediate, 'front line', and temporary therapy for newly diagnosed patients who do not have advanced disease--a therapy which may buy them some time to consider carefully their options for definitive treatment, and which may also provide them some peace of mind.

      "Content": "Androgen blockade buys time. In my case, four years. My experience has been extraordinary, and I want to share it with you. Early in 2008, a routine PSA was 11. A positive DRE and two positive biopsy cores led to the diagnosis of a Gleason 4 + 4 = 8. Pelvic CT scan and whole body bone scan were negative for gross metastases. The highest PSA, in the fall of 2008, was 14. I decided on HIFU for primary therapy. HIFU has been in routine use all around the world for several years, and appears to be the new 'gold standard' for organ confined disease. But the FDA has not 'approved' HIFU for primary therapy of PCa in the US. Few, if any, insurances cover it. The usual cost is US$25,000, out of pocket. This has been beyond my means. But early in 2009 I had the good fortune to contact an unorthodox urologist who put me on the androgen blocker, Flutamide, 250 mg. three times a day. Within three weeks, my PSA fell from over 13 to under 3. With some help from 0.5 mg. of Avodart daily, this 'Flutamide remission' (PSAs between 4 and 7) lasted two and a half years. During this entire time, the PSA has remained in single digits. For the last nine months, the PSA has been less than 1; the two most recent PSAs, in November and January, were 0.197 and 0.205. But now the (Avodart and) Flutamide (dosage reduced to 125 mg. three times a day) must be continuous, or the PSA starts to rise. The urologist who wrote the original prescription for Flutamide has said that any oncologist or urologist who does not put every newly diagnosed prostate cancer patient on androgen blockade with Flutamide or Casodex--to buy time--is guilty of malpractice. In my distant past there is an MD degree, but I have never practiced medicine. Nevertheless, at age 79, I am familiar with the oncology, biochemistry, and pharmacology of this disease, and I understand why androgen blockade has been so effective.
