      "Content": "Onefin - As Chuck mentioned above PNI is cancerous invasion of the nerves INSIDE THE PROSTATE... It just means that as the tumor grew within the prostate it also grew into the nerve tissue that is in there. Almost everyone has PNI. Another \"scary\" term some people have is \"High Grade PIN\" which sends men and their spouses into a tailspin, \"OMG I have High Grade PIN\"... but it really does not affect the outcome. What's more, your only grade 4 component was secondary and probably small in volume. Grade 4 is the kind of cancer that can escape the prostate and spread. As some background, the prostate is full of nerve tissue but with very little blood supply. That's why the first line of attack is rarely if ever chemo, because the chemo would not reach the tumor. Furthermore your tumors were in the lateral lobes, not near the base which might involve the bladder, and not near the apex, where positive margins are more likely to occur. Also your lymph nodes were all negative, which is no guarantee, but is definitely to your benefit. All in all I would say, DON'T WORRY. Most likely this was nipped in the bud. Many guys would trade anything to have a pathology report like yours. Enjoy your freedom. And congratulations on having excellent continence so far![/QUOTE]",

      "Content": "Thanks man, I appreciate it. I did speak to my surgeon today and he said verbatim what you said. In fact he laughed and said, dude, I said cured and I don't take that lightly....... He was also not believing that my continence so far was as good as it was...... I literally do not have a single drop coming out and have urinated normally for 2 days now. God is great! Now all we have to do is get Mr. Happy moving and grooving and I will be one happy camper! I hope yours is going as well!",

      "Content": "Hey all- I am a 52 y/o WM 8 days post op RALP at Hackensack Medical Center in NJ with Dr.Michael Esposito. Fantastic surgeon, great bedside manner and I couldn't be happier with where I'm at in recovery which is currently exceeding my expectations. Catheter came out today, urinated 4x, no drips, no leaks and dry as a bone so far. As a newbie, I have a question. My surgeon told me today, Congrats, you are cured but in reading my pathology report, I felt like the blood got drained out of me on the way home- Would like to hear some thoughts. Here are my results and my story with question to follow 7-15 PSA 2.1 7-16 PSA 2.5 8-17 PSA 4.1 Biopsy showed 6 of 12 cores positive 5/ 3+3 1 3+4 with most of the cancer in the right lateral lobe, 1 small amount in left lobe but still bi-lateral Surgery on 9-18 at Hackensack University Medical Center. Told my wife and myself \"textbook perfect operation. Everything looked totally clean\" Both nerves spared and Amniox used. Pathology report as follows; 1. Right Pelvic Lymph nodes- 6 lymph nodes negative for metastatic tumor 2. Left Pelvic Lymph nodes- 3 lymph nodes negative for metastatic tumor 3. Prostatic Adenocarcinoma Gleason Score 3+4=7 (Grade group 2) 4. Tumor involved the right anterior and posterior and left anterior quadrants of the prostate.

My doc says, \"most of the prostates we send for pathology show it and there is no prognostic significance. You do not need radiation. Stop worrying, you're clean! Spoke to another friend of mine who is a doc and he said pretty much the same thing. My question is how the hell is perineural invasion present and i'm \"clean\".....Good news is it wasn't anywhere else.

      "Content": "You guys rock- thank you for the quick and thoughtful replies! I did some reading after I posted and most of what you said seems to ring through. The perineural invasion if a pathologist just looks for it is present on almost every post surgical examination of the cancerous prostate. for those who have not yet gone there are RALP-I would like to offer some advice as well. First, I would absolutely spend whatever time I had between DX and your surgery practicing mastering and doing your Kegal exercises! I did mine for approximately five weeks and I'm happy to report that my catheter came out two days ago and I have not had so much as a drip or a leak-second night with the padded underwear and dry. Normal urination during the day although still a bit sore . Secondly, walk walk walk and walk some more as soon as you can when you get out of the operating room. They told me all of these horror stories about gas pain and post surgical bowel movements. I got up 15 minutes after they got me back to my room and literally walked for almost an hour through the halls of the hospital and pretty much didn't stop at most of the day. Passed gas and had a bowel movement that evening and felt great. when I got home on day two I walked a mile and a half that day and the subsequent three days walked 3-4 and 5 miles respectively. Not even a trickle of blood in my urine and did not need anything beyond a Tylenol after day two. I am absolutely convinced that the better shape you go in to surgery-the better and quicker your recovery. I myself am a bit of a workout freak and know that there is no way I would feel this well if I didn't . good luck and God bless to all!",
