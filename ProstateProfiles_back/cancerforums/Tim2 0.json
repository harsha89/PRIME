      "Content": "Hello everyone. I am new to the forum and want to introduce myself. I went for a normal annual physical and was healthy except for slightly elevate PSA levels (4.8, I am 51). Took two more tests (3.8 and 4.6) and was referred to a urologist. I has a biopsy last week Thursday and got the news yesterday that they found cancer in one of the twelve cores taken (3 + 3 = 6). I meet with the urologist again on the 31st to discuss options. What do I need to know between now and then? There is a lot of info out there and it is hard to know where to start. Cheers, Tim",

When I was told that there would be blood in my urine and semen I was expecting normal looking semen with little bits of blood. Instead I have red semen. I was not expecting that. It looks like I am ejaculating blood. Is this normal? It's fine for now because it seems rather Christmas-y but how long does this last?",
