      "Content": "I was dx with prostate cancer back when I was 40. I am now 55 years of age. My cancer was advanced and I required a shot of estrogen to stop the cancer and then external beam radiation since the cancer was not confined to just the prostate. I then had high dose radiation. Since that time I have had very low PSA level. 0.8 in 2005, 1.2 in 2007 (with older testing), PSA, total 0.11 in 2014. I also have Multiple Sclerosis and was diagnosed in 1990. I was already fighting fatigue and after the treatments for cancer, I was drained, I had to force my sex life, I had ED problems, I was losing hair, etc... I had a penile implant a few years ago but even though it worked great, I was still forcing sex because my drive was just gone. Some could have been from depression also since during that same time I had to have a hip replacement and a hernia operation. I kind of felt my body was falling apart. My wife left me and ran off with some kid. I think she was tired of very little sex and also I think she was afraid of the cancer coming back. I also had two soldiers show up at my door and tell me that my son had been killed. It was a lot of stress and border on being too much to handle. After my ED surgery, I told my urologist that did the implant that I had no sex drive. He looked at my testosterone levels and said they were low. He recommended I take testosterone. I started on the GELs, but quickly advanced to the shots (so much better and cheaper!). My testosterone is varies between 800 and 1117 (later only if I take the blood test too soon after the shot). My sex drive is not what it use to be which isn't necessarily a bad thing, but it is better. I seem to have more energy and less depressed. Overall it seems to help a lot. My question is this. I have had a couple of doctors totally freak out that I had prostate cancer (let alone really advanced) and that I am on testosterone. I do closely monitor my PSA and so far I seem to have stayed in remission. The other day one of my doctors told me he has a very serious problem with me taking testosterone. He did admit he does not like them period anyhow. He made it very clear that he felt I was doing something extremely dangerous because of the cancer. He was not the first doctor to freak out over it. I had another doctor that questioned me about it while I was in France. I went to him to get the injection and he felt very uncomfortable doing it since I had cancer. I explained my PSA levels were very low and that we were monitoring it closely, so he did the injections (I was there for 3 months). Anyone know of a prostate cancer patient taking testosterone after the cancer? I love the testosterone. I would really hate to give it up. For the first time in ages, I feel a little more normal, like the old me.",

      "Content": "Thanks all for your input. I have been on T for two years now. My Primary and my urologist are very comfortable with me being on T. It's just a couple of doctors that told me they would never recommend it. My pulmonary dr made it clear the other day, he wants nothing to do with that and it concerned him highly. I just wanted to get feedback from others and now I have. T has really helped me. I wish I had tried it prior to my implant, but it's done and I'm pleased with it. I will keep checking for more feedback. Thanks.",

      "Content": "I was told there isn't very much information on higher PSA levels with younger men so you can't compare to those at a more mature age. I was dx at age 40. The doctor did not even want to test me. I had to argue and it was just because my dad was just diagnosed and a friend that I asked. I just felt the need to be tested, I had a feeling and that was all. He finally told me if I wanted to waste my money he would test me. When the results came back, he called and apologized and said I needed to see a urologist ASAP, that my PSA levels were elevated. It was over 8 if I remember right. I was moving to Southern Utah from Texas the next day. When I got to Utah I met with a urologist. They set up a biopsy and almost all samples came back a 100% tumors. All along the way each specialist would tell me that there was not a lot of data with prostate cancer at my age. I took this to mean that young men that have raised PSA is more alarming than someone older with the same level. At least that is what I understood. Mine was already advanced and was not contained to the prostate. I am glad that it seems they are testing at a younger age. My doctor said if I had waited, it would have killed me by \"normal\" testing age.",
