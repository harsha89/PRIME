    "Content": "I think something to really think about at this point is the quality of life. If Chemo is not going to cure him, then why do it? Many doctors would turn it down at this stage. You have to ask yourself how will the chemo effect him at this stage. He will have to deal with many side effects, and I feel like when people are at a later stage of cancer, they deteriorate a lot faster with the chemo. If in the end the outcome is the same, then maybe you are better of having more good days vs. bad chemo days. Towards the end, he will need hospice and pain pills to control the pain. Personally if that was my relative, I would turn down the chemo and I would say \"Lets enjoy the time we have\" I've talked and read on many forums, that many of times people wished they had taken this route instead. No one can really tell you about the life expectancy because everyone is different and really none of us know when we will die. Once the doctors tell you that he is a candidate for hospice, you clearly know he may have 6 months or less. Sometimes some people live way longer, but that usually is not the norm. Towards the end, the cancer will spread like wild fire inside his body. Sometimes people do not die of the cancer but rather other complications for the cancer. For example blot clots, etc. etc. The chemo rounds will depend on how he does with the last round he does. But again, why at this stage keep doing the chemo? That is the question for him.",
