      "Content": "So i am absolutely terrified that i have prostate cancer. I'm 20 years old and male obviously. For the past few months i have been having painful ejaculation. It's a sharp burning pain inside of my body (behind my penis) that feels like it's coming from my prostate. I remember it happening a few months ago and not paying much attention to it, then i stopped masterbating for a while and started again last week and had that bad pain.. and it scared me. I've masterbated 3 times this week and had the pain every single time. There is no blood in my semen.. and the pain stops as soon as i finish. I don't have a STRONG urine flow, but it's not weak either.. it's medium strength i would say. It's not painful to pee.. and i can stop my urine flow if i want to. I wouldn't say that i have frequent urination, but i peed before i went to bed and after 10 minutes of laying in bed.. i had to pee again. That doesn't really happen often.. but i remember it happening before. Sometimes i have a mild ache in my testicles.. and a sharp pain that lasts for a few seconds right above my groin.. above my penis but below my stomach.. right at my waist line. I'm absolutely terrified that i have prostate cancer. I want to go to the doctor but i am so afraid of what he will say. I'm scared that i am dying.. and have a fear that if i do have it, it's spread. I also live with my mom and it's going to be sooooooo incredibly uncomfortable & awkward to go to the doctor and tell her i have painful ejaculation.. i feel like crawling under a table just thinking about it. What does this sound like to you? |",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by PDV I bet you have epididymitis. I used to get it occasionally when I was a young man and those sound like the symptoms. I used to get it if I didn't have sex for a long time. In my 30s, that would be more than a couple of days. If you push hard on your epididymis (its a tube leading to your testicles in your scrotum) it will hurt. A urologist can diagnose it in minutes and will prescribe an antibiotic (I believe my doc gave me Cipro) that will get rid of it in a couple of days. Don' worry. There is no way you have prostate cancer. Wow, i forgot to mention that one of the symptoms i was having was pain to the touch in my right testicle. When i put pressure on the bottom tube, it's really painful and the pain goes away when i stop squeezing it. It's kind of a really sharp pain. But i have had that for months... could it be chronic epididymitis? And can it cause painful ejaculation?",
