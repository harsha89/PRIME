      "Content": "I spent 3 days there recently. They did tests and diagnostics for my advanced cancer. They have good qualified dr's with a integrative approach as well. Treating symptoms, mind body and spirit. You don't feel like your in a hospital. They did accept my insurance and a lot services are free such as accupucture.rekei, etc. Just a different atmosphere, the personnel are upbeat and positive as I am sure they are trained to do this. Let me know if you have any other specific questions, Warm regards",

Conspiracy theories (\"What the cancer industry doesn't want you to know!!\") pop up everywhere but there is no place for them on this website. When people become desperate there is a tendency to grasp at straws but it serves no useful purpose and is detrimental to those who seek reliable answers via proven scientific modalities. By no means would I attempt to authenticate any of these theories. I am new to any cancer forum and was simply reaching out to people that might have investigated alternatives. I need empirical evidence as well. But I am 54 and have advanced stage 4 mcrpc past with more mets shown and psa quadrupled after chemo in 6 weeks. I WILL THINK OUTSIDE OF THE BOX. I have been given a very poor prognosis by Mayo and I want like many to add months and god willing years. I apologize for bringing this hot topic and if I do seek remedies else and are successful you will be the first one I will inform. Maybe you call this desperate and grasping at straws. I call it trying to keep hope and there just might be other answers.",

Good luck. e Thanks for the kind words. Actually I really didn't have any intention to promote any of this alt therapies or that it works etc.. It was just a random question. I do not want to be singled out as maybe it should be on a seperate topic. Believe me a numerous amount of people are seeking other ideas and hopefully are intelligent enough to draw their own conclusions. If people watched the 60 minute special last night they are actually using polio vaccine to treat a rare form of brain cancer and looking to treat other cancers. also there was a hbo special a month ago on similar topic. fda has approved in phase 1. MD anderson is testing a hyperthermia treatment in trials which is not conventional. I will not bring this up again and I thank you and all for assistance. Best, Kenny",

      "Content": "I agree Steve. Taxotere did bring my psa down through the six cycles. I think I am going for an immunotherapy trial at u of c. They need to test tissue from prostate to see if I have tumor marker Which is needed to qualify. Have you looked into xofigo injections. I did this for mets. Radioactive isotope injections Let's keep up the fight. Best ken",

      "Content": "Oh thanks Allen, I will be more descriptive and detailed: I started my chemo in october of 2014 and there were 6 cycles of taxotere administered to me 3 weeks apart. So the duration was a total of 18 weeks. Taxotere is infused and prednisone is taken orally night before and day of chemo. I finished in january and as mentioned above my psa dropped dramatically. I took psa test 5 weeks later and it climbed to 40 and approximately 1 week ago it was 60. I really never had a leveling out of psa but they say drug can work for many by stabilizing psa for up to 2 years. Just did not happen for me which seems to be the trend for me. The drug fortunately did not give me any real side effects. The prednisone kept me wired and up at night but no biggie. It did make me feel better because if it works it shuts down the cancer and in my case the bone mets subsided giving me more mobility. Hope this helps, Ken",
