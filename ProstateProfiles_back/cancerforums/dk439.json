      "Content": "Hi. I have never done a forum. Sorry for any mistakes. I just turned 50 years old. I had 13 cores. 2 were positive (both on right side). 3+3 and 3+4. So my doc says I am a Gleason 7. T2A. PSA 5.17. I am trying to decide between brachy plus external radiation or divinchy prostatectomy. Doc is surgeon so recommends surgery (but I am fearful of possible urinary and sexual side effects). Doc is not pushy and will be supportive of my choice. My fear of of the brachy/radiation choice is it seems there is less data regarding long term recurrence. After entering all my numbers at the Sloan Kettering recurrence probability site prostatectomy gave a 93% nonrecurrence rate for up to 10 to 15 years. Brachy/external beam radiation could only project out 5 years for a 89% nonrecurrence rate. Is this because there is not enough longevity studies with brachy? I know I am steeped in numbers in order to cope with the emotions and anxiety. On one hand I want someone to tell me what to do and on the other hand don't want anyone to tell me what to do. I have had surgeries before but I have never experienced the dread and reluctance before as I am with regard to having my prostate removed. Thanks for listening.",

      "Content": "Thanks guys. Good luck Pratoman! Sending good thoughts. I realize I have more questions I need to ask the doc. Reviewing my pathology report the 3+4 is up 3 mm in gretaest deminsion and occupies 14% surface area of core and shows perineural invasion. The second 3+3 is less than 5%. I will also find out how many Davincis my doc has done. Appreciate your posts very much.",
