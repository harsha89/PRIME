      "Content": "You are excatly right. Chemotherapy (Taxotere/Prednisone Combination) gave my father an additioanl 2 or 3 months. But at a very high cost. His quality of life was pretty much gone, in and out of the hospital due to low white blood count, pneumonia, blood clots, etc. My father told me if he had the choice again he would decide against Chemotherapy for the extra few month. But it might be different with someone else. Just dont give up hope. There is always some hope. Doctors are not gods and I think sometimes they are just guessing how long someone has left on this earth. Good luck.",

      "Content": "Dont give up hope. My father has been fighting prostate cancer for the last 16 plus years. It became hormone ref. about 2 years ago and the cancer metastized into his liver and other places. Still he was determined to fight. The only things he could receive at that point was Chemotherapy with weak results. Initially Taxotere shrunk the tumors but only temporarily. His side effects were terrible. My father is in his last stage of cancer now and doctors said he will not have much time left. a few days or weeks maybe. He is very weak, cant get out of bed, but he fought all the way to the end. The doctors are amazed that he survived 16 years. He is only 67. Always stay positive and keep fighting. Good luck.",
