      "Content": "Hello We i was diagnosed with Prostate cancer in February this year which obviously was a shock with a Gleason score 3+3=6 I considered my options of treatment, and was advised that as i am only 43 years old and had a low PSA of 1.4 that the best option is to treat it as aggressively as possible by the two opinions i received from different doctor. So i have opted for the robot assisted nerve sparing surgery to have it all removed. I must admit i am so scared not so much about the surgery itself but the possible news after they perform the biopsy on my prostate when it has been removed and if it has actually spread anywhere or will this just be the end of it. I know it is just the luck of the draw really even though the surgeons are positive that it has been caught at the early stage of the cancer and they are sure they can completely get rid of it. But reading different forums and care providers posts i get mixed messages about what to expect and if it will actually be successful of not. I appreciate everyone is unique and no one can answer 100% of what is definitely going to happen as the outcome. I just don't know what to think and i am finding i am getting really angry at random things for no reason, especially things that would never normally affect me. Just the way people even speak to me can make me angry especially my wife. She is so good to me and i love her so much but i feel these emotions are actually starting to come between us and that is even before the surgery has taken place. I know this whole thing is effecting her as well, and i should be more sympathetic but it is so hard sometime to keep a straight rational thought on things. Sorry i know i am just probably pitying myself but i am hoping that i can get some comments or feedback to help me to deal with everything. Thank you for listening, i am sure i will be posting more details as time goes on. Paul",
