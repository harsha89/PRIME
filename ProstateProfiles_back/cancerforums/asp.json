      "Content": "This is my first time posting. Appreciate any advice and here's my story: In my first full body checkup at about age 22 for employment fitness purpose, the PSA reads about 3. The Dr did not mention any thing and i was not aware of it too. Sometime at age 25, my PSA grew again and I was asked to go to the Urology Dept to be handled by the Dr there. I do not remember the figure but over the time, I had numerous PSA test and it continously grow, roughly increases by 1 to 2 every year. Dr. gave me ciprofloxaxin and PSA reduced very very slightly. About two years ago, I had biopsy while the PSA was about 7 and test was negative. I also had DRE before the biopsy and Dr. said there is no abnormalies. I did another PSA test in Dec 2009 and it reads 9.8. Dr. said just monitor it and take the test this July 2010 again. I don't have burning feeling while urinating and my sexual life is active and normal. Greatly appreciate if anyone can offer some advices.",

      "Content": "Thanks skippy. I'm actually in Brunei (South East Asia), and a Bruneian. There is only one big Govt hospital here and that's the one I go to. There is another private hospital, I will check it out soon, hopefully there is a good urologist there. The Dr consistently tells me not to worry because it could be my normal baseline to vary in that range. However I doubt he is right, since my PSA consistently rises. I will go for a checkup soon. Thx!",
