      "Content": "I would greatly appreciate hearing about your experience with CyberKnife vs robotic surgery. I would like to go with CyberKnife but can't find much information about its long term curative rate, side effects and toxicity. I am 67, have a PSA of 5.58, clear bone and CT scans, an MRI showing four \"suspected tumors\" ranging from .4 to 1.3 cm with two of them in broad capsular contact but with no bulging, Gleason scores of three 6's and one 7 (3+4) and my father had pc. Have any of you used CyberKnife? Or is robotic surgery the way to go? If I do that procedure, my surgeon is one of the very best. What is your evaluation of CyberKnife? Thanks for sharing any of your experience or advice?",
