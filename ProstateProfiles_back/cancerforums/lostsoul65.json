      "Content": "I was suppose to get a prostate biopsy today but after waiting 1 hour and 15 minutes past my appointment and sitting on the table in the nude for about 25 minutes I re-schedule and went home. I suffer from depression and anxiety and I was at the point of having a nervous breakdown and god know what would of happen if they would of caught me coming out after 75 minutes. Anyway my question is there another test to see if you have prostate cancer except a test that makes you pass blood for weeks. After studying about a prostate biopsy I felt like I was back in the 1900's?",
