      "Content": "I have been taking a Calcium and Vitamin-D tablet twice a day since starting hormone therapy (as instructed by my oncologist). I just had a bone density scan about a week ago but have not received the results yet. I am 64. I did not have a radical prostatectomy. When I was diagnosed in July 2012 the cancer had spread from the prostate to my bladder and pelvic lymph nodes and was therefore considered inoperable. When I first started on hormone therapy, my medical oncologist said I would be on it for the rest of my life. However I saw him a couple of weeks ago and he now says that if my PSA stays undetectable until the August/September 2014 timeframe (two years after starting hormone therapy), then he will take me off it (and thus stop all treatment for the prostate cancer). I would certainly welcome losing all the side effects of hormone therapy, though at the same time it would feel a little scary to not be receiving any treatment... If you do start hormone therapy, I hope it works as well for you as it has for me (helped in my case by radiation therapy back at the end of 2012). I do think one of the best things you can do on hormone therapy is to stay as physically active as possible. That helps fight many of the major side effects, including the bone loss, muscle loss, fat gain and fatigue. Best of luck to you! Steve",

      "Content": "This is similar to what I did. I started on Casodex roughly a few weeks before my first Lupron shot. As I understand it this is normal because the Lupron can cause a brief spike or increase in your testosterone when you first start taking it, so the Casodex is taken first to block the testosterone receptors during the spike (note that I am still on both Casodex and Lupron 1.5 years after starting - the Casodex was not temporary). I also started on the hormone therapy about 3 months before I started radiation therapy. My understanding of the thinking here is that the hormone therapy will shrink the tumors first and thereby reduce the volume they have to hit with the radiation. Bottom line is that what you are describing sounds pretty standard to me.",

      "Content": "I have been on hormone therapy for about 18 months now. It does have a large number of side effects, though I have found them to be for the most part minor. The most significant ones for me have been loss of libido, hot flashes, fatigue and difficulty sleeping. The hot flashes are irritating and annoying but not really a big deal in the grand scheme of things. The difficulty sleeping has been dealt with by my taking a low dose of a prescription sleeping pill prescribed by my oncologist. The fatigue was quite minor for the first year, but has slowly increased. I would probably rate it as mild to moderate now. I have kept very active physically, with near daily weight lifting (very minor stuff though), core and back exercises and cycling (1223 miles last year, plus some stationary bike stuff in bad weather). The good news is that the hormone therapy has been working very well so far. I started it in August 2012; my PSA has been undetectable since at least February 2013. I also had external beam radiation in November and December 2012 so I am sure that has helped as well. The bottom line is that while hormone therapy has it's side effects, they have not been really bad. In looking at the overall picture, including both side effects and the results (e.g., PSA scores), I would not hesitate at all to start on hormone therapy if I magically had the chance to make the decision over again.",

      "Content": "July 13th was the two year anniversary of my diagnosis with prostate cancer. On that day in 2012 I had a biopsy done on a prostate cancer tumor in my bladder and had two kidney stents inserted to deal with urinary obstructions caused by the cancer. The biopsy revealed a Gleason 9 prostate cancer that was in my prostate, bladder and pelvic lymph nodes. Today the prostate cancer continues to be at least temporarily held at bay by the medications I am on, and, the last kidney stent was removed over a year ago. It is also roughly the two year anniversary of having started hormone therapy (Lupron and Casodex); Wednesday of this past week I received my every 3 month Lupron shot. I marked this anniversary last Saturday by participating in the 38th Annual Ann Arbor area \"One Helluva Ride\". I completed a 64 mile bike ride, and, coincidentally, passed the 1000 mile mark on my bike for the year. I am very grateful that I was physically able to do this ride. Many thanks to the health care professionals, researchers, fund raisers and donors that helped make this possible. I have kept a blog about my cancer since shortly after my diagnosis two years ago. A slightly expanded version of this post, and all earlier posts, can be found at: www.steveroushblog.blogspot.com",

      "Content": "I have been on ADT (Lupron and Casodex) for about 23 months now. The list of side effects I have experienced is quite long. The more serious or bothersome ones include loss of libido, hot flashes, fatigue, loss of bone mass and insomnia. (I was diagnosed in July 2012, Gleason 9 (5+4), with prostate cancer in prostate, bladder and pelvic lymph nodes.) I have learned to cope better with these side effects over time. I do take a sleeping pill (6.5 mg Continuous Release Ambien) to deal with the insomnia. Generally I like to minimize the meds I am on, especially meds to deal with the side effects of other meds, but I think the exception for the Ambien has been worthwhile. Lack of sleep can make other problems like fatigue and depression worse. I am a big believer in lots of exercise; I do a lot of fitness biking and also do back and core exercises and use some hand weights most days. It may sound counterintuitive but the exercise can help counteract fatigue, as well as help with bone loss, muscle loss, weight gain, depression and difficulty sleeping. In cool weather I deal with the hot flashes by dressing in layers that I can quickly shed; in the car I have learned not to overdress and to blast myself with the air vents as soon as I feel a hot flash coming on. While I certainly do not enjoy being on ADT, I actually rate my current quality of life as quite high. Part of my attitude is colored by having had kidney stents in for over 8 months after my initial diagnosis to deal with a urinary obstruction caused by a prostate cancer tumor in my bladder. The kidney stents were uncomfortable and limited my physical activity substantially. Thanks to the ADT, and external beam radiation in late 2012, I had the last kidney stent removed in March 2013. Right now I feel very good physically and am able to be very physically active. The good news is that the ADT and radiation therapy have been working very well so far. My PSA has been undetectable since early 2013. I have it tested again in about a month and my Radiation Oncologist may actually discontinue the ADT if my PSA remains undetectable.",
