    "Content": "I am 45yo with two young children at home. I have a history of testicular cancer from 1999 (no reacurance) Anyway, I went to the doctor last week for a regular check up. My PSA came back as 11.14 with a free PSA of 7%. Doc said to wait a week and we will recheck. A week later we rechecked and it in now 7.89 with 6% free. He also completed a urine culture to rule out infection. He scheduled me for a Biopsy and indicated that he believes that I have prostate cancer. I am very scared and anxious. Any thoughts or ideas about my situation would be helpful. I am otherwise healthy. I have to say that large part of my fear Is being able to achieve an erection once all of this is over. Thanks",
