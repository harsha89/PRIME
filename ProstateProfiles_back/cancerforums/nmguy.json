Just find out and try to stay positive. I don't know about everyone else but I have good days and bad days worrying about it but mainly try to stay positive that it will be cured. I had no really bad effects from biopsy just watch you temperature for 72 hours is what they told me. If goes to 100 or 101 go to ER and tell them Sepsis. Good luck.",

I can hold a fair amount in my bladder but when I start to leak quite a bit instead of the little dribble I go pee, usually a fair amount. I have asked the same question you did about not feeling the urge to pee here a couple of times but no one has ever answered so I guess no one else has experienced this. I asked my doctor about it and he said some of the nerves may have been injured but they should heal up. So far I still don't feel a real urge to pee. That's all I know about that.",

My Dr. at Mayo says he doesn't want to do radiation until he sees an increase in my psa. I asked him about SRT in the near future and he said some would say go ahead with SRT but he wants to monitor psa and won't recommend SRT until he sees a definite increase in psa. My first psa test post prostatectomy is June 10th. Will see where it is.",

I get up about every 2 hours to pee and go a lot like my bladder is full but don't have the old need to pee feeling so just go when I start leaking alot. Don't have to go much during the day use 1 pad most days and occasionally 2 pads. Anyway it's really frustrating for me trying to figure out how long to try to wait. Guess it will get better over time. Wanting to get as continent as possible as with my Pathology feel radiation is in my future.",

      "Content": "Thanks yolli71 good post as I was just diagnosed so starting the process for treatment. Saw your last post about doctor. I am kind of the same trying to decide on surgeon. Looking at Mayo Clinic in Phoenix, MD Anderson in Houston, or UNM in Albuquerque. The other 2 are bigger names than UNM but the doctor at UNM was recommended by my doctor and a couple of people here who had surgery done and they thought he was great. He is a Urologic Oncologist and Director of Robotic Surgery UNM and has done 700 or 800 surgeries over the last 10 years. It's a teaching hospital so he teaches other doctors how to do Da Vinci surgery. The thing about UNM is it's only 190 miles from my home while the others are 700 miles. Anyway was interesting to me to read your post on how you chose your doctor. Hope all keeps going well. ML",
