    "Content": "My father was diagnosed with prostate cancer ( adenocarcinoma of the prostate ) last august. He voluntarily sought no treatment citing that allopathy is nothing but just a money making scam. He read somewhere on the internet that this does not work. He opted for Homeopathy and Ayurvedic treatments which ofcourse never worked. Recent PET Scan reports reveal that his cancer metastized to the bones. His PSA level shot upto 625. He is becoming weaker day by day. I have to press ( massage )his legs and shoulders because of the pain caused. This may sound bad but I want to know how much time could he possibly have on hand. My mother and I are mentally prepared for this as it is obvious what could happen next. I know it can be difficult to ascertain anything about my father's case as you don't have any reports on hand, but just a rough estimate if you can give any. Also as of now he is not vomiting any coloured substance but he is not able to eat. He ends up vomiting what he eats many a times. Thanks",
