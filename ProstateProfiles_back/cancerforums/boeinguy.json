      "Content": "I'm 52. I have no symptoms other than a PSA bouncing around the 4 to 5 area (always been high). No family history. Had two separate biopsies (total 24 slices), and only one (from first biopsy) showed a microscopic speck (less than .05 mm\u0085two minute foci of atypia highly suspicious for prostatic adenocarcinoma Gleason score 6 (3+3) ) a note said: Immunostains with antibodies to p63 and CK903 do not show myoepithelial layer around atypical glands in Part D. Staining with antibodies to Racemase are positive in these glands. It should be mentioned that according to literature in findings of neoplastic changes less than 1 mm in length, tumor presentation in radical prostatectomy specimen may be very limited. So, is this all it takes to be considered as having prostate cancer? Doctor is talking about options; remove prostate, radioactive seeds, etc. My feeling is, do nothing and keep an eye on it. Thanks!",
