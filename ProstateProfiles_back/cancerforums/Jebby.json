      "Content": "Have so many questions and glad I finally Googled support forums. I apologize for this wall of text but here goes; Basics: 49yo WASP, Father died of aggressive prostate cancer as have several paternal uncles. Started having all the typical prostate issues about 5 years ago, PSA's first reported in the 4 to 7 range, digital exam by local \"best\" urologist reassured it was BPH, tried Rapaflo with horrible side effects, went to Flomax with similar results finally settled on Jalyn about 2.5 years ago and have had good results; last PSA 8 months ago was .4. Other medical issues, diverticulosis lead to 12\" of colon being removed 3.5 years ago, have been told I have testosterone of an 80 year old, used various transdermal solutions and last 2 years have used testipel, i metabolize the pills as fast as doctor has ever seen and have max number inserted every 3 months, currently 7 months since last dose. My current issue: started having trouble eliminating stool about a year ago, added fiber pills, occasional laxative with no relief, it literally feels like there is an egg about 3 or 4 inches up, some anal leakage. Had a colonoscopy last week, two polyps removed, no other issues observed. Even with colon cleansing still felt like I was holding stool in lower colon. CT scan showed multiple cysts on liver (have been there for years, no biopsy but doctors have said it is common and nothing to worry about), elevated floor of bladder suggested enlarged prostate or possible mass so saw urologist who has been treating BPH. He performed cystoscope (ouch!) and said no evidence of cancer visible, bladder was normal, prostate \"much larger\" than last digital exam. He added flomax to the jalyn so I'm now taking both. Will recheck prostate and PSA in 30 days, if no change he wants to discuss surgical options. I asked him about possibility of prostate causing bowel blockage and he declined, said it was more likely for colon to \"aggravate\" prostate but not the reverse??? I am not having issues urinating but emptying my bowels. I spoke to my GP after the urologist and he agrees we need a second opinion even though current is regarded as best in our region. My questions are: has anyone had similar issues with prostate enlarging enough to impact bowels? Anyone combining both Jalyn AND Flomax?",

      "Content": "Thanks for the input Otago. My diet could surely be better but isn't as bad as all that, I live on a small farm and we grow maybe 40 to 50% of the veggies we eat, rest is bought fresh or canned. I try to have salads at least 3 or 4 times a week but I do load them with cheese, eggs, bacon, and such which likely negates the benefit. We also butcher almost all of our own pork and beef, (not ourselves but raise the stock and have it butchered). Wife and I both try to avoid fried foods, probably only have it 2 or 3 times a month, also try to eat fish at least 2 twice a week. We eat rice with practically every meal. I have never sat down and fogured out the avctual fiber content of an average week. I do drink 4 or 5 cups of coffee a day with a spoon of sugar, usually have one glass of moderately sweet tea and sevral glasses/bottles of water a day. Drink one glass of whole milk each night. I fought diverticulosis for 5+ years and managed the flare ups pretty well until my dad got sick with PC, during his last months I was not exactly focused on my health and was admitted the day after we buried him for the surgery as an emergency, had almost ruptured. The doctor recommended fiber pills for 6 months to give the surgery plenty of time to heal, stayed on them a year as every time I backed off of them I had constipation issues. Eventually weaned myself off and had normal bowels for probably 2 good years. I know what constipation feels like and what I'm feeling now is not constipation. I'm still looking for thoughts on taking both Jalyn and Flowmax. I understand Jalyn is two meds and function of each whereas Flowmax is singular in its goal. Biopsy on the polyps removed two weeks ago was clean, have a urinary flow test scheduled in about 3 weeks with current urologist. I still have little problem urinating and bowel emptying is getting marginally better, only going 4 or 5 times a day now over the 8 to 10 times I was two weeks ago. I have low concerns about PC at this time though I recognize it is very likely in my future, more concerned about the BPH and what it sure feels like it's doing to my colon.",

      "Content": "Update. After taking the Flowmax on top of Jalyn for the past month we did a flow test today, I urinate with the force and volume of a 90 YO man. Careful review of the CT scan shows definite encroachment of the prostate into the colon, doctor only read the radiologists report at last visit, he actually looked at the scan himself today hence the change of opinion. Blood work was drawn and I get PSA update tomorrow, first in probably a year. Doctor is telling me to consider either green light laser vs radical removal. The laser will correct the urination issue but not likely to reduce encroachment into colon. Removal will obviously correct both issues but I am very concerned about the likely side effects. If PSA's come back elevated they want to do a biopsy before recommending a solution. I am scheduled for a second opinion first week of March. Anyone have any suggested reading material to help me choose which procedure is best for me?",
