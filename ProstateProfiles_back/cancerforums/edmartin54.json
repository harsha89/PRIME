      "Content": "Thanks for posting that article - very interesting and pertinent for me, since I'm having surgery April 12. The person's comments in that article is the reason I decided not go somewhere far away to have my surgery - I want to be able to go see the guy that did the work if I have issues. I'm confident in his abilities (Urology resident at MUSC - good school) and he's always been very good at explaining things in great detail. I'm probably going to have a higher than normal probability of incontinence issues because he said my prostate was pressing into my bladder (I'm not explaining as well as he did) and that he'd probably have to make a little larger opening in my bladder than normal to make sure there were no positive margins left behind. At least I know that going in.",

      "Content": "Had surgery at 10 a.m. on Tuesday, April 12, at West Florida Medical Center, Dr Vaughan performing (my urologist at Woodlands Medical Specialists). Regarding the hospital, my experience from pre-admission through discharge was outstanding - everyone was so nice and attentive and explained everything every step of the way. I was released the next afternoon. The surgery took right at 4 hours. I think it took that long mainly because of what Dr Vaughan had to do regarding my bladder. My prostate was pressing into my bladder so he had to cut a bigger hole than normal in order to make sure no positive margins were left behind. Reattaching the urethra to a bigger hole took a little more work. He said after surgery that he thought things went really well and he was able to preserve the nerves. This morning (5 days after surgery) I was able to achieve an erection - with the catheter still in! Sounds promising! Regarding the recovery experience, it has been better than I expected. I walked a lot the 2 months prior and I think it paid off. Most of my pain was centered around the port containing the drainage tube. I was on morphine at first, then transitioned to percocet prior to discharge. Walking was slow, but was able to walk the next day without support. On Friday (3 days after surgery) I transitioned to Extra Strength Tylenol during the day and only took the percocet prior to bed to make sure I got a good night's sleep. Whenever I woke during the night, I'd take laps around the house and every couple hours during the day, I'd do the same. The catheter comes out tomorrow (Mon, April 18 ) and then I'll go on longer walks outside. I was a little nervous about getting too far away from home, in case I got fatigued or needed the facilities (taking stool softener twice a day). Still moving slow, but feeling really good about my progress. I imagine I'll get the pathology report on my prostate tomorrow when I see Dr. Vaughan and will post the results on here. The MRI prior to surgery showed no evidence of \"escape\", but time will tell. Dr. Vaughan wants a PSA test in 4 weeks and another at 3 months, so we'll have a better idea then. I got a lot of information from this forum, especially about post-surgery experience, and wanted to thank everyone for that. More later",

      "Content": "Had appointment with urologist yesterday to discuss pathology report and remove catheter. Pathology confirmed biopsy score of Gleason 6, no evidence of escape. Was very happy to get rid of the catheter earlier than I expected Blood test in 6 weeks and another in 3 months to check progress. Erection this morning The doc did a great job with preserving the nerves! Looks like incontinence will be the big issue (r.e. the non-standard reconnect at the bladder due to prostate pressing into the bladder).",
