      "Content": "Hi all, i'm new to this forum. I'm 49 yrs old and always had normal PSA in the past but this year it spiked almost 4x see below. I went to see Uro and he said my DRE was normal and put me on 30-day Cipro antibiotics then retest again in October. Looking at the PSAs between 2015 and 2016, it seems to double then double again, hence 4x. Should I be worried here or is the doubling then doubling between 2015/2016 a coincidence? Can PSA double then double again within a year? 4/2013 = 1.69 6/2014 = 1.43 6/2015 = 1.77 8/2016 = 6.96 Feel worried. -David",

      "Content": "Thank you all for very informative info. I'm on last week of Cipro, then next week blood test for PSA, then will see my Uro on Oct 4 for results. I did some research on mp-MRI and is fortunate to know I live only 5 minutes from world renowned 3T mp-MRI expert Dr. Robert Princenthal office. I will keep him in mind depending what my result is in Oct. I Will update. Thanks.",

      "Content": "UPDATE: After finished 30-day Cipro anti-biotics, I had a followup with my Uro on Oct 4. My PSA dropped to 4.00 from 6.96. My Uro thinks it is likely an infection that caused initial PSA spike. So my PSA was 1.77 then 6.96 and now 4.00. See below. My Uro said that my PSA might come down lower once the infection begins to settle down and resolves. I will retest PSA again in 3 months. Although the PSA drop can be good, I don't feel I'm out of the woods yet. I read some men have their PSA goes down after antibiotics then only to see PSA elevate again in 3 or 6 or 12 months. Also my free PSA is 18% which means there is still a 20% chance cancer can still be found which is a concern. So I'm taking the latest result with mixed feelings. In the meantime, no biopsy will be done but I insisted on getting 3T mp-MRI and my Uro agreed is a good idea. So I'm going to have a MRI done soon. PSA results: April 2013 - 1.69 June 2014 - 1.43 June 2015 - 1.77 Aug 2016 - 6.96 Oct 2016 - 4.00 (free PSA is 18%)",
