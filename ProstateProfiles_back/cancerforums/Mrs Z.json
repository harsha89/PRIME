I would ask the doctor's office if there is another uro that he is associated with that can be consulted while the doctor is on vacation. That is lousy timing for him to be gone right after laying this diagnosis on you both. Keep checking the forum because there will be LOTS of comment and advice coming your way. We also often recommend getting the book, Guide to Surviving Prostate Cancer, 3rd edition, by Dr Pat Walsh. It is an older book now, but still extremely informative about prostate cancer. Can you tell us how old your husband is and his PSA history prior to the latest one of 10.29? Good luck! Chuck",

      "Content": "This is my 2nd post, I wrote before that my DH's gleason was at 8, Johns Hopkins says it is a 4+5=9. We were told that it is \"VERY AGRESSIVE.\" During our last appointment I was trying to get a glimmer of hope from the doctor. Unfortunately that was not to be had. Husband has decided on radical prostatectomy with Dr. Han at Johns Hopkins. It has been scheduled for Sept 26th. Doctor says he will be there 1 or 2 nights. As a care-giver what can I expect? How many days should I take off from work? When he returns home, will he be able to climb the stairs to get to the bedroom? Will he need assistance when he returns from the hospital? Is there anything that I should buy now that will be needed for after his surgery? What don't I know that I should? Thanks, Mrs Z",
