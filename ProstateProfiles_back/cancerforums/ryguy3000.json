      "Content": "Hi everyone, Looking for some support/information here. My grandfather, who is 85 years old, has been visibly healthy as long as I've known him. He still lives on his own, takes no medications, drives, etc. The past 2 weeks, he's had really bad lower back/leg pain. He also had trouble urinating. After a blood test, it was determined he had a PSA level of around 11. We're now waiting for him to get an appointment with a urologist. Nothing is confirmed, but from what we've been told, it looks like it might be prostate cancer that spread to his bones. From what I've read, this is generally stage 4 prostate cancer. What is the prognosis on this? Do people usually get better with treatment? Thanks.",

      "Content": "Thanks everyone. I appreciate it. His PSA reading as recent as September was only just over 4. (Now it's around 11.) Good to know that there are still many treatments out there if it ends up being in this stage of cancer. He really had no known health issues and had regular check-ups.",

The fact that an ER doctor (and a few family friend doctors) told us this just had us worried needlessly. That said, it's a good lesson to not reach conclusions before having concrete facts. Best wishes to you all.",
