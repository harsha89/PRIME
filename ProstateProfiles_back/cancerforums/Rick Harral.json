      "Content": "I had prostate surgery in January. Went through the incontinence but my surgeon was right as to how things would heal and when. At first when I was prescribed Viagra I took nor 1 daily per surgeons recommended dosage. Things were coming along. Some heavy feeling in the morning about 4am and erections and orgasm. Them I went in to get blood work 0 PSA. GOOD. I THOUGHT THE doctor said at this point to take 4-5 pills when expecting sexual activity. Did I misunderstand? I have got nothing now. I have a whole new appreciation of the phase \" can't get it up\". Never has this happened to me before. I mean totally limp. Still can orgasm, urine fountain. Maybe I should go back to one a day and 4-5 when anticipating sexual activity. I am really bummed out. Thinking of vacuum device. I really have nothing, just totally limp. Any suggestions welcome. L.p.",

      "Content": "Thank you so much for the kind words and the words of wisdom. I guess I was so happy about things getting better so quick that I always expect things to go in an upward direction and then when things they go. back a couple steps I get really anxious. I don't really know why I feel this way because the incontinence was a step forward and then back three steps. But that got a whole better even within the last two weeks. In reference to the Viagra they are 20 mg. I was so discouraged that my wife suggested going back to one tablet a day. She is very smart so I will try that. Thanks again.",

I go through lots off clothes and that is annoying. Started going to the Y. That has helped. It has lots off equipment. I wish you well and will be praying for you l.P.p",
