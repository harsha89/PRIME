At the end of the lab report it has a gross Description: \"specimen labeled 'SP1 prostate chips' and consists of multiple irregular, tan-pink portions of partially cauterized, rubbery tissue (8 grams, 5.0 x 3.0 x 1.5 cm in aggregate).

      "Content": "Hi all I am a 51 year old, 6' 1\" 175 pound guy who was just diagnosed with PC. I have a family history of prostate cancer (brother and father) I was urinating very slowly, so I had a transurethral resection of the prostate which fixed the urination problem. However, the biopsy from the surgery found prostate cancer. The lab report is as follows: prostatic adenocarcinoma, Gleason Score 6 (3+3), involving 5-10% of the submitted tissue (five chips out of 70-80 chips submitted) Prostate Size: weight 8 grams, 32.5 ccs Histologic Type: Adenocarcinoma (acinar, not otherwise specified) Tumor Quantitation: TUR Specimens Proportion (percentage) of prostate involved by tumor: 5-10% Periprostatic Fat Invasion: Not identified Seminal Vesicle Invasion: Not identified Lymph-Vascular Invasion: Not identified Perineural Invasion: Not identified Additional Pathologic Findings: Nodular prostatic hyperplasia Inflammation: Chronic P63 immunostain is negative around foci of tumor supporting the above diagnosis (control satisfactory). -------------------------------------- My Dec 2011 PSA was 1.5; In Jul 2012 it was 1.9; In Dec 2012, it is 0.7 with Free PSA at 28% Right now my Urologist wants me to do either Radiation or Surgery. He thinks that my age, my family history, the percentage of involvement (5=10%) and the location of the cancer indicate that I can\u0092t do AS. GP wants me to do AS since my PSA is so low. Since they disagree, I am going to another Urologist for a second opinion. What I am curious about is what do you think about the location of my prostate cancer? Is it a problem being in the urinary tract?",
