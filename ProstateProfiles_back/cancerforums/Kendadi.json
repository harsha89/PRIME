Ya I guess I thought the urine bag was looking lighter for awhile - it only been two days since the surgery (on Tuesday morning, I write this Thursday evening). I guess I will have to wait for more information. But I am glad its over (at least for now). I had some days where the urine in my catheter bag would turn pink. This seemed to coincide with increased physical activity (walking). When I questioned this, I was told it was normal, as only one or two drops of blood would color the urine. If it turned bright red, I would contact your urologist.",

      "Content": "Prostate Gland Size: The prostate gland measures 4.2 cm AP x 5.5 cm transverse x 4.2 cm craniocaudad consistent with a prostatic gland volume of 48.0 cc. Central Zone: No tumor-suspicious regions are identified in the central zone. Transition Zone: There is a tumor suspicious region, PI-RADS 5, involving the anterior right aspect of the transition zone at the base. This extends inferiorly to the mid gland. This measures 2.1 x 2.7 x 1.7 cm. This demonstrates non-circumscribed moderate T2 shortening and evidence of restricted diffusion with early arterial enhancement. There is some nodular enlargement and inhomogeneous signal intensity throughout the transition zone most commonly due to benign prostatic hyperplasia. No tumor-suspicious region is identified within the transition zone. Peripheral Zone: No tumor-suspicious regions are identified in the peripheral zone. Extraprostatic Extension: None. Seminal Vesicle Invasion: None. Pelvic Lymphadenopathy: None. Urinary Bladder: Trabeculated urinary bladder. No evidence for mass. Rectosigmoid Colon: There is no evidence of diverticulitis or diverticulosis. No rectosigmoid mass is identified. No rectal hemorrhoids are seen. No inguinal hernia is identified. Pelvic Osseous Structures: There is no evidence of osseous metastatic disease at the level of the prostate gland. IMPRESSION: 1. The prostate gland volume equals 48.0 cc. 2. The PSA density not given. 3. There is mild nodular enlargement and inhomogeneous signal intensity throughout the transition zone most commonly due to benign prostatic hyperplasia. 4.
