      "Content": "Hello all. Recently I went to the doctor for pain in the groin era. After a ultrasound, the results say my prostate shows a heterogeneous appearance. It shows an irregular contour with indentation of the base of the bladder. The impression was the title of this thread. I went to a urologist and he almost dismissed it as nothing(much like my PCP) who said it was nothing. He almost dismissed it because of my age(I\u0092m 26, turning 27 this year) and said it\u0092s gas\u0092s probably causing the pain. I don\u0092t know what to think honestly but I\u0092m scared at the possibly of prostate cancer since my symptoms may match. Am I right for being concerned?",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by HighlanderCFH Hi Magic, Welcome to the forum. I happily tend to agree with the urologist. My reason is because it is EXTREMELY rare for a man your age to have prostate cancer. It probably is gas that is causing the pain you talked about. As far as your symptoms, the beginning stages of prostate cancer usually have no symptoms at all -- and since it is so highly unlikely that you would have prostate cancer, we can pretty much guess that it is something else, such as the gas the doctor mentioned. You are certainly correct for being proactive in your health care, so that is good. Keep on doing that as you get older. In the meantime, also keep in mind the highly unlikely possibility that you would have prostate cancer. You'll probably get additional comments from others in the forum, so keep checking back. I'm sure we're all going to try and give you some well deserved peace of mind. Take care, Chuck Thank you. I\u0092ve been having various issues and wanted to check to see if my prostate was ok. I also have an irregular contour of the prostate as well. I researched and of course it was a terrible idea cause all the searches led me to cancer. I\u0092m going to visit the doctor tommorow to talk more and be sure. Possibly take a PSA test as well",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by Michael F Hi Mmjj! To Chuck's points: - The probability of you having Prostate Cancer (PCa) is infinitesimal. Since both your PCP & URO MD are not concerned, then neither should you. - The vast majority of those who have discovered that they have PCa had \"0\" physical symptoms. Did either MD run a PSA blood test? IF elevated, it may indicate prostatitis or BPH. Hope your symptoms soon resolve. MF Thank you. I\u0092m going to take a PSA tommorow hopefully to make sure",
