      "Content": "Hi: I'm new here, I just had my prostate removed. And found out that even though the viagra is prescribed by my dr. for medicinal purposes (i.e. not recreational) my insurance co only covers 8 pills (about 12-20 short of what the dr. prescribed) for the month. So I'm paying for this out of pocket. Does anyone know of a cheap (and safe) way to buy this. My dr. mentioned that in Canada they have a generic form of the drug which is much cheaper. TIA I hope to be posting more.",
