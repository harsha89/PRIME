      "Content": "I've just been advised by my urologist that I need to have an orchiectomy, or at the very least Lupron shots going forward. My PC is the most aggressive Gleason 9, and likely systemic or metastatic at this point. But here in this forum, my question is not really clinical, but related to working with medical providers. In my PC adventure (now going on for 4 years), I've acquired new medical providers that I never anticipated before diagnosis: Urologist, Radiation Oncologist, Clinical Trial coordinator, etc. Over the last four years I've shared my experience with my GP. He is a competent MD, but lacks imagination and curiosity. Now I'm about to pursue some nonstandard treatment with a prostate cancer specialist / oncologist at a major cancer center about five hours from where I live. Frankly, not even my urologist understands the direction I want to take, and my GP is even less informed. I anticipate that what I learn from the prostate cancer specialist recommends will not jive with jive with my local caregivers view of the world. Anyone out there have any ideas about how to get a local team of GP/urologist to prescribe the nonstandard drugs and treatments that I may need? The \"nonstandard\" treatment I want is to use Estradiol transdermal patches to ameliorate side effects of ADT (whether via Lupron or orchiectomy). I will need all my prescriptions locally and will be limited in how often I can make the ten-hour trip to the specialist. Will the local generalists go along, or is it going to be a battle?",

      "Content": "Thanks Jim, I presumed that about a single prescription. But what about requesting changes in dosages requiring new or different Rx, or follow-up tests to confirm if the treatments are working? My GP seems to want personal control because I'm \"his\" patient. I realize I can look for another GP. But where I live is semi-rural, and doctors are hard to secure. I work full time and can't afford to move 400 miles away just to get ongoing treatment. What you're saying makes perfect sense, but I feel trapped by insurance-driven providers that dole out services. I guess I can try to work with a new doctor in another city, but am concerned he'll need to see me in person fairly often if my GP won't give me the nonstandard treatment. gme",

      "Content": "Hello all and thanks for all the great posts. They were quite encouraging before and after Da Vinci Rad Prost. in mid April, 2012. But, now, at the four-month PSA test, my reading is .84, where it should be virtually \"non detectable.\" At the meeting early this week to discuss what this means for me, my Urologist/Surgeon extended his sympathies. He did offer hope by saying that perhaps I could have another PSA in two months, and if no rise in the number is shown, that might be a sign of PSA from the salivary glands, etc., thus not growing cancer. But doing some reading on the Sloan-Kettering website, I ran across a 2005 report that claims about 25% of men who have Radical Prostatectomy still have cancer cells in their body, and that in most cases those cells are \"distant\" from the orignal lower pelvic area. So the prognosis and treatment for someone in my shoes becomes very complex. Radiation immediately may simply mess up my bladder without doing anything for \"distant\" cancer. Then I've heard the \"hormone ablation\" (nice euphemism, that) can make you pudgy and lethargic. I am still working at 69 at a demanding administrative position and plan to work 1-3 more years, and I really can't afford to stop supporting my family. I've been seeing a terrific physical therapist who herself beat breast cancer by taking charge of her situation, and she says the \"mind, body, spirit\" approach is what worked for her. Diet targeting cancer health, exercise program, and some spiritual meditation could be an alternative to the traditional burn and poison approach. Anybody in the forum taken the holistic approach?",

      "Content": "mkane09 Thanks for taking the time to post. Yes the margins were negative, so I would tend to agree that distant micrometases are going on. The surgery was \"deep\" as the surgeon described it, with no nerve sparing and seminal vesicles removed as well. I don't recall however, whether a biopsy of the lymph nodes was performed. But isn't the lymph system \"wide open\" to cell migration to distant sites? I'm seeing an oncologist in two weeks, and have a lot of information to digest in a short time. Unlike you, I'm not in the medical field, so wading through the technical concepts is going to be a challenge.",

      "Content": "Chuck, Thanks for the feedback. I've got to get my path report data posted on my signature, per Featherboy's suggestion. My PCP called last night (he's not a cancer specialist but is a good M.D.) and speculated that it may have been immune system at work eliminating PCa cells. But another theory I heard from a cancer center nurse is that the PSA was the result of residudual benign tissue that took about 6 months to die off. Whatever the reasons, I'll take whatever I can get!",
