      "Content": "I have the same Gleason score (4+4) * and same stage T2a. I was diagnosed in July. As the cancer may be outside the prostate ( one lymph node is 1mm oversized) I have opted for hormone and radiation therapy. I have been on hormones now for a couple months and have had a recent CT scan. I\u2019ll get the results on Nov 13th and map out a strategy from there. I opted for the radiation treatment because if they remove the prostate and there is any spread you my have to undergo radiation at that time. Also the less time I spend in hospital the better I like it.",

I searched Amazon and came up with over 20,000 results. To date I have read Katz\u0092s \u0093Definite Guide to Prostate Cancer\u0094, Marckini\u0092s \u0093You Can Beat Prostate Cancer\u0094 and \u0093Anti Cancer a New Way of Life\u0094 Also a slug of stuff off the Internet plus pamphlets I received from the BC Cancer Agency I\u0092d appreciate hearing about any other books that anyone would consider helpful",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by ezhelp712 I am a 63 year old (soon to be 64) white male. In August 2012, after experiencing a difficult time urinating, I sought a urologist. My PSA result was 50.11 A biopsy confirmed 6 of 10 samples were positive. CT and bone scans were negative. A Gleason score of 8. The doctor claims I'm a candidate for either surgery (removal of the prostate) or seed/hormone therapy. Would someone please be so kind and share their experiences with the \"seed\" therapy? Advice would be greatly appreciated - I thank you in advance. I have close to the same thing. Gleason 8 (4+4); Prostate isn\u2019t enlarged and PSA was low (2.7) and dropping at the time of diagnosis. CT and Bone scan showed nothing in the bones but slightly enlarged lymph nodes in proximity to the prostate. I chose External Radiation as there was a possibility the cancer had moved outside the capsule. Started hormones (Zoladex) at the end of August and hope to start the radiation early December. To date the Hormones have reduced my PSA to 0.14 Side effects for Hormones have been annoying but not impossible to live with. I will be getting off the Hormones as soon as the radiation is over. The original plan was to do hormones for 2 years but I will be quitting them as soon as the radiation treatments are done as I have some issues with the side effects that are troubling. Memory loss and loss of balance convinced the Dr. to pull me off them. I have a friend who had seeds implanted over 10 years ago and he is going strong today. I also have a cousin who underwent surgery and he swears it is the way to go. I chose radiation because if the surgery failed to get the cancer I would have to do radiation later and I thought that there was a good chance of getting cancer into the blood stream with an operation. The less time I have to spend in a hospital the better.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by Ronald007 Thanks. I am in Canada. Unfortunately, the prostate cancer centre in my city just received a \"F\" grade in service delivery. My experience so far has been a very frustrating one. I'm in BC; Same Gleason 4+4; decided on hormones and radiation; So far the process has been fairly quick. Got the biopsy results on June 27th and had a CT scan requisitioned that took place on July3; however I didn\u2019t get to see urologist until the 1st as he took his summer holidays. Then went through the referral process and finally had a consultation with an oncologist on August 17th. Started Hormone treatment that day. Had a follow up appointment with oncologist on Nov 13th. Hormones seem to be doing their job as PSA is now less that 0.2. Having issues with side effects and hope to get off them soon. Decided to take the radiation treatment in Vancouver and have been referred to another Dr. there. Consultation at the end Nov.; Treatments to start hopefully in early Dec. So far things have moved along fairly quickly; although I did tell everyone involved that I would prefer the treatments in Vancouver; so referring me to a Dr. there to begin with might have saved some time. Gotta love bureaucracies.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by Ronald007 Looks like BC has their act together better than us here in Manitoba. I wasn't told that HRT or radiation were options. Was advised that only surgery would be the best course of action. Didn't think I would have to wait this long though. I will be surprised if the cancer is still contained to the prostate once I finally do have the surgery. Regional Health Authority here had a conference last week where they stated their goal was to address service delivery and ensure that the time from diagnosis to treatment was 60 days. This appears to follow what occures in the US. Yes you are liable to get different answers as to what is the best treatment depending on whom you ask. Ask a surgeon he\u2019ll recommend surgery. Ask a radiation oncologist he\u2019ll recommend radiation. Ask someone who has had a successful surgery or someone who didn\u2019t again you get 2 different answers. If th surgery isn\u2019t successful you have the option of hormones and radiation. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s the case if radiation isn\u2019t successful. One thing about PC is it is slow. I asked my Dr what my life expectancy would be if I did nothing and she said 5 to 8 years. Lots of stuff on the Net about changing life style to slow the cancer down.",
