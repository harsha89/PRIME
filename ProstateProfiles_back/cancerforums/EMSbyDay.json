      "Content": "Don't know anything about dilation, but had a cystoscopy done about 4 years ago investigating some groin/abdo pain with microscopic hematuria. Mine was done in a special room at hospital with local numbing gel shot up the pipe. I would not say there was pain, just a lot of discomfort. I should clarify though that as mine was a bladder investigation I had to have a super full bladder and needed to urinate so bad before starting and they squirted in even more fluid to blow up the bladder and look around. I think my discomfort was mostly in the abdo due to trying not to wizz all over the doc like a firehouse the whole time.",

      "Content": "Hello everyone, I've found your site and have been reading your brave stories and am hoping I have nothing but good news to share in the future but in the meantime am wondering if any of you have had similar experiences to what I am going through. A little bit of back information about me: I am 34 years old and generally healthy, (6ft tall 165lbs), take no medications and have no real ongoing health issues. When I was young I had to have surgery twice for undescended/retractile testicles that pulled back up which they believe is likely the cause of fertility issues as an adult (very low sperm count). 4 years ago my wife and I went through specialized IVF procedures and have incredible 3 year old twins now. During that time I developed some discomfort in the top on my left testicle that radiated up my lower left abdomen. It comes and goes. I had blood/urine work ultrasound and cystoscopy done all were normal. Flash forward to last year. During a DRE at my annual physical my family MD though he felt some asymmetry and referred me to a straight to a urologist d/t family history. The urologist saw me in the spring in the hospitals local diagnostic clinic, checked my urine flow/residual and did another DRE which he said felt normal. He gave me a requisition to do a PSA test and follow up in his office in a few months. Urologist stated the prostate was a 25gram smooth benign non-tender prostate with no nodules and a PSA of 1.2 He was pleased with my status and wished to follow up with me yearly due to family history (Father - Will detail below) Here we are a year later and time to repeat. I had an anniversary weekend planned (had ejaculation 4x over 3 days) so I waited 4-5 days to have my blood taken (taken last friday, 4 days ago). The local blood lab allows you to access your results so expecting another normal value I took a look yesterday. I had to check a few times as the Total PSA Result was 17.5 I am absolutely beside myself, and on the verge of a complete breakdown. I am trying to convince myself it has to be an error or that something else is causing this extreme reading, because all I can think of when I see that number is that is must be some form of extremely aggressive cancer and I am never going to get to see my 3 year old twins grow up. I do not feel that I have an notable symptoms. I void every 2-5 hours depending on what I am doing and whether I'm drinking coffee or alcohol. I often pee once overnight, but I don't think I wake up having to pee as much as wake up and decide \"well I better go now so I don't wake up having to later\". I have no trouble starting or getting a good stream. I was fairly sick with a strep throat infection about 2.5 weeks prior to the blood test and on Penicillin with Potassium for 10 days ending just over a week before test. I did note that early on in the infection my urine was darker, with some urgency and a slower flow. This improved by the end of the infection and is normal now. The morning of the day I had the PSA test I had a very upset stomach and had diarrhea a number of times. Could this other infection or straining with bowel movements cause inflammation or increased PSA levels? Terrified I went to my regular doctor yesterday (young new family doctor) with the test results who simply tried to re-assure me that the PSA level just means the prostate is working and maybe mine was working harder and to try not to worry. At my insistence he wrote me a requisition for another PSA test to be done later this week to test both Total and Free PSA. I guess this is what people here call PSAnxiety, but I am losing my my mind. My 35 year old brother in law has just day/weeks left with aggressive colon cancer and my father died of aggressive prostate cancer @53. I'm in tears every time I see or think about my kids. Family History for reference: Father @ 51 years old started having urinary issues: urgency, small amounts of pee, trouble going, stop/starting saw his family MD who though some time of urinary infection or benign swelling and tried multiple different antibiotics or urinary medications a couple month later developed pain in one side of his groin/thigh after a few month became fed up with his family MD and went to a Urologist that he knew DRE was enlarged and sent for PSA/Biopsy Mother cant remember the PSA level but said it was unbelievabley high Urologist biopsied prostate and other tissues Diagnosed immediately with innoperable Prostate CA with Mets to bone He had a number of treatments of radiation, chemo, transfusions but died 1.5 years later at the age of 53",

I am trying to convince myself it has to be an error or that something else is causing this extreme reading, because all I can think of when I see that number is that is must be some form of extremely aggressive cancer and I am never going to get to see my 3 year old twins grow up. I do not feel that I have an notable symptoms. I void every 2-5 hours depending on what I am doing and whether I'm drinking coffee or alcohol. I often pee once overnight, but I don't think I wake up having to pee as much as wake up and decide \"well I better go now so I don't wake up having to later\". I have no trouble starting or getting a good stream. I was fairly sick with a strep throat infection about 2.5 weeks prior to the blood test and on Penicillin with Potassium for 10 days ending just over a week before test. I did note that early on in the infection my urine was darker, with some urgency and a slower flow. This improved by the end of the infection and is normal now. The morning of the day I had the PSA test I had a very upset stomach and had diarrhea a number of times. Could this other infection or straining with bowel movements cause inflammation or increased PSA levels? Terrified I went to my regular doctor yesterday (young new family doctor) with the test results who simply tried to re-assure me that the PSA level just means the prostate is working and maybe mine was working harder and to try not to worry. At my insistence he wrote me a requisition for another PSA test to be done later this week to test both Total and Free PSA. I guess this is what people here call PSAnxiety, but I am losing my my mind. My 35 year old brother in law has just day/weeks left with aggressive colon cancer and my father died of aggressive prostate cancer @53. I'm in tears every time I see or think about my kids. Family History for reference: Father @ 51 years old started having urinary issues: urgency, small amounts of pee, trouble going, stop/starting saw his family MD who though some time of urinary infection or benign swelling and tried multiple different antibiotics or urinary medications a couple month later developed pain in one side of his groin/thigh after a few month became fed up with his family MD and went to a Urologist that he knew DRE was enlarged and sent for PSA/Biopsy Mother cant remember the PSA level but said it was unbelievabley high Urologist biopsied prostate and other tissues Diagnosed immediately with innoperable Prostate CA with Mets to bone He had a number of treatments of radiation, chemo, transfusions but died 1.5 years later at the age of 53",

My understanding is that Testosterone for PCA is bad, and while \"shocking\" it with high doses while restricting natural production may have a positive effect on some is it making anyone worse or progressing anyone's disease faster? It seems like the trial was only performed on those who other therapy is not working for and who would probably get sicker anyway, but could it make them get sicker faster?

      "Content": "Here's hoping it's a false positive on the bone scan. My father was diagnosed with PCA with mets to bone in 2003. Again with him it seemed odd that it jumped to his elbow, collar bone, and head. Those were also places he had previous injuries from when younger. One doctor speculated that damaged tissue in those areas made them more susceptible.. Not to say this is the case for you, and testing is much better now than 13 years ago. Hopefully you get it cleared up soon.",
