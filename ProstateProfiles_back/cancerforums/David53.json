    "Content": "Hello, I'm 68 and in December 2016 had a radical prostatectomy. Gleason was 3+4, and there was no lymph node involvement. My first PSA following surgery was \"undetectable\" and six months later PSA was .1 On average I still wear three pads a week and my \"leaking\" is in direct relationship to pelvic pain when I sit down, especially on hard surfaces, without my donut. So if I sit in the car or a restaurant without a pillow, I'll lose continence. I spoke to the surgeon about this and he said he'd never heard anybody complain of this. I sought a second opinion, and that urologist said just about the same thing. QUESTION:HAS ANYONE ELSE HAD THIS EXPERIENCE? WHAT KIND OF DOCTOR DO I NEED TO SEE TO GET HELP WITH THIS, BOTH DIAGNOSTICALLY AND TREATMENT-WISE? Thanks so much for any help you can provide. David",
