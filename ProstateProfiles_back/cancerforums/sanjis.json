      "Content": "My husband had same surgery Dec. 13th, 2007. I will say the recovery is much slower than he expected and when listening to the urologist you hear that some recover fast and you want to be one of those, but it does not always work that way. He just turned 56 in August. He can have an orgasm but a lot of times the erection just gets barely hard enough for penetration. The Cialis & Viagra cause terrible headaches for him, but they seemed to help the erection some. You can always use a VED device. It has been 8 1/2 months since surgery, and finally things are starting to work some on their own. Now his erection is getting harder sometimes. He also feels that maybe he can try to go without a pad for incontinence as long as he is not doing any heavy lifting that day. If you have any questions I will try to answer if you want to privately email me. So far his PSA levels have remained undetectible.",
