      "Content": "Sorry you had to join the club but welcome. You're in good company here. I'm a couple months out of surgery with about the same stats as you and 52 years old. You should be fine but everyone told me that as well. Couldn't really believe it until I went through the experience myself. I can say I don't have any trouble with incontinance or ED at this point and other than a couple little scars I wouldn't know anything was ever wrong. I tell folks the scars are old bullet wounds from the war You'll get lots of good advice here and support. Looking back, the crap going on in my head when I heard the word cancer was way worse than any of the treatment. If your wife wants to get ya a nurse and she's hot I'd say go for it !!! Mine quit waitin on me after a week or so Good luck with your journey and keep us updated.",

Just wore loose pants and the leg bag. No lifting or twisting is the restriction they gave me. I have a desk job. After they remove the catheter, leaking can be the problem but pads usualy take care of that. I didn't leak much at all (just when I strained) and now hardly anything. When I found out guys were getting 6 weeks off I was kinda bummed I didn't do that. Would have been a nice vacation And, you might get that personal nurse thing 4 weeks after surgery should be fine for a new job if you don't have any issues or complications.",

Not as qualified as others to speak to your fathers possible outcome but from what I do know it looks like it's still early enough for a good outcome. I can certainly address the the emotional roller coaster you are on and will be going through as it's very fresh in my mind. It's inevitable you and your father will experience a wide range of emotions until he joins us on the otherside. This is perfectly normal and will settle in time as you choose a treatment and proceed. Try not to spend too much time reading negative stuff on the internet. I found that ultimately I only came here for comfort and information and spoke with my doctor. These guys are great. Don't be shy about asking any questions and sharing what's going on no matter how silly it may seem. You will get answers and experience from guys that have gone through exactly what you're going through. Hang in there and keep us posted.",

I'm 52 and my scores were lower than your husbands with the exception of 1 core being a 7. Recovery is going fine. Having the PC gone has all but removed any cancer anxiety. Based on where I'm at now at 4 weeks I expect to fully recover with \"NO\" side effects in a relatively short period of time. At your husbands age, he has a very good chance of having a similar outcome with the word \"cured\" in his future. Just make sure he has the best surgeon possible with at the very least 300 surgeries under his belt. 1,000 would be even better. Good Luck jim",

      "Content": "Personally, I think he's making the right decision. I'm on my 4th week out of the same surgery. I'm 52 and my scores were lower than your husbands with the exception of 1 core being a 7. Recovery is going fine. Having the PC gone has all but removed any cancer anxiety. Based on where I'm at now at 4 weeks I expect to fully recover with \"NO\" side effects in a relatively short period of time. At your husbands age, he has a very good chance of having a similar outcome with the word \"cured\" in his future. Just make sure he has the best surgeon possible with at the very least 300 surgeries under his belt. 1,000 would be even better. Good Luck jim",

Now on to the fun part of my day - Cath came out fine and I went home feelin good about the pathology. Had lunch and then tried to take my first pee. Holy Crap!!!! I went straight to my knees in pain. Worst cramps I've ever had in my life. I couldn't move much less get back to the docs office. Had to call an amulance to help me get back there. Things settled down a bit and they reinstalled the cath. Said I'd need another week and then try again. Back home now and feeling fine and very happy with what I think is a good path report.

On my first attempt to urinate I was hit with the most incredible pain I've ever felt in my life. I was literally on my kness shaking and sweating and couldn't even get to the car to get help. Ended up having to call an ambulance to get me to the ER. I rode to the hospital on my knees curled up in a ball and hanging on the the gurney. Once there, things settled down enough eventually that they could recath me and after that I went back to normal in an hour or so. Has anyone else exeperienced this?

And, I have a lot less anxiety knowing that my prostate is on the bottom of the ocean somewhere. Quote from Dr. Walsh: \"The bottom line of this long-term study,\" concludes Walsh, \"is that surgery cures the vast majority of men with tumors that are confined to the surgical specimen. Fortunately, today with improved means for early detection, this means that most men diagnosed with prostate cancer can be cured with surgery.\"",

I think or at least they tell me, I'm fortunate to be in my position with this. It helps some but still, when they tell ya you got cancer, it scares the crap outa me. Everytime I get a little pain I think \" Shit, it's the cancer spreading \" or, I worry that they'll find a bunch more other types of cancer when they get in there. It's not a constant fear or unbearable but it is messin with my head a little. Of course, they also gotta tell ya that you might not have sex anymore and that sucks. But who's gonna want to have sex with me if I'm peeing all over myself and wearin a diaper anyway. That's some of the crap that goes through my head right now. Vodka seems to be helping though.",
