      "Content": "AdVance male sling surgery update ... I'm 1 week out from having the AdVance male sling surgery \"installed\" (3/13/2017). The dr said it all went well with no surprises (I guess that's good). I stayed overnight in the hospital (\"23 hour\" stay) and they took the catheter out the morning I went home. The pain wasn't too bad but I'm sure that was helped by the oxy-whatever-they-are pills I slept on the couch from Tuesday night to Saturday night as it was much easier to sleep propped up versus laying down and trying to get up and down felt like someone had a fish hook in the bottom of my right testicle and was yanking on it if I moved \"wrong\" or too fast ... as you can guess, it did NOT feel good! So the couch it was until last night. I've only been taking Advil and Tylenol since getting home - too worried about getting constipation like I had after the prostate was removed and they didn't tell me it would be an issue back then. The \"fish hook\" feeling is still there but to a much, much lesser degree (at only 1 week out). The 1st couple of days were great in regards to incontinence, the next couple, not so good. Today (3/20) is better. I'm trying to be real good and following the drs orders. He said to not lift more than 10-15 #'s and I've limited it to a gallon of milk which is 8.34 # when full. No bending to floor, squatting and don't spread legs apart farther than shoulders. Kind of a pain to follow but the pain will remind me if I do too much. Now that the wind storm and snow storms (Rochester, NY) are over, I can walk around the neighborhood in the evenings and I returned to work today (man am I tired!). So far I've been feeling better each day. I just hope it was the right thing to do! John",

      "Content": "I'm ~15 months post radical robotic prostatectomy (Da Vinci) and still have both, stress and urgency incontinence. I've tried \"all\" of the medications for the urgency (and they were too expensive anyway). I've done the kegels and even tried reducing my intake of fluids. I go through 1-4 large pads a day, not soaked but quite uncomfortable to wear (and they leak if I let them go too long). The dr said I'm a good candidate for the AdVance male urinary sling surgery and says that it \"should\" get me back to where I was pre-sugery when I only had urinary urgency but no leakage and I could hold it until I got to a bathroom. I say the dr said \"should\" because he also said he makes no guarantees ... which I understand. I've changed my life because of this - I don't go on long walks with my wife because I can't hold back the urgency. I no longer go on Boy Scouts camp outs or other outings with my 2 boys and I have to be careful where I go, making sure I don't intake too many fluids and I always carry a spare pad in my back pocket. Has anyone had this surgery and what should I expect? Thanks, John",
