      "Content": "Thanks, ASA and Djinn. I realize that I wasn't clear enough. I'm still getting the hang of this stuff... 1. My initial 12-core TRUS biopsy came up G6 in 2 cores: one each in the right and left anterior apexes. 2. A 1.5T mpMRI 6+ weeks later revealed that the right apex malignancy was part of a lesion that the pathologist measured at 1.6cm, and said \"is considered PI-5\" (even though my urologist, in our talk a week later, said that while PI-5 is indeed deeply suspicious of cancer, he thought it was more likely a 3-4). 3. A second targeted UroNAV biospy was indeed centered on that right apex transition zone lesion. While the TRUS found 2 positive cores of G6 out of 12 (one on each side), the UroNAV took 6 cores on the right and found only one that was G6 - presumably indicating a third core that I'm \"guessing\" was near the first positive core on that side but don't really know for sure. It should be noted that in his ultrasound Dr. Bahn reduced the size of the 1.6mm lesion (I hadn't been given its width before) to 9x10mm. This seems to me a significant difference (?). He also measured my PSA at 1.8, up from 1.2 last August; and that in turn down from my last PSA of 1.4 in Feb. 2015. 4. Due to the left side's lesion's ill-defined nature (my wife and I both saw it on the ultrasound; the one of the left was fuzzy vs. the more distinct one on the right), Bahn believes it \"could be the index tumor\", and measured its size at 8x7mm. 5. After the UroNAV my urologist had told me that he was concerned that there might be more cancer there and therefore wasn't comfortable with just watching it. He also spoke about not wanting to miss the \"treatment window\", which I understand from speaking with others (at my local support group and another local group) is at the very least subject to medical opinion. That of course opens up a whole world of discussion! 6. Last weekend we attended the mid-year conference of Drs. Scholz and Moyad's Prostate Cancer Research Institute meeting. Educational if a bit thick at the science end (especially for a musician/writer like me and my retired educator wife...). One of the speakers was Dr. Kirk Wojno, who heads the path dept of a big urology group in Michigan. I was able to grab him for a quick question after his presentation and asked if it had been a mistake (so to speak) for my hospital not to have sent ALL my cores to Dr. Epstein for review a month ago (including even the positive ones from both biopsies). I had anticipated his yes answer and was not disappointed. Well, that is, I WAS disappointed that only the uroNAV slides had been sent. Oh well. 7. Finally: Kaiser, where we have our coverage, refused to send out my samples for OncotypeDX. I'd heard they were notoriously tight-fisted when it came to these things, even though Medicare will pay for it. So either I cough up the $4K myself, or leave Kaiser during open enrollment in November and buy a likely quite expensive supplemental policy myself. I just turned 65 in November and must admit to not knowing too much about how all this works. I hope this clears up what for me is still a steep learning process. Really more of a maze that I'm trying to negotiate blindfolded and with my legs in a sack! Thanks to both of you, and everyone here, for your knowledge and kindness. SC",

But what little I've heard about costs are all over the map (i.e. $5K or $6K to $25K.... big diff!) so I feel it's warranted to explore it. In my general area it's offered at UCLA, City of Hope and USC - all are NIH Cancer Centers and well-respected. Let's see what we see!",

I know it's been approved for use in this country since 2015, and that insurance (or at any rate Medicare) only pays for the hospital part of the procedure. I'm fine with these restrictions if I feel it would be right for me.... and two major hospitals in this area do it. Thanks, guys!",

      "Content": "It seems I've caught a case of prostate cancer, lucky me. I've been down a similar road: metastatic squamous cell carcinoma (head and neck) 9 years ago at age 55, treated with a big surgery and 31 days of IMRT. NED since then and I have every reason to believe it will never trouble me again, so bullet #1 (or more accurately, cannon shell) dodged. After meeting with a RO and a second urologist (he specializes in robotic surgery) I learned that I have a Gleason score of 3+3=6, clinically T1c. All three of the MDs including my initial urologist told me that the grading system - i.e. 1 for me - was now the norm rather than the Gleason score. My most recent PSA was 1.2, in fact down a tick from 1.4 at my last check in 2015. So I gather I'm in a pretty good place under the circumstances. I'm set to have an MRI in December after the biopsy sites heal, and then - oh goodie - a second confirmatory biopsy soon after that. In advance of those tests the docs are provisionally recommending Active Surveillance. Urologist #2 (a younger guy who seems to be on top of the latest stuff) expects a good result from the MRI and thinks it extremely unlikely that the cancer has gone anywhere outside the prostate. He mentioned optional genetic testing and said it would be a large chunk out of pocket. Dunno if Medicare, which I go on in a couple of weeks, will help with that or not but I'll certainly inquire if I decide to go that route. He did tell me that of all his patients who paid for it, none received bad news. As I recall he said that perhaps 10% of men would find out that their cancer is of the more aggressive type (or words to that effect, can't remember exactly). I'd love to get members' opinions as well as any suggestions for questions I should ask or other tests I might explore. I'm in my first week of gathering knowledge - have a couple of books on the subject, one recommended by the urologist called \"Surviving Prostate Cancer\" by Dr. Patrick Walsh. Also per his advice I've ordered pomegranate extract, Guanabana and Moringa. My dear friends at Amazon dot com should be showing up any minute with those. Thanks, guys. SC",

      "Content": "Djinn - thanks for your usual lightning-quick reply. To the best of my knowledge they took...hmm... I think it was 12 cores the first time, of which 2 were positive at 5% and 15% on the right and left respectively The fusion biopsy took 6 more, of which 1 was positive at 10%. Which I interpret to mean that the other 5 (and these were all targeted from that 1.5 cm mass) were not positive. That's an interesting comment \"too much of a tumor burden\", and I guess that's what my uro is thinking too. At any event I have a phone convo scheduled with him in a week. I also joined a local support group that meets next Monday, so maybe someone will have more insight for me there too - to add to yours and anyone else who might chime in on this post! I really appreciate your taking the time to consider my situation and respond so thoughtfully. Also love your avatar.... that's Le Doanier Rousseau, no?",

      "Content": "Well, you guys are great. A thousand thanks to all of you with a special \"shout out\" (as the young folk put it) to Djin for his comprehensive treatise! To particulars: ASA - thank you for the genetic testing info. Obviously all this is new to me but I'll certainly abide by your suggestions if and when I decide to go that route. NO QUESTION that if I do indeed elect AS I'll be staying very much on top of the testing. As I recall, the urologist is recommending PSA testing 3x a year (did I hear that right...? will be seeing him again in Dec so will verify). Chuck - thanks for all that you do around here. I do indeed have the 4th edition of the Walsh book and began reading it last night. Clearly a treasure trove of info from what appears to be one of the giants in the field. I also sent you a PM about the signature business; I may have missed the confirmatory email that will enable this. Southsider - thanks for those reassuring words and the info on further biopsies. Much needed from a frightened newcomer! Djin - as I said, I really appreciate all that golden info. I'm not particularly a vitamins and supplements guy, and having worked in the advertising biz for 20 years it takes a LOT of propaganda to convince me of anything. Those three I bought were recommended by the urologist (who said, as I'd long heard, that saw palmetto and cranberry juice were placebos). It's interesting to read about the testing/non-testing of these things and I will take all of your advice to heart. I'll also certainly inquire about paying for the gene testing via Medicare if I go that route. I tend to think that I'm doing a lot for my health anyway - haven't eaten meat in 40 years, never smoked, gave up alcohol after my cancer 9 years ago and sugar nearly 2 years ago; my wife and I walk at least an hour a day and do the gym 3x a week, etc. Trying as best I can to help my body fight all this junk!

      "Content": "Hello the group: so in reading some posts (I'm new) the issue of pain relief following surgery, etc. comes up now and then. During my 2009 head and neck cancer treatment I was eating Oxycodone like candy, and even added a Fentanyl patch for the last week of rads. I know these were lifesavers, but of course come with their own risks and unpleasantness, to say nothing of the possibility of dependence (luckily not for me but I know it happens). Perhaps some of you know about kratom. It's much in the news nowadays mainly because of the FDA and DEA's attempts to outlaw it, unfortunately. Kratom, which usually comes in powdered form, is the crushed leaf of a relative of the coffee tree that grows primarily in Indonesia (Kalimantan) and SE Asia. It's a natural analgesic that helps with pain, anxiety and a whole host of other issues. It is used extensively here in the USA, including as an aid to getting off opiods. I want to be clear (and speaking of clearing, I've done that with our moderator Chuck): kratom does not cure anything. It merely helps with those afore-mentioned issues and is an organic alternative to the stronger pharma products. You can look it up - there's a good wikipedia page. Anyone interested in more info please feel free to PM me. Thanks for listening. SC",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by Michael F Hi SC! You are on top this! Only those who have experienced H/N curative treatments can understand the associated pain and effects that you have been through. We can assure you that pain/discomfort following RP is both minimal and brief - in most cases. Before deciding that surgery is on the horizon, take time to: - Rule In or Out Active Surveillance - Seek expert 2nd opinions to make a highly informed determination as to which treatment option best addresses your specific pathology, overall health status & psyche - Ultimately you want to be treated by an expert MD who specializes in PCa If RP is your shared decision, be certain that your URO Surgeon is highly experienced (averaging 3-5 RPs per week). Robotic does offer advantages of less blood loss and no long incision. If deciding between Open vs Robotic RP, keep in mind that a highly skilled \"Open\" RP URO Surgeon is a better choice than an inexperienced \"Robotic\" URO Surgeon. Keep asking questions & seeking expert MD advice. Good luck getting all of the issues into clear focus! MF Thanks again, Michael. From everything I've heard (from the docs) and read (here and in Patrick Walsh's book) I'm a good candidate for AS. Scheduled for an MRI on 12/6 then another visit with the robotics Uro (he's done 400 of them and I hope I don't have need of his expertise for many years, if at all) and finally a confirmatory biopsy in the new year. So far so good!",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by Another My surgery experience had discomfort, but very little pain requiring treatment. Standard over the counter pain relief was more than enough and I didn't need much of that. Eating oxycodone like candy is never a good idea. Hope your doing so didn't cause long term problems for you. I agree on the oxy-candy advice. However it was unfortunately necessary. In fact at the time I'd never heard of it, knew nothing of opioid abuse and only needed something to deal with the incredible, increasing pain of having my body radiated every day for 31 days from my mandibles to my clavicle- and for a good month afterward as I was still \"cooking\". Please understand, I'm not looking for sympathy when I type this: just stating facts. Right now it all seems like a kind of dream. (and no, no long term problems but I appreciate your concern!)",

      "Content": "Well, you guys are great. A thousand thanks to all of you with a special \"shout out\" (as the young folk put it) to Djin for his comprehensive treatise! To particulars: ASA - thank you for the genetic testing info. Obviously all this is new to me but I'll certainly abide by your suggestions if and when I decide to go that route. NO QUESTION that if I do indeed elect AS I'll be staying very much on top of the testing. As I recall, the urologist is recommending PSA testing 3x a year (did I hear that right...? will be seeing him again in Dec so will verify). Chuck - thanks for all that you do around here. I do indeed have the 4th edition of the Walsh book and began reading it last night. Clearly a treasure trove of info from what appears to be one of the giants in the field. I also sent you a PM about the signature business; I may have missed the confirmatory email that will enable this. Southsider - thanks for those reassuring words and the info on further biopsies. Much needed from a frightened newcomer! Djin - as I said, I really appreciate all that golden info. I'm not particularly a vitamins and supplements guy, and having worked in the advertising biz for 20 years it takes a LOT of propaganda to convince me of anything. Those three I bought were recommended by the urologist (who said, as I'd long heard, that saw palmetto and cranberry juice were placebos). It's interesting to read about the testing/non-testing of these things and I will take all of your advice to heart. I'll also certainly inquire about paying for the gene testing via Medicare if I go that route. I tend to think that I'm doing a lot for my health anyway - haven't eaten meat in 40 years, never smoked, gave up alcohol after my cancer 9 years ago and sugar nearly 2 years ago; my wife and I walk at least an hour a day and do the gym 3x a week, etc. Trying as best I can to help my body fight all this junk! I look forward one day to being able to help other members. For now I'm just all ears here! All the Best. David Ah... now I see the signature.",

      "Content": "Djinn - thanks for your usual lightning-quick reply. To the best of my knowledge they took...hmm... I think it was 12 cores the first time, of which 2 were positive at 5% and 15% on the right and left respectively The fusion biopsy took 6 more, of which 1 was positive at 10%. Which I interpret to mean that the other 5 (and these were all targeted from that 1.5 cm mass) were not positive. That's an interesting comment \"too much of a tumor burden\", and I guess that's what my uro is thinking too. At any event I have a phone convo scheduled with him in a week. I also joined a local support group that meets next Monday, so maybe someone will have more insight for me there too - to add to yours and anyone else who might chime in on this post! I really appreciate your taking the time to consider my situation and respond so thoughtfully. Also love your avatar.... that's Le Doanier Rousseau, no?",
