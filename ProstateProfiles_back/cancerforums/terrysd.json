      "Content": "Limerose - I had surgery in 2014 also and my psa was 0.0 until a yr ago was 0.1 then 0.2 feb 2018 and 0.3 in aug. I had no symptoms at all with the growth. Comment from the Dr is that you may not feel anything until 2. or 4. so early detection is very important. I just had a Lupron shot and starting Radiation Treatment -RT- in 2 weeks. Had bone scan, MRI and CT scan and nothing shows but there is an 85% chance it is in the area where the prostate was. So they will hit that area and some lymph nodes in the area. We place trust in the history of the PSA testing as I feel just fine - no different than I have felt in the past 3 yrs. I guess we just need to trust the Dr and what they know!",
