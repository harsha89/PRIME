      "Content": "Hello All...I found this forum this morning and have read a few of the threads...I don't feel quite as isolated as I did. I am quite impressed with the various member's signatures, I guess I'll have to construct mine as time allows, which I have plenty of at current. I had been seeing my urologist for BPH for a couple of years, with PSA's in the low to mid 3's...after a couple of PSAs greater than 4 biopsy was suggested, performed, and confirmed cancer in April of this year. I had DaVinci surgery on 7/27 and the cath was removed 8/4 (4 days ago). Scott Tully, in Birmingham is my surgeon, and thus far I'm very pleased with him and his staff. Still in quite a bit of discomfort as it relates to one of the incision sites (the one on my right side) and of course there is some discomfort, though not a lot of pain, relating to the surgery site inside. I'm using between 3-5 pads per day, but am concerned that I am visiting the bathroom quite often, with very little results. Urination comes pretty freely and quite easily, but, even though my bladder feels full, there is only a small amount of urine...then 20 minutes or so later...time to go again...a pattern that seems to repeat itself for a while. Is this pretty common? I'm not really someone who likes to bug the doctor unless its pretty significant. I'm also a bit confused about the Kegels...I've read about them, and, of course, practiced them prior to the surgery, but post-surgery, I'm still learning about the best time & way to practice them, so this forum has provided some helpful info regarding those. My wife of 33 years is incredibly supportive. I'm hoping to return to work after Labor Day. Sorry for the long post, lots of info to digest here, I suppose. I am grateful to find this forum and, while I obviously would prefer not to be a member of this type of fraternity, I am glad to be among those whose experiences may be similar to mine and that I might be able to learn, and in time, contribute a little too. Many thanks!",

      "Content": "Hello All...I found this forum this morning and have read a few of the threads...I don't feel quite as isolated as I did. I am quite impressed with the various member's signatures, I guess I'll have to construct mine as time allows, which I have plenty of at current. I had been seeing my urologist for BPH for a couple of years, with PSA's in the low to mid 3's...after a couple of PSAs greater than 4 biopsy was suggested, performed, and confirmed cancer in April of this year. I had DaVinci surgery on 7/27 and the cath was removed 8/4 (4 days ago). Scott Tully, in Birmingham is my surgeon, and thus far I'm very pleased with him and his staff. Still in quite a bit of discomfort as it relates to one of the incision sites (the one on my right side) and of course there is some discomfort, though not a lot of pain, relating to the surgery site inside. I'm using between 3-5 pads per day, but am concerned that I am visiting the bathroom quite often, with very little results. Urination comes pretty freely and quite easily, but, even though my bladder feels full, there is only a small amount of urine...then 20 minutes or so later...time to go again...a pattern that seems to repeat itself for a while. Is this pretty common? I'm not really someone who likes to bug the doctor unless its pretty significant. I'm also a bit confused about the Kegels...I've read about them, and, of course, practiced them prior to the surgery, but post-surgery, I'm still learning about the best time & way to practice them, so this forum has provided some helpful info regarding those. My wife of 33 years is incredibly supportive. I'm hoping to return to work after Labor Day. Sorry for the long post, lots of info to digest here, I suppose. I am grateful to find this forum and, while I obviously would prefer not to be a member of this type of fraternity, I am glad to be among those whose experiences may be similar to mine and that I might be able to learn, and in time, contribute a little too. Many thanks!",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by Michael F BTW, wish we could say the same about the Red Sox!!! Good luck! Ditto that... BTW...I'm 22 days post-op and 14 days post cath removal...I have had plenty of nights thus far with multiple bathroom trips, but, they are getting less frequent...I'm optimistic that they will continue to diminish. I thought I was losing my mind for a couple of nights...up every hour, pee a little, go back to sleep...repeat over and over...its not as bad, although I do notice a pattern...if I drink tea or coke at night, the caffeine usually makes for a longer night, so I'm trying to limit my caffeine intake after lunch-time.

Im scheduled for DiVinci soon and been asking questions about anticipated time away from work. Comments have ranged from 3-4 weeks. For you it was 7 weeks so Im just curious as to how it was decided that 7 weeks was the appropriate time. Look forward to your reply. I had heard anywhere from 6-8 weeks anecdotally, but my urologist told me about 4 weeks, so that was my original plan...but everyone that I spoke with that had undergone the procedure pretty much told me that 4 weeks might not be enough, so I kinda figured 6 would be about right. I friend of mine had the same surgery 7 years ago. He & I are both Respiratory Therapists, so I know his work routine. However, he worked at a large acute care hospital at the time, so the activity level at his job was a bit higher than where I work...I work for a pediatric homecare company, so my level of activity may vary quite a bit from day to day...some days are spent mostly in my office at my desk, others may be spent almost entirely on the road, others may be doing teaching at the hospital, so the activity level is not as constant. But my friend went back after 4 weeks and his words were something like \"my first day back, I'd been at work about an hour and all I could think was \"My God what have I done?\"...so I planned on 6...and it was about right...however, at the middle of week 5, I was having some persistent and not-so-mild pain at a couple of the incision sites, so I told my office that I was taking off an extra week...by the start of the 6th week, however, the pain was much better and I probably could have went on back after the 6th week, but I had already arranged it for the 7th week, so I just went with it...and I'm glad I did. It was good spending an extra week at home...no regrets in that regard. I just tried very hard to not to \"push it\" or over-do it and I think that strategy worked, softball game notwithstanding (see one of my earlier posts ). I hope this info helps and all the best with your surgery and recovery...I'm very glad I found this forum...its been a big help and source of info, as well as camaraderie. All the best!",

Haven't been on line much... tragedy hit my household this summer...my wife & I lost our 24 year old son on July 9th, so its been a really rough summer and, to say the least, I have been quite distracted & otherwise occupied with all that has been involved with taking care of his final affairs, caring for the rest of my family, and finally going back to work. My urologist retired last spring, so the new one is following up pretty much like the old one was, so I'll see him again around the beginning of the new year. All the best.",

Here is my concern...I'm experiencing some tenderness in my right testicle. Nothing too dramatic, just enough to be a nuisance. Is there anyone else, this far removed from surgery that has experienced or is experiencing this? One other caveat...this seems to be occurring a few days after my wife & I have sex, but this time it seems to be hanging on for a couple of extra days. I thought I would give it a few more days before calling the doc, but its getting harder to ignore.",

      "Content": "Hello all...it's been a while since I've posted...I have a question. To review, I have the DaVinci surgery July 2015, with a good outcome, in my opinion, and no real issues in the last 6 - 10 months. Last week my wife & I went to watch our grandson's soccer game and I sat on regular metal bleachers for the game (we forgot our stadium seats). After the game I was walking to the car and I noticed that I was having some discomfort. By the time I got to the car, it was almost unbearable. We cancelled our dinner plans and went home. I took some naproxin and retreated to my chair. This pain lasted a couple of days before it subsided to the point of not being on my mind. I assume that my sitting on the flat bleachers was the cause of it, of course, but I'd never experienced anything like this. Has anyone else had a similar experience/problem, especially this far out from their procedure?",

      "Content": "Hey Folks...been a while since I've posted...thought I would share this...had my latest PSA, last week got the results and we're still at zero! The only complicating factor was that the office lost my results for a few days and when the nurse called me, and I've know her almost my whole life as we went to the same high school, her first words were, \"Hey Greg, uh, its Sherri...you got a minute?\"...well, these were the first word/tone I heard when she called me to tell me that my PSA had gone way up prior, the one that triggered the biopsy. Sort of scared me for a few seconds...but she just wanted to apologize for the delay and give me the results...afterwards I was fine, but I'll tell you, that first few seconds kinda made my gut tighten a bit...but all is well, thankfully so.",
