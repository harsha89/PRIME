      "Content": "I really appreciate everyone's thoughts about this. It really got us thinking about what would happen \"mid-stream\" (pardon the pun) if he was in treatment and got a call for a transplant. I think phone calls to the transplant doctors are in order. He also has his regular monthly dialysis clinic on Thursday and they are aware of what is going on and so I'm assuming a conversation will take place about all of this. I'm a little relieved that we do have a little bit of time to make any decisions. That being said, how many of you would suggest a second opinion?",

      "Content": "Hello, My husband, just turned 59 on Tuesday has been diagnosed with prostate cancer. His PSA test was 3.9. Biopsy shows 1 out of 12 samples is positive. Gleason of 6. Doctor discussed four options with us. 1. Removal 2. Radiation (M-F for 8 weeks - says takes about 5 mins but 1/2 hour total each day). 3. Seeds 4. Wait and see. He highly recommends #4 option of wait and see, with returning for an office visit every 3 months and a repeat PSA every 3 months. Of course you can imagine the things going through our minds. I should tell you that he is also a kidney dialysis patient (we do his hemo dialysis treatments at home 5 times a week) He is a high school biology teacher (also teaches summer school). He is on three transplant lists for almost two years now. We are wondering what others might have done in the same situation where the doctor recommends a \"wait and see\" option.",
