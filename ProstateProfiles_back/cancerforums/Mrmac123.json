      "Content": "Update - I saw the Doc at 9 weeks and my PSA was less than .01 I got a chest x ray and it was negative, so I concluded it must be the 15 pounds I had packed on. I started a new diet and the 15 plus is now gone. Back to my pre op weight and feeling much better. Working out again and making progress. Still having minimal erectile function, but trusting that this too shall pass. No regrets.",

      "Content": "I had my surgery (Da Vinci) on 8/7/13. First post op PSA was .01, second one next week. Had a 5.11 going in with a 3/3/6 Gleason. I'm 51, taking cialis and unable to get an erection. Leakage is a very minor problem. I still feel bloated, tire easily, and experience shortness of breath. Having a hard time getting back to my workout routine. Any comments on this? Thanks",
