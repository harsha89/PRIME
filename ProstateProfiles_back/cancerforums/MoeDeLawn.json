      "Content": "Hello -- I am a 63 year old retiree, went to the urologist for the first time in January at the advice of my family doc following a 5.7 PSA. I have no symptoms and no family history of cancer. After a digital exam by a PA who nearly decided that things felt OK enough that we should wait and see, the decision was to err on the side of caution and schedule a biopsy. When the biopsy samples were examined, one of the 12 cores showed abnormal cells, but it could not be determined whether or not these were cancerous, and the doctor decided to send the sample to Johns Hopkins for further study. I now have a follow-up appointment this week to find out what Johns Hopkins said and where we go from here. Obviously, I've been doing as much reading as possible online, and I think I know what's what going in. But many of you have already been through this, so I'd like to ask you -- what do I need to ask, and what do I need to find out when I meet with my doctor this week? My game plan at this point to hope for the best -- maybe a finding that merits watching and waiting instead of immediate treatment -- but be prepared for something more negative. If I do get bad news, my thought is to go back to my family doctor and review the pathology report with him, ask his opinion of the finding and whether he thinks I should seek a 2nd opinion from another urologist. Does that make sense in your experience -- did you go with your biopsy doctor's suggestion for treatment right away, or did you seek other input? Any information or suggestions you may have would be very much appreciated. Thanks... Moe",

In answer to a couple of the questions posed: -- Appointment for biopsy results is this Wednesday afternoon. -- PSAs for the past three years: 3.8 (10/16); 3.2 (3/17); and 5.2 (not 5.7 as I mistakenly put in my introduction, this past January).
