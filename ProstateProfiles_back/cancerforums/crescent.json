    "Content": "I'm new to the forum. My insurance is rejecting the MRI/Ultrasound fusion guided biopsy. It has me melancholy for the moment. I cannot understand why such a diagnostic tool is not approved but a technique where one shoots in the dark is. I had a regular TRUS biopsy in August that resulted in Gleason 6, 1 core, very small. PSA is 3.7. Prostate is estimated at 70 grams. I know it's a mild case. But I'd like to know that's the extent of it. Are there options other than going to the state board of appeals?",
