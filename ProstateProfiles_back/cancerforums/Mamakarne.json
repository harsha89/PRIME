      "Content": "I'm not posting this for sympathy. I'm posting this so that the next person in a situation like me might have an idea of what to expect. Because I was incredibly unprepared and had a hospital full of doctor's who promised that his prognosis was good. Just a little background. My dad had some kind of prostate procedure May of 2012. He was having difficulty urinating and they did some kind of procedure that was supposed to help with that. After the procedure he still had issues and twice had to go in and have a catheter put in to allow him to urinate. He continued to be treated by his urologist and his primary care physician. In August of 2012 he had his annual physical. I'm presuming that his PSA was checked since he was 66 at the time. In November after Thanksgiving my dad started to not feel well. It was almost as though he had the flu. He was achy. He had trouble breathing. He just wasn't well. For a month the doctor did tests and discovered a blood clot in his lungs. They treated him with a blood thinner. I think it started with a z. At this point his PCP left the country to do a service project. My dad was seeing another doctor in that office. This doctor told him that often times a blood clot in the lungs was a sign of cancer elsewhere in the body. He continued on the blood thinner. They drew lab after lab. He continued to get worse. In January I took him to the doctor. He was struggling to breathe. He couldn't get air. He had pain in his hips and in his lower back. (This is a man who doesn't ever admit to pain---like most of you I'm guessing). They put him on oxygen. They did more labs, a chest xray. They did a cat scan. Always looking above his waist because of his breathing issues. He had lost almost 40 pounds in three months. On February 21st (on his third visit to the ER in a month) he was admitted. Praise God! The next morning I was informed by a pulmonologist that my dad had hemolytic anemia. They weren't sure why. He said they would probably have to do a bone marrow biopsy and a muscle biopsy. The next day they did the bone marrow biopsy (which incidentally hurts, even superdad commented on how painful it was). The next morning we were visited by the oncologist. She said she had good news that it wasn't leukemia or lymphoma but that it was cancer and it had already contaminated 90% of his bone marrow. She said it looked to be prostate cancer because his PSA was 164 (at this point I had no idea what normal was) but she did say it was off the chart. They then wanted to do an MRI to look at his liver and his prostate. She told us the prognosis was good. That she had seen worse pull out and survive. They did the MRI. They confirmed prostate cancer. They did this by stains from the bone marrow. They told us that often times you can identify the cancers origin by the cancer cells. My dad's cell were so mutated that they couldn't tell what cells they had originally been. My dad continued to struggle to breathe and have pain in his back and hips. He was moved to ICU. They began hormone interruption therapy with casodex and lupron. They told us things looked good. An 85% survival rate. They did a bone scan. They said that all of his body was covered with tumors. His bones were all infected. They moved him out of ICU. He continued to not be able to breathe. He was on 15 liters and couldn't keep his oxygen at 90%. The doctor decided that we had to see what the problem was in his lungs. Back to ICU. They put him on the ventilator and did a bronchoscopy. They wanted to do a lung biopsy but my stepmom refused to give consent. They had been treating him for pneumonia with no results for days. All the scope could really do was look for bacteria or infection. They found none. He successfully came off the ventilator two days later. Praise God again. Still he struggled to breath. Now his liver numbers were doubling each day. I was searching on google and found that prostate cancer metastasizes in the bones, lungs and liver. I asked the oncologist. They told me no, that was incorrect. Prostate cancer doesn't act like that. They put him on a bipap machine. His kidneys were now failing. His liver was shutting down and so were his kidneys. The doctor told us that we had options. We could put him back on the ventilator and aggressively treat him. OR we could make him comfortable. I told the doctor I needed a number. Best case scenario, we aggressively treat, what are we looking at. He told me 2-3 days. WHAT??? That's an option?! My stepmom opted to make him comfortable and transfer to the hospice floor. He never made it there. He died quietly that evening. Two weeks after he was admitted to the hospital. All along I had false hope despite what I would read on the internet. I had doctors telling me how good things looked. He was going to make it. Not one doctor in that hospital EVER even mentioned that he may not go home. I hope perhaps that this helps prepare someone. Don't give up hope, but don't deny what could happen either. I wish each of you health. I will continually pray for a cure for prostate cancer. May God bless you.",

      "Content": "Thank you all so much for your condolences. It has been a horribly difficult time. But I prayed for two weeks for my dad to either get well or for him not to suffer. He didn't suffer long--at least while he was in the hospital. I am in Denver, CO. My father was in Greeley, CO at North Colorado Medical Center. Of course I am angry with his doctors. Someone, somewhere dropped the ball. I understand that he had a very aggressive form of prostate cancer but I just can't believe that he could have possibly had a normal PSA at his physical in August. And even if he did, WHY didn't they check him again when he presented with symptoms. I can only assume that my dad had so many issues with his lungs because he had smoked for many years. He had been smoke free for the last almost 20 years, but he probably smoked for close to 30 years. I so wish that the doctors had been honest with us. I wish that they had not tempted us with performing more tests and offering hope. The hormone treatment was the only treatment that they gave him. They talked of giving him something to strengthen his bones but decided that he wasn't healthy enough for the injection. mkane09--I will include you in my prayers. I believe that your doctors will provide for your wishes. I think that until my dad's liver began to fail that the doctors may have actually held out hope. I read some posts on here of people who were almost as bad as my dad and had been given better news. Once his liver began failing they should have talked to us. Instead my google research was confirmed. I agree that you are a wise and courageous man. I hope that you do not have to suffer more than you already have. God bless you.",
