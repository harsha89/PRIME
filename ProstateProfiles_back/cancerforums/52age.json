      "Content": "hi all new member here in the age of 52 had annual physical and blood test yielded PSA 4.1 in may of this year went to URO in june, performed DRE and prostate was found to be normal, did another round of PSA and it's 4.0 URO recommended biopsy since the PSA should be around 2.5 to 3.0 at my age and that the size of the prostate is not enlarged i am contemplating/debating my next step. 1. go ahead with the biopsy with this URO whom i am not entirely comfortable with because he didn't really seem to examine my prostate thoroughly (he quickly and quite harshly inserted for about a second and immediately removed his finger and that was it. i felt like he didn't really spend much time feeling around the prostate). when i asked him about the risks/side effects of the biopsy and potential surgery, he was impatient and cut me off and just gave me all the statistic in a rehearsed manner. i said i wanted to think about it and will get back to him. 2. go see another URO and get a second opinion, do another round of PSA and have another DRE i don't experience any symptoms until this past week, i notice that starting urinating seems to take a bit longer and the stream seems to be a bit weaker. no pain, no blood. any thoughts and comments will be greatly appreciated. thanks!",

      "Content": "thank you all for the valuable recommendations and advice, i really appreciate it. i made an appointment with another URO at NYU langone which seems to be one of the leading institutes in the disease? but they couldn't get me in until early september based on what i read, the slow growing PCa takes a rather long time to grow and the fast growing one usually shows a double PSA value in a short time. considering that the may result was 4.1 and the june result was 4.0, that's not exactly indicating a fast growing one?",
