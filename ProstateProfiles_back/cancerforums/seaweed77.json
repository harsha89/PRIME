      "Content": "Many of the other posters seem to recommend surgery as the only \"cure\". Well I will give you another opinion. I had a radical robotic prostatechtomy at the urging of my urologist in 2009 at the age of 46. My PSA never zeroed out and was climbing again within a year. I had radiation in 2011 when my PSA reached .76 and now my PSA is climbing again. Additionally, I was impotent for nearly a year after surgery and still suffer some leakage on occassion which my urolgist admits will continue to get worse with age. Do not feel rushed to have the surgery. Continue to explore all options.",

      "Content": "I was diagnosed with prostate cancer in 2009 and rushed into a radical robotic prostatechtomy. My PSA never zeroed out after the surgery and when it got close to 1.00 again, my urologist recommended radiation. I had radiation treatment in 2011 and now my PSA is approaching 1.00 again. I have an appointment with my urologist today and am seeking a referral to the University of Wisconsin Carbone Cancer Center, which seems to be the most progressive and comprehensive treatment center in our area. I am 49 years old and in all other ways healthy and active. Any insight would be helpful.",
