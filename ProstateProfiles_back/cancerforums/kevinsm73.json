    "Content": "Hello, my wife (marysm) has been speaking with you about my PCa and surgery last week 11/10. Would like to say a big thanks for all the advise and concern. My surgery went uneventful and now on to recovery. Had one day (Sunday) where I had sweats and a bad headache but that has pasted. My pain level was fine, I took pain meds in the hospital and only Advil once home. The catheter came out yesterday, I couldn't be happier. Spoke to the Doctor and was upgraded to Gleason 7, 45% off prostate had cancer. He stated that it was a more advanced then the biopsy showed, very close to entering the urethra. We had made the best decision of removal. Okay, he said, I dodged a bullet. I am looking on the hospital website for the pathology report. My appt. was at 5pm and I forgot to ask for a print out. When I get it I can list more information. Any advise on recovery is welcome. I will be out for a full 6 weeks and really do as told. I seem to get tired early evening and go to bed early. And going to the bathroom a lot! Before it seemed like I never went. Treated at Concord Hospital Concord NH/ Dr. Santis Thanks- Kevin",
