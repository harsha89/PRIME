I am on testosterone injections for a year and a half to keep up my sex drive and strength. I had an implant last summer and now I am a porn star in the bed. Almost feel like i am glad I had the cancer LOL. If anyone is trying to debate weather to have surgery or chemicals to battle this cancer, I will be more than happy to answer any question you may have. Any one that had surgery and doesn't at less look into a implant is not being fair to their selves. This is the greatest invention by man.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by DjinTonic Hi Tybeeman. Could you check your lab reports -- I'm not understanding all those \"<\" signs through 2015. I don't think they should be there. It's reasonable that your recent <0.01 less-than signs are correct -- it would mean that the PSA test you had doesn't measure below 0.01, so your exact value can't be further determined. Do check whether your last result was indeed <0.03 and not 0.03. If it was <0.03, you can't deduce anything, because your PSA could still be <0.1. However, if your last test was 0.3, you should discuss it with your doc and perhaps retest to see if it is accurate and therefore a true increase. Be sure to look at (and request if necessary) the original results from the lab doing the test. Also, be sure to keep testing with the same test from the same lab. Didn't notice that it is just .03",

They were unclear in the language and options. They called the 0.02 limit ultrasensitive. Lesson learned, your primary is good for screening. Go throuh your urologist/MO/RO and a national lab for post treatment testing. Yes I just checked this was done by a different lab All my others have been done by Labcorp. That was a little scare",

At my yearly physical my psa went from 2 to 13. I had a biopsy 3 weeks ago showing 2out of 16 with a Gleason 4+5 =9 Bone and CT negative. My doctor is great but seems to think there'll be more treatment after surgery. I asked about an MRI but it'll put treatment off for a couple of months. Appreciate any advice. Pat I am sorry to heir this and will keep you in my prayers but at least you caught it when you did. As Michael F says where are you located? I would start to find the best surgeon possible. Bringing that prostrate out the body needs to be done by the most experienced doctor you can find. Keep asking questions we all did",

Yeah it comes and goes.Just so you know I had a very light pad in my underwear at the 3 month mark. When I went in for the my 3 month check up Dr. Patel told me too take out the pad and quit using them. At first I was scare but it made me think about it so that built my muscle up even more. You will get a drip every once in the while that feels like guesser but it is hardly enough to wet your underwear much less your pants. Once you get to wearing pads if you have time and are still concern, weight them before and after removing them. That will show you how little of a drip you have. Get on injection as soon as you can and start a good therapy program.",

The problem with that is your insurance will probably not pay for that until you have at less one regular biopsy. Just my 2 cents and I am not a doctor.

Doctors put me on testosterone therapy after 3 months which is unheard of. I have read all these forums for the last 14 month that are very helpful. The one thing no one agrees on is when and how because everyone is different. The how is what I wish more people would talk about. Do you just wake up one morning and you have erections again are does it just start getting harder little by little. As i said I have no signs of an erection so if it is just a gradual process for me at 14 months it better start improving. Make sure you have support which the guys on here are good for. I have found my self very depressed an have come on here and got a lot of support. Now I am just depressed and trying to figure out my next move. I would also talk with your doctor and get on a injection program as soon as possible.",

Just wanted to say that for me it took two years to get a decent erection. However I did have some signs of life before that. And now after 28 months it is ok again. I don´t really know where I am going with this all I am saying is that it can take a long time to make it work again. Well I have done the rounds and interviewed 3 urologist. They all said I would never get back to where I was and my erection will be limited. I had a very active sex life leading up to RP 4 to 5 times a week. It is hell seeing a naked woman you love get in the bed and you get excite with no sign of an erection. I don't want to knock anyone but some guys sex is not a big deal, but the ones of us that it is a big deal they need to be prepared mentally for the 18 months to a year it takes to get it back",

(He did not experience this during the Lupron Treatment.) He had his regular Oncologist appointment this past week and he says it's most likely gynecomastia. (Good news, is that his PSA has been <.01 since treatment!) He then had him get blood work to see what testosterone level is currently at. We just got results back from the portal and the testosterone is receding for some reason. So his last Lupron (3 month) was given in November 2015. Last radiation was mid-December 2015. (Also had prostate out in March 2015) His Testosterone Results: (Standard range according to the hospital portal is 249-836 ng/dl) 5/13/16: 15 8/30/16: 176 11/15/16: 214 5/16/17: 169 We are still waiting to hear back from the oncologist on the result but during the appointment he said it wouldn't be normal for Testosterone to go backwards at this point. I can't seem to find any info on the testosterone climbing back to normal and then receding again. Of course the oncologist said (while we were chatting before this latest test result) that giving him testosterone is not an option -- as that could cause issues with any dormant cancer cells. But there are a lot of medical problems associated with low T levels too. He's had blood in his urine since he finished treatment. He's had (1) Cysto and nothing abnormal noted so they chalked it up to be part of the irritated bladder from the surgery/radiation, etc. He's been in the ER for kidney stones 3x since August. The most recent within 2 a month period. And at each cat scan they don't show any additional stone. So the last one formed quite quickly, within 2 months. Last Cat Scan Kidney also enlarged -- which wasn't an issue the first two stones. Going to see a Kidney Stone specialist on Monday....they say probably unrelated the prostate cancer and treatment...but I don't know....something just feels like it doesn't add up. And now his blood pressure is elevated too. His bladder control is very good. ED still pretty much sucks. He has a feeling there is something more going on although he's trying to stay positive. But he just feels crappy. He's working and trying to live a normal life. Just wondered if anyone has had the testosterone receding again or any input? Thanks guys! Gina Gina I had RP in February of 2016 at the 3 month test I asked if they would also check my testosterone, I just felt tired all the time and no sex drive at all. My testosterone level was at 59. The doctor put me on testosterone injects that day. I asked him wasn't it early to start testosterone this early after surgery and he said it no that I need to be at less 600. If i was to leave it low I would have no sex drive to think about he also said he wanted to keep me on watch every 3 months for a few years until I stayed zero. I am 58 years old and am glad he did. But now I have a sex drive with no erection so that part is not fun. I would get a second opinion. I did and both my surgeon and my local urologist agreed that they wanted the testosterone level at 600. One side note, at over 50 years old they did not want me on estrogen blocker. Both urologist and the cardiologist said the a high level of estrogen is good for the heart",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by Wilde Hello Tybeeman, it is very frustrating indeed and I am sure the implant will be fine. Just wanted to say that for me it took two years to get a decent erection. However I did have some signs of life before that. And now after 28 months it is ok again. I don´t really know where I am going with this all I am saying is that it can take a long time to make it work again. Well I have done the rounds and interviewed 3 urologist. They all said I would never get back to where I was and my erection will be limited. I had a very active sex life leading up to RP 4 to 5 times a week. It is hell seeing a naked woman you love get in the bed and you get excite with no sign of an erection. I don't want to knock anyone but some guys sex is not a big deal, but the ones of us that it is a big deal they need to be prepared mentally for the 18 months to a year it takes to get it back",

I had surgery. My advice to would would be there are really the big 3 Cancer, inconsistency and sex. How important is sex to you? If you are a once a week planed sex guy then if you have it removed there are injection that work for a lot of people. Inconsistency is another thing to consider. I think for most of us we got that back. The days of have to wear a dipper the rest of your life is slim. You may need a pad which to some people is a big deal. I had no problem with it after 2 months a had a slim pad that I hardly knew was in my underwear. Then there is the cancer. Unless you remove it, it will always be there in some type of state. I just couldn't live knowing that once day I will get a PSA at a high level and then be told that it can't remove it or it will be a high risk savage removal. The one small thing that you may not be worried about. with any radiation you will almost always have some type of recurrence in 20 years. that make you 87. At 56 I would be 76. My dad was 95 when he died and my mother is still alive at 93. I did want to deal with it at 76.",

Was wondering if anyone else has experience this and could this be a sign that I will be getting my erections back. It is a long process and I am sure most of you know I am very anxious. I started taking injections 6 months ago, with very little luck. I am on my 4th mix and now they are sending me another. If I do get an erection it hurts too bad to have an orgasm. Has anyone had the same problem? I have shot a lot of needles not to have any erections. Frustrating",

      "Content": "I healed well and quick, was back at my desk 6 days after surgery. Constancy is better now than it was before the surgery. I had a lot of problems with my enlarged prostrate. Start back with a heavy work out in the gym and have only had a few dips on some ab\u0092s work out. Erections, I have done the 14 months of pumping and daily Cialis. Started injections 6 months ago and have about 30% success with that but it is still painful and does not last long. Doctor still trying to change up the mix. Had an appointment with my local urologist last week and he said at this point, the likely hood of me getting my normal erections even with the pills is not good being that I have only had a few nocturnal erections. I am sure everyone on here that is married have, in their eyes, a beautiful wife. I got one that turns everyone\u0092s head. To have her walking around me all-day and me getting sexual aroused all the time is very frustrating. At what month post-surgery will I know it is not coming back? Before surgery I had sex 4 to 5 time a week. I am now where I am lucky to be successful having it work once a week, but even then, a lot of pain for a few hours after injecting. At what point should I start considering an Implant? I know I made the right decision because I am in the zero club and Doctor Patel along with my local urologist was so sure he got everything he put me on testosterone therapy at the 3-month mark. Which makes feel a hell of a lot better but of course horny as hell which is the double edge sword",
