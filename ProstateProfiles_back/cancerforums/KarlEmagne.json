      "Content": "Originally Posted by nmguy Karl I had a biopsy in November. Cipro morning of biopsy then 3 days after. Biopsy was not to bad just a little uncomfortable. It's best to know what you have one way or the other. I actually wanted a biopsy before they would do it. As you can see I will have surgery in a little over a week. I'm a 3+4=7 but would it have been better 2 years ago who knows. Just find out and try to stay positive. I don't know about everyone else but I have good days and bad days worrying about it but mainly try to stay positive that it will be cured. I had no really bad effects from biopsy just watch you temperature for 72 hours is what they told me. If goes to 100 or 101 go to ER and tell them Sepsis. Good luck. True, I'll only know more after the biopsy and there is absolutely nothing to be gained from worrying now. I was glad I got my appointment in just a week, even if I'm dreading the procedure / losing my virginity to an elephant. As said, I'm a bit of a nutcase With my biopsy in the afternoon I also tend to think I better start the antibiotics early in the morning, because it's important to keep taking them for long enough. How long did it take for you to get the results, btw?",

My urologist asked me three times if I wanted to go forward for fear I might cancel again as said I'm a nutcase but not completely crazy.

      "Content": "I'm 53 and judging from rapidly rising PSA I'll be in for RP very soon seriously NOT HAPPY! I'm a bit of a nutcase and so terrified of just that biopsy I opted out last year in the vain hope things might stabilize. I would have agreed to it earlier if not for the Cipro prescribed to prevent sepsis. I'm still somewhat in disbelief there is no better procedure for diagnostic purposes than one involving an antibiotic that's virtually guaranteed to make me sick in order to find out if I'm sick. On the upside, which is also a downside, PSA is now 11.8 so yes, I am sick. Enough of whining, here are my questions: 1. Start time for antibiotics: I picked up my prescription and have 6 pills of Cipro 500mg and one bag of Monurol 3g. Monurol to be taken the evening before biopsy. Cipro to be started the evening before biopsy and continued for three days. Now I'm wondering if the \"evening before\" instruction is based on the assumption of a morning time biopsy. Mine is scheduled for 2.30pm, and since the Cipro is to be taken morning and evening, I'm wondering if I should rather take the first Cipro and the Monurol in the morning of the biopsy? To rephrase the question, how many hours before biopsy should I begin with the antibiotics? Or am I again worried about nothing and it doesn't matter? 2. Adverse side effects of biopsy: My urologist told me to read less about what all could happen, only to tell me the horror story of a patient who suffered a lower back spinal canal infection requiring surgery. Did anyone on this forum experience sepsis or other complications? 3. Method of manual surgery: In my province there are only a few hospitals offering DaVinci and I will be referred to old style surgeons. I don't think there's much time left to wait for a space on the DaVinci queue. So, if I get treatment in Canada, my options will be manual laparoscopic or generously sized abdominal cut. If I mainly care about a half-decent outcome in terms of continence and maybe a little bit of sexual function, should I prefer laparoscopic or generous cut? I have a hard time imagining the manual procedure works well with a laparoscope, especially since I already had my small intestine perforated in a laparoscopic procedure for an ileus, after which I woke up with laparoscopic holes AND a generous cut. 4. DaVinci surgery: Though I can't get DaVinci here in Canada/Quebec, the robotic procedure is standard all across my home country and I still hold an option for 5 star insurance which I can activate irrespective of pre-existing conditions. I just need to say I'm back, pay full insurance fees for a couple of months, and presumably could get an appointment for surgery quickly as a private patient. This would probably cost me $5000+, not including intercontinental flights, time off work, and most importantly, another month or two of wait during which the condition is only going to get worse. Anyone an opinion? Is DaVinci so much better than old style surgery that I should seek treatment outside Canada?",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by HighlanderCFH Welcome to the forum Karl, Hopefully your biopsy will show no prostate cancer. Can you tell us your age? In any case, anything over 4.0 is high, unless you are in your 70s or older. Even a man in his 70s has a high PSA if it is over 6.5. BPH can elevate the PSA a bit, so the best thing is to let the biopsy take place and see what it shows. How often do you see someone get rundown when looking up and down and crossing the street? In reality, this is quite rare although it does happen from time to time. How often are there complications from a prostate biopsy? Consider my example up above. It can happen, but is relatively rare. If you should be diagnosed with PC and opt for surgery, the good thing to know is that open surgery has an equal cure rate to DaVinci, so you will be just fine either way -- as long as the surgeon has performed at least several hundred of them. There are a few advantages to DaVinci, but the main goal is to be cured -- and both do it with equal success. Please keep us advised of when the biopsy is scheduled. Chuck I'm 53 and then PSA 11.8 is sky high. I'm under no illusions that this is not a good sign, especially since it's been rising so quickly. It could be BPH, but much more likely it's PCa. Anyway, biopsy is due in 5 days on Thu. I probably jumped the queue because of poor values. Aside of occasional fits of frequent urination, which seem to be linked to diet and perhaps cold, I have relatively few symptoms. It was only after years of waiting for a family doctor that my blood was checked, so the condition might as well have gone unnoticed for a lot longer. But in hindsight it was a mistake to wait with the biopsy because of the Cipro scare. I often take quite irrational decisions.",

Another, I agree I'm a candidate for treatment. I find it hard to believe this UK/NHS prediction tool gives me a 15Y survival chance of 78% with T4 cancer even if I did nothing, just as if PCa metastases didn't matter. Like I should bother only if I had BRCA mutation, lowering 15Y survival to 58%. Opinions? On the very good idea of biopsy slides sent elsewhere, am not sure how far I'd get. At Santé Québec I'm still at the stage where I'm supposed to be faithfully waiting for my uro to call and reveal + explain results. Consequently my (now ex) family doctor declined a cancer specialist referral. I have a consultation in a German clinic upcoming 22 Mar and already authorized them to access my QC data. Maybe Santé Québec wouldn't want to expose themselves as much in international requests. I would expect treatment to proceed with bone scan and CT as well. Are MRIs of any use at this point? Anything else I should ask for? Genetic tests? BRCA variant? My grandma died miserably of breast cancer maybe in her 40s or early 50s max. On the significance of LVI, I stumbled upon this link where 16 of 18 cases with LVI had BCR. Or is this out of date because of the sample taken between 1991 and 2001? On cribriform patterns this link suggests they got me the primary Gleason 4, with 63% chance of 5Y and under 50% of 10Y freedom of BCR. Also, according to this study Gleason 7 with primary 4 has threefold increased mortality rates compared to primary 3 secondary 4. That already not great, I'm afraid Djin is right that the cribriform patterns are another adverse indicator towards the upper end of the Gleason 4 bracket. *sigh* So the general wisdom is I shouldn't undergo RP if further tests indicate the cancer is no longer contained? Then what? Just radiotherapy? Chemotherapy? Hormone therapy? Be fcuked and testament? If I had unlimited funds at my disposal I'd probably never even done the biopsy here in QC, but would have gone straight to the US. Why not JH, true. Given my German insurance will very likely cover hospital bills completely with a like EUR2000 deductible on outpatient consultations and tests, and the usually very swift appointments, plus extensive coverage including fancier treatments, I think my flight home on Sunday is still my best bet. All of this sounds so unreal at this point. Trying to get things done here in QC will only get me stomach cancer on top.",

      "Content": "I translated my detailed biopsy results from French, and am unclear about interpretation and outlook. I haven't yet had a doctor explain the results, so maybe the forum experts could help out, thanks!! <<< Prostate biopsy on the right (R2) - Small focus (in French \"foyer\") of atypical glands in one of the biopsies Prostate biopsy on the right (R4) - Acinary adenocarcionoma of Gleason score 7 (4, 3), 90-95% of grade 4 cribriform pattern, glomeruloid and malformed glands, group 3/5 according to the WHO, occupying 40% and 5% of the surface of 2 biopsies. - PTEN: no loss of expression (French original: \"PTEN: pas de perte d'expression\") - Focus (in French \"foyer\") suspect of vascular invasion in one of the cuts Prostate biopsy on the right (R6) - Benign prostatic parenchyma Prostate biopsy on the left (L1) - Acinary adenocarcionoma of Gleason score 3 + 3 = 6, group 1/5 according to the WHO, occupying less than 5% of the surface of one of the two biopsies. Prostate biopsy on the left (L3) - Benign prostatic parenchyma Prostate biopsy on the right (L5) - Benign prostatic parenchyma >>> So I think that gets me: - an overall Gleason 7 (4, 3), which is same as WHO group 3/5 - the number 4 in \"grade 4 cribriform pattern\" the same 4 as in the Gleason (4,3)? - PTEN no loss of expression indicates the cancer is less likely to be hormone blocker resistant? - and focus suspect of vascular invasion means by the look of samples the cancer may well have spread to lymph nodes? Is vascular invasion same as LVI? Vascular invasion is at least t3, correct? With which the median time of BCR is just 2.6 years? What's the typical course of treatment here? RP, radio therapy, hormone therapy, the whole package? and I'm only hoping the kidney cyst visible in a CT some 15 months ago was really just a cyst, as the doctor claimed. Opinions, please. Thanks!",

I told my wife that it\u0092s like some really well directed movies where you learn and associate with the main character and you feel trapped right along with them in their circumstances. Training Day is one instance, I felt completely trapped with Ethan Hawke\u0092d character. The only difference is we don\u0092t get to turn the channel or pick a romantic comedy! 😀 Hang in there brother. Definitely try out a new antidepressant for the short term. There are several that are new and good. I took generic Prozac and really didn\u0092t want to stop except it caused a little weight gain. Made me crave carbs..all the carbs. But it gave me the most elaborate and beautiful dreams that seemed to go on forever like a long movie. After my mom died I had a long conversation with her in heaven...she was healthy and could breathe again and that was a gift. Good luck buddy, there are people who have so many uncurable cancers...were the lucky ones if you can call it luck. Most of us have a positive future, just a semi rough road to hoe to get to it. Yes, one could call the \"date with the elephant\" a pothole on a bumpy road. Unfortunate movie characters aside I was thinking about what wise elders always told us. Old age is big misery and I'm taking a shortcut. But it's just a shortcut, the suffering inevitably catches up one way or other. Best to accept it as it is and I hope your wife is taking good care of you. I have none, which makes this easier in some ways and more difficult in others.

      "Content": "IceStationZebra, all the best with your results, I'll be thinking of you in the hope it helps. Yes, I should look for a local cancer support group! Lastchance, I lately found a nice congregation close by lifting my spirits even though I'm not a firm believer either. Depressive episodes are like heart attacks; people that had some are much more likely to get more. Especially if there's a triggering event, such as sudden affliction with frustrating chronic illness. I took fluoxetine 20mg for several weeks and the issue wasn't that the drug didn't have any effects. It increased my clumsiness, caused strange headaches, and most importantly destabilized me. I flipped from seeing pink elephants to miserable or irritable with disorganization and crappy ideas in very short time. Did more harm than good. Possible there are now better medications on the market, but they should be chosen with care and I'm not too confident, judging from experience, that the public health system will provide this service should I need it post-OP. Honestly, all of this is just such a nightmare.",

      "Content": "So I'm very likely a candidate for RP at age 53 and am wondering what others on this forum having undergone the procedure, especially with less than ideal outcomes, experienced afterwards in terms of mood swings. Has RP been triggering severely depressive episodes for anyone? I've already had several despite good physical health and am worried I'll be plunging into the next hole soon. I have unfortunately been unable to get help with this in our public health care system despite repeated attempts. The attitude seems to be one of total indifference towards male individuals over 50 who are working and paying taxes. To complicate matters, I had very adverse side effects from an SSRI anti-depressant which I tried decades ago. Advice? Coping strategies? Medications taken? Thanks!",

      "Content": "So I'm very likely a candidate for RP at age 53 and am wondering what others on this forum having undergone the procedure, especially with less than ideal outcomes, experienced afterwards in terms of mood swings. Has RP been triggering severely depressive episodes for anyone? I've already had several despite good physical health and am worried I'll be plunging into the next hole soon. I have unfortunately been unable to get help with this in our public health care system despite repeated attempts. The attitude seems to be one of total indifference towards male individuals over 50 who are working and paying taxes.

      "Content": "Originally Posted by IceStationZebra KarlEmagne, yes it is a nightmare. Thanks for the positive thoughts. I told my wife that it\u0092s like some really well directed movies where you learn and associate with the main character and you feel trapped right along with them in their circumstances. Training Day is one instance, I felt completely trapped with Ethan Hawke\u0092d character. The only difference is we don\u0092t get to turn the channel or pick a romantic comedy! 😀 Hang in there brother. Definitely try out a new antidepressant for the short term. There are several that are new and good. I took generic Prozac and really didn\u0092t want to stop except it caused a little weight gain. Made me crave carbs..all the carbs. But it gave me the most elaborate and beautiful dreams that seemed to go on forever like a long movie. After my mom died I had a long conversation with her in heaven...she was healthy and could breathe again and that was a gift. Good luck buddy, there are people who have so many uncurable cancers...were the lucky ones if you can call it luck. Most of us have a positive future, just a semi rough road to hoe to get to it. Yes, one could call the \"date with the elephant\" a pothole on a bumpy road. Unfortunate movie characters aside I was thinking about what wise elders always told us. Old age is big misery and I'm taking a shortcut. But it's just a shortcut, the suffering inevitably catches up one way or other. Best to accept it as it is and I hope your wife is taking good care of you. I have none, which makes this easier in some ways and more difficult in others. Originally Posted by RobLee My cancer experience sent me to very dark and unfamiliar place. [...] Eventually thru my own research I learned about venlafaxine or Effexor, an SNRI, and outright asked my GP for a prescription. Suddenly things started to improve. I have now been on it for nearly two years, have had to go up and down in dosage a few times but am fairly certain that I will be taking it for the rest of my life. The emotional stability it has brought far outweighs the side effects. I should also mention the effects of general anesthesia. It sticks with you for a few weeks and can be very depressing... Yes, own research is very helpful, thanks for the SNRI recommendation. I've heard positive critiques elsewhere. I had multiple surgeries and never experienced the pos-general anesthesia black hole yet. I'll watch out for it this time I don't mind beautiful dreams and skinny as I am a little weight gain would only harm my mountain hiking performance. But I was a complete mess on Prozac and declined an offer for some SSRI prescription from my family doc for fear of weird things happening. She sent me to a PDoc who threw me out concluding that I work and shouldn't get help, especially no meds. So now I have the big expert judging from a 10min encounter I'm a miserable old f*rt who may get better on his own (or not) without anything that costs the public system. Unprofessional, but I guess we get what we pay for. I wouldn't mind with an option for private referrals, but in this particular case they are not available. The public system claims a psych monopoly and freedom to deny treatment. Which is not good because, reading up on this and comparing symptoms, I may have had a manic-depressive condition from my mid-teens, for which anti-depressants are poison without additional anti-psychotic or mood stabilizing medications. But my family doc says I shouldn't get anything because the big PDoc said so and I'm now ditching her, she seems utterly useless. Definitely not good with the PCa mess on top.",

      "Content": "I've been told repeatedly in this forum that I should relax and will have plenty of time later to decide on treatments. Sounds like good advice in principle but I maintain having to WAIT UP TO 6 WEEKS for biopsy results doesn't help and also judging from other threads in this forum I'm not the only one adversely affected by the uncertainty. Aren't most of you getting biopsy results in a week or 11 days the latest? I heard 11 days are for especially difficult cases with extra tests only. Maybe I'm just silly, but the 5 WEEKS QUEBEC special biopsy results DELAY DOES MATTER, COSTS me time I could use for an informed decision AND/OR contacting ROs on top of clinics specializing in surgery, assuming surgeons will probably be biased towards surgery as a preferred treatment. NO ONE can rule out my case might be urgent at this point and I AM ABSOLUTELY SHOCKED at the INDIFFERENCE towards patients HERE IN QUEBEC. There seems to moreover be an attitude towards NOT HANDING PATIENTS PRINTED RESULTS without another Uro appointment with another wait, even if patients leave the country to be treated or examined elsewhere. Just as if I couldn't read (biopsy results) myself and should rely entirely on my uro or family doctor for decisions. ALL SERIOUSLY NOT GOOD IMHO. My (now ex) family doctor, I unregistered with her on Friday, already declined a cancer specialist referral on grounds of insufficient evidence for cancer, with PSA near 12 at age 53, and rather snapped at me for gathering information on the internet. So again some questions I had, copied from another thread: 12 core random biopsy from Feb 21 are still not in, and may need another 3 1/2 weeks to come around. So I wanted to ask some questions on treatment options since I'm trying to arrange for consultations OUTSIDE QUEBEC as I HAVE LOST CONFIDENCE in optimal and timely treatment with all choices here. <rant over> So I have an outside quebec consultation upcoming and questions on treatment options in the two cases of a) a negative biopsy and b) a positive >=G6 biopsy. There's also case c) that I may STILL not know my biopsy results at the date of my first consultation, so I'll probably better ask to be seen later. Given my PSA levels I understand there's a significant chance ~20% of having cancer even if the biopsy didn't find any. What additional diagnostic tests should I request in that case? Another MRI? Also, even if I really have no cancer, is there anything I could do about my prostatitis? - Is it possible my various abdominal surgeries, especially the ones for the hernia, may be causing my prostate issues? Should my biopsy be positive with G7+ I think treatment would either be RP, radiation or both. - Reading up on other threads RP is usually recommended at my age unless the cancer is not contained and I'll need radiation anyway? - What examinations should I request to check pre-op if cancer is contained? Another MRI? - If cancer is not contained, is it still worth having RP, or should I then opt for just radiation? - Is it true I can't have RP if my prostate is too big to be operated? I AM NOT FAT, height 190cm weight 65kg. - Is it true radiation therapy doesn't help with symptoms from an enlarged prostate/BPH? - If my cancer is contained, am I more likely to dodge the dreaded ADT/HT with RP rather than radiation? - I heard bowel problems are a counter-indication for radiation therapy? I'm suffering from a combination of intestinal adhesions following my appendicitis and irritation from food allergies (especially dairy and gluten/barley, no beer, no bread, no cheese, no butter, no cream). So I guess this means I should avoid radiation therapy if possible? Thanks, and again apologies for unspecific questions given the unnerving biopsy results delay.",

I am still wondering what is to be done in case of a negative biopsy, especially w/ respect to prostatitis. Word is samples only travelled 2km to a nearby uni hospital.

      "Content": "I've been told repeatedly in this forum that I should relax and will have plenty of time later to decide on treatments. Sounds like good advice in principle but I maintain having to WAIT UP TO 6 WEEKS for biopsy results doesn't help and also judging from other threads in this forum I'm not the only one adversely affected by the uncertainty. Aren't most of you getting biopsy results in a week or 11 days the latest? I heard 11 days are for especially difficult cases with extra tests only. Maybe I'm just silly, but the 5 WEEKS QUEBEC special biopsy results DELAY DOES MATTER, COSTS me time I could use for an informed decision AND/OR contacting ROs on top of clinics specializing in surgery, assuming surgeons will probably be biased towards surgery as a preferred treatment. NO ONE can rule out my case might be urgent at this point and I AM ABSOLUTELY SHOCKED at the INDIFFERENCE towards patients HERE IN QUEBEC. There seems to moreover be an attitude towards NOT HANDING PATIENTS PRINTED RESULTS without another Uro appointment with another wait, even if patients leave the country to be treated or examined elsewhere. Just as if I couldn't read (biopsy results) myself and should rely entirely on my uro or family doctor for decisions. ALL SERIOUSLY NOT GOOD IMHO. My (now ex) family doctor, I unregistered with her on Friday, already declined a cancer specialist referral on grounds of insufficient evidence for cancer, with PSA near 12 at age 53, and rather snapped at me for gathering information on the internet. So again some questions I had, copied from another thread: 12 core random biopsy from Feb 21 are still not in, and may need another 3 1/2 weeks to come around. So I wanted to ask some questions on treatment options since I'm trying to arrange for consultations OUTSIDE QUEBEC as I HAVE LOST CONFIDENCE in optimal and timely treatment with all choices here. <rant over> So I have an outside quebec consultation upcoming and questions on treatment options in the two cases of a) a negative biopsy and b) a positive >=G6 biopsy. There's also case c) that I may STILL not know my biopsy results at the date of my first consultation, so I'll probably better ask to be seen later. Given my PSA levels I understand there's a significant chance ~20% of having cancer even if the biopsy didn't find any. What additional diagnostic tests should I request in that case? Another MRI? Also, even if I really have no cancer, is there anything I could do about my prostatitis? - Is it possible my various abdominal surgeries, especially the ones for the hernia, may be causing my prostate issues? Should my biopsy be positive with G7+ I think treatment would either be RP, radiation or both. - Reading up on other threads RP is usually recommended at my age unless the cancer is not contained and I'll need radiation anyway? - What examinations should I request to check pre-op if cancer is contained? Another MRI? - If cancer is not contained, is it still worth having RP, or should I then opt for just radiation? - Is it true I can't have RP if my prostate is too big to be operated? I AM NOT FAT, height 190cm weight 65kg. - Is it true radiation therapy doesn't help with symptoms from an enlarged prostate/BPH? - If my cancer is contained, am I more likely to dodge the dreaded ADT/HT with RP rather than radiation? - I heard bowel problems are a counter-indication for radiation therapy? I'm suffering from a combination of intestinal adhesions following my appendicitis and irritation from food allergies (especially dairy and gluten/barley, no beer, no bread, no cheese, no butter, no cream). So I guess this means I should avoid radiation therapy if possible? Thanks, and again apologies for unspecific questions given the unnerving biopsy results delay.",
