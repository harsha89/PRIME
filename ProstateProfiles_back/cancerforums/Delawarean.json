      "Content": "Hello, Gang. I had my robotic procedure last Wednesday. I am doing fairly well. Only took a few days for the bowels to move. I am in pain but it is bearable. The catheter is no pleasure but I only have 4 days until it is removed. I find that I don't sleep well-- more dozing and napping. Surgeon said things went very well and all looked good. The pathology results will, of course, tell the story. Observations: Surgical staff excellent; floor nurses only fair and under staffed. Got myself walking right away. The exhaustion didn't hit until I got home. The robotic incisions are larger than I expected and very sore -- but certainly better than the open surgery would have been. I am essentially pleased but I was prepared for the worst possible, as is my nature (even made a list of pall bearers). A lot of the outcome depends on attitude. My one sentence summation: prostate cancer and the surgery should only happen to rotten people.",
