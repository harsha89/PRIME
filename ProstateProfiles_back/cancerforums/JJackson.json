      "Content": "Originally Posted by RobLee J/K. Anyway so I had the hold-for-10-rest-for-five lessons. To be honest, ten times ten, three times a day just wears me OUT, so I don't always do them as prescribed. I do at least try to hold for five seconds five times. So I'm curious, what is \"your version\" of the Kegels? Good morning. I used the phrase \"my version\" as I have not, to this point, had any formal instruction for Kegel's. About a month prior to my surgery my Urologist's suggested I start working Kegel's exercises. He said, \"It's kind of like holding back passing gas when you're in public\"....A lot of help that was LOL. I had never even given a thought to Kegel's exercises, as I had no idea that was something a male did! I thought it was only for females either post childbirth or for stress incontinence. You think being an RN I would know better! (Hey...I do much better with gunshot wounds, heart attacks, and car wrecks!!! ) So I ventured onto YouTube (my God that's a dangerous place if you're not careful about what you type! ) But I did find some quality instructional viewing material...finally. So \"my version\" was isolating the anal musculature and pulling tension towards my perineal area until my testicles and penis would rise, without causing lower abdominal muscles to tension and without holding my breath. Am I doing it right? I honestly don't know. But I do the \"Hold 5 sec, Relax 5 sec\" alternating with \"Hold 10 sec, Relax 10 sec\" between 10-15 times each day. I will experience tenderness in my pelvic floor area, but not pain. I hope to find out in a few hours what I have been doing wrong as well as right. My progress has been very incremental as to this point. I have days of near constant leaking and days of darn good control with occasional squirts...but I accept that I am still very early on in this and hope for some truly helpful and useful info at my PT session this morning. Jim! I sure hope I get a private rehab room! Especially if an anal probe is involved! LOL....not that I haven't been accused of showing my A** before...",

      "Content": "Greetings from another newbie Jim, and Welcome to the \"Club\"! I am 10 days post cath, still having the dribbles of course, but I am seeing progress....slow, but sure. I haven't experienced flowsplitting, but I would imagine each of us are pretty unique (while similar) in our recovery. I have periods of leaking, especially later in the day as I begin to fatigue. But I'm down from 6-8 pads/day to only 3 yesterday. It's progress! The sage advice and support I've received from the wonderful folks here is to try and view the progress on a week to week, preferably month to moth basis...not as easy as it types LOL...but I do believe it's sage advice nonetheless my friend. I'm a \"Kegel's junkie\" too, but have been cautioned not to overdo them as the muscles can fatigue. But again I'm certain we all have variable and individual experiences as related to that. Best wishes for a speedy and uneventful recovery Jim.",

      "Content": "maxphunn; You received some excellent advice already. I too had robotic assisted surgery, about 5 weeks ago. I did have 2 IV sites as per our hospital's protocol, but only IV fluids infusing overnight. I was treated with Tylenol (acetaminophen) and Ultram (Tramadol) while in the hospital, and prescription for the Ultram upon released the next day. My only discomfort were from the puncture wounds (via trocar) for the laparoscopic device insertion and of course the pain between my shoulder blades from the gas used to inflate the abdomen for the procedure. All of these abated over the next 3-4 days as I increased my activity...walking around. I took the Ultram for 2 days...hated the way it and all narcotics make me feel..and Tylenol actually worked much better for the discomfort control. Many anesthesia department discuss the various methods of pain control you mentioned, intrathecal (spinal...using an opoid for general pain relief and regional using a variation of a \"numbing med\" for pain relief), and the patient controlled administration of an IV narcotic... but these are, to the best of my knowledge, very rarely used for these procedures...at my surgeon and his group have never found it necessary and the vast majority of their patients have their pain controlled with Tylenol. I would hazard a guess it's the policy of your hospital to mention or discuss these pain control options. They were mentioned at my pre-op workup...but not specific to my surgery...but to all patients undergoing surgery. Again per my hospital's policy and protocol. Keep us posted and ask questions. There's a great group of knowledgeable, helpful, experienced people here that want to offer you information and support. I've found them to be a God-send.",

      "Content": "maxphunn; You received some excellent advice already. I too had robotic assisted surgery, about 5 weeks ago. I did have 2 IV sites as per our hospital's protocol, but only IV fluids infusing overnight. I was treated with Tylenol (acetaminophen) and Ultram (Tramadol) while in the hospital, and prescription for the Ultram upon released the next day. My only discomfort were from the puncture wounds (via trocar) for the laparoscopic device insertion and of course the pain between my shoulder blades from the gas used to inflate the abdomen for the procedure. All of these abated over the next 3-4 days as I increased my activity...walking around. I took the Ultram for 2 days...hated the way it and all narcotics make me feel..and Tylenol actually worked much better for the discomfort control. Many anesthesia department discuss the various methods of pain control you mentioned, intrathecal (spinal...using an opoid for general pain relief and regional using a variation of a \"numbing med\" for pain relief), and the patient controlled administration of an IV narcotic... but these are, to the best of my knowledge, very rarely used for these procedures...at my surgeon and his group have never found it necessary and the vast majority of their patients have their pain controlled with Tylenol. I would hazard a guess it's the policy of your hospital to mention or discuss these pain control options. They were mentioned at my pre-op workup...but not specific to my surgery...but to all patients undergoing surgery. Again per my hospital's policy and protocol. Keep us posted and ask questions. There's a great group of knowledgeable, helpful, experienced people here that want to offer you information and support. I've found them to be a God-send.",

I am struggling with limiting my activity, especially the lifting no more than 10 lbs part...But as Rob mentioned, this is a pretty intricate and involved procedure to a delicate area. I will even be more diligent after reading this. I would also appreciate hearing if this is more common than one would have thought. Please keep us posted rooster and I hope you heal quickly and uneventfully.",

      "Content": "I trust your discomfort is improving rooster. I mentioned your post to my wife, who, in her best supportive voice told me \"See? I told you to slow down and take it easy!\" God I love that woman! She's right of course...generally is. But it's quite easy to \"slip up\" and do something you would normally be able to do with no consequences... She asked me if I knew any particular activity you might be able to attribute this to? fwiw I'll be 4 weeks post-op this coming Friday, the 23rd. Again, I appreciate you giving us the head's up and word of caution on this and hope you heal quickly.",

Give your bladder a fighting chance to return to it's normal size over time. It tends to shrink during the post-surgery catheterization period.\" ^^ This one I am struggling with. It seems to be worse a couple of weeks post cath for me than it was initially. I tend to get pretty strong squirts as my bladder gets about 1/4 it's normal full. My bladder tends to reach it's old normal during the night while sleeping and only have to get up twice usually during the night. Tips and or suggestions welcomed folks. Rob...I use Amazon exclusively for my pads. I wore boxers for literally decades, but picked up a good supply of Fruit of the Loom and Hanes briefs prior to my surgery. I use the Depends Incontinence Guards (thick contoured pads). They cost $11.99 for 52 pads from Amazon at this time. We have AZ Prime, so no extra cost for shipping. I was familiar with these from multiple patients I've cared for in the ER I work in. They hold a remarkable amount of liquid for their size. A snug fitting pair of briefs is a necessity I've found. I have some of the Depends flex-fit Incontinence underwear that I used the first week after cath removal. This was probably overkill at the time, but I didn't know what to expect. I agree, they are hot and will make you sweat some, especially with increased activity such as walking. But I am maintaining a supply of them for that \"just an extra precaution\" when I return to work next month...like Rich suggests. I am really glad I listened to my surgeon when he recommended I take 8 weeks off (he works at the same facility as I do and personally knows the work I do), and Blessed I have several hundred hours of \"sick time\" banked. Thank you Lord! \"For pad/shield/diaper disposal I use quart size zipper plastic bags. $6 for a box of 100, and I can fit two pads in each baggie. Keeps the bath/bedroom from smelling like urine.\" Excellent Tip Rob! Good idea. I keep my emergency spare kit in these. I have one bag with \"baby wipes\" and one bag with 2 extra pads. These fit easily into a pocket in my jeans or a cargo pocket in my shorts. I made use of them yesterday at my MRI outing. Peace of mind, even if not an absolute necessity.

I posted a portion of this, but would like to elaborate and offer this into a more easily found area...this thread. Well, in my ongoing and less than scientific explorations into...\"just how much leakage will this pad hold\"...I put on a fresh (Depends Incontinence Guard) along with a pair of Depends Flex-fit underwear...JIC and went for my morning walk. I pushed it to 5 miles this morning, and I feel it. LOL But it's a good feeling! No leak through, a bit sweaty as expected, but much less leakage onto the Guard/Pad than I anticipated. This is starting to give me some confidence that I will be able to work out a \"system\" prior to my return to work. 5+ miles of walking each 12 hour shift is more than easily accomplished there. So a \"system\" for containment is my goal, that and regaining continence!",

      "Content": "First and foremost Thank You Highlander and the Admin for assist in signing up! Hi Folks; I\u0092m Jamie and just found this site yesterday. What an outstanding resource and awesome support you have here! Thank you!! I\u0092m 62, an RN (ER), married to a wonderful woman and Blessed each and every day. My PSA was 5.04 (Gleason 6) in late May during my annual PE at my Primary Care Doc\u0092s visit. Normal RE, so swelling, no urinary issues. I scheduled a Bx for June (28th). One positive cell and 2 atypical cells. I had a Robotic Assisted Radical Prostatectomy on 9/26. My surgery was pretty uneventful. I was released to home the following day. Of course with a Foley cath, 5 puncture wounds (subcuticular stitches covered with Dermabond) and no JP or any other drain. I share the majority of experiences I\u0092ve read here\u0085no issues with the catherter really, very sore lower abdomen and pain in the shoulders. But the discomfort lessened each and by Post Op Day 4 all was fine. I had my catherter removed Sept 2nd. My anxiety over the removal was much worse than the act itself\u0085minimal discomfort that was over, done and gone in a few seconds. My cath was removed in my Surgeon\u0092s office. He was able to spare both nerves and said the lymph nodes were clear. I am here seeking information, suggestions, and perhaps reassurance as regards my urinary incontinency. I read the entirety of this thread, including 98% of the linked threads and pages. THIS is solid Gold!  http://www.cancerforums.net/threads/...-Vinci-surgery I\u0092ve also searched and read multiple other threads related to my concern(s). I did start Kegel\u0092s exercises about one month before my surgery. Figuring that out was interesting as I\u0092ve never even considered them before embarking on this journey! So to my concerns\u0085The day of my cath removal I essentially had no control, very frequent \u0093squirts\u0094, but I was able to start and stop a stream while sitting on the toilet. (I didn\u0092t trust having enough time to stand and try LOL). I was not, nor have I been incontinent while sleeping in my bed at night, though I do get up about midway through the night and go urinate. While sitting, either in a recliner or upright in a chair, I have no incontinency issues. But when I stand my \u0093squirts\u0094 are pretty frequent! My surgeon assures me I am progressing very well. (I know him from work and have his cell number\u0085he\u0092s a good guy, Excellent Urological Surgeon and someone I trust.) OK. Those \u0093squirts\u0094 when standing\u0085 one of the links I read referred to developing the \u0093Knack\u0094 to reduce or eliminate these\u0085which I interpret as meaning a subliminal, approximately 50% tensioning of the pelvic floor muscles. Am I way off base folks? Should I just keep doing my Kegel\u0092s 3-4 times a day and keep my fingers crossed? Am I fatiguing the pelvic floor muscles too much with the amount of exercises? I am scheduled for PT\u0085but Sept 26th is the earliest date I was able to obtain. The majority of what I've learned about urinary continence recovery is from the internet and a book entitled: \" 100 Questions and Answers about Prostate Cancer\" by Pamela Ellsworth, MD. I work 12 hour shifts in a busy Emergency Room and rarely if ever have the opportunity to sit\u0085perhaps 5 minutes out of an hour when I\u0092m starting an IV on a patient. I am beyond Blessed to have a supportive crew, manager and I am able to take 6-8 weeks off of work with it being a burden to our income flow. Thank you all in advance for sharing your knowledge, experiences and suggestions.",

These fit easily into a pocket in my jeans or a cargo pocket in my shorts. I made use of them yesterday at my MRI outing. Peace of mind, even if not an absolute necessity. Kozmic/Jeff...Where are you locating the generic pads etc? Jetfxr82. Welcome and that's encouraging & good news my friend! Great info and input. Thanks again Rob!",

      "Content": "I just returned from my walk and posted a link to this thread in my little corner of the world. I posted a portion of this, but would like to elaborate and offer this into a more easily found area...this thread. Well, in my ongoing and less than scientific explorations into...\"just how much leakage will this pad hold\"...I put on a fresh (Depends Incontinence Guard) along with a pair of Depends Flex-fit underwear...JIC and went for my morning walk. I pushed it to 5 miles this morning, and I feel it. LOL But it's a good feeling! No leak through, a bit sweaty as expected, but much less leakage onto the Guard/Pad than I anticipated. This is starting to give me some confidence that I will be able to work out a \"system\" prior to my return to work. 5+ miles of walking each 12 hour shift is more than easily accomplished there. So a \"system\" for containment is my goal, that and regaining continence!",

I am quite honestly impressed with and thankful to have found such a knowledgeable and supportive group of individuals. Chuck...Thank you again for all the help in getting me started here! You Rock Sir! Jim, I am very fortunate as regards my place of work. They are great folks and I honestly look forward to each and every day there. I am Blessed to have a job and profession I love....some days not so much as others LOL. But I wouldn't trade my life for any other. Rich... Brother I hope to have an uneventful and speedy recovery! With a positive attitude and great support such as we've found here, I have no doubt it will be so. Michael...great advice. I have a leaning towards impatience and control and while I consciously \"know\" I shouldn't try to rush things, I have to hold myself in check sometimes. Thank you. And excellent tip btw! I think I may well have overworked my Kegel's yesterday. My pelvic floor (prior to this I didn't even possess consciousness awareness of my pelvic floor) is sore this morning and I did in fact dribble a bit while sleeping last night for the first time. Lesson learned! You got it DD. I'm just thankful and Blessed that I will be able to look forward to another year and the progress it brings. Thanks again to all. JJ",

What an outstanding resource and awesome support you have here! Thank you!! I\u0092m 62, an RN (ER), married to a wonderful woman and Blessed each and every day. My PSA was 5.04 (Gleason 6) in late May during my annual PE at my Primary Care Doc\u0092s visit. Normal RE, so swelling, no urinary issues. I scheduled a Bx for June (28th). One positive cell and 2 atypical cells. I had a Robotic Assisted Radical Prostatectomy on 9/26. My surgery was pretty uneventful. I was released to home the following day. Of course with a Foley cath, 5 puncture wounds (subcuticular stitches covered with Dermabond) and no JP or any other drain. I share the majority of experiences I\u0092ve read here\u0085no issues with the catherter really, very sore lower abdomen and pain in the shoulders. But the discomfort lessened each and by Post Op Day 4 all was fine. I had my catherter removed Sept 2nd. My anxiety over the removal was much worse than the act itself\u0085minimal discomfort that was over, done and gone in a few seconds. My cath was removed in my Surgeon\u0092s office. He was able to spare both nerves and said the lymph nodes were clear. I am here seeking information, suggestions, and perhaps reassurance as regards my urinary incontinency. I read the entirety of this thread, including 98% of the linked threads and pages. THIS is solid Gold!  http://www.cancerforums.net/threads/...-Vinci-surgery I\u0092ve also searched and read multiple other threads related to my concern(s). I did start Kegel\u0092s exercises about one month before my surgery. Figuring that out was interesting as I\u0092ve never even considered them before embarking on this journey! So to my concerns\u0085The day of my cath removal I essentially had no control, very frequent \u0093squirts\u0094, but I was able to start and stop a stream while sitting on the toilet. (I didn\u0092t trust having enough time to stand and try LOL). I was not, nor have I been incontinent while sleeping in my bed at night, though I do get up about midway through the night and go urinate. While sitting, either in a recliner or upright in a chair, I have no incontinency issues. But when I stand my \u0093squirts\u0094 are pretty frequent! My surgeon assures me I am progressing very well. (I know him from work and have his cell number\u0085he\u0092s a good guy, Excellent Urological Surgeon and someone I trust.) OK. Those \u0093squirts\u0094 when standing\u0085 one of the links I read referred to developing the \u0093Knack\u0094 to reduce or eliminate these\u0085which I interpret as meaning a subliminal, approximately 50% tensioning of the pelvic floor muscles. Am I way off base folks? Should I just keep doing my Kegel\u0092s 3-4 times a day and keep my fingers crossed? Am I fatiguing the pelvic floor muscles too much with the amount of exercises?

      "Content": "Outstanding post and list with consolidation of information Rich!! Thank you! \"Try not to 'go' too often. Give your bladder a fighting chance to return to it's normal size over time. It tends to shrink during the post-surgery catheterization period.\" ^^ This one I am struggling with. It seems to be worse a couple of weeks post cath for me than it was initially. I tend to get pretty strong squirts as my bladder gets about 1/4 it's normal full. My bladder tends to reach it's old normal during the night while sleeping and only have to get up twice usually during the night. Tips and or suggestions welcomed folks. Rob...I use Amazon exclusively for my pads. I wore boxers for literally decades, but picked up a good supply of Fruit of the Loom and Hanes briefs prior to my surgery. I use the Depends Incontinence Guards (thick contoured pads). They cost $11.99 for 52 pads from Amazon at this time. We have AZ Prime, so no extra cost for shipping. I was familiar with these from multiple patients I've cared for in the ER I work in. They hold a remarkable amount of liquid for their size. A snug fitting pair of briefs is a necessity I've found. I have some of the Depends flex-fit Incontinence underwear that I used the first week after cath removal. This was probably overkill at the time, but I didn't know what to expect.

My PSA was 5.04 (Gleason 6) in late May during my annual PE at my Primary Care Doc\u0092s visit. Normal RE, so swelling, no urinary issues. I scheduled a Bx for June (28th). One positive cell and 2 atypical cells. I had a Robotic Assisted Radical Prostatectomy on 9/26. My surgery was pretty uneventful. I was released to home the following day. Of course with a Foley cath, 5 puncture wounds (subcuticular stitches covered with Dermabond) and no JP or any other drain. I share the majority of experiences I\u0092ve read here\u0085no issues with the catherter really, very sore lower abdomen and pain in the shoulders. But the discomfort lessened each and by Post Op Day 4 all was fine. I had my catherter removed Sept 2nd. My anxiety over the removal was much worse than the act itself\u0085minimal discomfort that was over, done and gone in a few seconds. My cath was removed in my Surgeon\u0092s office. He was able to spare both nerves and said the lymph nodes were clear. I am here seeking information, suggestions, and perhaps reassurance as regards my urinary incontinency. I read the entirety of this thread, including 98% of the linked threads and pages. THIS is solid Gold!  http://www.cancerforums.net/threads/...-Vinci-surgery I\u0092ve also searched and read multiple other threads related to my concern(s). I did start Kegel\u0092s exercises about one month before my surgery. Figuring that out was interesting as I\u0092ve never even considered them before embarking on this journey! So to my concerns\u0085The day of my cath removal I essentially had no control, very frequent \u0093squirts\u0094, but I was able to start and stop a stream while sitting on the toilet. (I didn\u0092t trust having enough time to stand and try LOL). I was not, nor have I been incontinent while sleeping in my bed at night, though I do get up about midway through the night and go urinate. While sitting, either in a recliner or upright in a chair, I have no incontinency issues. But when I stand my \u0093squirts\u0094 are pretty frequent! My surgeon assures me I am progressing very well. (I know him from work and have his cell number\u0085he\u0092s a good guy, Excellent Urological Surgeon and someone I trust.) OK. Those \u0093squirts\u0094 when standing\u0085 one of the links I read referred to developing the \u0093Knack\u0094 to reduce or eliminate these\u0085which I interpret as meaning a subliminal, approximately 50% tensioning of the pelvic floor muscles. Am I way off base folks? Should I just keep doing my Kegel\u0092s 3-4 times a day and keep my fingers crossed? Am I fatiguing the pelvic floor muscles too much with the amount of exercises? I am scheduled for PT\u0085but Sept 26th is the earliest date I was able to obtain. The majority of what I've learned about urinary continence recovery is from the internet and a book entitled: \" 100 Questions and Answers about Prostate Cancer\" by Pamela Ellsworth, MD. I work 12 hour shifts in a busy Emergency Room and rarely if ever have the opportunity to sit\u0085perhaps 5 minutes out of an hour when I\u0092m starting an IV on a patient. I am beyond Blessed to have a supportive crew, manager and I am able to take 6-8 weeks off of work with it being a burden to our income flow. Thank you all in advance for sharing your knowledge, experiences and suggestions.",

Give your bladder a fighting chance to return to it's normal size over time. It tends to shrink during the post-surgery catheterization period.\" ^^ This one I am struggling with. It seems to be worse a couple of weeks post cath for me than it was initially. I tend to get pretty strong squirts as my bladder gets about 1/4 it's normal full. My bladder tends to reach it's old normal during the night while sleeping and only have to get up twice usually during the night. Tips and or suggestions welcomed folks. Rob...I use Amazon exclusively for my pads. I wore boxers for literally decades, but picked up a good supply of Fruit of the Loom and Hanes briefs prior to my surgery. I use the Depends Incontinence Guards (thick contoured pads). They cost $11.99 for 52 pads from Amazon at this time. We have AZ Prime, so no extra cost for shipping. I was familiar with these from multiple patients I've cared for in the ER I work in. They hold a remarkable amount of liquid for their size. A snug fitting pair of briefs is a necessity I've found. I have some of the Depends flex-fit Incontinence underwear that I used the first week after cath removal. This was probably overkill at the time, but I didn't know what to expect.

What an outstanding resource and awesome support you have here! Thank you!! I\u0092m 62, an RN (ER), married to a wonderful woman and Blessed each and every day. My PSA was 5.04 (Gleason 6) in late May during my annual PE at my Primary Care Doc\u0092s visit. Normal RE, so swelling, no urinary issues. I scheduled a Bx for June (28th). One positive cell and 2 atypical cells. I had a Robotic Assisted Radical Prostatectomy on 9/26. My surgery was pretty uneventful. I was released to home the following day. Of course with a Foley cath, 5 puncture wounds (subcuticular stitches covered with Dermabond) and no JP or any other drain. I share the majority of experiences I\u0092ve read here\u0085no issues with the catherter really, very sore lower abdomen and pain in the shoulders. But the discomfort lessened each and by Post Op Day 4 all was fine. I had my catherter removed Sept 2nd. My anxiety over the removal was much worse than the act itself\u0085minimal discomfort that was over, done and gone in a few seconds. My cath was removed in my Surgeon\u0092s office. He was able to spare both nerves and said the lymph nodes were clear. I am here seeking information, suggestions, and perhaps reassurance as regards my urinary incontinency. I read the entirety of this thread, including 98% of the linked threads and pages. THIS is solid Gold!  http://www.cancerforums.net/threads/...-Vinci-surgery I\u0092ve also searched and read multiple other threads related to my concern(s). I did start Kegel\u0092s exercises about one month before my surgery. Figuring that out was interesting as I\u0092ve never even considered them before embarking on this journey! So to my concerns\u0085The day of my cath removal I essentially had no control, very frequent \u0093squirts\u0094, but I was able to start and stop a stream while sitting on the toilet. (I didn\u0092t trust having enough time to stand and try LOL). I was not, nor have I been incontinent while sleeping in my bed at night, though I do get up about midway through the night and go urinate. While sitting, either in a recliner or upright in a chair, I have no incontinency issues. But when I stand my \u0093squirts\u0094 are pretty frequent! My surgeon assures me I am progressing very well. (I know him from work and have his cell number\u0085he\u0092s a good guy, Excellent Urological Surgeon and someone I trust.) OK. Those \u0093squirts\u0094 when standing\u0085 one of the links I read referred to developing the \u0093Knack\u0094 to reduce or eliminate these\u0085which I interpret as meaning a subliminal, approximately 50% tensioning of the pelvic floor muscles. Am I way off base folks? Should I just keep doing my Kegel\u0092s 3-4 times a day and keep my fingers crossed? Am I fatiguing the pelvic floor muscles too much with the amount of exercises? I am scheduled for PT\u0085but Sept 26th is the earliest date I was able to obtain.

      "Content": "Outstanding post and list with consolidation of information Rich!! Thank you! \"Try not to 'go' too often. Give your bladder a fighting chance to return to it's normal size over time. It tends to shrink during the post-surgery catheterization period.\" ^^ This one I am struggling with. It seems to be worse a couple of weeks post cath for me than it was initially. I tend to get pretty strong squirts as my bladder gets about 1/4 it's normal full. My bladder tends to reach it's old normal during the night while sleeping and only have to get up twice usually during the night. Tips and or suggestions welcomed folks. Rob...I use Amazon exclusively for my pads. I wore boxers for literally decades, but picked up a good supply of Fruit of the Loom and Hanes briefs prior to my surgery. I use the Depends Incontinence Guards (thick contoured pads). They cost $11.99 for 52 pads from Amazon at this time. We have AZ Prime, so no extra cost for shipping. I was familiar with these from multiple patients I've cared for in the ER I work in. They hold a remarkable amount of liquid for their size. A snug fitting pair of briefs is a necessity I've found. I have some of the Depends flex-fit Incontinence underwear that I used the first week after cath removal. This was probably overkill at the time, but I didn't know what to expect. I agree, they are hot and will make you sweat some, especially with increased activity such as walking. But I am maintaining a supply of them for that \"just an extra precaution\" when I return to work next month...like Rich suggests. I am really glad I listened to my surgeon when he recommended I take 8 weeks off (he works at the same facility as I do and personally knows the work I do), and Blessed I have several hundred hours of \"sick time\" banked. Thank you Lord! \"For pad/shield/diaper disposal I use quart size zipper plastic bags. $6 for a box of 100, and I can fit two pads in each baggie. Keeps the bath/bedroom from smelling like urine.\" Excellent Tip Rob! Good idea. I keep my emergency spare kit in these. I have one bag with \"baby wipes\" and one bag with 2 extra pads. These fit easily into a pocket in my jeans or a cargo pocket in my shorts. I made use of them yesterday at my MRI outing. Peace of mind, even if not an absolute necessity. Kozmic/Jeff...Where are you locating the generic pads etc? Jetfxr82. Welcome and that's encouraging & good news my friend! Great info and input. Thanks again Rob!",

Rob has already made many good points in this thread and has been very helpful in sharing his experiences with me, and all of our forum family. This \"caballero\" will be following this thread closely and updating as I learn and gain experiences. Thank you my friend.",

      "Content": "Excellent post by RobLee. Very good info and suggestions. I particularity like the bucket suggestion. Very smart move. The recliner suggestion is great as well. We had a recliner we purchased when we moved to our current location 10 years ago. We got a great buy on it, but we had never actually put it in use. It's been a God send! One suggestion I might add. If your Urologist hasn't yet mentioned PT and/or Kegel's Exercises, I would ask them about their suggestions on this. I personally believes it helps to start the Kegel's about 1 month before the surgery date. Other folks have differing opinions, so check with your surgeon. Here's a link to the Mayo Kegel Instruction's stickie at the top of this subforum Highlander posted: http://www.cancerforums.net/threads/...l-Instructions As regards PT, just make sure the therapist specializes in urinary incontinence. I had my last appointment with mine this morning. It really helps to have a knowledgeable professional to assist with this. imho. Best of luck to you and please keep us posted. Jamie",

I use the Depends Incontinence Guards (thick contoured pads). They cost $11.99 for 52 pads from Amazon at this time. We have AZ Prime, so no extra cost for shipping. I was familiar with these from multiple patients I've cared for in the ER I work in. They hold a remarkable amount of liquid for their size. A snug fitting pair of briefs is a necessity I've found. I have some of the Depends flex-fit Incontinence underwear that I used the first week after cath removal. This was probably overkill at the time, but I didn't know what to expect. I agree, they are hot and will make you sweat some, especially with increased activity such as walking. But I am maintaining a supply of them for that \"just an extra precaution\" when I return to work next month...like Rich suggests. I am really glad I listened to my surgeon when he recommended I take 8 weeks off (he works at the same facility as I do and personally knows the work I do), and Blessed I have several hundred hours of \"sick time\" banked. Thank you Lord! \"For pad/shield/diaper disposal I use quart size zipper plastic bags. $6 for a box of 100, and I can fit two pads in each baggie. Keeps the bath/bedroom from smelling like urine.\" Excellent Tip Rob! Good idea. I keep my emergency spare kit in these. I have one bag with \"baby wipes\" and one bag with 2 extra pads. These fit easily into a pocket in my jeans or a cargo pocket in my shorts. I made use of them yesterday at my MRI outing. Peace of mind, even if not an absolute necessity.

      "Content": "Thank you Rob for starting this thread. The information I've gleaned here has been incredibly appreciated and informative. At least I know \"I'm not alone\" in this journey. As Rob said...my \"Post Op Day 10\" has long passed, but I remain hopeful. I don't have my first PT appointment for Incontinence training until Sept. 26th. Knowledge is power, so I am definitely looking forward to the 26th. Rob has already made many good points in this thread and has been very helpful in sharing his experiences with me, and all of our forum family. This \"caballero\" will be following this thread closely and updating as I learn and gain experiences. Thank you my friend.",

Give your bladder a fighting chance to return to it's normal size over time. It tends to shrink during the post-surgery catheterization period.\" ^^ This one I am struggling with. It seems to be worse a couple of weeks post cath for me than it was initially. I tend to get pretty strong squirts as my bladder gets about 1/4 it's normal full.
