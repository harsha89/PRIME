      "Content": "Hubby has been seeing the oncologist at UofM. He has been monitoring him over the last year. PSA is on a steady rise. Two scans later bone and abdominal (February and September) we have located where it has spread. Small spot lit up, lower back, in the sacrum. While at last appointment, hubby was asked if he would be interested in doing a clinical research trial. It could help him (or so he said) to locate any other areas of concern. The trial is called PyL. There are a few articles on the net that we have been reading about. It involves them injecting, and doing a different kind of scan. Also a bone biopsy to study. Although it may be beneficial, hubby is leaning towards NOT being in this trial. I didn't think a bone biopsy sounded like fun. Anyone else do one of these? If only one spot shows up, doctor said they could radiate it. We are very doubtful that there is only one. We return to UofM next week, with a decision. Looks like hormones are next.",

He was able to come home the next day, but didn't have the issues that you did. Lucky You! NOT! Hope all went well and that your path report is decent. DH's appt is on Thurs for cath removal and results. Then onto the next journey and hump to get over (incontinence). Other members will be here soon! They are so helpful! I'm just a newbie too offering you a warm welcome!",
