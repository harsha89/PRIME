      "Content": "Da Vinci Robotic Prostatectomy surgery is gaining popularity as a less traumatic and minimally invasive alternative for treating and removing prostate cancer. The most famous robotic prostatectomy system available today is the da Vinci Robot manufactured by Intuitive Surgical. The da Vinci robotic system enables surgeons to overcome many of the shortcomings of both open prostatectomy and laparoscopic radical prostatectomy. As with any surgical procedure, the benefits of a da Vinci Prostatectomy cannot be guaranteed as surgery is both patient and procedure specific. However, patient testimonials and media coverage attest that da Vinci Robotic Prostatectomy patients are discharged within 24- hours of their surgery. Many patients leave the same day, and often walk out of the hospital within hours of their robotic prostatectomy surgery. For most patients use of the da Vinci Prostatectomy provides superior benefits over traditional open or laparoscopic prostatectomy.",

      "Content": "Radical prostatectomy cuts the connection between the testicles (where sperm are produced) and the urethra. This means that a man can no longer father a child by natural means. Often, this is not an issue, as men with prostate cancer tend to be older. But if it is a concern for you, you may want to speak with your doctor about \"banking\" your sperm before the operation.",
