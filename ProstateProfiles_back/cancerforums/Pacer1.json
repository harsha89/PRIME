      "Content": "I am not very happy with the performance either. I am now four months passing the surgery. Initially, the doc put me on three times a week cialis treatment which I found does not help much because I get semi erection without it as well. Never full even with cialis. Now the doc put me on cialis daily routine. I really hope that it will help me in long term. Yes, i think we all feel depressed sometime when you think about BEFORE and AFTER, but I try to not think about it. I have not tried any other methods yet. Still doing some research. Yep, don't give up.",

      "Content": "My U dr prescribed daily Cialis for whole year and he said it will help ED. Since my insurance only pays 6 pills a month, my dr sent me to a pharmacy which makes generic Cialis compound. I think it works as good as the original pill. I think I am getting better in that area. By the way, the Cialis compound costs $50 for 30 days supply which is not bad. If anyone needs the contract info for the pharmacy, please let me know.",
