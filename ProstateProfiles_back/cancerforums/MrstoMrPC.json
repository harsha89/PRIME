      "Content": "My husband was diagnosed 3 years ago- Stage 4 metastatic PC. Started immediately on docataxel with hormon shots monthly, have already done radiation, provenge, and Xtandi- new scans show enormous amounts of new mestasis on spine , ribs, legs, and feet . Started second cycle of chemo. I feel like the doctor is being vague- my gut is telling me this is not good and time is running out. Anyone else have a rapid aggressive growing form of PC? There are so many articles out there, one says he\u0092s going to die within months while others seem to give the illusion of lasting years. Thoughts? Experiences??",

      "Content": "Thanks everyone! We asked the doctor about clinical trials and he said there aren\u0092t any right now that he would be eligible for... so chemo it is for now. Second round on 3/28, scans again in June to see if it\u0092s even working to help slow it down.",
