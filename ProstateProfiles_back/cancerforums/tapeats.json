      "Content": "Hello... I mistakenly posted this to the general cancer thread by mistake. Thought I would post here since trying to get information is somewhat difficult and contradictory. I was diagnosed with PC in 2010. PSA 50, Gs 8. MRI/CAT/Sonogram came back negative. Did 8 weeks of IMRT, along with 2 years of Lupron. PSA went down to ~ .05, and stayed around .1 for 2 1/2 years. Last two PSA readings were .35 and .65. I am wondering what options are open to me for salvage treatment(s) if my PSA continues to rise. If my PSA rises again (I go back in April for another test), then my Urologist will schedule a biopsy. Depending on the results of that test, he will recommend further treatment with Lupron. I asked about surgury if the biopsy comes back with limited positive indications (1 spot?). If the info is spotty, I am still trying to digest all I have read and researched. Thanks",
