From what I know there are continuing issues regarding continence. These are things which he will not talk about. I wish I could talk to him about such issues but he is totally closed. Planes run in the family. My father was an RAF pilot in the second World War. He is not the type of person to talk about things like that. Which makes it even more difficult I am pretty sure he is not continent. Prostate cancer does not run in the family. You question as to whether treatment was successful is I think highly pertinent. I am not sure of the statistical facts but whatever, it must have a bearing on ones perception of mortality. Psychologically, I think this might be root of the problem. He always was the most caring, giving person you could wish to meet. Now he cares more about spanners and sanding machines than any human being. No contact with friends or anybody else. Yes I agree, I think that the realization of mortality has had a profound effect. Yes, building your aircraft is a very dangerous hobby, he has only taken it up since the surgery. He has always been obsessed with flying. He does not have years of experience in building aircraft and yes it does correlate with his prostate. Dear DMW. I am not sure whether or not to let him carrying on building his airplane or not. It is quite an obsession and I am sure he will get up into the air, for how long I don't know, but that might be enough for him. You can only help people if they want to talk to you, and he doesn't. So, where do I go? Robert",
