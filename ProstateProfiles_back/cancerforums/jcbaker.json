    "Content": "Hello everyone, My name is Jerry, and I have come this forum in an effort to reduce my anxiety and depression levels. I have had prostate cancer for just over a year and recently was told that it has spread to my abdominal lymph nodes(3). To give you a general picture of what I am going thru, when I finished radiation therapy in january, my PSA had gone down from 16.2(when they diagnosed me) to 0.05. Today, it is at 910. To say that I am shocked is a huge understatement. I am very scared and terribly depressed. i recently told my Oncologist that I was going to take an active role in my cancer treatment. That means, I now am pursuing additional modalities, (immunotherapy and possibly clinical trials) I am also seeing a nutritionist, chiropractor, and an Acupuncturist. Both of these are to treat the pain. I was told by my nutritionist to xtop all dairy, because I have a lactose allergy. Since I have done this, I have felt much less fatigue.My questions are basically how do you deal with pain that never completely goes away. How do you sleep and concentrate at work, etc. I am also taking strong narcotic pain medicines, which have done little to alleviate the pain. How do you deal with or prevent the depression? How are you dealing with the fear of experiencing terrible pain for longs periods. Last, how do you come to grips with your mortality?????????? ANY response to any of these questions, will be greatly appreciated. Thanks for letting me vent. Jerry",
