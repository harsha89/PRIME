And lastly, these wet pads and Depends briefs are causing some mild \"diaper rash.\" I wash with soap and water every time I change pads/briefs and apply a skin cream with aloe, which helps, but wondered if anyone has found anything better. For me, aloe salves seemed to make it worse. They soothed but did not help the rash to dry-out. Lanolin worked better for me [bag balm]. Someone recommended 'Corn-huskers' which I think is mineral oil based. If all else fails try diaper-rash ointment, that is what they formulated it to treat. I quickly recovered urinary control. But for some reason occasional diaper rash has plagued me. Be patient.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by rwewpar4 ... I discussed this with my wife and she wasn\u2019t certain that she was comfortable with the idea of artificially achieving an erection. She said that she may need to talk to a councilor. First, congratulations on getting diagnosed in time, and your successful surgery. Next, from how I read your post, your wife recognizes that she has an issue, and that she needs therapy. Which is actually a big step. My wife had a back injury a couple years after we were married. As a side effect she began menopause at 25 and began feeling pain during intercourse. Her body could no longer lubricate, and she quickly lost interest in sex. Most of our 35 years of marriage has been celibate. Now that I am post-surgery, I like all men, am concerned if I can have an erection. Like you in your position, my wife does not care. So here we are. I understand frustration brother. I have found that the Tri-mix injections work really well. If you do not like the vacuum pump, you can always try the injections.",

I am still wearing the diaper all day, as any cough or sneeze makes me leak. At 2 weeks I also began passing blood in my urine. It is extremely important to take it easy, rest and avoid lifting. My first PSA test is scheduled 3 months after surgery. At this point I do not have any additional treatments scheduled, we will wait to see the PSA test results. I wish your husband the best.",

      "Content": "I am an organic farmer. In a field of 40 different types of cancers, there are a few types of cancer strongly linked to diet. The type of cancer with the strongest known link is colon cancer, the negative links for colon cancer are red meats and nitrates. For prostate cancer the known positive links are lycopene and pomegranate. But even a diet rich in these does not guarantee anything. Cumin and turmeric are both associated with one of the cancers, but I do not recall which one. There are many different types of cancer. What triggers one, is different from what triggers another. Nothing totally prevents any of them. Prevention is a matter of reducing risk. But say if you have a 90% chance of getting prostate cancer, reducing that risk to only 85% is something, but it is not a huge preventative. Here I am. Into organics, mid-50s, outdoors and active lifestyle, I eat all the right things. I have been attending an annual workshop presented locally by a Oncologist on the most recent research into dietary links to cancers. He has a wonderful presentation, there have been thousands of studies done. He is the only person I am aware of trying to compile the data, and present it in a workshop. I have been adjusting my diet according to the latest research. My PCP was shocked that I wanted a PSA test done with my last check-up. Initially she refused to even test me. I had to talk her into it. In her mind, I fit the image of a man who would never have prostate cancer. It was a total surprise that I had a PSA of 22 and gleason 9.",

      "Content": "I am an organic farmer. In a field of 40 different types of cancers, there are a few types of cancer strongly linked to diet. The type of cancer with the strongest known link is colon cancer, the negative links for colon cancer are red meats and nitrates. For prostate cancer the known positive links are lycopene and pomegranate. But even a diet rich in these does not guarantee anything. Cumin and turmeric are both associated with one of the cancers, but I do not recall which one. There are many different types of cancer. What triggers one, is different from what triggers another. Nothing totally prevents any of them. Prevention is a matter of reducing risk. But say if you have a 90% chance of getting prostate cancer, reducing that risk to only 85% is something, but it is not a huge preventative. Here I am. Into organics, mid-50s, outdoors and active lifestyle, I eat all the right things.

      "Content": "In all cases, it is really up to the discretion of the surgeon during the operation. His training, his experience, his ability to recognize if the nerves can be safely spared, or not. Before the surgery, he can look at the tests, and he can make a general guess as to what will happen during the surgery. But it is a guess. Before my operation, my surgeon told me that given my test results, my nerves needed to go. Previously in his career he had spared the nerves, in cases like mine, and in those cases, the cancer spread. The more you focus on nerve-sparing, the more likely that the cancer will not all be removed. In my case, he seemed pretty sure that if he spared the nerves, I would still have cancer. He told us all of this, before my surgery date. I would hope that your cancer has not spread to such an extent, and that your nerves can be spared.",

I have not needed a diaper for 2 months now, and I have not used any pad for about a month. I still get a small bit of leakage when I am tired, or when I have had a few drinks. But I do not leak when I am sleeping. He said that I am well above par for this, as many men will be fighting leakage for up to a year after surgery. During the surgery he also clipped the artery that leads to my testicles to remove a varicocele, that he been bothering me since I was a teenager. So the urologist wanted to inspect how much the varicocele had deflated, and if it was bothering me any more. I am very happy with that also, as the varicocele seems to be completely gone. I asked him about viagra. He said that he could give me viagra, but it will not work on me. Because he removed the nerve bundle, the mechanism of viagra will not function for me. Instead what I will need to do is the injections. He ordered the script for me, and said I will need an appointment for them to instruct me on where exactly to inject myself.",

In accordance with my post-op documents, I went to an ER. For their urine sample, there was obvious blood in the sample. After a few hours, I was given Cipro, told that this is normal, and I was sent home. They contacted my urologist, and followed his advice. Somehow I am not comforted with this development. When I was released from the hospital post-surgery, I had no blood in my urine. So I was not expecting to see any now. How normal is this?",

If healthcare is done from a viewpoint of herd management, then you accept the anticipated losses. Radiation is done in this manner. You do harm, on purpose, in the hope that most of the herd will be okay. Look at Chinese medicine, or on the other hand Ayurvedic medicine. Both systems have been around for thousands of years.

      "Content": "I am glad that I had PSA tests done. If I had not had PSA tests done, I would likely be the example of the guy who was not detected until it was too late. My wife is on a couple other forums. As it turns out, there she speaks with a nurse from Canada and a MD from Auz. Both of them, had previously told her that in their regions PSA are not used like this. Both of them recommended to her, for me 'not' to have the biopsy. \"... PSA is too unreliable, the chances of it being an aggressive cancer are minimal, etc\". Since my surgery, both of those posters, have came back and apologized to my wife for their bad advice. This is a problem of 'Herd Management'. If you look at the entire herd, when you see a disease spreading, you give out vaxx. Even when you know at the outset, that your vaxx will kill and maim a small percentage. It is better for the herd, to stop the spread of the disease, and ignore those you have killed or maimed. I had a friend who was a lab-tech who spent his career making the polio vaxx. As an elderly man, his biggest regret was the thousands of children that his work had maimed. They never went on to perfect a 'cure' that lacked the known side effects [1 out of 1,000 will be maimed in this manner, so many will have that reaction, etc]. If healthcare is done from a viewpoint of herd management, then you accept the anticipated losses. Radiation is done in this manner. You do harm, on purpose, in the hope that most of the herd will be okay. Look at Chinese medicine, or on the other hand Ayurvedic medicine. Both systems have been around for thousands of years. Both have had to treat these same diseases. Neither system intentionally harms you, with the intent that maybe you will be among the lucky to survive the treatment.",

Though I will admit, for being the first time my penis has stretched out in such a long time, it was painful.

      "Content": "I went in for surgery one morning. I woke-up that night in hospital and I was not in any pain [obviously I had IV meds going]. The next afternoon I was sent home. At that time, I was taking acetaminophen 500mg and oxy 5mg. I had a catheter/bag for a week, then I got it removed. I wore a diaper all day/night for about a week. Then the diaper only when I was in bed for the next 2 weeks. Before going in for surgery, I was taking Naproxen Sodium [Aleve] everyday for mild back pain and to keep my Bursitisis under control. [I am a farmer, I carry sacks of feed / etc around every day] My Urologist wanted me to shift to acetaminophen during my recovery, as it would not interfere with my recovery. When I was sent home, I was given oxy at 5mg for the first week. I only took it 2 days though and did not need it any further. Now 2 months after surgery, I am going back to Naproxen Sodium. Maybe it is because I take a NSAID every day anyway, but I have not had much pain from the site of PC surgery. I also had a varicocelectomy done at the same time. Due to that surgery, my scrotum has been very tender, and it has only faded in the last 2 weeks.",

I saw my urologist 2 days ago, to instruct me on how to do the injections. He also said that it would keep long term frozen, and to only thaw the vial I was using.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by azgreywolf Jebstart, I was left with one nerve, badly damaged. 150mg of Viagra gave a little size, but still too droopy to even try to use. Trimix only got me a semi, again not adequate for penetration. A vacuum pump with 3 rings got me fully up, but much of the blood pushed back out anyway on insertion and I'd be in but floppy. I've had one orgasm via intercourse in 3.5 years. The implant is my last great hope. If you're only 10 months out and getting a semi, give it some time. I've heard surgeons won't do an implant till 24 months post-op at the earliest. I am curious, one damaged nerve and a vacuum pump can get you up, but the blood drains away as soon as the pump is removed. Is that because of the damaged nerve? Anyone? What if the nerve had been removed entirely? Anyone?",
