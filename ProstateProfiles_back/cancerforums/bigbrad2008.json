      "Content": "Originally Posted by dupres In Aug, 2010, I was diagnosed with PCa (PSA-29, Gleason 4+3). In Dec, 2010 I began a 6 month program of Androgen Deprivation Therapy and had IMRT beginning in Feb. 2011. Since that time, my PSA has been raising and, to me, seems high. My results are as follows (note- the 5/31/11 test was while I was still on ADT, which ended in mid June): PSA <0.1 05/31/2011 PSA 0.9 08/30/2011 PSA 1.2 11/29/2011 PSA 1.2 02/27/2012 PSA 1.4 05/22/2012 My urologist says \u201cYour PSA remains stable.\u201d SAY WHAT?!!! I haven\u2019t been able to find out much about post radiation PSA levels, but what I have found would indicate that my case is unusual (to say the least). My PSA seems high and seems to be on an upward trend. When a PSA reaches 2.0 post radiation, it usually is taken to mean the treatment failed. I am on this forum looking for information (how common ARE my results so far), advice, opinions, references to published research, etc. Thanks. What happened, did PSA continue to rise, did you do ADT? I am having the same issue but I have 2 differences, I am at 0.49 right now, 6 months after hormone withdrawal. My dr wants me back on ADT, I am opposed.",

External Beam Therapy. They zap you from the outside of your body. HDBT High Dose Brachiotherapy, you get radioactive material right in your prostate. As it is high dose, it is a temporary procedure. LDBT, low dose brachiotherapy refers to radioactive material being left in as it is not that radioactive. Their is no decent data comparing high -dose vs. low dose but I choose high-dose as my radiologists said if it was him that is what he would get, I said why. He said since it is very temporary, they make sure they position it right where they want it. They may not do that as good with low dose and the radioactive implants may move a bit over time so they are not as concerned with placement. I think the Dr doing it is more imp than the procedure I feel, but it is a crap shoot on picking HDBT vs LDBT.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by SeaCock Thanks newporter... Here is my uneducated thoughts; I feel that if testosterone causes PC to get worse...wouldn't PC be a young mans disease. The older we get the lower our test gets, the more likely you are to get PC. So I think a case could be made that lower...or dropping test causes PC to kick off and start being an issue. It just seems like if it is truce test causes cancer to grow and be more active...young men should be more prone to cancer than older men... Testosterone may be important, how important is open to debate. In regards to younger men having higher T and little PCa (a theory talked about by others with expertise in this field) I think that is a red herring. Why? Young folks that smoke may have lower rates of certain cancer types than older non-smokers do. Does that mean smoking is unrelated to cancer? NO. It means smoking and other factors, like age, are involved. I am NOT saying testosterone has a major role in prostate cancer, I am saying that age of onset is not a way to determine the importance of testosterone. If one wants to determine if T plays a role, you cannot mess up the data by using different age groups in the analysis. The best research is done by looking at one variable at a time and trying to hold everything else the same in both groups.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by Fairwind Hormone therapy is used in one of two ways..First as an adjunct to some other form of primary treatment be it surgery or radiation. Studies have shown it can increase the effectiveness of SRT, salvage radiation treatment, and it can also be used to augment any radiation treatment. Radiation Oncologists love it because it makes them look good both in the short term and hopefully in the long term.. In the past, HT was used as a primary treatment for late-stage PC discovered before the age of the PSA test. Physical castration was the method employed. This never CURED anyone of Prostate Cancer, but it gave them several years of survival improvement. Today, it still offers no cure, it's a palliative treatment, and drugs are used instead of castration. Since it's effective and relatively inexpensive, it's still used before the newer, far more expensive therapies that are now available..When the HT stops working and the patients PSA continues to rise, it's referred to as becoming \"hormone refractory\".. The downside of HT are the side-effects...They begin with hot flashes which can be severe, many men feel fatigued and listless, some suffer emotional upsets, all sex drive and ability quickly evaporates, breast development begins, body hair disappears, ones personality becomes a lot more \"mellow\"... Not everyone suffers all these things at the same time, but as the duration of treatment grows longer, the side-effects become more prominent..The unspoken truth is that few men have to endure HT for prolonged periods of time....Another unspoken truth, the longer you are on HT, the longer it takes to recover from it and after 3 years or so, the effect of the drugs becomes permanent in most men... Men without health insurance might wish to consider physical castration as the long-term cost of the drugs used can be quite high. Castration is the least expensive form of HT and it's thought to be the most effective as it lowers testosterone levels to almost nothing... Good review of the negative side affects. I experienced them all in the 4 months I was on hormones. The sexual side affects were not that hard to deal with, but the hot flashes, fatigue, etc were bad. The depression hit me big time at like 4 months on treatment and it appeared the hormones had done its job. I could have gotten medication to counteract the depression but I just stopped the hormones 2 months early. In regards to your suggestion to possibly get castration I disagree. The thing about hormones is that you can stop the treatment when side affects get so bad that no matter the benefit they afford, the cons outweigh it. As far as I know, you can't get un-castarated. If due to financial reasons, I would not continue on hormones long-term, I would be ok with that as they are palliative (your words) and have huge side-affects for me and many. Even if they offered more than just palliative benefits, I personally would be very concerned taking them again. HAVING SAID THAT, HORMONES ARE USED BY MANY AND THEY ARE OK WITH THE SIDE AFFECTS. I WAS NOT.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by SeaCock Thanks newporter... Here is my uneducated thoughts; I feel that if testosterone causes PC to get worse...wouldn't PC be a young mans disease. The older we get the lower our test gets, the more likely you are to get PC. So I think a case could be made that lower...or dropping test causes PC to kick off and start being an issue. It just seems like if it is truce test causes cancer to grow and be more active...young men should be more prone to cancer than older men... Testosterone may be important, how important is open to debate. In regards to younger men having higher T and little PCa (a theory talked about by others with expertise in this field) I think that is a red herring. Why? Young folks that smoke may have lower rates of certain cancer types than older non-smokers do. Does that mean smoking is unrelated to cancer? NO. It means smoking and other factors, like age, are involved. I am NOT saying testosterone has a major role in prostate cancer, I am saying that age of onset is not a way to determine the importance of testosterone. If one wants to determine if T plays a role, you cannot mess up the data by using different age groups in the analysis. The best research is done by looking at one variable at a time and trying to hold everything else the same in both groups.",

Do you think they will say, our machine is a bit outdated but since we have it, we have to use it?

However, attributing it to their ethnicity is a real jump. I'd think we'd have to look at what the occurrence of PC is among blacks in other countries, take a look at black men who were raised by white people and compare them to the overall results before jumping to any conclusions. They tell me that asian men have a very low PC rate in Asia- but if they move here, they end up with a rate comparable to the rest of us. My guess is that it is more diet related than genetic. And what in the diet is different?",

      "Content": "I had radiation treatment for my PCa about 3 years ago and things went great, my PSA dropped. About 2 months, with routine follow up testing, it shot up. My oncologist said I am setting up a bone scan, MRI and CT here (in Iowa) and you should go to Mayo for a choline scan (choline scan is much more sensirive and good for recurrent PCa). Since I have HMO and Mayo is not in my region, insurance issues. So I was in a quandry. I checked around and the hospital in Decataur Illnois offered the choline scan. They do a regulasr MRI, CT and then do a choline one. I said my insurance will not pay anything and they said most will be 1500. Great deal. The nurse at that location gives EXCELLENT CUSTOMER SERVICE. She gave me local hotels to stay at (it is a 5 hour drive) and the tests start aT 9 AM AND END AT 1 PM. They tell you if they found anything and give you a CD with images on to take back to your local Dr (customer service). Cheap and quick and nice. It is part of a clinical trial so you can get details on it by searching the NIH clinical trial thing. You must have recurrent PCa as determined by a rise in PSA, details on the trial details. https://www.centerwatch.com/clinical...catur&State=IL My elevated PSA was a lab mistake sop I did not need this service as 2 subsequent PSA tests have shown it was a false positive. But the price and service seemed great so I am passing this on. Another thing, FUSION biopsy. That is when the person doing the biopsy uses the sensitive scan along with an real time ultrasound scan to target the most likely area of cancer. Regulsr biopsys are randomof the prostate and may miss the cancerous portion. I think it very important to do a fusion biopsy for recurrent PCa as it might be hard to find where to sample as the initial treatment makes youir prostate real small or non-existent. I talked to my local doc, should I bring back the CD and have the biopsy person use that to do a fusion biopsy (most places do not do the choline scan). She said NO. A fusion biopsy would be improved she felt if the person doing the fusion biopsy does them often, and the local hospital does not do them often. I hope this imnformation is not needed as no one should have recurrent PCa, but if you do, I have done some of the leg work for your journey. A positive note, just a few years ago the treatment for recurrent PCa was very limited but it has really exploded recently. So some of the newer therapies and expeerimntal therapies offer us great hope.",

Those on the drugs have about a 18 percent chance of cancer returning and those not taking them 42 percent at 4 years. As I was in the high risk category I figured a 50 % chance of recurrence at 5 years. But that was older rad doses so with the newer dose I dropped it to 35%. Now with the fact that I am on warfarin I can go from 18 to 10, I am kicking ass. lol. They think the anti-cosgulant may make the cancer cells more sus to radiation as it may alter the biochemistry of the cells. AWESOME.

And I love the word likely, when I use it in my papers it means, I think this may happen but I can't find anything to back my views.",

      "Content": "OK, I think this may be an article we all should read. http://jco.ascopubs.org/content/30/35/4294.full The authors work at John Hopkins and discuss upgrading after surgery etc. They state at the start. \"Overtreatment of low-grade prostate cancer (Gleason score ≤ 6) is a recognized problem today, with systematic prostate gland sampling triggered by prostate-specific antigen (PSA) measurements.1 The extent to which overtreatment is caused by fear of death resulting from cancer, fear of litigation from undertreatment, and misaligned incentives that reimburse more for treating rather than monitoring when appropriate is not known. Nevertheless, fear of death resulting from cancer likely plays some role, and removing the label \u201ccancer\u201d could reduce unnecessary treatment of low-grade disease.2,3 On the other hand, undertreatment of prostate cancer and a missed opportunity for cure in those who could benefit is a real risk of relabeling a cancer as noncancer. We have decided on an alternative modification of the Gleason scoring system and herein present the arguments for and against removing the label of cancer from Gleason 6 tumors. We believe that our alternative approach may help: one, ensure that patients receive the proper counseling/treatment; two, reduce the risk of overtreatment and its associated harms; and three, improve shared decision making. .\"",

      "Content": "thanks, the biggest drawback i see is that this was a retrospective study, not a randomized one. 1) a director of womans studies, any background in test therapy or prostate. 2) i agree correlation does not always mean causation but it might. She/He is a gynecologist? they did look at numerous other conditions that the patients suffered from (includid lipid levels) and the Tes Ther was known as it was a prescription, so it was not willy nilly administration. The article is also similar to 3 other published studies. There is one study where tes levels had the opposite affect but those were naturally occuring test levels not from therapy. we can always find a few doctors that disagree with the majority, and they might be right. but i will wait on tes ther till we get data from the nih clinical trials, which are randomized. from the article i found the most interesting conclusion was this, studies funded by the pharm industry did not have much of a neg affect but in studies funded by different ways, the tes ther was big. seems like the funding source affects the results and that is interesting as heck.",

So they have upped the rads doses. So take what you read with a grain of salt as we got higher doses and likely have better odds. what was your dre? any image evidence of outside of prostate? did you get imrt alone or brachiotherapy on top of imrt?",

In other words, who really knows. If it was me, I would stay with AS till my PSA reached 10 or if the biopsy went up to 7. But Bud thinks he will live 30 years so maybe that means I am being to much AS liking. If Bud goes for the treatment, who knows. I chose radiation (both beam and brachiotherapy) for a strange reason, it did not interfere with my bike riding. That was my decision maker. The urologist, guy doing the surgery kinna agreed as my PSA was high (19) suggesting that I had some mets outside of my prostate so zapping would be better. The beam zaps were expanded to my lymph nodes to give any extra-prostatic cancer a zap. The advantage to surgery is you can easily do follow up with radiation but not the other way around. I also choose the radiation as that was part of the trial at my local hospital and I like trials, more data is always good. I was FURIOUS when I got kicked out of trial however. I was eligible and the 2 places doing the 2 types of radiation were enrolled in doing the trial. However, the expert for the ex beam was at a hospital 30 miles from the dude who did the brachiotherapy. I was thinking, since they both are in the trial I will be fine, I was not allowed to go to 2 places, had to go to only 1 if I was to stay in the trial. I choose doing the 2 places, as that was best for me. And when they did the brachiotherapy, the ex beam guy and his team came down and learned that procedure and are now instituting that. So it was a very crowded surgery room. I also looked at radiation success, surgery seemed to have a bit better results but that data is based on lower and older dosages. They are using higher doses now so likely it is equal to surgery, but time will tell. I also considered (guessed) high does radiation vs surgery followed by radiation. Hard to compare those 2 as it is not known when using high dose. So, I have answered by saying, no definite answer, so who knows. I think this may give you insight into how I think. My one dr thought I relapsed based on my post radiation PSA amounts, I knew she was wrong. I had a follow up with another Dr and he said, you have no evidence of relapse, my daughter was with me.

      "Content": "Since you are twins, I will give my 2 cents worth. I have read countless articles and am shocked by the lack of definitive research. But then in retrospect, I realized that the differing opinions of the experts are due to the fact that their is a lot of unknown due to the slow nature of PCa so they guess a bit. In other words, who really knows. If it was me, I would stay with AS till my PSA reached 10 or if the biopsy went up to 7. But Bud thinks he will live 30 years so maybe that means I am being to much AS liking. If Bud goes for the treatment, who knows. I chose radiation (both beam and brachiotherapy) for a strange reason, it did not interfere with my bike riding. That was my decision maker. The urologist, guy doing the surgery kinna agreed as my PSA was high (19) suggesting that I had some mets outside of my prostate so zapping would be better. The beam zaps were expanded to my lymph nodes to give any extra-prostatic cancer a zap. The advantage to surgery is you can easily do follow up with radiation but not the other way around. I also choose the radiation as that was part of the trial at my local hospital and I like trials, more data is always good. I was FURIOUS when I got kicked out of trial however. I was eligible and the 2 places doing the 2 types of radiation were enrolled in doing the trial. However, the expert for the ex beam was at a hospital 30 miles from the dude who did the brachiotherapy. I was thinking, since they both are in the trial I will be fine, I was not allowed to go to 2 places, had to go to only 1 if I was to stay in the trial. I choose doing the 2 places, as that was best for me. And when they did the brachiotherapy, the ex beam guy and his team came down and learned that procedure and are now instituting that. So it was a very crowded surgery room. I also looked at radiation success, surgery seemed to have a bit better results but that data is based on lower and older dosages. They are using higher doses now so likely it is equal to surgery, but time will tell. I also considered (guessed) high does radiation vs surgery followed by radiation. Hard to compare those 2 as it is not known when using high dose. So, I have answered by saying, no definite answer, so who knows. I think this may give you insight into how I think. My one dr thought I relapsed based on my post radiation PSA amounts, I knew she was wrong. I had a follow up with another Dr and he said, you have no evidence of relapse, my daughter was with me. She saw me smile and then said, you seem to be more happy with being right than with knowing your cancer has not returned, I said of course I am. Cancer is not that biggie to me, being smarter than my drs is what gets me excited. And I hate to say this, but the penalty for me being wrong makes this even more exciting, that is strange but I do enjoy that part.",

T level was 6 during hormone therapy and then rose to 486 in April 2013. Recently in September this year, PSA was 0.01, still undetectable, but there may be an upward trend. T level dropped to 350. I think T level will stabilize at a lower level, I feel there is decrease in my libido, and am curious if the relatively lower T level has any effect on PSA level and velocity",

Journal of Urology. Innovations and Challenges in Prostate Cancer: Prevention, Detection and Treatment: Fourth International Conference. 172(5, Part 2 of 2) Supplement:S38-S41, November 2004. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the use of hormone therapy when combined with radiotherapy prior to a radical prostatectomy. Physicians analyzed ongoing clinical trials in an effort to identify prostate cancer patients who will benefit most from this combination. In patients with low Gleason scores, short-term androgen ablation improved cause specific survival rates. For high-grade prostate cancer, long-term androgen ablation is required. Patients at intermediate risk are candidates for short-term androgen ablation, however there is a lack of trials that assess overall treatment benefit. Doctors advise patients with low risk prostate cancer to not receive androgen ablation unless additional data support a substantial clinical benefit. Patients with a high-risk for pelvic lymph node involvement may receive whole pelvic radiotherapy in order to maximize biochemical interaction. Hormonal Therapy and Radiotherapy for Localized Prostate Cancer: Who, Where, and How Long?\u0094 ROACH, MACK III Journal of Urology. 170(6, Part 2 of 2):S35-S41, December 2003. In this study 1, 323 patients with a risk of lymph node involvement greater than 15 percent were analyzed to determine the success rate of hormone therapy used with external beam radiation. Long-term hormone therapy was tested against short-term. Doctors compared whole pelvis radiotherapy, radiotherapy of the prostate alone, neoadjuvant hormone therapy and concurrent hormone therapy with radiotherapy, and radiotherapy with adjuvant hormone therapy. They strived to find out which one out of the four would most improve progression-free survival. After five years, all four treatments were contrasted and whole pelvis radiotherapy as well as neoadjuvant and concurrent hormone therapy with radiotherapy were found to be the best options in the improvement of progression-free survival. \u0093Neoadjuvant Hormone Therapy Before Salvage Radiotherapy for an Increasing Post-radical Prostatectomy Serum Prostate Specific Antigen Level\u0094 TIGUERT, RABI; RIGAUD, JEROME; LACOMBE, LOUIS; LAVERDIERE, JACQUES; FRADET, YVES Journal of Urology. 170(2, Part 1):447-450, August 2003. Within this study doctors retrospectively evaluated 81 patients who were treated with neoadjuvant androgen deprivation therapy before salvage external beam radiation treatment due to an increased PSA level following radical retropubic prostatectomy. Patients were analyzed based on the outcome of preoperative, pathological, postoperative characteristics, pre-salvage treatment, and radiation therapy. Prior to the salvage radiotherapy patients received a 3-month injection of a luteinizing hormone releasing hormone analogue. Doctors followed up with their patients approximately 38 months after external beam radiation and 91 months after radical prostatectomy. At three years 75% of patients were free of biochemical failure and 50% were at 5 years. Two patients (2 percent) died of prostate cancer. Those who benefited most from this treatment were patients with a pre-radiation PSA level less than 1 and a Gleason score less than 7.",

One day they told me, your bowel is not empty, so go to the bathroom but keep your bladder full. Yeah right. lol. So I had to drink more water and wait a bit but that only 1 time. However, there was on side affect that came up unexpectedly. I had to go get radiation every day and I always took my dogs along. They loved the 15 minute ride and I was in and out in 15 minutes. The day I had to wait meant the dogs had to wait. The one dog got bored during that long wait and ATE THE BACK SEAT. I am not talking a little damage I am talking destroying the whole damm seat. Frickin dog, lol. So that is a sidew affect that they do not talk about. lol. The oncolgist and staff laughed and laughed.",

This combination (combined with hormones), is being done a lot now. Again, as that is the combination I had, I am biased. Good luck with either option, radiation or surgery. The side effects from either are not usually too severe. Hormones are great treatment but the side effects really do SUCK. lol. I know.",

Normally I can see the PSA results on line but the Dr has not released them yet and I am very very nervous.

      "Content": "Originally Posted by traveller Hi, I am a G8 and have been through surgery, ART and AHT. After stopping the hormone therapy my T level was restored. My question is does it matter to have high or low T levels on PSA? In other words, if there is residual cancer cells and PSA increases due to increase in testosterone, will PSA increase higher and faster if T level is higher (i.e. T level being 500ng/ml vs 200ng/ml). First of all, I could be very wrong on this. Testosterone has been thought to add fuel to the fire so that is why exogenous T is normally not recommended for those with PCa. Your situation, like mine, is different than the preceding. You are measuring endogenous T which has rebounded due to the affects of the hormones going away. In my case, both went up and I think that happens to everyone who did NOT get surgery and had AHT. What I mean is my PSA went from non-detrectable levels from ADT and when off them, to went to 0.4, which is normal post-radiation. After surgery, PSA should stay very low. They measure the T to see if the ADT worked and then to see if the side affects wore off. I have looked at a paper which did a ratio of T to PSA before any treatment (Japaneses paper I think) and I think they could predict future PCa a bit if the T.PSA ratio was skewed a bit. Question, after stopping ADT, your T went up, which is expected. Did your PSA go up. The only way to not have T go up I feel is stay on ADT or get castarated. T has some great affects, and I like them. I do NOT think you should worry at all about endsoigernous T levels that are acting like expected.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by Otago I'd get the PSA test done about March 3rd or 4th... allowing even more time for any inflammation to have calmed down since December and your round of antibiotics. Then I'd not get the PSA results until you return from your nice RV trip. If the results are still high, you can then do a quick biopsy. There is little to be lost in delaying a few weeks and depending on the results of either the psa or the biopsy, you could really ruin your trip. Right now, I'd assume the best and not get any results before you return. Imagine how your RV trip will be if you get a high psa or especially a positive core in a biopsy. After all, regardless of the results of those tests, you won't be taking any immediate action. Why possible ruin a good trip. Get the PSA test just before you leave... even the day before... or the day you return. Don't feel the need to call in quick and get the PSA result before you leave. Don't have it emailed to you or call to get it. Yes, sometimes a \"head in the sand\" approach is the best, especially with a potential very slow growing prostate cancer. That is funny, I love knowing all things ASAP but you differ Otago. It varies from individual to individual. The good thing is you were told by many here it is not that bad and immediate action is not needed. The rest is schedule and personal view. I squeezed my biopsy in so I could have the results in Macchu Piccho. I can't imagine not knowing, lol.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by newporter A couple of comments: 1. Fairwind made an excellent point, in a standard radiation treatment, PSA does not go to undetectable immediately so your .02 PSA is most likely caused by the hormone. However, if hormone is what caused the PSA to be undetectable, then from what I read and from many of the posts here, PSA should stay low for some time and not rising immediately after it stops. Maybe you stopped too soon? 2. Most of the literatures I read about adjuvant hormone in radiation treatment started with hormone prior to radiation and usually continued for 6, 12 to 18 months after radiation. To stop right after radiation seemed unusual? 3. If you did not have adjuvant hormone therapy, PSA usually drops slowly and won't reach nadir for sometime, perhaps 12 to 24 months. So, my recommendation is to seek another opinion or perhaps get back to hormone. Best wishes. In regards to rising, I think my PSA rose quickly as my testosterone did as well. The test rise shows hormone action wore off and that is why my PSA rose. In rewards to how long on hormones is up for debate. The guidelines for treating high risk prostate cancer in Sept 2012 is EXBT, HDBT and maybe 4-6 months of hormone. The docs wanted 6, I said 4 is enough. And the experts say MAYBE. The guidelines were then revised in Jan 2013 to EXBT, HDBT, and MAYBE 2-3 years hormone therapy. Again, MAYBE. There are only 2 publications I could find on hormone effectiveness in tri-modal treatment. They were very small studies (one in Cal and one in Brazil) and the studies had some issues but they did NOT find a benefit to using hormones. I was like, the experts say MAYBE and change the time length to use them and there is some weak data saying they don't help, I stopped. Little pro, lots of con. A big study is being set up in Japan and it appears it will be done properly where they compare the trimodal treatment with short termn hormone usage to tri-modal treatment with long-term hormone care.",

      "Content": "I have read those studies and agree. But those were based on EXBT alone with hormones. That is a bi-modal treatment. So in that case clearly the longer you were on hormones the better. The only issue with those studies is that they were done using lower radiation than what is usually done now so they may not be perfect. A good review of tri-modal treatment is here. http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2407/12/110. I still cannot believe they got it published as it has not generated data, they just say how they will collect it. Tri-modal SUPPOSEDLY is better than bi-modal cause your prostate gets two methods of radiating. PS I am a dr, not a real dr. a pig doctor so cancer is not a concern, we just eat em lol.",

      "Content": "the article above is from 2012, so it is recent. These are the important points. \"In patients at greater risk for EPE, a BT boost combined with additional EBRT can ensure adequate margin of coverage of surrounding tissues even in the case of minimal spread of disease. As there is mounting evidence that dose escalation leads to a decrease in the rate of treatment failure [27-29], this combined BT and supplemental EBRT is now commonly used to provide a very conformal high-dose-boost to the prostate. Indeed, this synergistic effect of the combination strategy of two types of RT can induce a greater biologically effective dose (BED), the values of which are strongly correlated with treatment outcomes in biochemical control of disease [6,30\". AND \"Accordingly, we have designed this TRIP study of trimodality treatment consisting of 125I-BT, EBRT, and either short- or long- term HT for high-risk PCa. To our knowledge, there have been no previous reports of prospective studies documenting the efficacy and safety of trimodality therapy for high-risk PCa patients. \"",

All my doctors said, lots quit early. Thanks Fairwind. My regular dr is an oncologist who treats patients with all types of cancer and treated with many methods. I am scheduled to see the dr that did my ex beam therapy and am thinking he will say, you are fine, no treatment needed, continue testing. If needed, I will get the 3rd drs opinion that did my high dose brachytherapy, he is the smartest I feel and very funny. After removing my brachytherapy needles he applied a bit of pressure to stop the bleeding so he told a story while we waited. In his residency, a night shift nurse recorded a patients vitals. Recorded was respiration, 0, heart rate 0, and temp, 93.5 etc. The patient had expired but she must have not wanted to do the work required so she just recorded the vitals and left him to the next shift. She got fired for that crap. It sounds gruesome, which it is, but the way he told the story made me and the nurse assisting him crack up.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by newporter A couple of comments: 1. Fairwind made an excellent point, in a standard radiation treatment, PSA does not go to undetectable immediately so your .02 PSA is most likely caused by the hormone. However, if hormone is what caused the PSA to be undetectable, then from what I read and from many of the posts here, PSA should stay low for some time and not rising immediately after it stops. Maybe you stopped too soon? 2. Most of the literatures I read about adjuvant hormone in radiation treatment started with hormone prior to radiation and usually continued for 6, 12 to 18 months after radiation. To stop right after radiation seemed unusual? 3. If you did not have adjuvant hormone therapy, PSA usually drops slowly and won't reach nadir for sometime, perhaps 12 to 24 months. So, my recommendation is to seek another opinion or perhaps get back to hormone. Best wishes. In regards to rising, I think my PSA rose quickly as my testosterone did as well. The test rise shows hormone action wore off and that is why my PSA rose. In rewards to how long on hormones is up for debate. The guidelines for treating high risk prostate cancer in Sept 2012 is EXBT, HDBT and maybe 4-6 months of hormone. The docs wanted 6, I said 4 is enough. And the experts say MAYBE. The guidelines were then revised in Jan 2013 to EXBT, HDBT, and MAYBE 2-3 years hormone therapy. Again, MAYBE. There are only 2 publications I could find on hormone effectiveness in tri-modal treatment. They were very small studies (one in Cal and one in Brazil) and the studies had some issues but they did NOT find a benefit to using hormones. I was like, the experts say MAYBE and change the time length to use them and there is some weak data saying they don't help, I stopped. Little pro, lots of con. A big study is being set up in Japan and it appears it will be done properly where they compare the trimodal treatment with short termn hormone usage to tri-modal treatment with long-term hormone care.",

      "Content": "Thanks. Chuck, I agree with error on the safe side most of the time but hormone therapy SUCKS. Big time, lol. I was supposed to be on HT for 6 months but after 4 months I quit. All my doctors said, lots quit early. Thanks Fairwind. My regular dr is an oncologist who treats patients with all types of cancer and treated with many methods. I am scheduled to see the dr that did my ex beam therapy and am thinking he will say, you are fine, no treatment needed, continue testing. If needed, I will get the 3rd drs opinion that did my high dose brachytherapy, he is the smartest I feel and very funny. After removing my brachytherapy needles he applied a bit of pressure to stop the bleeding so he told a story while we waited. In his residency, a night shift nurse recorded a patients vitals. Recorded was respiration, 0, heart rate 0, and temp, 93.5 etc. The patient had expired but she must have not wanted to do the work required so she just recorded the vitals and left him to the next shift. She got fired for that crap. It sounds gruesome, which it is, but the way he told the story made me and the nurse assisting him crack up.",

      "Content": "the article above is from 2012, so it is recent. These are the important points. \"In patients at greater risk for EPE, a BT boost combined with additional EBRT can ensure adequate margin of coverage of surrounding tissues even in the case of minimal spread of disease. As there is mounting evidence that dose escalation leads to a decrease in the rate of treatment failure [27-29], this combined BT and supplemental EBRT is now commonly used to provide a very conformal high-dose-boost to the prostate. Indeed, this synergistic effect of the combination strategy of two types of RT can induce a greater biologically effective dose (BED), the values of which are strongly correlated with treatment outcomes in biochemical control of disease [6,30\". AND \"Accordingly, we have designed this TRIP study of trimodality treatment consisting of 125I-BT, EBRT, and either short- or long- term HT for high-risk PCa. To our knowledge, there have been no previous reports of prospective studies documenting the efficacy and safety of trimodality therapy for high-risk PCa patients. \"",

      "Content": "I have read those studies and agree. But those were based on EXBT alone with hormones. That is a bi-modal treatment. So in that case clearly the longer you were on hormones the better. The only issue with those studies is that they were done using lower radiation than what is usually done now so they may not be perfect. A good review of tri-modal treatment is here. http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2407/12/110. I still cannot believe they got it published as it has not generated data, they just say how they will collect it. Tri-modal SUPPOSEDLY is better than bi-modal cause your prostate gets two methods of radiating. PS I am a dr, not a real dr. a pig doctor so cancer is not a concern, we just eat em lol.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by njs No, it doesn't work that way. The chance of hitting the cancer depends mostly on the percentage of prostate that contains cancer. For example, if the tumor is 10% of the prostate, then a single core has around 10% chance (actually a little more because the core has length vs being a single point) of hitting tumor or about a 90% chance of missing. But a 2nd core has another more-or-less independent 10% chance of hitting the cancer. For cancer involving 10% of the prostate the chances of all 12 cores missing tumor (false negative) would be 0.9 ^12 = 28% or about a 72% chance of finding it. Solid explanation njs.

This was a good thing as it suggested the tumor may have not spread/been aggressive. Of the 6 biopsies on the left, 3 were positive. I asked the urologist, were those positive from adjacent biopsies. He said it does not matter. I call BS on that. If you have 3 of 6 positive samples, and the positive 3 are together is better than if they are spread out.

The exception being it is fine to bypass sex with a gf, wives like it when you abstain from that activity with your gf.",

I have an appointment with Dr Peter Rossi at Emory next Thursday 03-17-16 to discuss it. For those of you that have had HDR Brachy and or have heavily researched it I have a question. I know this is a pretty straight forward question but here goes. Can you still ejaculate after HDR therapy? I know with surgery there is still orgasm's but they are dry. I have heard there is still a possibility that you still can after HDR. Is this true? I know that to some this is a vain reason but that is one thing that has me leaning toward HDR since it and surgery have close to equal cure rates. That may not mean much to some but at 49 without that I feel like I am being put out to pasture. i had HDBT and EXBT, dry as a bone. That seems logical to me as your prostate gets pretty well destroyed.",
