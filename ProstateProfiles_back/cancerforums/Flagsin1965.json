      "Content": "I am a 70 year old who has recently been diagnosed with prostate cancer, Gleason 4+3, T1C. Had consultations yesterday with two radiation oncologists and will consult tomorrow with the surgeon. I've read the Walsh and Marks books thoroughly and consider myself as fully briefed on what may be ahead as I can be. Like so many, I personally know a number of men who've undergone treatment of many kinds. The first radiation oncologist has recommended androgen suppression followed by EBRT. The second oncologist is a brachytherapy therapist who laid it all out there for me without a specific recommendation. Tomorrow I expect the surgeon to recommend surgery. I will reach my decision point next week and would appreciate hearing here about any personal experiences with the course of treatment recommended by the first oncologist, above, as even though I am trying to keep an open mind toward the decision there is no question I would lean to that recommendation at this point.

PSA history: years and years at 3.0 or below until January 2016 when the VA physical showed a 6.8. Immediately had the private provider do another and that came in at 6.5. Immediately asked for referral, got it quickly, and here we are.",

Gleason 4+3, stage T1C. Diagnosed in April, consulted with surgeon, brachy specialist and beam specialist. Chose beam.
