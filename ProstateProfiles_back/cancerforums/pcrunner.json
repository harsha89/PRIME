      "Content": "Haven't posted much, but have read a lot. After reading the books suggested here, and meetings with health professionals, I decided on RALP. My cancer was clinical stage 1, Gleason 6, with just 1 of 12 cores positive. However, my PSA velocity was high (1.1 to 5.9 in one year). I had my procedure on July 2, 2012, so am still in recovery. So far so good! The surgery was successful, with the only issue being my two previous hernias making the lymphectomy difficult for the surgeon. I will go Monday 7/9 for catheter removal and path report. Overall, I'm feeling pretty good, but there are a few things that the docs did not adequately prepare me for. I'll share a few: First night home, second night following surgery, temp may rise following all the trauma - but as long as it is below 101, you should be OK. Mine got close to 101, but not quite - it was still enough to scare me. 2. The pain from the CO2 gas in my chest was quite significant (thought it was shortness of breath) 3. Bladder spasms - I never realized until now how all of our waste system is so closely linked physically and neurologically. With the catheter in, I never expected super, painful, strong urges to urinate...but they are frequent and intense. Especially when I try to pass gas...those muscles seem to kick in the bladder spasms...then hang on for about 30 seconds! I also am one of the lucky ones who feels they need to urinate all the time with the cath in. Again, I'm doing well, but not knowing some of those things are going to happen, and when they happen when you're all alone walking the living room floor at 2 AM, your thoughts tend to jump to the worst possible scenario. At least mine do. I'll plan to post again with my path results.",

      "Content": "Thanks, mtsarpilot! I am getting better, with just an occasional, \"oops, what the heck is that?\". Good news was my DR appt yesterday. The bladder cystogram was OK, so out with the catheter. I only had a pad on yesterday, and it stayed dry, so I'm operating padless today, without any problem starting flow. I drip a little at the end for a few seconds, and as the bladder empties, I have some pain in there, but other than that, the bladder function is great. I can actually hit the back of the urinal now! And today, my system figured out how to pass gas and not spurt. The other good news was the pathology: margins were all clear and the bilateral lymph nodes were clear. The tumor itself was just a Gleason 6, and in one quadrant. My biggest hurdle currently is the bladder pain (or somewhere down where the prostate was), and occasional blood being passed. Blood coming out of things that it shouldn't unnerves me, but I suspect it is normal and soon will go away.",

      "Content": "Three weeks post op (RALP), and I'm doing very well. I have had no problems with incontinence. I wore a pad the day I had the cath removed (day 7), and at night a couple of times, but everything is working as designed, thankfully, so no pads on at all. In total, I've had three small squirts over three weeks, and they were when I had a little trouble learning how to pass gas while holding urine. I got it now! I had a fair amount of discomfort internally along my pelvic floor, rectum and testicle region during the second week. That is resolved now, and the only lingering minimal pain is in the incision area. I've not tried intimacy yet, but there is evidence in the mornings that it may not be an issue. We'll keep our fingers crossed. My doc released me to return to running (albeit slowly) at week 2, so last week I ran 20 miles. That is half of my preop mileage, and I ran it at a slow pace, averaging just over 10 minute miles (at 9 by week's end). This week, I will increase to 25 - 30 miles, averaging 9 (hopefully). Pre op I averaged 40 plus miles per week at an 8 minute pace. I was scheduled to run the USAF marathon again this year in September, but I transferred my bib when this came up. I now plan to run my next full marathon in May in Cincinnati (Flying Pig). I will run some halfs between now and then, Lord willing! I am thankful and blessed, and wish for any of you that are facing this surgery success and a quick recovery too.",

      "Content": "I've been doing great since RALP 6 months ago. Completely continent & good sexual function. My three month, and now 6 month PSA's were<.1. However, on my 6 month follow up, the doc found a fair amout of microscopic blood in the urine. There was none during my 3 month check up. I will have to go back in 3 weeks for another test, and if there is still blood in there, will be scoped & MRI'd. Has anyone had any problem with this? I guess it could be totally unrelated to the procedure I had?? BTW, I do run quite a bit, and have been training for an upcoming marathon. He did not think that was the cause. Thanks!",

      "Content": "You're probably aware that Florida Celebration is a teaching hospital, so if I met with Vi Patel, I personally would want assurance that his hands would be in the DaVinci controls 100% of the time. I know there are a lot of teaching hospitals (Shands included), and the newer surgeons need some supervised machine time, I just selfishly preferred it not be on me. I live in central FL too, and considered going to FL Cel., but my uro also suggested Dr Harvey Taub in Ocala (Munroe Regional Hospital). Dr Taub, at the time had done just under 1000 procedures, so not the 6,000 that Dr Patel has done. When I met with Dr Taub he assured me that he would be the only one on the device, but that another surgeon would be table side for support, closure, etc. I think that is standard practice. I ended up using Dr Taub and had fantastic results. I have also have heard very good reports about Vi Patel, so in NO WAY am I knocking him.",
