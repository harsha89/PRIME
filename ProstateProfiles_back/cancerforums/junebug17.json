      "Content": "Dad got Ct scan results today. I didn't get the report, but my mom read it to me as best as she could. So far the ct scan looks okay. No findings of metastasis to organs. However, he still didn't get the bone scan yet, that will be this Friday. Anyways they found on his ct scan was left Chronic basiliar plural thickening. I believe that because my dad was a boiler maker and was around asbestos. But, his breathing is good. They did find 3 sub-centimeter liver lesions, but I don't think that is worrisome unless I could be wrong. They did find a 5x6 cm by 3x6 cm diverticula off his bladder(pretty big from what I saw). If this means anything to anyone here, please feel free to let me know. I will keep you posted on the bone scan results next monday we will have the results then. Thanks all. PS/ I was at the appt with him today and the doctor kept telling my parents about the drugs to treat bone cancer without even knowing his bone scan yet. I found that really crappy and so did my dad, but my mom wasn't upset about it. He didn't even talk about the radiologists report until I thought of it when I got home. I called them to go get the report and they did. And she read it to me. JB",

      "Content": "I have reading about Gleason scores. If my dad was at 2.3 and three months later its at 5.7 so its not an aggressive cancer. I'm confused because I read someone who has a Gleason score of 300 and that is considered aggressive. So, does this mean that even if it did spread outside the prostate some years ago, that it is still sorta localized in that area? scratching my head. Thanks. June",

      "Content": "Hi all. There is a lot I don't know about prostate cancer so I will try hard to explain what I know from what my mother is telling me. My father was diagnosed with prostate cancer 17 years ago. he had radiation treatment, but after that the cancer spread outside the prostate. The put him on lupron and casdodex. Well apparently, from my dad last psa test which was 2.3 three months ago, it went up to 5.7. The doctor did take him off the casodex a while back because my mom said that it wasn't working? Yesterday in the office the doctor didn't give him his lupron shot and ordered a cat scan of the stomach and pelvis with and without contrast and a bone scan. Its been 3 years since his last bone scan. The doctor did order it STAT. Also, my mom said the doctor talked about treatments of bone cancer just in case the cancer had spread. Was this doctor jumping the gun? I am not the type to worry unless there is something to really worry about. I am just relaying what my mom told me. I hope this made sense. Is there anyone who can explain this to me. Thank you. Junebug.:",
