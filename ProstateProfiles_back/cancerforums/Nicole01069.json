    "Content": "My dad was diagnosed with stage 4 prostate cancer in January 2015. He has been doing different chemotherapy treatments. It seemed to be working and got his PSA level down to a 7. Within the last two months he started a new chemotherapy and it's been horrible. His PSA level is now 3200. He has started to get light headed dizzy and blurred vision. In the past week he has fallen twice. The cancer specialist sent him to get a MRI of the full body. We got word Monday that the cancer has spread to the spinal cord and to the skull. Today the doctor called him in for an appointment and told him there is nothing else they can do and that he has a month or less to live. This is completely shocking to us because by looking at him you'd never think he'd be gone in a month. He still walks alone no oxygen is needed or anything of that sort. I'm so lost. How do I tell him good bye? How do i explain to my children their paw paw is going to pass away soon?",
