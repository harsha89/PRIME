      "Content": "This is my first post and hope one of you may be able to answer my question. Have you experienced a return of incontinence once you went dry? Following surgery, I was on pads for about three months, then shields for about two, and then completely dry for about three months. Unexpectedly, the incontinence returned to about the same degree as post surgery. This has been going on for about six months, and although getting better, still need a pad or shields. I was doing Kegels before surgery, and continued until I went dry. I restarted Kegels when the incontinence returned. Details below: Diagnosed 11/2014. Gleason scores (4+3), (3+4), (3+3), (3+4), (4+3) RALP 3/2015, confirmed Gleason 7 Margins clear Follow-up PSA's <0.1 Still have ED",
