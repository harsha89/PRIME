      "Content": "Thank you for everyone's wishes. It's been an up and down few months. Mid-February, my dad was experiencing significant pain so when meeting with his radio oncologist, she had him transferred to the ER so he could have a CT scan. Turns out the Radium 223 wasn't working for him, and his cancer was progressing. So we immediately discontinued Radium 223 treatment (with only one shot left to go!). He had 5 days of radiation to his spine and sacrum, and was sent home. I stayed with him every night for this process, and he progressively got weaker as his treatments continued. He went from working full time the week before, to bed-ridden in agony, with diarrhea and incontinence the next. We met with his oncologist a week later and she said that she was going to give him the option of seeing if he was well enough in a week to consider entering into a medical study, if not, docetaxel was his other and final option for treatment. She said at this point, it was not curative in any regard, but simply for symptom management. My dad chose to sign up to start chemo, with the view if he turned around quickly he would cancel his chemo and ask to be put on a study. A week later, he was worse than ever- barely able to walk, I had to hand feed him. At this point I had essentially moved in with him, and my husband joined me after he realized that I was splitting my time being with my husband and needing to care for my father. I had a few heated arguments with my sister who felt it was unnecessary I move in with our father (ie. it made her look bad for not putting in any effort, so she didn't want ME to help him either, ughhhhh), but I'm still here, a few months later. Dad has been mostly bed-rideen. He was not well enough to go on a trial. His oncologist gave him less than 6 months, and for awhile I believed that because he was declining so much. He had soooo much bowel incontinence. It was just days and days of poop. I am definitely being paid back for my dad changing my diaper, I tell ya! Happily his bowel issue has resolved the further away from his radiation we have moved, and we only had to worry about constipation with him now being on hydromorphone for pain. That's fixed with restoralax, but we had a few um, incidents which I like to refer to as \"The Crappening\" where he overdosed himself on senna three days in a row, all over his cream carpets. Thankfully both me and my husband are the hardy sort, and did our best to make my dad feel comfortable with us being up to our elbows in his fecal matter. So, as a word of warning to anyone who's worried about becoming constipated: don't overdo it! Slowwwwwwly increase your dose, and for the love of all that is holy, do NOT take more laxatives right after you've had a liquid bowel episode! So chemo began. He fasted day before, day of, and day after his first round of chemo, and had very minimal side effects (some tingling in his feet, a little bit of fatigue). He did have a back-pain flare, which we attributed to not progression but just normal chemo pain flare. He was still bedridden for the most part, and I was hand feeding him or helping him eat. After a week of him being on chemo, I went on a work trip for my writing, and while I was gone he lost the majority of his hair. He was salt-and-pepper before, but all that is left now is the silver/white hair, with all the pepper hair gone. Interesting to me, I guess the silver/white hair cells divide more slowly than the darker hairs? He had quite a thick head of hair before, and now he looks like any gent his age, a fact he is very displeased with but I try to see some positivity in. He went for another round of chemo at the end of my trip, for which he fasted day before, day of, and day after. Again, very few side effects, not even really fatique. Back pain flare was managed with 1 mg hydromorph every hour as he desired. This seems to manage things just well. No more additional hair loss. They have him wearing ice-gloves during his treatment, so his nails are still good and no finger/hand tingling/pain/neuropathy. His PSA flared right before his second treatment, so his oncologist mentioned that she did not think the chemo was working for him, which quite obviously devastated him. I did a bunch of research and showed him that in one study they found 15% of men had a PSA flare after the first treatment, and before the 2nd, which would usually resolve by the 3rd treatment, and that those men even showed a longer median OS than the men who had no PSA flare. This did not comfort him, and I had to respect that although I was privately thinking that's what was happening with him. I am not prone to fits of baseless optimism, but I did think that he was just having a PSA flare, not progression. And I was right (or at least, I am right until we go to the oncologist tomorrow and she tells me Doom and Gloom again). He just got his 3rd blood test back before his chemo on Thursday. And guess what? PSA IS DOWN. It's almost back down to what it was prior to the treatment beginning and the PSA flare. His white blood cell count and neutrophil count is also very good. If his PSA continues to drop, as per studies I've read, his median OS will extend from 16 months to 25 months. That's amazing. So. Here's hoping. Throughout this process he is has been extremely treatment resistant. He didn't want to take his painkillers. He didn't want to take anything, really, because that meant he was \"really actually sick\". He was faking it for the doctors and home-nurses the government sends to check on him weekly and underreporting symptoms which meant I was having to deal with him when he was a sobbing, snotting, pooping mess as soon as they left. I'm working on getting him to be more honest, and I've had to pull aside doctors and nurses and tell them the real story. He's started to have urinary incontinence and failure to fully void his bladder, and they wanted to give him a catheter. I did some research and found external catheters instead (why the hell did no one tell us this was an option?). It's basically a condom with a spigot. I tell ya, it is super fun and exciting to tell your 78 year old dad that you're going to help him put on a condom. Not. Oh well. So, we pair it with a urine bag. They're not crazy expensive. I also have incontinence pads that are like, .25 each and are essentially big puppy pads that he can lay on in bed. They're soft on his skin. Oh, with the condoms/external caths - get good lube. Silicone lube is very good and lasts a lot longer than water-based. It helps to keep the latex from sticking to my dad's tender bits and makes life more comfortable for him. Things had been really going downhill for him and I was pretty sure I'd only have him for a few more months, when his younger brother comes to see him for the first time in a decade a couple of days ago and brings... the chair. A leather reclining chair, which allows my dad to sit up for his meals, but lay back to the perfect angle to take pressure off his tumor-ridden sacrum/tailbone as needed. That chair, I swear to god, has breathed new life into him. He's a different person. He's going for walks on his treadmill! His bladder incontinence is starting to fade. He's pooping regularly without laxatives. He's using about the same or less painkillers. He's eating 3 square meals a day, and polishing them off instead of picking at them. I know this is like, a temporary reprieve? But I just want him to have one more summer. One more summer, where he can relax and enjoy the weather, and maybe go out to see a few friends, or go see his boat one more time. That'd be great. There's a whole bunch of stressors in his life (money-wise, daughter-wise with my sister) that are going off like carpetbombs, that I'm trying to manage. I have my husband to help, and my mother, even though she divorced my dad almost 2 decades ago, has been a stalwart support and is coming to give us respite time, as well as keep my dad company and cook for him. He's a difficult patient, but we're working through it. That's the update. Damn, that is a lot of words. Living with my dad has been the biggest blessing I could ask for, and getting to spend the extra time with him is worth ANYTHING. I hope that anyone else going through this has someone close at home to care for them.",

      "Content": "Thank you all so much for the kind words. I cried a lot over your responses. My father has been pretty rotten to me throughout my life, and I'm just trying to be a good daughter to him despite it. It's so hard to be patient and kind, but if he's only got a few months left, or a year, then I want it to be the best for him it can be. Sorry to post and vanish - life really shook me by the scruff this month! Dad is doing... okay. I keep having to remind him that almost all of his symptoms immediately started after going on the Radium. He's convinced his cancer has progressed, but the odds are in his favour and his docs are not concerned. His bloodwork is very good. His... phosphatase (sp?) is in the low 60's. He's got a lot of fatigue and bone pain, but he's taking Aleeve (it's working better than Tylenol)... I finally have convinced him that taking pain killers regularly will lift his quality of life and he's listening. We spend a lot of time with me making dinner for him, and him watching Fox News (which is, ugh, as a Canadian, it's like watching a bunch of yelping dogs fighting over a dirty animal carcass but whatever makes him happy, I'll put up with it ha ha). We talk about politics, and my job, and just normal stuff. I try to remind him that it's okay to cry, and be sad, because what he's going through is awful. I'm not trying to put false hope in his heart, but I am giving him the facts... like he's outlived almost all of his friends, and he's had an amazing life, and that while this cancer will kill him, he's doing so much better than most gentlemen on radium 223. I dunno if it's helping. I'm just trying not to make him feel bad. I'm feeling pretty positive that he's hit the peak of how awful the radium will make him feel. He's doing better after each shot and isn't bed-bound as long which is really good. He should be at the phase where 76% of men have stable disease which is very good odds. Two more shots left, and then I get to tell him he's likely to have completely stable disease (as I think after all 6 shots 94% of men have stable disease). Then we wait for... you know, the major skeletal event, I guess? Like, that's the next thing, right? Or progression into the soft tissues (please god no). I've been reading a lot of documentation that some \"off label\" type use of Radium is happening where men are going 6-10 months before doing another full course of it. I know that sort of use is not approved here in Canada yet cause there haven't been any studies proving that's effective at all, so I doubt we'll be offered that course of treatment and I'm not sure how well he would handle a second cycle of 6 injections of the Radium since the first round has knocked him on his ass so badly. I am wondering about trying to get him on a study in the USA but the travel would be very prohibitive, and there's supposed to be some more studies coming up through the BC Cancer Agency here soon. It's just a matter of him hanging on until the next \"great thing\". His urologist said there's a lot of new drugs coming down the pipeline. I don't have a lot of hope really? I had to tell his granddaughter and my niece the other day that \"grandpa has the kind of cancer that doesn't get better\" because bless her, my sister thinks it's acceptable to leave her teenaged kid in the dark about something so glaringly obvious, and I'm not going to lie to my niece. Maybe that makes me a bad aunt, but I don't care. I think kids need to know the reality of things, and my sister is super \"head in the sand\" about our father's illness and is pretending it's fine and is therefore not making an effort to be around him or support him while he's sick. I'm starting to have the \"talk\" with my dad about future planning and end of life care, etc. We're going to sit down after Christmas and draw up the legal plans of what he wants done for himself in the event he becomes unable to advocate for himself. I'm going to do a plan for myself as well so he can feel more \"normal\" about it, and it's less \"YOU'RE DYING LET'S MAKE A PLAN\", right? I'm in my mid-thirties, but one of my best friends had breast cancer two years ago and she's my age, so it's not like these things don't apply to me. I think the worst part of this is him feeling weak. He's been a physical man all of his life, working in the trades (which I took after him and was a mechanic for awhile and then a gasfitter), so he's used to being so strong. Now he can barely get himself out of bed. I know it's so so so hard for him to from super-functional to not. I am trying to remind him that a lot of men are using walkers and other mobility aides and that he's not at that point yet so it's a good thing but... yeah. I don't know how to make him feel better. I don't think I can. Ugh. Happy Christmas everyone I hope the new year brings peace and happiness to you all, and that you have loved ones close by during these dark winter days.",

      "Content": "Wow it's been a rollercoaster of a few years. I'm in my mid-thirties, and my father is closing in on his 80's. Prostate cancer has shaped his life for the last... I'd say, 28 years or so. When I was quite young (I'm the replacement child from a second wife so he was older when he had me), he had pre-cancerous stuff going on with his prostate, so there was an immediate lifestyle change. That seemed to hold the beast at bay for awhile, until I hit my mid-twenties, when it came back with a vengeance. From there it's just seemed to progress, even though his gleason score I think was a 6 or 7. He's on palliative care with RT when he needs it for bone mets, since his PC went stage for around 2013, after failing to be stopped by the ADT. He went into a study (open, abi or enz), and started on ENZ which lasted him a good 14 months, and when that failed he went onto ABI which lasted him another year-ish. Now he's out of the study, and onto Radium 223. The worst part is seeing him waste away, and the depression and sadness he is suffering. My parents are divorced, and his \"girlfriend\" ghosted on him in 2016 I think, after she realized he was going to keep getting worse and not better. So he is quite lonely. He is into his 3rd cycle of 223 and it's damn hard. He works full time running his construction company, and I think that's what's kept him alive so long (his urologist says he's an anomaly, and that all the other men diagnosed around the same time have passed), but the 223 makes him exhausted and is causing lots of bone pain/flares. I'm trying to comfort him by reading medical studies and letting him know that bone pain on 223 is rarely a sign of progression, and at month 3 is has a 76% chance of having stable disease, but it doesn't help when you want to just lay in bed all day and not move from the pain and exhaustion. I'm doing my best to be a good daughter, despite the fact he's been a pretty horrible father to me throughout my life... I'm putting that to the side because right now, he is suffering, and it'll do him no good to bring up his failures as a parent and a person, right? But I'm all alone in this.... mostly. My mom helps me a bit (they've been divorced for a good 15 years or so, but she's put aside her bitterness too in order to help me care for him). I have an older half-sister from his first marriage, but she's nigh useless. She doesn't do any research into his illness, has no idea that he's terminal (I figured that out without him even telling me within the first day because I'm good at medical searches and google info), does not seem to care he's terminal (I've been hinting at it with her because he does not like her to know the details as she's... more removed from him than I am)... and I'm just... I'm falling apart? It's so damn hard? Like, this sucks. I moved so that I was only a 5 minute walk from his house so I could visit him (I lived 35+ minutes away by car before), and be there for him every day. Thankfully I work from home and have no kids, and my husband is very supportive of me taking care of my dad, so I'm able to do whatever my father needs doing. I'm just trying to keep it together, and comfort him when he's sad. I go to his doctor appointments with him and advocate for him, taking notes, and asking questions because he seems very paralyzed and unable to. I took on his house mortgage so that he wouldn't have to worry about anything... and my sister is going to be certainly surprised when he passes and she finds out that the house is in my name, and not his, although I'll be respecting his wishes and selling it so that I can give her a portion of the equity in it despite the fact I feel she deserves n-o-t-h-i-n-g. She was going to miss christmas with us this year (all she has to do is show up, I do all the shopping, cooking, cleaning, everything), because she doesn't have her kid with her and her boyfriend won't have his kid with him either so she didn't want to miss \"boyfriend time\" and so I hastily told her \"look, this might be dad's last christmas, please make a freaking effort to come out to see him\", and her response was \"well it'll be a bummer if I can't spend it with my boyfriend because he might not want to come blah blah blah\"... I mean, she's in her 50's, for god's sake, she's not a teenager. I think the worst of it is, that... he was never a good father. Downright awful. He was physically abusive with me in my early years, and has been very verbally abusive to me throughout my teen and young adult years. It's only now that I'm older and able to tell him to not talk to me a certain way that he's stopped... but only because I stand up for myself. He tried to blame me for the ENZ failing because I wouldn't take out a second mortgage out on his house and just give him the cash to invest in a silver mine (like, the first mortgage is over half a million, seriously, and I have no idea how I managed to qualify it all for myself, and I definitely wasn't going to take out a second mortgage!!), and said because I didn't give into him, it caused him stress and made the ENZ fail. When I had a breast cancer scare, the first words out of his mouth were \"what happens to my house if you die since you are married, and your husband will inherit it\"... basically, very self-centered, self-focused man. I used to stand up for myself with him for many years, and now, I don't even do that because I know he's sick and dying and if lashing out at me is the only way for him to feel better, I'll let him do it. So I sit there, and I rub his aches, and make him dinner, and help him sit up, and try not to remember all the terrible things he's done or said over the years. Because it's not about that now, right? And without me, he's got no one. No family, he's sued them all or alienated them. No friends, same thing. He's lost both wives, and one daughter clearly doesn't give a fig. It kind of lands on my shoulders to take care of everything. I know I'm rambling. Sorry. I'm actually an author and usually way more... \"good\" at not being a rambly, scattered idiot, but honestly, I'm tired, and I'm stressed, and I'm sad. He's doing really badly on the 223, and I know that when you have changes, you count how quickly the changes come and that gives you an idea of how long someone has left. So, year to year changes? They've got years. Month to month? They have months. Week to week? Weeks. Day to day? Days. Hour to hour? Hours. It feels like he's at the months stage. I know he's out-lived expectations by about a year, but... I just don't know what's next. He says he's tired, and doesn't want to stop fighting, but he is scared, and I don't feel his doctors have given him enough of a picture so he knows what to ask for or what happens next. I just.. yeah... Thanks for listening.",

      "Content": "Thank you all so much for the kind words. I cried a lot over your responses. My father has been pretty rotten to me throughout my life, and I'm just trying to be a good daughter to him despite it. It's so hard to be patient and kind, but if he's only got a few months left, or a year, then I want it to be the best for him it can be. Sorry to post and vanish - life really shook me by the scruff this month! Dad is doing... okay. I keep having to remind him that almost all of his symptoms immediately started after going on the Radium. He's convinced his cancer has progressed, but the odds are in his favour and his docs are not concerned. His bloodwork is very good. His... phosphatase (sp?) is in the low 60's. He's got a lot of fatigue and bone pain, but he's taking Aleeve (it's working better than Tylenol)... I finally have convinced him that taking pain killers regularly will lift his quality of life and he's listening. We spend a lot of time with me making dinner for him, and him watching Fox News (which is, ugh, as a Canadian, it's like watching a bunch of yelping dogs fighting over a dirty animal carcass but whatever makes him happy, I'll put up with it ha ha). We talk about politics, and my job, and just normal stuff. I try to remind him that it's okay to cry, and be sad, because what he's going through is awful. I'm not trying to put false hope in his heart, but I am giving him the facts... like he's outlived almost all of his friends, and he's had an amazing life, and that while this cancer will kill him, he's doing so much better than most gentlemen on radium 223. I dunno if it's helping. I'm just trying not to make him feel bad. I'm feeling pretty positive that he's hit the peak of how awful the radium will make him feel. He's doing better after each shot and isn't bed-bound as long which is really good. He should be at the phase where 76% of men have stable disease which is very good odds. Two more shots left, and then I get to tell him he's likely to have completely stable disease (as I think after all 6 shots 94% of men have stable disease). Then we wait for... you know, the major skeletal event, I guess? Like, that's the next thing, right? Or progression into the soft tissues (please god no). I've been reading a lot of documentation that some \"off label\" type use of Radium is happening where men are going 6-10 months before doing another full course of it. I know that sort of use is not approved here in Canada yet cause there haven't been any studies proving that's effective at all, so I doubt we'll be offered that course of treatment and I'm not sure how well he would handle a second cycle of 6 injections of the Radium since the first round has knocked him on his ass so badly. I am wondering about trying to get him on a study in the USA but the travel would be very prohibitive, and there's supposed to be some more studies coming up through the BC Cancer Agency here soon. It's just a matter of him hanging on until the next \"great thing\". His urologist said there's a lot of new drugs coming down the pipeline. I don't have a lot of hope really? I had to tell his granddaughter and my niece the other day that \"grandpa has the kind of cancer that doesn't get better\" because bless her, my sister thinks it's acceptable to leave her teenaged kid in the dark about something so glaringly obvious, and I'm not going to lie to my niece. Maybe that makes me a bad aunt, but I don't care. I think kids need to know the reality of things, and my sister is super \"head in the sand\" about our father's illness and is pretending it's fine and is therefore not making an effort to be around him or support him while he's sick. I'm starting to have the \"talk\" with my dad about future planning and end of life care, etc. We're going to sit down after Christmas and draw up the legal plans of what he wants done for himself in the event he becomes unable to advocate for himself. I'm going to do a plan for myself as well so he can feel more \"normal\" about it, and it's less \"YOU'RE DYING LET'S MAKE A PLAN\", right? I'm in my mid-thirties, but one of my best friends had breast cancer two years ago and she's my age, so it's not like these things don't apply to me. I think the worst part of this is him feeling weak. He's been a physical man all of his life, working in the trades (which I took after him and was a mechanic for awhile and then a gasfitter), so he's used to being so strong. Now he can barely get himself out of bed. I know it's so so so hard for him to from super-functional to not. I am trying to remind him that a lot of men are using walkers and other mobility aides and that he's not at that point yet so it's a good thing but... yeah. I don't know how to make him feel better. I don't think I can. Ugh. Happy Christmas everyone I hope the new year brings peace and happiness to you all, and that you have loved ones close by during these dark winter days.",

      "Content": "Wow it's been a rollercoaster of a few years. I'm in my mid-thirties, and my father is closing in on his 80's. Prostate cancer has shaped his life for the last... I'd say, 28 years or so. When I was quite young (I'm the replacement child from a second wife so he was older when he had me), he had pre-cancerous stuff going on with his prostate, so there was an immediate lifestyle change. That seemed to hold the beast at bay for awhile, until I hit my mid-twenties, when it came back with a vengeance. From there it's just seemed to progress, even though his gleason score I think was a 6 or 7. He's on palliative care with RT when he needs it for bone mets, since his PC went stage for around 2013, after failing to be stopped by the ADT. He went into a study (open, abi or enz), and started on ENZ which lasted him a good 14 months, and when that failed he went onto ABI which lasted him another year-ish. Now he's out of the study, and onto Radium 223. The worst part is seeing him waste away, and the depression and sadness he is suffering. My parents are divorced, and his \"girlfriend\" ghosted on him in 2016 I think, after she realized he was going to keep getting worse and not better. So he is quite lonely. He is into his 3rd cycle of 223 and it's damn hard. He works full time running his construction company, and I think that's what's kept him alive so long (his urologist says he's an anomaly, and that all the other men diagnosed around the same time have passed), but the 223 makes him exhausted and is causing lots of bone pain/flares. I'm trying to comfort him by reading medical studies and letting him know that bone pain on 223 is rarely a sign of progression, and at month 3 is has a 76% chance of having stable disease, but it doesn't help when you want to just lay in bed all day and not move from the pain and exhaustion. I'm doing my best to be a good daughter, despite the fact he's been a pretty horrible father to me throughout my life... I'm putting that to the side because right now, he is suffering, and it'll do him no good to bring up his failures as a parent and a person, right? But I'm all alone in this.... mostly. My mom helps me a bit (they've been divorced for a good 15 years or so, but she's put aside her bitterness too in order to help me care for him). I have an older half-sister from his first marriage, but she's nigh useless. She doesn't do any research into his illness, has no idea that he's terminal (I figured that out without him even telling me within the first day because I'm good at medical searches and google info), does not seem to care he's terminal (I've been hinting at it with her because he does not like her to know the details as she's... more removed from him than I am)... and I'm just... I'm falling apart? It's so damn hard? Like, this sucks.

      "Content": "Thank you for everyone's wishes. It's been an up and down few months. Mid-February, my dad was experiencing significant pain so when meeting with his radio oncologist, she had him transferred to the ER so he could have a CT scan. Turns out the Radium 223 wasn't working for him, and his cancer was progressing. So we immediately discontinued Radium 223 treatment (with only one shot left to go!). He had 5 days of radiation to his spine and sacrum, and was sent home. I stayed with him every night for this process, and he progressively got weaker as his treatments continued. He went from working full time the week before, to bed-ridden in agony, with diarrhea and incontinence the next. We met with his oncologist a week later and she said that she was going to give him the option of seeing if he was well enough in a week to consider entering into a medical study, if not, docetaxel was his other and final option for treatment. She said at this point, it was not curative in any regard, but simply for symptom management. My dad chose to sign up to start chemo, with the view if he turned around quickly he would cancel his chemo and ask to be put on a study. A week later, he was worse than ever- barely able to walk, I had to hand feed him. At this point I had essentially moved in with him, and my husband joined me after he realized that I was splitting my time being with my husband and needing to care for my father. I had a few heated arguments with my sister who felt it was unnecessary I move in with our father (ie. it made her look bad for not putting in any effort, so she didn't want ME to help him either, ughhhhh), but I'm still here, a few months later. Dad has been mostly bed-rideen. He was not well enough to go on a trial. His oncologist gave him less than 6 months, and for awhile I believed that because he was declining so much. He had soooo much bowel incontinence. It was just days and days of poop. I am definitely being paid back for my dad changing my diaper, I tell ya! Happily his bowel issue has resolved the further away from his radiation we have moved, and we only had to worry about constipation with him now being on hydromorphone for pain. That's fixed with restoralax, but we had a few um, incidents which I like to refer to as \"The Crappening\" where he overdosed himself on senna three days in a row, all over his cream carpets. Thankfully both me and my husband are the hardy sort, and did our best to make my dad feel comfortable with us being up to our elbows in his fecal matter. So, as a word of warning to anyone who's worried about becoming constipated: don't overdo it! Slowwwwwwly increase your dose, and for the love of all that is holy, do NOT take more laxatives right after you've had a liquid bowel episode! So chemo began. He fasted day before, day of, and day after his first round of chemo, and had very minimal side effects (some tingling in his feet, a little bit of fatigue). He did have a back-pain flare, which we attributed to not progression but just normal chemo pain flare. He was still bedridden for the most part, and I was hand feeding him or helping him eat. After a week of him being on chemo, I went on a work trip for my writing, and while I was gone he lost the majority of his hair. He was salt-and-pepper before, but all that is left now is the silver/white hair, with all the pepper hair gone. Interesting to me, I guess the silver/white hair cells divide more slowly than the darker hairs? He had quite a thick head of hair before, and now he looks like any gent his age, a fact he is very displeased with but I try to see some positivity in. He went for another round of chemo at the end of my trip, for which he fasted day before, day of, and day after. Again, very few side effects, not even really fatique. Back pain flare was managed with 1 mg hydromorph every hour as he desired. This seems to manage things just well. No more additional hair loss. They have him wearing ice-gloves during his treatment, so his nails are still good and no finger/hand tingling/pain/neuropathy. His PSA flared right before his second treatment, so his oncologist mentioned that she did not think the chemo was working for him, which quite obviously devastated him. I did a bunch of research and showed him that in one study they found 15% of men had a PSA flare after the first treatment, and before the 2nd, which would usually resolve by the 3rd treatment, and that those men even showed a longer median OS than the men who had no PSA flare. This did not comfort him, and I had to respect that although I was privately thinking that's what was happening with him. I am not prone to fits of baseless optimism, but I did think that he was just having a PSA flare, not progression. And I was right (or at least, I am right until we go to the oncologist tomorrow and she tells me Doom and Gloom again). He just got his 3rd blood test back before his chemo on Thursday. And guess what? PSA IS DOWN. It's almost back down to what it was prior to the treatment beginning and the PSA flare. His white blood cell count and neutrophil count is also very good. If his PSA continues to drop, as per studies I've read, his median OS will extend from 16 months to 25 months. That's amazing. So. Here's hoping. Throughout this process he is has been extremely treatment resistant. He didn't want to take his painkillers. He didn't want to take anything, really, because that meant he was \"really actually sick\". He was faking it for the doctors and home-nurses the government sends to check on him weekly and underreporting symptoms which meant I was having to deal with him when he was a sobbing, snotting, pooping mess as soon as they left. I'm working on getting him to be more honest, and I've had to pull aside doctors and nurses and tell them the real story. He's started to have urinary incontinence and failure to fully void his bladder, and they wanted to give him a catheter. I did some research and found external catheters instead (why the hell did no one tell us this was an option?). It's basically a condom with a spigot. I tell ya, it is super fun and exciting to tell your 78 year old dad that you're going to help him put on a condom. Not. Oh well. So, we pair it with a urine bag. They're not crazy expensive. I also have incontinence pads that are like, .25 each and are essentially big puppy pads that he can lay on in bed. They're soft on his skin. Oh, with the condoms/external caths - get good lube. Silicone lube is very good and lasts a lot longer than water-based. It helps to keep the latex from sticking to my dad's tender bits and makes life more comfortable for him. Things had been really going downhill for him and I was pretty sure I'd only have him for a few more months, when his younger brother comes to see him for the first time in a decade a couple of days ago and brings... the chair. A leather reclining chair, which allows my dad to sit up for his meals, but lay back to the perfect angle to take pressure off his tumor-ridden sacrum/tailbone as needed. That chair, I swear to god, has breathed new life into him. He's a different person. He's going for walks on his treadmill! His bladder incontinence is starting to fade. He's pooping regularly without laxatives. He's using about the same or less painkillers. He's eating 3 square meals a day, and polishing them off instead of picking at them. I know this is like, a temporary reprieve? But I just want him to have one more summer. One more summer, where he can relax and enjoy the weather, and maybe go out to see a few friends, or go see his boat one more time. That'd be great. There's a whole bunch of stressors in his life (money-wise, daughter-wise with my sister) that are going off like carpetbombs, that I'm trying to manage. I have my husband to help, and my mother, even though she divorced my dad almost 2 decades ago, has been a stalwart support and is coming to give us respite time, as well as keep my dad company and cook for him. He's a difficult patient, but we're working through it. That's the update. Damn, that is a lot of words. Living with my dad has been the biggest blessing I could ask for, and getting to spend the extra time with him is worth ANYTHING. I hope that anyone else going through this has someone close at home to care for them.",

      "Content": "Thank you all so much for the kind words. I cried a lot over your responses. My father has been pretty rotten to me throughout my life, and I'm just trying to be a good daughter to him despite it. It's so hard to be patient and kind, but if he's only got a few months left, or a year, then I want it to be the best for him it can be. Sorry to post and vanish - life really shook me by the scruff this month! Dad is doing... okay. I keep having to remind him that almost all of his symptoms immediately started after going on the Radium. He's convinced his cancer has progressed, but the odds are in his favour and his docs are not concerned. His bloodwork is very good. His... phosphatase (sp?) is in the low 60's. He's got a lot of fatigue and bone pain, but he's taking Aleeve (it's working better than Tylenol)... I finally have convinced him that taking pain killers regularly will lift his quality of life and he's listening. We spend a lot of time with me making dinner for him, and him watching Fox News (which is, ugh, as a Canadian, it's like watching a bunch of yelping dogs fighting over a dirty animal carcass but whatever makes him happy, I'll put up with it ha ha). We talk about politics, and my job, and just normal stuff. I try to remind him that it's okay to cry, and be sad, because what he's going through is awful. I'm not trying to put false hope in his heart, but I am giving him the facts... like he's outlived almost all of his friends, and he's had an amazing life, and that while this cancer will kill him, he's doing so much better than most gentlemen on radium 223. I dunno if it's helping. I'm just trying not to make him feel bad. I'm feeling pretty positive that he's hit the peak of how awful the radium will make him feel. He's doing better after each shot and isn't bed-bound as long which is really good. He should be at the phase where 76% of men have stable disease which is very good odds. Two more shots left, and then I get to tell him he's likely to have completely stable disease (as I think after all 6 shots 94% of men have stable disease). Then we wait for... you know, the major skeletal event, I guess? Like, that's the next thing, right? Or progression into the soft tissues (please god no). I've been reading a lot of documentation that some \"off label\" type use of Radium is happening where men are going 6-10 months before doing another full course of it. I know that sort of use is not approved here in Canada yet cause there haven't been any studies proving that's effective at all, so I doubt we'll be offered that course of treatment and I'm not sure how well he would handle a second cycle of 6 injections of the Radium since the first round has knocked him on his ass so badly. I am wondering about trying to get him on a study in the USA but the travel would be very prohibitive, and there's supposed to be some more studies coming up through the BC Cancer Agency here soon. It's just a matter of him hanging on until the next \"great thing\". His urologist said there's a lot of new drugs coming down the pipeline. I don't have a lot of hope really? I had to tell his granddaughter and my niece the other day that \"grandpa has the kind of cancer that doesn't get better\" because bless her, my sister thinks it's acceptable to leave her teenaged kid in the dark about something so glaringly obvious, and I'm not going to lie to my niece. Maybe that makes me a bad aunt, but I don't care. I think kids need to know the reality of things, and my sister is super \"head in the sand\" about our father's illness and is pretending it's fine and is therefore not making an effort to be around him or support him while he's sick. I'm starting to have the \"talk\" with my dad about future planning and end of life care, etc. We're going to sit down after Christmas and draw up the legal plans of what he wants done for himself in the event he becomes unable to advocate for himself. I'm going to do a plan for myself as well so he can feel more \"normal\" about it, and it's less \"YOU'RE DYING LET'S MAKE A PLAN\", right? I'm in my mid-thirties, but one of my best friends had breast cancer two years ago and she's my age, so it's not like these things don't apply to me. I think the worst part of this is him feeling weak. He's been a physical man all of his life, working in the trades (which I took after him and was a mechanic for awhile and then a gasfitter), so he's used to being so strong. Now he can barely get himself out of bed. I know it's so so so hard for him to from super-functional to not. I am trying to remind him that a lot of men are using walkers and other mobility aides and that he's not at that point yet so it's a good thing but... yeah. I don't know how to make him feel better. I don't think I can. Ugh. Happy Christmas everyone I hope the new year brings peace and happiness to you all, and that you have loved ones close by during these dark winter days.",
