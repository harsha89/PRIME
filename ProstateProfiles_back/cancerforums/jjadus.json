      "Content": "Hi and thanks for my addition to the forum. I've been diagnosed with urethral carcinoma in situ in my bladder. Several cystos and CT and IVP scans have revealed no tumors. But I did have elevated PSA levels, a 5. So my urologists wants to do a ultrasound guided prostate biopsy. It's going to happen in about three weeks. I just was asking if any forum members have had this procedure and if so what should I expect as far as pain, discomfort and recovery times. Thanks and if this topic is more appropriate at a different forum could you please direct me there. Thanks again. Joe",

He injected some novicane in the prostate which helped. The PA injected some antibiotic in my butt cheek which created a sore spot in that muscle but it clearer up that evening. I experienced no blood in the urine or stool, not sure about the ejaculate yet. Dr took about 12 samples, he said the prostate looked enlarged but other than that he said things looked good. I had some minor cramps yesterday evening but they are gone today. A follow-up appointment with Dr and the results are next week. I was a bit apprehensive before the procedure but feel so much better today.",

I'm still getting urgency to urinate frequently sometimes every hour and like four times during the night. I bit uncomfortable when I urinate.

      "Content": "Hi Chuck, Thanks for your feed back. I'm 70 years old. Been in great health until about 2 years ago. Back then I started experiencing discomfort during urination and frequent trips to the bathroom. This happened sporadically. This kept occurring frequently. I went to my GP and tested my urine which checked out to be normal. Urine was clear with minor evidence of blood but no indication of anything remarkable. Did several rounds of antibiotics which did nothing. Took saw palmetto, pumpkin seed oil, probiotic and other supplements, nothing relived the symptoms. Finally referred to a urologist. He tried the antibiotic routine plus Oxybutinin and Flomax generic. No relief. The urologist diagnosed me with prostatitis. I went to a second urologist. He basically did the same things. What he did do was insert a scope into my bladder to look for tumors. He found none, but he sent the fluid in my bladder to check for carcinoma. The biopsy was positive but he had to determine where the carcinoma cells were coming from, kidneys, bladder or prostate. He did a cystoscopy. The carcinoma was isolated in the bladder. He referred me to a specialist in Stanford Hospital. Stanford recommended a series of 6 BCG treatments followed up with a second cystoscopy. First set of BCG treatments were not successful so a second set of 3 BCG treatments. Not sure if the second set of BCG treatments were successful, waiting on the results. Urologist found elevated levels in PSA test. So this is where I am now. Ultrasound guided prostate biopsy scheduled in two weeks. I guess I go from there after getting the results of the ultrasound guided prostate biopsy.",

I have been diagnosed with carcinoma in situ in my bladder and a digital rectal exam revealed a bump on my prostate about a month ago. Did a series of 6 BCG treatments and a follow-up of 3 BCG treatments 2 months ago. Also had a TURP and cytology 3 months ago.
