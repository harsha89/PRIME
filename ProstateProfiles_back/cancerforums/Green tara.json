      "Content": "Hi all, I meant to come back sooner, but it has taken some time to get the info. Even now, I don't have it all. My Dad is approaching this whole thing in a way that is utterly confounding, if not somewhat inspiring and admirable. Like a spring lamb in a meadow, just in the now. I am sure there is so much more going on inside, he is the cleverest man I know, but it's almost impossible to get proper information from him. Lucky my mum is on the side giving me some straight info. So here it is. He has bone mets in pelvis, spine, sternum, ribs and upper arms. In the lymph nodes. He has apparently nil pain and nil symptoms other than the leg swelling. He had a hormone injection last week and had some sort of implant in today. He also mentioned taking pills for 28 days. He said they don't give Gleason Score unless you are looking at surgery. I am sure that's not right, but wasn't going to argue. He then said something about 'off the scale'...deep breaths... So he is off os on Sunday for 8 weeks. I guess if he feels good, he should go. I am guessing it may be the last trip. dunno? HE isn't interested in reading up or prepping. He said why look up side effects unless he experiences them...ohhkay I guess. Fair enough. I am finding it hard to know how or what or whatever to do with all this. I read up about the spinal mets and that sounds fairly shite. Worried and want him to ask the oncologist about the possibility of spinal compression. Anyhoo, anyone know about experimental treatments or what to do when it's like this...just have the time of your life while you feel good?",

      "Content": "Thank you for this heartening anecdote. I clarified with mum that the ct scan clearly showed bone Mets and that all the lymph nodes up the renal artery (?) and that the biopsy was to rule out that cancer was based elsewhere in the body. Tuesday will bring the full diagnosis. Sounds like he is set on hormone therapy, do the bone mets and lymph node involvement change prognosis dramatically? Thanks.",

      "Content": "Hi all, appreciate your experience and wisdom. My dad called last night to say he has been diagnosed with prostate cancer. He was downplaying it but my mum told me he has a psa of over 400 and the initial cat scan (his leg was swollen so they suspected a blood clot initially rather than pc) showed lymph node swellings all through his system to kidneys. I think he also had a bone scan that showed it is also in bone. Today he is having a biopsy. I was initially thinking that it must have been in the groin to check the lymph nodes there, but mum said it was to check nodes near his kidneys. We won't get the full picture till next week (the wait is going to be tough) but I am typing to prep myself. From the information I have it sounds like it's definitely metastasised and sounds pretty dire? Any knowledge based on what I have outlined? He said they were discussing hormone therapy, that sounds like a palliative option? Thanks very much in advance",

      "Content": "Thanks so much for the replies. I am very comforted to read them. I'll try and share what I can. He is such a private chap I am worried he is going to be mad if he sees this. Dad if you read this, I am just trying to get educated! I wish I had clearer info, but I am known as a bit of a know-it-all and nobody is appreciating my 20 questions at this time. So it's lots of deep breathing and trying to stay present till I get more info. It's heartening to hear that people can still have many good Years with a diagnosis. My dad is almost 68 and has been in rude good health his whole life. Never wanted to get checked out for pc, declined to. I hope to find out his Gleason score soon, and to get info and advice from you experts. Blessings",
