I went thru RP surgery end of Jan 01/25 and had my first PSA test on Fri 3/08. The very first PSA reading came at 1.6 and of course I was looking for <= 0.01. Any thoughts, advise. I am really really concerned!!",

      "Content": "Thanks. Yes, the steps recommendation from the uro is to consult with RO and schedule the next PSA test for Jun. He also said that any radiation treatment won't start till the area heals up which could be Jun/ Jul. The next 3 months are going to be tough waiting for the next set of numbers. I guess this is what they call \"Persistent PSA\". And yes, I will fix the signatures!!!",

      "Content": "Hello everyone, Here is my update. I met with the RO and Oncologist on Thursday (Mar 21st). Their recommendation was to start with the Axumin Pet Scan. I am working with the insurance company, doctors' staff, and the local hospital (it is not available everywhere) to schedule it. That should help detect the problem areas and therefore help with the radiation targetting. The doctors want to start the radiation therapy once I am all healed which could be 4-6 months from the surgery - which means Jun July time frame. Once they nail that time, they will start the ADT couple of months before that. (I think I am more scared of ADT than radiation. The side effects sound awful). I think the Oncologist mentioned Lupron for ADT (not 100% sure. Too many discussions!!). One surprising item was the number of radiation treatments. When we discussed with the Urologist, he had mentioned 6-8 potential radiation treaments. The RO recommended 38 t0 40 treatments! It looks like from here to end of summer I am going to be doing some kind of treament. And then unsure about the ADT. It could anywhere between 6-8 months to 2 years. Thoughts?",
