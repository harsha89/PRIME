      "Content": "Hi, my name is Warren and I just turned 66. Last year 2011 I decided to have a urologist check me out....frequent nightly trips to the bathroom were of some concern. The first visit an ultrasound showed an enlarged prostrate putting extra pressure onto the bladder..... My family has no known history of PC. Of course testing wasn't even available for my deceased relatives. Who knows? Realizing the prospect of having PC is something I need to discuss with other survivors. The more information and research that I do regarding my exams and lab reports is not encouraging....take a look. Here are the hard numbers for the exams and lab results. and the winner is: 8 -2011 psa 4.2 DRE-OK ??mm (sample meds?? given for helping night urination frequency did not work) 6 -2012 psa 4.8 DRE-OK 48mm 10 -2012 psa 8.6 DRE-OK 52mm free psa 11% 10 -2012 massaged prostate and then urine sample-NEGATIVE 11-28-2012 DRE-OK TRB? BIOPSY prostrate 12 samples. (I am anxiously awaiting these biopsy reports) (3-4 days no more bllood in urire) Because of the very rapid increase of the psa as well as the enlargement of the prostrate itself, I can only HOPE this is not PC. The more research and statistics I obtain, the more discouraged I get. If I were to make a wager, I give myself a 20% chance of this being just BHP. Not Good! Doc says 30% for PC. Any wagers DaVinci? Just trying to be objective............. no fear! I may be at the train station, but do not want to get on this train. Appreciate your feedback! Thx Warren",

      "Content": "HI Eskafy First of all I wish you the best.....There is so much information and quality services out there, you will certainly have great personal support here at the Forum. Everyone has their individual stories and your post caught my particular attention. As I was getting ready to search and ask the forum guys about my own prognosis, I could not help but notice the similarities. I too was 1/12 3+4! But I went from years of 4.0 to an increase to 8.0 in a few months! Except that I am now 67 and did choose to do the radiation (because I would probably die of other causes before PC), Da Vinci and RPC would most likely have my other option other than radiation. The hard part is the waiting and not knowing after treatment if or when the cancer will reappear. At least the odds are favorable! Recovery does take time and my Mom always reminded me to be patient-----it takes 9 MONTHS to have a baby! Keeping a positive attitude is the biggest factor for a successful recovery. Again Best Wishes! Warren",
