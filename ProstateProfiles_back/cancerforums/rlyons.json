Thank you very much and best of luck to you. His PSA is 45 and only has two more chemo treatments left. All cases are a bit different but in my case the intermittent will be 6 months on and then of my PSA has dropped back to undetectable then I will stop the injections until my PSA starts to climb (if it does) then I will start the injections again until a time when the PSA climbs again. The studies and my doc have said that way the body will not adjust to the lupron as quickly allowing it to work longer as well as lessor side effects than to have the injections for a long period of time.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by white08gt got my Eligard shot in the stomach the 12th of June and have every side effect mentioned. some are worse than others. is this the same as Lupron, just another maker? this is not helping with manhood returning. When you got the shot did you have extreme pain in your stomach, chest and shoulder area for an hour or so? I had always had the Lupron shot in my thigh before but the VA hospital didn't use it so the doctor put me on the Eligard. I had extreme pain that started about 10 minutes after the shot so bad I could hardly walk to the car. It started to go away after about an hour or so. I had stopped the injections because my doctor had decided to put me on intermittent treatments to see how the cancer responded. However we found out quickly that I am not a candidate for intermittent treatments. My PSA was climbing fast and the cancer had started to spread in my hip and neck. He said my cancer was very aggressive. I have all the side effects that are know and then some I think. Two years ago I worked hard every day, had a great sex life and energy to spare. Now it is like I have aged 20 years, I spend almost all of my days sitting in the recliner watching TV and sleeping, have zero sex drive or ability and I don't remember what it feels like to have energy. Seems I have the choice of an earlier death or living the life of the walking dead. I just hope and pray every day that they come out with a new medicine that has less side effects.",

      "Content": "I was diagnosed with PC in 2011 with a 4+3 and a 3+4 biopsy result. After talking to my doctor at the military hospital and the civilian Oncologist I opted for the external beam radiation treatments and received them in Dec of 2011. I was then put on Lupron injections for the hormone treatments, this continued until Dec of 2012. I was experiencing pretty severe side effects so my doctor stopped the treatments. My PSA was at 24 prior to the radiation treatments and dropped to .10 within 1 year. I had a PSA check in March 2013 and it was at .13, when the test was repeated in 08 Oct it had risen to 5.34. Upon returning to Florida and my original Uroligist had left the military and my new Uroligist repeated the test to rule out machine error and in 3 weeks it had risen to 7.39. He ordered a new bone scan and CT scan and biopsy but immediately started talking about performing surgery to remove the prostate. I have completed the bone scan and doing the CT scan tomorrow with a biopsy on the 22nd. My research so far has pretty well convinced me that I do not want the surgery due to the possible complications and quality of life issues afterward. My original Uroligist told me that surgery after the external beam radiation would be pretty well impossible to do and not advised. I am only 59 and still live a very active life with a lot of travel, motorcycle riding and we RV full time. I am not ready to be tied down at home with problems from the surgery like an old man. I know a lot depends on the outcome of the tests as far as what can be done but I am not sure who to believe or what I want to allow them to do. I am leaning towards intermittent hormonei therapy to maybe lessen the side effects. The doctor just seems to ready to cut on me and that does not put me at ease. I am hoping someone here has been in my situation and can give me their opinion?",

      "Content": "I was diagnosed with PC in 2011 with a 4+3 and a 3+4 biopsy result. After talking to my doctor at the military hospital and the civilian Oncologist I opted for the external beam radiation treatments and received them in Dec of 2011. I was then put on Lupron injections for the hormone treatments, this continued until Dec of 2012. I was experiencing pretty severe side effects so my doctor stopped the treatments. My PSA was at 24 prior to the radiation treatments and dropped to .10 within 1 year. I had a PSA check in March 2013 and it was at .13, when the test was repeated in 08 Oct it had risen to 5.34. Upon returning to Florida and my original Uroligist had left the military and my new Uroligist repeated the test to rule out machine error and in 3 weeks it had risen to 7.39. He ordered a new bone scan and CT scan and biopsy but immediately started talking about performing surgery to remove the prostate. I have completed the bone scan and doing the CT scan tomorrow with a biopsy on the 22nd. My research so far has pretty well convinced me that I do not want the surgery due to the possible complications and quality of life issues afterward. My original Uroligist told me that surgery after the external beam radiation would be pretty well impossible to do and not advised. I am only 59 and still live a very active life with a lot of travel, motorcycle riding and we RV full time. I am not ready to be tied down at home with problems from the surgery like an old man. I know a lot depends on the outcome of the tests as far as what can be done but I am not sure who to believe or what I want to allow them to do. I am leaning towards intermittent hormonei therapy to maybe lessen the side effects. The doctor just seems to ready to cut on me and that does not put me at ease. I am hoping someone here has been in my situation and can give me their opinion?",

      "Content": "My wife gets on to me all the time and asks, how can you joke about dying, all I can tell her is, if I don't joke and laugh about it I will cry instead and I would much more want to laugh. I know the reality that I will never grow old more than likely, but there is always the chance a cure will come along, however I can't just roll over and die now. I am going to travel, visit family and friends and live my life while I can. After all there are advantages to dying young, we don't worry about extended warrantees or saving for the future or how long an item will last, no need for new cars or new clothes, the things we have will outlast us. I am sure none of us want to die, and I know I don't, but I will not allow myself to sit around and worry about it either. If your husband is cancer free and remains that way I am very happy for him and you and no one here will fault you for being happy too. Now you may get chewed out for feeling sorry that he is ok and we are not. Besides he has to look forward to the curse of old age, and there is no cure for that! (:",
