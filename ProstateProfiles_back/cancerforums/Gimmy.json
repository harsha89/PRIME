      "Content": "Hi all. My surgeon was doctor Holden at cedars in Los Angeles .Considered world wide as the best surgeon in this field.he was so busy he never sat during my appointments. Later I learned his nickname is skippy given to him by his colleagues because he skips so fast between clients. He gave me a prescription and before I filled my son looked in up I the web and found it was contraindicated with a med I was already taken. Holden flipped out and yelled \" you're not a doctor, I'm the expert do what I say. I left and thought to myself, to be an expert you need to know the causes and cures for the cancer , there are no experts in the field of prostate cancer. Furthermore as a surgeon, he along with all other surgeons have no business practicing oncology, which is a completely different specialty.I found dr. Hoffman in Beverly hills, my first appointment lasted 1hour and we sat the entire time there were no interruptions . All subsequent visit lasted 1/2 hour. We go on the computer to look up the latest on prostate cancer and he takes all the time I need to understand what's going on.i've never been late for an appointment and neither has he! He doesn't overbook .and after a fee visits he gave me his private number, the same one his wife uses! I never have to worry about test results because his nurse practitioner e mails them, or if it's important he calls me at home. Sometimes out of desperation we put up with a lot of crap from our doctors that we wouldn't take from anyone else ( except our kids ).the quality of life improved considerably when I changed doctors. Doctor Hoffman refer me to a real pain management doctor and it's been great.ihope this is helpful. god Bless....Gimmy T",

Ask you.doctor what the odds are the radiation will be completely successful . my life is nearly a complete wreck. The fibro is way worse pain than the cancer.

      "Content": "Hi Mickee, There is a chemical you can inject into your penis and you will get rigid. I've done it many times once you get over sticking your penis with a needle it's a piece of cake. Your doctor should have provided that option to you. I'm chemically castrated because the cancer came back after 5years it's called recurrence . It's impossible to create in you head a sexual thought, nothing is a turn on. It is a cruel and horrible way to exist. It's used on convicted sex offenders. Being Italian sex was always big on things to do. I weighed in at 136 lbs, now I'm at 206 down from 217. my breasts are huge ,we literally turn into women. Recurrence happens in a very small percent of us so your probably going to be just fine. Between the recurrence and the castration I had 1 to 2 hookers a day, home just couldn't do the job. You need someone who doesn't know the score and someone who will focus on your pleasure. It will restore your confidence and you'll be the man you were before . It sounds like you and your old lady are not only not on the same page but your not even reading the same book. Can you imagine how she'd treat you if you really got sick!!!! For $10 a hour you can have the cleanest house in town, there are plenty of good restaurants and for a few bucks you can have your pipes cleaned by a different pro every day..I sure miss those days. Maybe just maybe a lifestyle change would lower your stress level and raise your self confidence through the roof. I've been through the whole prostate cancer nightmare so if you ever want to talk just text me. Good luck. ...Gimmy",

Don't panic,never give up and #3 don't forget the first 2. We have all walked in your shoes. Millions of men who have had their prostates removed live long and happy lives and enjoy sex. A very small percent of us will ever have a recurrence ,and that is usually 5 years after the operation. The environment your living in may significantly impact your ability to perform sexually. There are trained perfessionals who can be used to help invigorate you sex life. As highlander said use it or loose it. Go on line and manipulate yourself every day watching porno.You have to start talking to your penis just like you did when the catheter was removed. It works. You are fine give yourself a break and give it time. You have nothing to be humiliated for , you had a medical procedure just like a heart attack you need patient loving care. Are you getting that at home? Have you checked to see if there are support groups in your town? Please continue to come on line everyone here really cares and prays for you!!! Remember 1,2,3 ...Gimmy ...........By the way I'm 64 prostate removed 2003, recurrence 2008, chemo,radiation 2008,castrated, radiation 2011 matastisized ,currently going through round of radiation and experimently drugs.
