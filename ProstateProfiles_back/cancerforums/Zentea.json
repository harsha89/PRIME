    "Content": "Almost 4 years ago i had a radical prostatectomy. My gleason score had been6 or 7. the psa was 13.5 at its highest. Three months after surgery my first psa was.2. Long story short, it stayed that way for 3.5 years. This spring it went to .4. I had radiation and the first psa came back at .2. Seems im back where i started. After talking to my surgen and my oncologist i'm confused about what they said exactly and what this means. No one told me what to expect after the radiation. I assumed it would go to zero, more than likely, because my cancer had been contained and was in less than1% of the prostate. How Could it still even be there. Well, asked and ansewed with all the possibilities. On line i got some info, but nothing with numbers this low to start radiation. Not sure where i stand or whats next except more psas's and wait and see.",
