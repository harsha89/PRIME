      "Content": "My husband was diagnosed with prostate cancer in July. We were sent home \"to let the news soak in\" and are scheduled to go back for the \"cancer talk\" with the surgeon/urologist this Wednesday and then an oncologist on Thursday. I have searched through the internet trying to educate myself the best I can. I am requesting a copy of my husband's cat scan from the Dr because we never received a copy and the Dr had told me that it had showed a \"misshapen bladder with a cyst/tumor in it\". When I asked the size of the cyst/tumor he held up his hand and showed me a \"grape\" size. I think my question is how do they not know that this is prostate cancer that has spread to the bladder? The Dr said that he was hesitant to do a biopsy on it while he was doing a biopsy on the prostate because he wasn't sure what he was dealing with. And if any of you can give me more insight by the information I have provided on my husband (biopsy results) I would really appreciate it!! Dr did say that he thought my husband's cancer was confined to the prostate. I have also read the importance of getting a second opinion on the biopsy and I am going to ask the Dr to send it off for me!! Thanks for everyone's input and time to answer my questions.",

      "Content": "I am a little bit more confused now that we have left the doc. He did the \"cancer talk \" with us and answered many questions. He does about 25-35 of the Da Vinci Robotic surgeries per year so he seems quite experienced at it. A question for ASA - my husband also has a left upper pole cortical simple cyst measuring 3.6 x 3.6 x 2.8 in his kidney. Dr. did not mention to this but I had requested a copy of the cat scan and it is the number one diagnosis on it. Is that what you have also? Is that big? And to clarify the cyst/tumor in bladder what he has is prostatic utricle projecting into the urinary bladder 1.7 x 1.4cm. The Dr says that IF we decide on surgery this would be removed and sent to pathology along with the prostate. Can anyone give me any insight into a cortical cyst in kidney and a prostatic utricle projecting into urinary bladder? Anything we need to worry about? Thanks!!",

      "Content": "My husband was diagnosed with prostate cancer in July. We were sent home \"to let the news soak in\" and are scheduled to go back for the \"cancer talk\" with the surgeon/urologist this Wednesday and then an oncologist on Thursday. I have searched through the internet trying to educate myself the best I can. I am requesting a copy of my husband's cat scan from the Dr because we never received a copy and the Dr had told me that it had showed a \"misshapen bladder with a cyst/tumor in it\". When I asked the size of the cyst/tumor he held up his hand and showed me a \"grape\" size. I think my question is how do they not know that this is prostate cancer that has spread to the bladder? The Dr said that he was hesitant to do a biopsy on it while he was doing a biopsy on the prostate because he wasn't sure what he was dealing with. And if any of you can give me more insight by the information I have provided on my husband (biopsy results) I would really appreciate it!! Dr did say that he thought my husband's cancer was confined to the prostate. I have also read the importance of getting a second opinion on the biopsy and I am going to ask the Dr to send it off for me!! Thanks for everyone's input and time to answer my questions.",

      "Content": "Hello everyone. My husband's PSA came back at 0.009 3 months post op and then 0.034 6 months post op from Da Vinci Robotic Prostatectomy so the doc has referred us to Radiologist oncologist. He wants him to do 39 treatments. My question is his Decipher Prostate RP came back at 0.69 which puts him in the high risk category. He was upgraded to Stage 3 after his surgery. However on the Decipher Grid Prostate where it list the post op radiation response signature he is at 2%. The oncologist said he doesn't \"put a lot of faith in that\". But I question if he doesn't put faith in it why was the test ran in the first place and should I have \"faith in it\"? His ADT response came back at 31%. The Grid, for me, is a little hard to decipher. Just wanted someone's input on this. Is it a good idea to go ahead with the radiation even though the GRID says 2%? Thanks for anyone's input!! Mags",

      "Content": "Thank you Djin Tonic for the reply! It is very informative for me. The doc DID NOT suggest another PSA test in 30 days. I plan on calling the uro/surgeon and the oncologist tomorrow so I love the questions that you have brought to my attention! Such as him just barely being over the mark to being considered high risk and the suggestion for repeat PSA! The doc did bring up ADT but if I remember correctly he said that he wanted to save ADT as a backup to radiation in case the radiation does not work. The uro/surgeon also did not think that ADT was a good idea at this point. Unfortunately when we were talking with the radiation oncologist I was only able to retain part of the conversation because \"our world was being rocked\". What I specifically remember both docs telling us was that radiation alone was the best course of action because of the fact that my husband had EPE, was high risk, had rising PSA and was stage 3. I will now be calling Genome DX tomorrow also. I never thought about calling them directly and talking with them. I appreciate your reply so much!! Thank you!!",
