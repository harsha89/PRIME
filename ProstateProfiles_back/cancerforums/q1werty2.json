My doctor was running routine blood-work on Friday and called me Tuesday to tell me the news. She may have run the test in the past and everything was fine; I really don't know. I will call the office and ask tomorrow. - My biopsy is scheduled for May 5th at 9:45. I am trying to stay calm and focused, but it is a little difficult. I rarely even get a cold, never take any regular medications, and generally feel great all the time. So, this is a little different for me to say the least. I'll monitor the forum and also update you guys when I get my results back. thanks again for the advice and well wishes. Scott W",

      "Content": "Thanks to all who have replied. To answer the questions from Chuck, Wifetowoory, and fairwind: - This is my very first PSA that I know of. My doctor was running routine blood-work on Friday and called me Tuesday to tell me the news. She may have run the test in the past and everything was fine; I really don't know. I will call the office and ask tomorrow. - My biopsy is scheduled for May 5th at 9:45. I am trying to stay calm and focused, but it is a little difficult. I rarely even get a cold, never take any regular medications, and generally feel great all the time. So, this is a little different for me to say the least. I'll monitor the forum and also update you guys when I get my results back. thanks again for the advice and well wishes. Scott W",

      "Content": "Yesterday morning I found that my PSA is 22.39. I went to the urologist and he performed a DRE. He indicated the prostate is enlarged and firm, so he scheduled me for a biopsy. My question - Is there anyone out there who has experience with a PSA this high? When browsing the blogs and forums I continuously read about PSA levels of 4 as being high. The information in those post are generally helpful, but I am hoping to make contact with someone a little closer to my situation (over 20 PSA). I am trying to figure out what to expect. BIO - I am 52, extremely healthy, active, and don't even need meds for typical issues such as BP and cholesterol. Any experience-based feedback would greatly be appreciated. Scott W.",
