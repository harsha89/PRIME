      "Content": "I just found out that my 70 year old dad has prostate cancer. The good news is that it has not spread far if at all (according to the bone scan which was clear although I understand it cannot detect anything less than 1cm?). He has a Gleason of 9(4+5), PSA 13.12, 1 positive core and 12 negative cores from biopsy, staged T1c. He has started hormone therapy (a shot plus pills). We are trying to decide between radiation and surgery and I'm having a hard time understanding why we wouldn't do surgery and then add radiation and hormone therapy. The doctors here seem to lean towards radiation although they wouldn't come out and say that. They just told my parents to think about their options and choose one. My parents are going to Cleveland clinic in early November for a second opinion and hopefully the doctor will give him a straight answer about what treatment path to take. I know things could be much worse, but his Gleason score of 9 is very scary for us all. I also don't understand if he is technically \"high risk\" just because of his Gleason score alone since his PSA is less than 20? Some of the things I am reading say that to be high risk you must have a Gleason score of 8-10 PLUS a PSA of greater than 20. What I am really looking for is anyone with a similar experience to my dad and what treatment did you choose and why do you feel it was the best choice? I am so deeply sorry that we all have to be here. Thank you all in advance for any advice.",

I thought it was nice that they had already thought ahead to do that. I am hoping this trip will make them feel better and lessen the anxiety a bit. It sounds like he will be in great hands.",

      "Content": "Thank you all so much. This is all good information for us to consider as we get closer to his appointment in Cleveland. It sounds like the doctor may recommend radiation. I am going to be okay with anything that can keep him with us and give him a good quality of life for 10-15 or more years. He and my mom started a business together, married 46 years and have worked so hard their whole lives, I know they are hoping to enjoy their retirement and travel. They had a big trip planned for May that they cancelled after finding out this news since we don't know how dad will be feeling at that point. I am an only child and also only 27 so it can be lonely going through this but I feel better already having heard back from all of you and being able to talk about this. He is in pretty good health other than this but he does have diabetes. He says he feels no different but that he's anxious not knowing which treatment he's going to have. I like the idea that once he has surgery we can at least know what we are dealing with, and possibly remove the lymph nodes, etc. so that it can't spread there (assuming it hasn't already). I am praying for all of you on this forum and thankful to have everyone's support. If I can't reply back to everyone - just know how much I appreciate all of this!",
