      "Content": "Wow, what rotten luck, especially after all you've both been thru. I'd say don't worry too much about it right now until it can be investigated further. The 3mm lung nodule could be anything, but the lymph node is certainly unusually large. Has she or have you had the chance to speak with the doctor yet? (or did I miss that?) Without her doctor's input you're really just shooting in the dark. I hope it ends up being something that is either easily treatable or perhaps requires no action at all. We can always hope, right? Prayers for you both!",

      "Content": "Things seemed to be going well. PSA is zero, and no more Lupron injections. Nothing to do now but wait for the HT to wear off over the next couple of years and see what if anything the PSA does. So it seemed like a good time to re-attack a few older medical problems that had been back-burnered by the prostate cancer a few years ago. So grab a drink, get comfy and let me take you on a ride. I've had eye, sinus and mouth problems for a long time, and have a big scar on my neck from surgeries around 35 years ago. And just as my PSA had started out (long story) my first few stabs at getting treated were met by \"oh that's nothing to be concerned about\" from the medical community, or \"here, take this and come back in six months\". With my adjuvant radiation out of the way last fall, I had an ENT look up my nose and he said he saw a \"mass\" in there, and wanted a CT scan. Great, just what I needed... more radiation. So instead he ordered an MRI, which was inconclusive. He put me on megadoses of gabapentin for a few months and the pain in my throat (nose? tongue? Pharynx?) subsided. I slept a lot and put on ten pounds, which I finally managed to lose this year. But I was still having trouble breathing, so he did a septoplasty (and turbinoplasty... look it up, \"turbinators\", like Ahh-h-nold) ... I had broken my nose a half dozen times in high school, basically every sport they tried to make me participate in. Why don't they \"force\" jocks into math and science competitions? Made sense that the deviated septum was the problem. It took a couple months to heal up. But now one side of my nose is completely closed off. Not what I had hoped for. At least I'm not coughing up phlegm for the first few hours of every day. So then I have my annual eye exam with my fourth ophthalmologist and he puts me on yet another expensive eye drop (you've no doubt seen commercials for them) which worked no better than the ones that I had been on for five years before that. So I dug out the business card for yet another ophthalmologist (#5) whom I had been referred to last year when I was going thru the \"AUS-and-ART\" phase of my PCa treatment. So no time for yet another eye doc then, but now the time seemed right. So he pokes me in the eye and says \"I've seen this before \" (it's a somewhat rare condition) and started me on 60mg/day of prednisone. He wanted CT's of my brain and face. (Great, just what I needed... more radiation.) Got that about a month ago, just after seeing my ENT again for a follow-up on the septoplasty. ENT says my nasal valve is incompetent... that's an actual medical term. As he was the throat guy (who had ordered the MRI) he refers me to his nose and sinus associate to discuss putting what he called a \"clip\" in my cheek to hold my nose open. Turns out this is a new procedure currently undergoing clinical trials. Interesting concept. Hey, at least it's not cancer! So I say oh by the way I just happen to have this CT study of my face from the eye doctor, and he looks at it and says I have a bony deformity that is fairly common, but for most it is not a problem. We discuss the implant procedure to be included as part of surgery to remove some of the bone deformity from the base of my skull (!!!) and I schedule the surgery for next month. The scheduling nurse asks, how long you gonna be on prednisone? I dunno. Back to the eye doc, a neuro-ophthalmic and occuloplastic surgeon (fortunately he has never mentioned surgery) and he has me tapering down on the prednisone... 60-50-40, and this week 30mg/day. Apparently this is a lot of prednisone. I didn't know. So I figure I'd better get in to see my GP just so he knows all the stuff I've got going on. I'm telling all this to my GP and he kind of gives me one of those looks, like what the hell are you doing? He says my cheeks are widening and I am developing \"moon face\" (again, an actual medical term, look it up) and he starts poking me in the belly. Does that hurt? No, but if you poke hard enough, it will. Then he orders some bloodwork. So yesterday his nurse calls and tells me that I have pancreatitis and he wants more bloodwork, which I had this morning, and a CT scan of my abdomen. (Great, just what I need... more radiation.) So now I wait. Called the eye doc and turns out he never sent a report to my PCP. The healthcare system in Florida is overwhelmed and the patient has to follow up on literally everything. If you don't then stuff just falls thru the cracks. Nurses are constantly busy shuffling papers and answering the phone, and then don't remember if they already took care of the one in their hand so just put it on a stack, where it gets buried and ends up in the warehouse from the end of \"Raiders of the Lost Ark\" where it will never be seen by those \"top men\". So now it's Friday. I may get a call telling me to rush to the hospital... or maybe not. The prednisone has me all jittery anyway... hard to sleep. Really revved up. And now I gotta worry about something new? Maybe? All I know so far is my doc said NOT to have implant surgery while I'm on prednisone, so I called the ENT's office to cancel the surgery. I hope they got the message. No one has called back yet. So I sit and wait... tick, tock.",

Without her doctor's input you're really just shooting in the dark. I hope it ends up being something that is either easily treatable or perhaps requires no action at all. We can always hope, right?

      "Content": "Things seemed to be going well. PSA is zero, and no more Lupron injections. Nothing to do now but wait for the HT to wear off over the next couple of years and see what if anything the PSA does. So it seemed like a good time to re-attack a few older medical problems that had been back-burnered by the prostate cancer a few years ago. So grab a drink, get comfy and let me take you on a ride. I've had eye, sinus and mouth problems for a long time, and have a big scar on my neck from surgeries around 35 years ago. And just as my PSA had started out (long story) my first few stabs at getting treated were met by \"oh that's nothing to be concerned about\" from the medical community, or \"here, take this and come back in six months\". With my adjuvant radiation out of the way last fall, I had an ENT look up my nose and he said he saw a \"mass\" in there, and wanted a CT scan. Great, just what I needed... more radiation. So instead he ordered an MRI, which was inconclusive. He put me on megadoses of gabapentin for a few months and the pain in my throat (nose? tongue? Pharynx?) subsided. I slept a lot and put on ten pounds, which I finally managed to lose this year. But I was still having trouble breathing, so he did a septoplasty (and turbinoplasty... look it up, \"turbinators\", like Ahh-h-nold) ... I had broken my nose a half dozen times in high school, basically every sport they tried to make me participate in. Why don't they \"force\" jocks into math and science competitions? Made sense that the deviated septum was the problem. It took a couple months to heal up. But now one side of my nose is completely closed off. Not what I had hoped for. At least I'm not coughing up phlegm for the first few hours of every day. So then I have my annual eye exam with my fourth ophthalmologist and he puts me on yet another expensive eye drop (you've no doubt seen commercials for them) which worked no better than the ones that I had been on for five years before that. So I dug out the business card for yet another ophthalmologist (#5) whom I had been referred to last year when I was going thru the \"AUS-and-ART\" phase of my PCa treatment. So no time for yet another eye doc then, but now the time seemed right. So he pokes me in the eye and says \"I've seen this before \" (it's a somewhat rare condition) and started me on 60mg/day of prednisone. He wanted CT's of my brain and face. (Great, just what I needed... more radiation.) Got that about a month ago, just after seeing my ENT again for a follow-up on the septoplasty. ENT says my nasal valve is incompetent... that's an actual medical term. As he was the throat guy (who had ordered the MRI) he refers me to his nose and sinus associate to discuss putting what he called a \"clip\" in my cheek to hold my nose open. Turns out this is a new procedure currently undergoing clinical trials. Interesting concept. Hey, at least it's not cancer! So I say oh by the way I just happen to have this CT study of my face from the eye doctor, and he looks at it and says I have a bony deformity that is fairly common, but for most it is not a problem. We discuss the implant procedure to be included as part of surgery to remove some of the bone deformity from the base of my skull (!!!) and I schedule the surgery for next month. The scheduling nurse asks, how long you gonna be on prednisone? I dunno. Back to the eye doc, a neuro-ophthalmic and occuloplastic surgeon (fortunately he has never mentioned surgery) and he has me tapering down on the prednisone... 60-50-40, and this week 30mg/day. Apparently this is a lot of prednisone. I didn't know. So I figure I'd better get in to see my GP just so he knows all the stuff I've got going on. I'm telling all this to my GP and he kind of gives me one of those looks, like what the hell are you doing? He says my cheeks are widening and I am developing \"moon face\" (again, an actual medical term, look it up) and he starts poking me in the belly. Does that hurt? No, but if you poke hard enough, it will. Then he orders some bloodwork. So yesterday his nurse calls and tells me that I have pancreatitis and he wants more bloodwork, which I had this morning, and a CT scan of my abdomen. (Great, just what I need... more radiation.) So now I wait. Called the eye doc and turns out he never sent a report to my PCP. The healthcare system in Florida is overwhelmed and the patient has to follow up on literally everything. If you don't then stuff just falls thru the cracks. Nurses are constantly busy shuffling papers and answering the phone, and then don't remember if they already took care of the one in their hand so just put it on a stack, where it gets buried and ends up in the warehouse from the end of \"Raiders of the Lost Ark\" where it will never be seen by those \"top men\". So now it's Friday. I may get a call telling me to rush to the hospital... or maybe not. The prednisone has me all jittery anyway... hard to sleep. Really revved up. And now I gotta worry about something new? Maybe? All I know so far is my doc said NOT to have implant surgery while I'm on prednisone, so I called the ENT's office to cancel the surgery. I hope they got the message. No one has called back yet. So I sit and wait... tick, tock.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by garyi What dose of Venlafaxine are you guys taking? Just in case I started at 37.5 - they always start you low and taper up. Then on to the 'effective' dose of 75mg daily, in the morning. I would sometimes take an extra 37.5 later in the day if I was feeling down. Just recently I doubled again to 150mg. Been on it for nine months now and rarely have the blues these days. My family notices I am much more pleasant to be around. You have to taper back off it gradually, so it's a double edged sword. I told Lori I'd probably be on it for life. She asked why. TBH it only 'helps' the hot flashes, but does not eliminate them. They are shorter, less severe and less frequent, but tolerable. I hear it takes a year or even years to get T levels back. So as long as the Venlafaxine keeps working, I guess I'm okay. Word is in MDD circles that Effexor (venlafaxine) has good durability and works for years before it 'poops out'. I guess we'll see.",

Thus anything from .05 to .14 would round to .1. Once it hits .15, it becomes .2. If I remember correctly, in a purely statistical environment I think a 5 is rounded up only if it would result in an even number, otherwise it is rounded down... so either 1.5 or 2.5 would be rounded to 2. Of course, it may be different when rounding PSA numbers, but in statistics, there's an even probability that the number of samples being rounded up would equal the number rounded down. In other words, you'd be rounding up half the time and rounding down half the time. Just nit picking here!",

My favorite reference for decoding all the symbols and numbers can be found here Prostate Cancer: Stages and Grades .... BTW congrats on surviving the Foley. Mine is back IN again, for the past week... and I HOPE it is coming out on Thursday.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by DavefromMD When decreasing the number of decimal points (significant figures), a 5 or greater in the least significant place rounds to the next higher number. Thus anything from .05 to .14 would round to .1. Once it hits .15, it becomes .2. If I remember correctly, in a purely statistical environment I think a 5 is rounded up only if it would result in an even number, otherwise it is rounded down... so either 1.5 or 2.5 would be rounded to 2. Of course, it may be different when rounding PSA numbers, but in statistics, there's an even probability that the number of samples being rounded up would equal the number rounded down. In other words, you'd be rounding up half the time and rounding down half the time. Just nit picking here!",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by jfredfc Question, for many years ... I had been on Wellbutrin with good results. Since the surgery I feel more depressed ... Gotten to the point where I am snapping at folks and letting a lot of things worry me. I am going to see my PCP on the 19th. Anyone else had these problems. The phenomenon of an antidepressant becoming ineffective particularly after an extended period of \"good results\" seems to be fairly common if you read forums devoted to anxiety and depression, just as this one (cancerforums.net) is focused on cancer. Patients who had taken a certain antidepressant for some years refer to it as having \"pooped out\" and that they had to switch to another one. You can think of it as the treatment having a lifespan. Just as each class of antidepressants (tricyclic, SSRI, SNRI) has a specific mechanism of action, various drugs in each class seem to work for some symptoms of some patients where another similar drug may not work at all. So when a drug becomes no longer effective for the patient, the physician needs to find a different drug that works. Also there may be issues with tolerability. Wellbutrin in particular is generally well tolerated by most patients, though it may not necessarily be the most effective. Personally I am fairly new to the world of behavioral pharmacology, but as with prostate cancer, I had to become a quick study, did a lot of research and told my doctor what specific problems bothered me the most and what I felt might help. First thing is that you need to inform your doctor that the Wellbutrin (Buproprion) is no longer working for you, and that you have these specific issues that disturb you most. Do not \"lead\" into it by recommending a specific drug, but when further into the conversation you might ask about it. You might print out specific articles from your own research and highlight specific hot points that are similar to your own condition. Doctors don't like to be told what to do, but also they do not take hints very well. They expect to ask questions and you just answer, so when it comes your turn if he prescribes something else, ask why and oh what about this other one (you've heard of, a friend uses or recommended, etc). It seems like a convoluted way to get things done, but doctors do have an ego and respond better to input rather than suggestion.",

The Cipro made my feet turn purple and made my fingers numb. The \"prostatitis\" later turned out to be high grade prostate cancer. The word \"cancer\" had never been mentioned by anyone until after my urologist retired. Moral of the story is that sometimes it really is cancer.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by DavefromMD When decreasing the number of decimal points (significant figures), a 5 or greater in the least significant place rounds to the next higher number. Thus anything from .05 to .14 would round to .1. Once it hits .15, it becomes .2. If I remember correctly, in a purely statistical environment I think a 5 is rounded up only if it would result in an even number, otherwise it is rounded down... so either 1.5 or 2.5 would be rounded to 2. Of course, it may be different when rounding PSA numbers, but in statistics, there's an even probability that the number of samples being rounded up would equal the number rounded down. In other words, you'd be rounding up half the time and rounding down half the time. Just nit picking here!",

      "Content": "Things seemed to be going well. PSA is zero, and no more Lupron injections. Nothing to do now but wait for the HT to wear off over the next couple of years and see what if anything the PSA does. So it seemed like a good time to re-attack a few older medical problems that had been back-burnered by the prostate cancer a few years ago. So grab a drink, get comfy and let me take you on a ride. I've had eye, sinus and mouth problems for a long time, and have a big scar on my neck from surgeries around 35 years ago. And just as my PSA had started out (long story) my first few stabs at getting treated were met by \"oh that's nothing to be concerned about\" from the medical community, or \"here, take this and come back in six months\". With my adjuvant radiation out of the way last fall, I had an ENT look up my nose and he said he saw a \"mass\" in there, and wanted a CT scan. Great, just what I needed... more radiation. So instead he ordered an MRI, which was inconclusive. He put me on megadoses of gabapentin for a few months and the pain in my throat (nose? tongue? Pharynx?) subsided. I slept a lot and put on ten pounds, which I finally managed to lose this year. But I was still having trouble breathing, so he did a septoplasty (and turbinoplasty... look it up, \"turbinators\", like Ahh-h-nold) ... I had broken my nose a half dozen times in high school, basically every sport they tried to make me participate in. Why don't they \"force\" jocks into math and science competitions? Made sense that the deviated septum was the problem. It took a couple months to heal up. But now one side of my nose is completely closed off. Not what I had hoped for. At least I'm not coughing up phlegm for the first few hours of every day. So then I have my annual eye exam with my fourth ophthalmologist and he puts me on yet another expensive eye drop (you've no doubt seen commercials for them) which worked no better than the ones that I had been on for five years before that. So I dug out the business card for yet another ophthalmologist (#5) whom I had been referred to last year when I was going thru the \"AUS-and-ART\" phase of my PCa treatment. So no time for yet another eye doc then, but now the time seemed right. So he pokes me in the eye and says \"I've seen this before \" (it's a somewhat rare condition) and started me on 60mg/day of prednisone. He wanted CT's of my brain and face. (Great, just what I needed... more radiation.) Got that about a month ago, just after seeing my ENT again for a follow-up on the septoplasty. ENT says my nasal valve is incompetent... that's an actual medical term. As he was the throat guy (who had ordered the MRI) he refers me to his nose and sinus associate to discuss putting what he called a \"clip\" in my cheek to hold my nose open. Turns out this is a new procedure currently undergoing clinical trials. Interesting concept. Hey, at least it's not cancer! So I say oh by the way I just happen to have this CT study of my face from the eye doctor, and he looks at it and says I have a bony deformity that is fairly common, but for most it is not a problem. We discuss the implant procedure to be included as part of surgery to remove some of the bone deformity from the base of my skull (!!!) and I schedule the surgery for next month. The scheduling nurse asks, how long you gonna be on prednisone? I dunno. Back to the eye doc, a neuro-ophthalmic and occuloplastic surgeon (fortunately he has never mentioned surgery) and he has me tapering down on the prednisone... 60-50-40, and this week 30mg/day. Apparently this is a lot of prednisone. I didn't know. So I figure I'd better get in to see my GP just so he knows all the stuff I've got going on. I'm telling all this to my GP and he kind of gives me one of those looks, like what the hell are you doing? He says my cheeks are widening and I am developing \"moon face\" (again, an actual medical term, look it up) and he starts poking me in the belly. Does that hurt? No, but if you poke hard enough, it will. Then he orders some bloodwork. So yesterday his nurse calls and tells me that I have pancreatitis and he wants more bloodwork, which I had this morning, and a CT scan of my abdomen. (Great, just what I need... more radiation.) So now I wait. Called the eye doc and turns out he never sent a report to my PCP. The healthcare system in Florida is overwhelmed and the patient has to follow up on literally everything. If you don't then stuff just falls thru the cracks. Nurses are constantly busy shuffling papers and answering the phone, and then don't remember if they already took care of the one in their hand so just put it on a stack, where it gets buried and ends up in the warehouse from the end of \"Raiders of the Lost Ark\" where it will never be seen by those \"top men\". So now it's Friday. I may get a call telling me to rush to the hospital... or maybe not. The prednisone has me all jittery anyway... hard to sleep. Really revved up. And now I gotta worry about something new? Maybe? All I know so far is my doc said NOT to have implant surgery while I'm on prednisone, so I called the ENT's office to cancel the surgery. I hope they got the message. No one has called back yet. So I sit and wait... tick, tock.",

He says my cheeks are widening and I am developing \"moon face\" (again, an actual medical term, look it up) and he starts poking me in the belly. Does that hurt? No, but if you poke hard enough, it will. Then he orders some bloodwork. So yesterday his nurse calls and tells me that I have pancreatitis and he wants more bloodwork, which I had this morning, and a CT scan of my abdomen. (Great, just what I need... more radiation.) So now I wait. Called the eye doc and turns out he never sent a report to my PCP. The healthcare system in Florida is overwhelmed and the patient has to follow up on literally everything. If you don't then stuff just falls thru the cracks. Nurses are constantly busy shuffling papers and answering the phone, and then don't remember if they already took care of the one in their hand so just put it on a stack, where it gets buried and ends up in the warehouse from the end of \"Raiders of the Lost Ark\" where it will never be seen by those \"top men\". So now it's Friday. I may get a call telling me to rush to the hospital... or maybe not. The prednisone has me all jittery anyway... hard to sleep. Really revved up. And now I gotta worry about something new? Maybe? All I know so far is my doc said NOT to have implant surgery while I'm on prednisone, so I called the ENT's office to cancel the surgery. I hope they got the message. No one has called back yet. So I sit and wait... tick, tock.",

      "Content": "What I've read is that the length of time between RP and RT is not significant, but the PSA level at which RT is initiated is quite significant. Hence many doctors are advocating SRT as soon as an elevating pattern is established. With a rising PSA, then higher PSA also means longer time passed before starting, so they are related. I just passed the halfway point in my RT (18 more to go I think) and bowel issues started the second week... frequent urgency and loose bowels, occasional diarrhea (2X/week or more). Normally I am regular as clockwork. One cup of coffee and two minutes in the throne room. No other SE's at this time, but I hear the last couple weeks brings on fatigue that lasts for several weeks following conclusion of Tx. Good luck to you and your father. There will be some dietary restrictions (varies by RO) and the water/bladder requirement. Bowel issues if any will impact the bladder requirement. It's a bit tough, but nothing compared to what has been thru already. Showing up every day in time is imperative, but the procedure itself is not the least bit uncomfortable.",

      "Content": "My urologist never mentioned the word \"cancer\" and seemed totally unconcerned, even with my double digit PSA and family history. By the time I changed doctors, my PCa had apparently progressed rapidly. An MRI indicated that the tumor was contained within the prostate, where in fact upon surgery it had penetrated in three separate areas near the bladder and had invaded the seminal vesicles. Moral of the story is you never know just what will be found in there. The surgeon had to use a \"broad cut\" and removed a lot of tissue, including the nerves. Everything that could have possibly gone wrong, did. However, nowadays I never hesitate to get a second opinion before proceeding with surgery. In my most recent experience, the tests run at a large cancer center were inconclusive, and I ended up having a bowel resection at a local hospital, with good results. So I'd say go ahead and go with the second clinic and if their findings are no different, then go ahead with your original surgeon. As long as all of them take you seriously, you're in good shape.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by Another Some doctors are loathed to inform their patients that biopsy and MRI tests regularly generate false negatives. I have not heard of any insurance company requiring an antibiotic be used prior to approving additional biopsy or MRI. FWIW this all sounds so familiar to me, as well as Another's earlier mention of your apparent \"discomfort with your doctor\". I had persistent annoying burning in my urethra (but NOT when urinating) and was given longer and longer courses of Cipro... so much that my feet and toes turned purple. Meanwhile my PSA kept rising and rising. After the first biopsy \"proved\" that there was nothing wrong, I essentially gave up. My urologist NEVER mentioned the possibility of false negatives and in fact never mentioned the word cancer. Admittedly I was a fool. All this time I could have been doing online research, but I trusted my urologist (eventhough his attitude annoyed and frustrated me). By the time I changed doctors, my cancer had progressed to where is was almost at the point of metastasis. Thank god it was discovered just in time, and by then had become quite difficult to treat. I don't know what to say about your case. It is truly puzzling. The previous poster (ASA) has had a lot of biopsies, and another contributor here (Djin) had many more before his cancer was finally discovered. This all seems to me to be a barbaric practice... a test of wills against a system designed to keep the patient in the dark.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by h60av8er Well, first post surgery post, had the catheter removed today which is nice, on the other hand, the pathology report has me at stage p3ta pN0... The doctor started out with \"I got all the cancer\" so that, negative margins and the Gleason staying at 3=4+7 seems good. My wife and are are at square one again and pretty pessimistic, this seems like not so good news. Actually it all sounds like pretty GREAT news, especially since he said flat out that he got ALL the cancer. As long as you are certain of that, then you have little to worry about. Although no cancer is good cancer, it sounds like yours didn't go very far. Negative margins is VERY good. pN0 means there is no lymph node involvement. And you can assume \"M0\" for no metathesis. Furthermore, 3+4 is better than 4+3 (assuming yours was a typo). The first number is the predominant pattern, and the second number is the secondary pattern. Nothing to be pessimistic about. My favorite reference for decoding all the symbols and numbers can be found here Prostate Cancer: Stages and Grades .... BTW congrats on surviving the Foley. Mine is back IN again, for the past week... and I HOPE it is coming out on Thursday.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by DavefromMD When decreasing the number of decimal points (significant figures), a 5 or greater in the least significant place rounds to the next higher number. Thus anything from .05 to .14 would round to .1. Once it hits .15, it becomes .2. If I remember correctly, in a purely statistical environment I think a 5 is rounded up only if it would result in an even number, otherwise it is rounded down... so either 1.5 or 2.5 would be rounded to 2. Of course, it may be different when rounding PSA numbers, but in statistics, there's an even probability that the number of samples being rounded up would equal the number rounded down. In other words, you'd be rounding up half the time and rounding down half the time. Just nit picking here!",

      "Content": "What I've read is that the length of time between RP and RT is not significant, but the PSA level at which RT is initiated is quite significant. Hence many doctors are advocating SRT as soon as an elevating pattern is established. With a rising PSA, then higher PSA also means longer time passed before starting, so they are related. I just passed the halfway point in my RT (18 more to go I think) and bowel issues started the second week... frequent urgency and loose bowels, occasional diarrhea (2X/week or more). Normally I am regular as clockwork. One cup of coffee and two minutes in the throne room. No other SE's at this time, but I hear the last couple weeks brings on fatigue that lasts for several weeks following conclusion of Tx. Good luck to you and your father. There will be some dietary restrictions (varies by RO) and the water/bladder requirement. Bowel issues if any will impact the bladder requirement. It's a bit tough, but nothing compared to what has been thru already. Showing up every day in time is imperative, but the procedure itself is not the least bit uncomfortable.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by Another Some doctors are loathed to inform their patients that biopsy and MRI tests regularly generate false negatives. I have not heard of any insurance company requiring an antibiotic be used prior to approving additional biopsy or MRI. FWIW this all sounds so familiar to me, as well as Another's earlier mention of your apparent \"discomfort with your doctor\". I had persistent annoying burning in my urethra (but NOT when urinating) and was given longer and longer courses of Cipro... so much that my feet and toes turned purple. Meanwhile my PSA kept rising and rising. After the first biopsy \"proved\" that there was nothing wrong, I essentially gave up. My urologist NEVER mentioned the possibility of false negatives and in fact never mentioned the word cancer. Admittedly I was a fool. All this time I could have been doing online research, but I trusted my urologist (eventhough his attitude annoyed and frustrated me). By the time I changed doctors, my cancer had progressed to where is was almost at the point of metastasis. Thank god it was discovered just in time, and by then had become quite difficult to treat. I don't know what to say about your case. It is truly puzzling. The previous poster (ASA) has had a lot of biopsies, and another contributor here (Djin) had many more before his cancer was finally discovered. This all seems to me to be a barbaric practice... a test of wills against a system designed to keep the patient in the dark.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by garyi What dose of Venlafaxine are you guys taking? Just in case I started at 37.5 - they always start you low and taper up. Then on to the 'effective' dose of 75mg daily, in the morning. I would sometimes take an extra 37.5 later in the day if I was feeling down. Just recently I doubled again to 150mg. Been on it for nine months now and rarely have the blues these days. My family notices I am much more pleasant to be around. You have to taper back off it gradually, so it's a double edged sword. I told Lori I'd probably be on it for life. She asked why. TBH it only 'helps' the hot flashes, but does not eliminate them. They are shorter, less severe and less frequent, but tolerable. I hear it takes a year or even years to get T levels back. So as long as the Venlafaxine keeps working, I guess I'm okay. Word is in MDD circles that Effexor (venlafaxine) has good durability and works for years before it 'poops out'. I guess we'll see.",

      "Content": "My urologist never mentioned the word \"cancer\" and seemed totally unconcerned, even with my double digit PSA and family history. By the time I changed doctors, my PCa had apparently progressed rapidly. An MRI indicated that the tumor was contained within the prostate, where in fact upon surgery it had penetrated in three separate areas near the bladder and had invaded the seminal vesicles. Moral of the story is you never know just what will be found in there. The surgeon had to use a \"broad cut\" and removed a lot of tissue, including the nerves. Everything that could have possibly gone wrong, did. However, nowadays I never hesitate to get a second opinion before proceeding with surgery. In my most recent experience, the tests run at a large cancer center were inconclusive, and I ended up having a bowel resection at a local hospital, with good results. So I'd say go ahead and go with the second clinic and if their findings are no different, then go ahead with your original surgeon. As long as all of them take you seriously, you're in good shape.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by jfredfc Question, for many years ... I had been on Wellbutrin with good results. Since the surgery I feel more depressed ... Gotten to the point where I am snapping at folks and letting a lot of things worry me. I am going to see my PCP on the 19th. Anyone else had these problems. The phenomenon of an antidepressant becoming ineffective particularly after an extended period of \"good results\" seems to be fairly common if you read forums devoted to anxiety and depression, just as this one (cancerforums.net) is focused on cancer. Patients who had taken a certain antidepressant for some years refer to it as having \"pooped out\" and that they had to switch to another one. You can think of it as the treatment having a lifespan. Just as each class of antidepressants (tricyclic, SSRI, SNRI) has a specific mechanism of action, various drugs in each class seem to work for some symptoms of some patients where another similar drug may not work at all. So when a drug becomes no longer effective for the patient, the physician needs to find a different drug that works. Also there may be issues with tolerability. Wellbutrin in particular is generally well tolerated by most patients, though it may not necessarily be the most effective. Personally I am fairly new to the world of behavioral pharmacology, but as with prostate cancer, I had to become a quick study, did a lot of research and told my doctor what specific problems bothered me the most and what I felt might help. First thing is that you need to inform your doctor that the Wellbutrin (Buproprion) is no longer working for you, and that you have these specific issues that disturb you most. Do not \"lead\" into it by recommending a specific drug, but when further into the conversation you might ask about it. You might print out specific articles from your own research and highlight specific hot points that are similar to your own condition. Doctors don't like to be told what to do, but also they do not take hints very well. They expect to ask questions and you just answer, so when it comes your turn if he prescribes something else, ask why and oh what about this other one (you've heard of, a friend uses or recommended, etc). It seems like a convoluted way to get things done, but doctors do have an ego and respond better to input rather than suggestion.",

By the time I changed doctors, my PCa had apparently progressed rapidly. An MRI indicated that the tumor was contained within the prostate, where in fact upon surgery it had penetrated in three separate areas near the bladder and had invaded the seminal vesicles. Moral of the story is you never know just what will be found in there. The surgeon had to use a \"broad cut\" and removed a lot of tissue, including the nerves. Everything that could have possibly gone wrong, did. However, nowadays I never hesitate to get a second opinion before proceeding with surgery. In my most recent experience, the tests run at a large cancer center were inconclusive, and I ended up having a bowel resection at a local hospital, with good results. So I'd say go ahead and go with the second clinic and if their findings are no different, then go ahead with your original surgeon. As long as all of them take you seriously, you're in good shape.",

Fortunately it sound like everything went by the book for you. Dry nights is typically the first sign of improvement, then reduced number of pads during the day. Most guys have it worst when on their feet (it's gravity). And most claim 6-12 months to regain full continence, though there are some superheroes who have managed even shorter. You are fortunate to have retained full erectile capability as well. Congratulations on pulling thru this with flying colors! Don't hesitate to drop by any time with a question or a progress report. It's always good to hear the positive experiences.",

      "Content": "Mike - Thanks for taking the time to write about your experience. Sometimes what tends to end up online is some of the horror stories. Fortunately it sound like everything went by the book for you. Dry nights is typically the first sign of improvement, then reduced number of pads during the day. Most guys have it worst when on their feet (it's gravity). And most claim 6-12 months to regain full continence, though there are some superheroes who have managed even shorter. You are fortunate to have retained full erectile capability as well. Congratulations on pulling thru this with flying colors! Don't hesitate to drop by any time with a question or a progress report. It's always good to hear the positive experiences.",

      "Content": "To you guys who recently had biopsies... OleJoe and NCman, I hope your procedures went well and that the results were helpful. But there's one thing that you need to know, something that my doctor never told me but was hopefully discussed in your books... If your biopsy is 'negative' it does not mean that you do not have cancer. My original urologist never even mentioned the word cancer, but merely told me that all my tests were negative. He gave me the impression that my PSA rise could be treated with medicine. What no one ever told me was that about a third of initial biopsies totally miss any tumor, even when high grade cancer may exist. If the doctor does not pursue further investigation then the patient must be the one who takes the reins and pushes for more information. Doctors tend to say as little as possible. I believe that withholding information is unethical, but today it is probably a legal requirement. All this is very unfortunate but that's the way it is. Some others here have had multiple biopsies and other tests and procedures with varying outcomes. The bloody, uncomfortable process of prostate biopsy leaves a guy certainly not anxious to repeat the procedure when the outcome yields nebulous results. The 'lucky' ones are those who strike pay dirt the first time and are successfully treated without clinical upstaging in the process. It is all too easy to become discouraged in this process. Unfortunately the 'once and done' guys are the ones least likely to seek out forums like this one and others. The good news is that most guys have favorable outcomes from their PCa experience and we never hear from them. Hopefully your experiences will go well.",

      "Content": "Welcome to the forum, and good luck on Monday. With your G7 pathology you stand an excellent chance of pulling thru this without any complications. I too am having surgery on Monday 5/15 to implant an artificial sphincter. Only a couple thousand of these are done annually so I'm a bit apprehensive about it, however it is necessary so that I can begin salvage radiation which was postponed from March due to incontinence. I have good control but am told that continence worsens following RT so it is best to get it in beforehand rather than try to recover later. My blog is listed at the bottom of my sig (though I haven't paid much attention to it lately). I hope everything goes well for you in the weeks ahead. If you follow the path of most of the guys here, you will be pad free in just a few months.",

Yes, it is a good idea to trim, not shave the skin to improve adhesion and avoid irritation. And be sure to clean around the tip daily with mild soapy water and apply a mild ointment, for comfort. Use polysporin or bacitracin, NOT Neosporin. It is too strong.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by mikesimm here is my question... During the course of 39 treatments of RT, is it permitted to say do half of them, then take a 3-4 week break and then resume for the remainder of the treatments? I'm going to say no, though your RO will be the ultimate judge on this. I for one went thru \"hell and high water\" (literally) to get through RT. The list of events that would have caused me to delay or take a pause in treatments is lengthy and I won't repeat them here, but I'd say don't plan on getting a break in midstream. It's good to see you back here again Mike. Your lovely wife is correct... as a T3b you should use every tool in the arsenal to knock out this cancer while it's down. I think the stats are 50/50 regarding progression free survival for T3b's without ART and ADT, but you don't want to be on the wrong side of that statistic. Good luck!",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by JW57 The diagnosis has yet to completely sink in. It's such a strange feeling to know I have cancer and yet feel completely fine. I've been on a bit of a roller coaster, emotionally. Finding this Forum has been very helpful. Yes, the cancer diagnosis is certainly a shocker, and for most is their first serious medical issue of a lifetime beyond maybe a broken bone or perhaps some major surgery for something non-malignant. But learning that there is something eating away inside you - and that there is no certainty that you can or will be cured of it is truly a life altering event. In my case I knew there was something wrong... I felt certain of it, but all the tests were negative. The final diagnosis of prostate cancer at least relieved my anxiety of not knowing what was wrong and why I had been so emotional for the past couple years on top of everything else my wife and I had going on. I wish I'd had the time to seek out other opinions from other doctors and not have to rush into treatment, but given my particular situation, surgery appeared to be the best approach and I have no regrets. It sounds like you are taking this very well and approaching your treatment logically and analytically. You will get thru this. It was discovered early and the path you are now on is one that is well worn. Good luck in your recovery and don't hesitate to come back and keep us informed of your progress.",

A couple things to keep in mind if you do... 1) not all insurances will pay for an initial MRI guided biopsy, and generally require an ultrasound biopsy first (stupid, given the high chance of false negative... I lost a year that way) and 2) if the biopsy is positive, there is a 6-8 week healing period required before any treatment could commence, so it's likely you'd need to postpone any treatment until around the time of the wedding anyway... and with PC it's usually not so aggressive that a few weeks delay would be significant.

      "Content": "Good luck with this June, and for your husband. Often the choice between surgery and radiation as the first line treatment comes down to the patients age and general health, as well as the extend of the cancer. If your husband is over 70 or has other medical problems such as diabetes or heart disease that might interfere with his recovery, then surgery is probably not a good idea. On the other hand, if he is young (less than 60) you must consider that he would likely still live more than 20 years and some of the after effects of radiation might appear later in his life (there is disagreement on this from staunch proponents of first line radiation). Furthermore, if your husband's cancer turns out to be a higher grade than 8, which would be 9 or 10, then generally surgery is skipped and treatment goes right into hormone therapy and radiation only. One of the advantages of surgery is that the entire prostate is removed and examined in a lab and the exact nature of the cancer can be determined. Also the prostate bed can be visually examined as well as remaining lymph nodes for any residual cancer. I have heard of some cases in which surgery is begun and then halted if the extent of cancer turns out to be much more than expected. With radiation all the targeting of beams is based on scans. Also there are about a dozen varieties of radiation treatment and many of them require a commitment of daily treatments for several weeks or months. The pill your husband has started on is probably Casodex, which blocks testosterone and in a couple weeks he will probably get a shot of Lupron, which reduces the production of testosterone in order to 'starve' the cancer and limit its growth and potential spread. For most men, the hormone therapy or ADT is the least comfortable of the treatment trifecta as it usually goes on for several years. His high PSA number is probably the reason for starting HT immediately. Otherwise, the single G8 grade with a few 6's should be able to be treated successfully. The wild card is the lymph node involvement. I hope this works out well for you both.",

      "Content": "The catheter will probably be attached to his thigh with a Statlock. If not you can tape the tube to his thigh to prevent tugging on his penis. Pink crud will develop around where the tube exits the penis. I rinsed it with a cotton ball, mild soap and warm water, pulled back on the penis slightly to expose the tubing and apply polysporin or bacitracin ointment (NOT neosporin) with a q-tip all the way around the tubing then let it slide back in. Stool softener starting the day after surgery is a must. If no \"movement\" within a couple days, add a stimulant laxative. My Uro liked Milk of Mag. I never disconnected the cath from the large overnight bag. I cut out the bottom of one pocket on a couple pairs of pajama bottoms and fed the bag and tubing thru the hole. During the day I would carry the bag around in a large empty bucket, which was also handy for carrying drinks and such when you don't have a free hand. During the night, keep the overnight bag in the big bucket by the bedside. Sometimes they do leak, and it will save a big headache. The valves on those bags can be tricky. By never allowing the bag to be level or higher than his bladder will prevent introducing infection. Make sure it is always draining down and is not kinked or clogged. Also never disconnecting the bag from the tubing also minimizes the possibility of infection... but that's just me. He will have lifting restrictions for about a month following surgery. I think it was ten pounds. It's surprising how heavy some things are, like a gallon of milk or a twelve pack of soda. If in doubt, don't exert. Getting in and out of bed will be difficult for at least a week, maybe two. That's why the recliner is very handy. Also it is difficult to put on socks and shoes, even slippers, scratch the ankles or whatever. He will likely have some odd requests for you to do things for him.

      "Content": "I'd say there's likely to be surgery in your near future. Your case looks a lot like mine. Just FYI here's what happened... My PSA had been slowly rising over a number of years, 2-3-4, until just after my 63rd birthday it shot up to 9.5. My Uro did a biopsy which was negative, but the PSA kept rising thru the teens and finally twenties. He suggested my symptoms could be prostatitis and I was prescribed repeated courses of Cipro. This year he retired unexpectedly and his partner took over my case and did a MRI-guided biopsy. The results were two of twelve cores 100%, several others ranging 15-40%, with the majority being negative. Bone scan was negative. Tumor appeared to be contained within the capsule. Surgery was recommended as I am \"young and healthy enough\" and the tumor appeared to be aggressive. So your Gleason is slightly higher and hopefully the remaining test(s) will also be negative. I'd say you have the opportunity to nip this in the bud. With a Gleason 9 but low % of total cores positive I'd say yours is also likely to be aggressive. TBH it was a relief to me when the biopsy finally came back positive as everything leading up to that for the past three years wasn't giving me any answers at all. All I could do was worry, and when the news finally came in at least I knew I could actually do something about it. With the surgery the Uro was able to examine the surrounding tissues for any signs of the cancer having spread. So far it appears only the seminary vesicles were affected. If I were five years older or had some underlying health issues (heart disease, diabetes) then some other lengthy, alternative treatments might have been more viable, but for me getting it over with was the best solution. Good luck to you in whatever may come of this. You are fortunate this was found fairly early on.",

      "Content": "I was overdue for a colonoscopy and had spent the entire previous year trying to get other medical procedures out of the way before starting ART to radiate the prostate bed following RP. My RO informed me that I would have to wait I think it was three months after a colonoscopy before starting RT. That colonoscopy was scheduled and then rescheduled several times last year, when it became apparent that it would delay the RT significantly. Three doctors told me flat out that I was \"trying to do too much\", so the colonoscopy got postponed until after the end of ART. Then when I completed ART my RO said that I would need to wait at least six months before getting the colonoscopy. I am anxious to get that underway as I experienced considerable bowel disruption during RT and beyond. The radiation proctitis still persists today, nearly five months after RT, and my colonoscopy is already scheduled for April. The reasoning for the healing periods is that the colon needs time to heal following a colonoscopy before hitting it with radiation, and once radiated, needs to heal before any invasive procedures that could lead to scar tissue developing as a result of radiated tissue healing improperly. All though I can't say I'm really looking forward to it, it will be a relief to finally have that out of the way.",

I ask because Ed's sig has \"Surgeon went wide on the right side and spared nerves on left.\" To answer your question as one of the \"RALP guys\", my surgeon \"went wide\". My wife and I had informed the him beforehand that nerve sparing was not as important as was treating the cancer. Consequently he used a broad cut. Both PNI and EPE were extensive. I was however able to achieve orgasm (quite a few actually!) post-op before starting the Lurpon... plus even a few in the early days of \"Lupron flare\". In my case, the tumor was located at the base of the prostate, at the opposite end from the apex where a positive surgical margin would be likely to occur. Hence no intraoperatove sections were deemed necessary. Instead my tumor was proximal to the bladder and sphincter, and so I suffered the consequences. But that's the breaks, and I dealt with it.",

I think it was titled \"Is now the time for MRI to become the standard\" or something similar. I had looked it up and referenced it in several subsequent posts, but by now it has probably moved back too many pages to be easily found. Without the MRI my cancer and my wife's quite possibly would have never been found until they might have progressed to the point of causing extensive metastatic damage. Prowler and surely several others here have likely also had a similar experience. Granted, MRI is currently an expensive procedure, but there are no known residual side effects (such as cumulative radiation, as with CT) and is only slightly uncomfortable... who hasn't had an itch you can't scratch appear just a few minutes into a 40 minute scan?

      "Content": "You are right where I was at eight months, faced with getting the AUS. In my case, there was additional urgency added because of the necessity for ART and the looming one year post-op deadline, including approx three months dedicated to getting the AUS and allowing it to heal. It was a very tough decision. Like you, I had some semblance of normalcy thanks to the condom caths, but occasionally used diapers at 8-12 per day. Some normal continence had returned but was told I would lose some of that after RT. The scary part of this is that this decision will change the way you do something that you do all day, every day for the rest of your life! ... Plus there seemed to be no one else on this board with any experience on the subject. I felt so all alone. But then I scoured several other message boards and found a few others who'd had the implant and were satisfied. One month post activation for me now, and the ability to once again wear shorts and swimsuits has been a wonderful feeling. Plus, my RT is finally underway. Again, it is a very tough decision, but if and when you do go that way, you will be pleased with the outcome. Good luck!",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by Pottk I am curious what you mean by 1 year deadline.. the reason i ask is my first psa was <.1 with my second psa being .09. So there is a possibility of srt in my future. Not so much of a deadline but more of a milestone. There have been studies which show that RT is most effective within the first 21 months post-op. I infer from that essentially \"the sooner the better\". Initially, ART was scheduled to begin last March 1st and was postponed due to incontinence. Then I was put into PT with a kegel coach. When that did not yield significant improvement I had to decide whether to get the AUS, which also meant allowing at least six weeks to heal AND accommodate the 25% potential revision rate... which of course, also happened to me as well. I could have put these things off forever... and then of course blame myself somewhere down the road for allowing the cancer to get the upper hand.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by G1enn During the last 18 months I've been having it checked every three months and it's hovered between 3.8-5.3. We ran a few courses of antibiotics- including one that lasted a month. My doctor has now recommended a biopsy. His initial recommendation was a MRI- but my insurance won't cover it and it would be 3500$. I have it scheduled for august 2nd. It's under local anesthesia. My concern is that even if it shows nothing that doesn't mean there is nothing there right? Is there anyway to know for sure that there's nothing there? What else could be causing my psa to be so consistently high for such a long time. My doctor said he didn't know. You are very right on that. I too had rising PSA but a negative biopsy. In fact all tests were negative. That just told me that I had to wait until it got bad enough that some doctor couldn't help but stumble over it. Well, yes there was cancer, and it did get worse. Read my sig below for the full rundown. My greatest problem was that my urologist did not share ANY information with me other than the tests being negative. Three years later, after a lot of time and research, I learned that insurance will not pay for an MRI unless there is a negative biopsy first, but other symptoms persist. Usually they prefer a positive DRE rather than 'just' rising PSA. So you may need to go thru a blind ultrasound biopsy just to get authorization for the MRI. It would be more cost effective and many more lives could be saved if they would just pay for an MRI when everything else in negative. This is what happens when the rules are made by people who have never been sick. Good luck. I hope you can get this taken care of quickly.",

      "Content": "We are sorry that you must join us here and especially because this is your father's second cancer. The good news is that his PSA and his Gleason are not terribly high. The Gleason 3+4 is better than 4+3 type because it means that MOST of the cancer found in the biopsy samples is grade 3, not grade 4. Grade 3 rarely ever spreads outside the prostate, though it is possible that some of the grade 4 may have spread. Also his PSA is high for a man of his age, but is under 10 and over 10 is more dangerous. Some severe prostate cancer the PSA is in the hundreds or even thousands. You will know more after your father has had more tests. Good luck!",

      "Content": "Good recommendation from ASA. He has had biopsies aplenty and knows they are uncomfortable if not painful and can lead to many potential complications. Given your age and your other health problem(s), another \"blind' biopsy could be counterproductive. Also your PSA is relatively low for your age. Most likely that one cancerous spot is still in there but in the subsequent biopsies, the needle just missed it. It happens. Cancer does not just go away on its own. However, if it is slow growing, which it appears to be, it is unlikely that it will grow to the stage where it might endanger your life before something else takes you, so to speak. The saying is, many men die with prostate cancer, not from cancer. The MRI fusion may indeed identify an actionable tumor in your prostate, but the procedure requires specialized training, and not every urologist will recommend it (because they are not qualified to do it themselves). There are also varying levels of detail to be revealed by different generations of MRI procedures. If you are concerned about your condition, you should investigate the MRI guided biopsy before allowing anyone to do another blind ultrasound guided biopsy. Good luck to you!",

      "Content": "I'd say there's likely to be surgery in your near future. Your case looks a lot like mine. Just FYI here's what happened... My PSA had been slowly rising over a number of years, 2-3-4, until just after my 63rd birthday it shot up to 9.5. My Uro did a biopsy which was negative, but the PSA kept rising thru the teens and finally twenties. He suggested my symptoms could be prostatitis and I was prescribed repeated courses of Cipro. This year he retired unexpectedly and his partner took over my case and did a MRI-guided biopsy. The results were two of twelve cores 100%, several others ranging 15-40%, with the majority being negative. Bone scan was negative. Tumor appeared to be contained within the capsule. Surgery was recommended as I am \"young and healthy enough\" and the tumor appeared to be aggressive. So your Gleason is slightly higher and hopefully the remaining test(s) will also be negative. I'd say you have the opportunity to nip this in the bud. With a Gleason 9 but low % of total cores positive I'd say yours is also likely to be aggressive. TBH it was a relief to me when the biopsy finally came back positive as everything leading up to that for the past three years wasn't giving me any answers at all. All I could do was worry, and when the news finally came in at least I knew I could actually do something about it. With the surgery the Uro was able to examine the surrounding tissues for any signs of the cancer having spread. So far it appears only the seminary vesicles were affected. If I were five years older or had some underlying health issues (heart disease, diabetes) then some other lengthy, alternative treatments might have been more viable, but for me getting it over with was the best solution. Good luck to you in whatever may come of this. You are fortunate this was found fairly early on.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by TinkerbellRM27 Can you explain what impact radiation can have over urinary function? Radiation freezes the healing process. For a RP patient recovering from surgery, the urinary tissues take considerable to time to fully heal, though for some they may reach a functional state fairly quickly. For some individuals it may take over a year, and for someone with adverse pathology indicating residual cancer, there is some urgency to proceed with adjuvant or salvage radiotherapy. Radiation damages all cells, healthy cells as well as cancer cells. Healthy cells are able to recover, but cancer cells are not. The process takes some time... months. In the case of structures that are still healing from the trauma of surgery, probably even longer. I am not yet there myself, however I have spoken with others who had RP followed by RT who have stated that they were near fully continent before RT but lost some continence following the radiation. This was one of the decisions involved in the AUS process. My doctor said it is better to have the AUS implanted before radiation rather than after, and the only case of a failed AUS implant involved a man who had previously had primary radiation during which he lost some continence and the tissues were not healthy enough to accommodate the AUS. Thanks for your interest!. I present some of this info in my blog at cancercoupleblog.com",

      "Content": "We are sorry that you must join us here and especially because this is your father's second cancer. The good news is that his PSA and his Gleason are not terribly high. The Gleason 3+4 is better than 4+3 type because it means that MOST of the cancer found in the biopsy samples is grade 3, not grade 4. Grade 3 rarely ever spreads outside the prostate, though it is possible that some of the grade 4 may have spread. Also his PSA is high for a man of his age, but is under 10 and over 10 is more dangerous. Some severe prostate cancer the PSA is in the hundreds or even thousands. You will know more after your father has had more tests. Good luck!",

      "Content": "Good luck to you Bob. I chose a local radiation oncologist as he was only about ten minutes away versus 45 minutes in heavy traffic to get to the big cancer center in Tampa. Your lymphatic involvement does put you in the high risk category, but at least you do not have seminal vesicle invasion. You will need to get your adjuvant RT underway as soon as possible. For me, the delay was due to persistent incontinence. Guidelines recommend ART within 12 months of surgery. JH and some Uro's use only one decimal place precision, so anything under (or slightly over) 0.1 is reported as 0.1 ... My current uro always uses the ultra sensitive testing, so when my PSA was going from .02 to .08, which would all be reported as \"undetectable\" by JH... so they knew it was time to start hormone therapy to halt the cancer's progression.",

      "Content": "Yesterday I saw the surgeon for a ten day followup and he had the pathology report, which concluded that my mesenteric mass was sclerosing mesenteritis. That and Carcinoid cancer were the two most likely diagnoses that I had studied for the past few months. A good graphic of the various possible diagnoses can be found here: Peritoneal Solid Masses He said the mass was essentially \"calcified fat\", lobular in appearance and slightly smaller than a baseball, but much larger than expected. It is typically non-lethal but was large enough to cause some disruption. The fact that I had been told that it could not be biopsied led to the delay in treatment. I would have had the surgery a month earlier, but my gastroenterologist said that these \"usually\" turn out to be Carcinoid, which is the antiquated name for \"neuro-endocrine tumor\" or NET (more specifically GEP-NET). This led me to a crash course on NET's and becoming familiar with yet another cancer that I had previously known nothing about. This Saturday - tomorrow - Nov 10th is \"NET cancer awareness day\". I have the bumper decal but not the T-shirt. This is the same type of cancer that killed Steve Jobs and more recently Aretha Franklin. Look it up. No one will ever even HEAR of neuro-endocrine cancer unless you specifically look for it. It is often misdiagnosed as a number of other conditions, such as irritable bowel syndrome. This type of mass is rare but not uncommon. Usually one is found upon autopsy in about 1 in 100 cases, but there are only a few hundred cases of appearance in the living... not because it is deadly, but because they usually don't look for it. It was just my good fortune that my GP suspected pancreatitis and ordered a CT which discovered the mass. The surgery itself went well. I have three new incisions added to my collection, the largest being 7\" long right down the middle. I was unable to eat or take anything by mouth for several days. Saliva and ice chips alone were enough to cause tremendous reflux and discomfort, but the surgeon said the anastomosis was so close to the stomach that anything I took by mouth had nowhere to go. Finally after five days on IV nutrition I quickly transitioned to full liquids and finally some cream of wheat. Still having some discomfort and my bowels are unpredictable, but am eating normally... though in smaller portions. I see the surgeon next just before Thanksgiving. He told me it may take six months before things return to normal... whatever that is.",

      "Content": "Yesterday was surgery number 15, and I'm pleased to say that everything went well. This was a revision of the septoplasty that I'd had last April but which left me with a collapsed nasal valve. So some bone was removed from my nasal cavity and a pair of implants were placed into either side of my nose to hold it open. Everything went well. I went in at noon and was home at 4PM and slept most of the rest of the day. After several dressing changes, the bleeding had stopped by 11PM last night. My nose is crusty and tender, but it's nothing like the original surgery last April, when I was stuffed up for several weeks. Once that had cleared up it became obvious that I wasn't breathing as I should. A lot of people, when I told them I was having a septoplasty for a deviated septum, they told me oh yeah I had that and it really helped. Well, that's just me and my luck. So this revision surgery had originally been scheduled fairly soon after, but then that mass was discovered in my abdomen. Everything had to be postponed to take care of that first. So as they say, \"it's another one for the record books\". I'm typing without my reading glasses as they hurt my nose (I had been warned about that beforehand). There appears to be no bruising, but have some ink marks on my nose. Anyone remember \"Nip Tuck\"? So I'm glad at least that my nose is open now and just have to sleep with my head elevated for a few nights. Next \"big\" surgery will hopefully be the total knee replacement that I was supposed to get back in 2015, but got prostate cancer instead. That damn cancer just gets in the way of everything!",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by DjinTonic Positive surgical margins following radical prostatectomy The \"extent\" of a positive margin is usually measured in mm in your path report. It could influence a decision for adjuvant RT or early SRT. We should have a Forum contest: In 100 words or less, describe the sensation of having a Foley removed. Winner gets a helium-inflated Foley balloon. First, a question for you Djin... one that has always puzzled me. The surgeon who performed my RP stated that I had negative margins. But in the path report it stated that the largest extraprostatic extension was 6mm. My RO looking a the same path report (which I have around here somewhere) told me that there were actually three foci of EPE. I'm guessing that these were places where the cancer had broken thru the prostate capsule, but because it had not been cut away from external tissues (or something of that nature) that it was not considered a surgical margin. Note my tumor was at the base and had consumed 25% of my prostate, but not at the apex where most PSM's occur. So, is there a formal distinction between extraprostatic extension and positive surgical margin? Is PSM the invasion of extraprostatic tissue? (other than SVI I suppose) Second matter, I have only one way to describe the sensation of Foley removal: it tickled. I've had it done at least a half dozen times in my life, and can only say that it is far more scary than painful. It was not unlike hill hopping or rollercoaster airtime.",

      "Content": "Good luck to you Bob. I chose a local radiation oncologist as he was only about ten minutes away versus 45 minutes in heavy traffic to get to the big cancer center in Tampa. Your lymphatic involvement does put you in the high risk category, but at least you do not have seminal vesicle invasion. You will need to get your adjuvant RT underway as soon as possible. For me, the delay was due to persistent incontinence. Guidelines recommend ART within 12 months of surgery. JH and some Uro's use only one decimal place precision, so anything under (or slightly over) 0.1 is reported as 0.1 ... My current uro always uses the ultra sensitive testing, so when my PSA was going from .02 to .08, which would all be reported as \"undetectable\" by JH... so they knew it was time to start hormone therapy to halt the cancer's progression.",

It seems we are always waiting for something... waiting to see a doctor, waiting for test results, waiting for improvement following treatment. Then there's the apprehension beforehand, which has its own special name, \"scanxiety\"... the anxiety that your next scan may show more cancer or that the cancer has returned. My fusion biopsy was a major relief, after my first biopsy proved to be a false negative. I seemed to be the only one who was concerned about it. When the MRI actually showed something, I finally had something that could be treated rather than ignored. But the fear and anxiety are always there.",

      "Content": "Not sure if there is actually a question in here, but here's a few things I've been able to determine: ART - adjuvant radiation is planned as part of the RP surgery, either due to adverse pathology known beforehand from the biopsy or discovered during the RP surgery. Adverse pathology is generally a very high pre-op PSA, locally advanced cancer (stage 3), seminal vesicle invasion, positive surgical margin. I am generalizing here, but the difference between adjuvant and salvage radiation is not so much based on the time lapsed between RP and RT, but on known adverse pathology which was not resolved during surgery. Generally ART is planned to be performed as soon as possible following surgery, generally 3 to 6 months post-op, or as soon as sufficient healing and continence have returned. ** SRT - salvage radiation is prompted by a rise in PSA post op in response to possible biological recurrence (BR). This is generally determined by two consecutive rises in PSA and/or PSA rising above a threshold value, formerly 0.2 but more recently 0.03 ... Often SRT would be needed if there was positive surgical margin(s) which at the time of surgery \"may or may not\" lead to BR, as opposed to ART which is prompted by adverse pathology which is likely to lead to rising PSA immediately following surgery without a period of low PSA between RP and RT. SRT is often required in a 2-5 year time window following RP. Sorry I do not have references or specific links to support any of this. It was not easy to glean this info from highly technical articles and personal accounts on boards like this one, so if anyone disputes these generalities, have at it. FWIW the recent NCCN classifications of high risk or adverse pathology is presented here. Again there is much discourse and dispute (nit-picking) on what on the surface appear to be hard and fast criteria. Low risk. The tumor is classified as T1a, T1b, T1c, or T2a. PSA is less than 10 ng/mL. The Gleason score is 6 or less. Intermediate risk. The tumor has 2 or more of these characteristics: Classified as T2b or T2c PSA is between 10 and 20 ng/mL Gleason score of 7 High risk. The tumor has 2 or more of these characteristics: Classified as T3a PSA level is higher than 20 ng/mL Gleason score is between 8 and 10 Very high risk. The tumor is classified as T3b or T4. The histologic grade is 5 for the main pattern of cell growth, or more than 4 biopsy cores have Gleason scores between 8 and 10. ** BTW in my case, I had been referring to my current radiation treatment as 'SRT' before I knew enough to figure out that it was actually ART. I was told immediately after surgery that I would need radiation at six months post-op due to the SVI. But at six months I was still near fully incontinent so was put on ADT to keep my PSA down until such time that continence could return. PSA rise was minimal, but the 12 month milestone was approaching. Why that was important is a different discussion. Anyway, my RT is referred to as \"delayed adjuvant\".",

      "Content": "The grade and extent of your father's cancer does indeed make surgery questionable, however there are advantages to removal followed by EBRT as opposed to merely radiating the entire prostate area, especially if your father already has problems with urination. You will find, especially online, many proponents - even zealots, of radiation as monotherapy and view surgery as brutal and barbaric. Often it turns out that these individuals have had only intermediate grade cancer and/or have not dealt with long term after effects of living with a toasted prostate. I personally had RP+RT+HT over the past two years. The prostate gland and surrounding tissues were removed and thoroughly examined in a pathology lab and the extent of disease was well known once the surgeon was finished. All three forms of therapy have had lasting after effects. The surgery left me incontinent and I required a prosthetic implant to proceed on with radiation. The adjuvant radiation left me with persistent bowel problems. And the hormone therapy is a \"gift that keeps on giving\" as for how it has impacted my life. But my PSA is now zero, I have no problems with voiding and my gastroenterologist says my next colonoscopy will be in seven years. My current urologist stated that high risk, high grade PCa patients who undergo the trifecta treatment protocol have the lowest incidence of recurrence compared to those men who had RP or RT (of any form) alone, with or without HT. Also please be aware that of the guys with G8-10 and stage T3a-b there is a 50% possibility that they would not have needed the adjuvant radiation, however given your father's advanced condition I do not believe he would be fortunate enough to get by without it. Additionally be aware that there are limitations to the accuracy of external scans regarding their ability to identify and locate the extent of spread until the disease has progressed much further. The only way to be sure that it stopped at the SV and capsule is to actually get in there. Some surgeons will likely even be unwilling to operate on a man your dad's age and condition, and radiation oncologists will likely give highly optimistic predictions for their own particular form of RT which they practice. Don't dismiss any possible options. Your father is only a few years older than me and has a slightly worse prognosis, but for me at least for now, prostate cancer appears to now be in the past.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by DjinTonic Positive surgical margins following radical prostatectomy The \"extent\" of a positive margin is usually measured in mm in your path report. It could influence a decision for adjuvant RT or early SRT. We should have a Forum contest: In 100 words or less, describe the sensation of having a Foley removed. Winner gets a helium-inflated Foley balloon. First, a question for you Djin... one that has always puzzled me. The surgeon who performed my RP stated that I had negative margins. But in the path report it stated that the largest extraprostatic extension was 6mm. My RO looking a the same path report (which I have around here somewhere) told me that there were actually three foci of EPE. I'm guessing that these were places where the cancer had broken thru the prostate capsule, but because it had not been cut away from external tissues (or something of that nature) that it was not considered a surgical margin. Note my tumor was at the base and had consumed 25% of my prostate, but not at the apex where most PSM's occur. So, is there a formal distinction between extraprostatic extension and positive surgical margin? Is PSM the invasion of extraprostatic tissue? (other than SVI I suppose) Second matter, I have only one way to describe the sensation of Foley removal: it tickled. I've had it done at least a half dozen times in my life, and can only say that it is far more scary than painful. It was not unlike hill hopping or rollercoaster airtime.",

      "Content": "Denis - you know me from several other boards. I'm not sure how much you remember about me, but as I recall I was your first reply to your first question in your first forum (but please correct me if I am wrong). Some guys are lucky, or as lucky as one can be when they have cancer. Their GP refers them to a Urologist because their PSA is elevated. A DRE finds something unusual with the prostate and their first biopsy reveals a low grade tumor, a G6 or perhaps G7(3+4). They are told they have cancer and then fret over treatment for a few months, undergo either surgery or one of the myriad forms of radiation, recover and then live happily ever after, and we never hear from them. I am not that guy. My GP started this and my Urologist whom I had been seeing for more than a decade dismissed my elevated PSA and said my DRE was normal. A year later it had doubled and I consented to a biopsy, which much to my dismay came back negative. I saw my urologist many times over the next few years and all he told me was that my PSA was sky high but that \"all your tests are negative\" and gave me more Cipro. We were in the process of retiring and moving to Florida and I did my best to manage my symptoms throughout the chaos and mayhem of vacating our home of 33 years and downsizing to a condo a thousand miles away. When my new GP in Florida asked about my PSA I told him the story, and when I later presented his findings to my Urologist he told me that he was going to quit practicing. Why is all this relevant? Because it is the exact opposite of your case. By the time anyone took me seriously my cancer had progressed to the level of being considered 'very high risk'. I did not have months or years to ponder what to do. Our furniture and possessions were divided between two states, work was under way on both homes and contracts had been signed. A new, more competent urologist ordered tests that should have been done years earlier. I looked into several forms of radiation and each would have required time commitments that were inconvenient at best if not impossible given our present situation, and would leave me in questionable condition following treatment. The surgeon said come back in two months and we can take it out and find out exactly what's going on in there. That was something I could work with. I drove a rental truck to Florida a month later and flew back home just four days before the surgery. The surgery itself went spectacularly well. Because my wife worked at the hospital I was treated like royalty. The recovery was uneventful. Within days the surgeon called and informed me that I would need radiation in about six months. So should I have chosen radiation in the first place? Well, it turns out, no. Even trying to get ART underway at the six month mark was impossible. Shortly after our move my wife developed non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and required hospitalization followed by months of treatments. Within days of her discharge from the hospital she required emergency eye surgery and needed to be driven to all appointments. It would have been extremely difficult to commit to daily radiation given all we were going thru. As it is, I nearly lost my sanity during that period. Others on this board can attest to my frazzled mental state last winter. Rarely does cancer allow us the option of leisurely choosing between so many options. Even in my wife's case we had to chose between immediate spinal surgery or proceed with a biopsy and wait for the results. And the decision had to be made within hours. There are and were no guarantees that one path would not lead to a complete disaster or to a full recovery. As you know, on that other message board there are those who believe that surgery is a brutal form of torture that should be outlawed and that any form of radiation therapy would yield a superior outcome. I was told by my surgeon that if I had been five years older, or had some health issues, or if my cancer had progressed just a bit further, that I would not be a candidate for surgery. Again, no time to sit and wait. Furthermore I did not like the idea of having this dead organ inside of me for the rest of my life, or that I might end up like several other men I've spoken with who had been left with serious bowel issues. And as far as I knew at the time, if the radiation failed to kill the cancer there were no other options but chemo. BTW, I should mention that my father, who I loved dearly, was a radiologist, or more specifically, what is today known as a radiation oncologist. If anything, I might be biased toward radiation, not against it. It's just that in my case, radiation was not a good fit. Heck, surgery barely fit at the time. And as it is, I've ended up getting almost as much radiation as I would have if I'd gone that way in the first place. But I have the assurance of knowing that a very good doctor was actually in there, knew exactly what he had taken out and what was left behind. It was not a smooth journey by any means, and I am still to this day fighting this disease tooth and nail. Your choices will be based upon your present situation and given the constraints within which you must navigate. You are the commander of this ship and where you end up will be the result of the decisions you make within the limitations of the knowledge you have to work with. In other words, it's pretty much like the life in general, but this time the stakes are higher. I still love to hear every doctor I've seen tell me \"you made the right decision\". At the time, there was no way to be sure.",

      "Content": "Yesterday was surgery number 15, and I'm pleased to say that everything went well. This was a revision of the septoplasty that I'd had last April but which left me with a collapsed nasal valve. So some bone was removed from my nasal cavity and a pair of implants were placed into either side of my nose to hold it open. Everything went well. I went in at noon and was home at 4PM and slept most of the rest of the day. After several dressing changes, the bleeding had stopped by 11PM last night. My nose is crusty and tender, but it's nothing like the original surgery last April, when I was stuffed up for several weeks. Once that had cleared up it became obvious that I wasn't breathing as I should. A lot of people, when I told them I was having a septoplasty for a deviated septum, they told me oh yeah I had that and it really helped. Well, that's just me and my luck. So this revision surgery had originally been scheduled fairly soon after, but then that mass was discovered in my abdomen. Everything had to be postponed to take care of that first. So as they say, \"it's another one for the record books\". I'm typing without my reading glasses as they hurt my nose (I had been warned about that beforehand). There appears to be no bruising, but have some ink marks on my nose. Anyone remember \"Nip Tuck\"? So I'm glad at least that my nose is open now and just have to sleep with my head elevated for a few nights. Next \"big\" surgery will hopefully be the total knee replacement that I was supposed to get back in 2015, but got prostate cancer instead. That damn cancer just gets in the way of everything!",

      "Content": "Frenchy, congrats on keeping the low PSA. I'm exactly one year behind you... one year since RP and presently just finishing RT. I'm surprised since you are T3b that they did not refer you immediately for ART and start you on HT. Also not using the uPSA. But it's the outcome that is important. I had to request a testosterone check at my last PSA, and will ask for one every three months now until after the HT wears off. The significance is that higher T-levels while you are undergoing treatment means the HT is not working... which I guess in your case probably doesn't apply. I've heard it said that following HT T-levels never return to their previous normal high.",

I am not that guy. My GP started this and my Urologist whom I had been seeing for more than a decade dismissed my elevated PSA and said my DRE was normal. A year later it had doubled and I consented to a biopsy, which much to my dismay came back negative. I saw my urologist many times over the next few years and all he told me was that my PSA was sky high but that \"all your tests are negative\" and gave me more Cipro. We were in the process of retiring and moving to Florida and I did my best to manage my symptoms throughout the chaos and mayhem of vacating our home of 33 years and downsizing to a condo a thousand miles away. When my new GP in Florida asked about my PSA I told him the story, and when I later presented his findings to my Urologist he told me that he was going to quit practicing. Why is all this relevant? Because it is the exact opposite of your case. By the time anyone took me seriously my cancer had progressed to the level of being considered 'very high risk'. I did not have months or years to ponder what to do. Our furniture and possessions were divided between two states, work was under way on both homes and contracts had been signed. A new, more competent urologist ordered tests that should have been done years earlier. I looked into several forms of radiation and each would have required time commitments that were inconvenient at best if not impossible given our present situation, and would leave me in questionable condition following treatment. The surgeon said come back in two months and we can take it out and find out exactly what's going on in there. That was something I could work with. I drove a rental truck to Florida a month later and flew back home just four days before the surgery. The surgery itself went spectacularly well. Because my wife worked at the hospital I was treated like royalty. The recovery was uneventful. Within days the surgeon called and informed me that I would need radiation in about six months. So should I have chosen radiation in the first place? Well, it turns out, no. Even trying to get ART underway at the six month mark was impossible. Shortly after our move my wife developed non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and required hospitalization followed by months of treatments. Within days of her discharge from the hospital she required emergency eye surgery and needed to be driven to all appointments. It would have been extremely difficult to commit to daily radiation given all we were going thru. As it is, I nearly lost my sanity during that period. Others on this board can attest to my frazzled mental state last winter. Rarely does cancer allow us the option of leisurely choosing between so many options. Even in my wife's case we had to chose between immediate spinal surgery or proceed with a biopsy and wait for the results. And the decision had to be made within hours. There are and were no guarantees that one path would not lead to a complete disaster or to a full recovery. As you know, on that other message board there are those who believe that surgery is a brutal form of torture that should be outlawed and that any form of radiation therapy would yield a superior outcome. I was told by my surgeon that if I had been five years older, or had some health issues, or if my cancer had progressed just a bit further, that I would not be a candidate for surgery. Again, no time to sit and wait. Furthermore I did not like the idea of having this dead organ inside of me for the rest of my life, or that I might end up like several other men I've spoken with who had been left with serious bowel issues. And as far as I knew at the time, if the radiation failed to kill the cancer there were no other options but chemo. BTW, I should mention that my father, who I loved dearly, was a radiologist, or more specifically, what is today known as a radiation oncologist. If anything, I might be biased toward radiation, not against it. It's just that in my case, radiation was not a good fit. Heck, surgery barely fit at the time. And as it is, I've ended up getting almost as much radiation as I would have if I'd gone that way in the first place. But I have the assurance of knowing that a very good doctor was actually in there, knew exactly what he had taken out and what was left behind. It was not a smooth journey by any means, and I am still to this day fighting this disease tooth and nail. Your choices will be based upon your present situation and given the constraints within which you must navigate. You are the commander of this ship and where you end up will be the result of the decisions you make within the limitations of the knowledge you have to work with. In other words, it's pretty much like the life in general, but this time the stakes are higher. I still love to hear every doctor I've seen tell me \"you made the right decision\". At the time, there was no way to be sure.",

I am generalizing here, but the difference between adjuvant and salvage radiation is not so much based on the time lapsed between RP and RT, but on known adverse pathology which was not resolved during surgery. Generally ART is planned to be performed as soon as possible following surgery, generally 3 to 6 months post-op, or as soon as sufficient healing and continence have returned. ** SRT - salvage radiation is prompted by a rise in PSA post op in response to possible biological recurrence (BR). This is generally determined by two consecutive rises in PSA and/or PSA rising above a threshold value, formerly 0.2 but more recently 0.03 ... Often SRT would be needed if there was positive surgical margin(s) which at the time of surgery \"may or may not\" lead to BR, as opposed to ART which is prompted by adverse pathology which is likely to lead to rising PSA immediately following surgery without a period of low PSA between RP and RT.

The tumor has 2 or more of these characteristics: Classified as T3a PSA level is higher than 20 ng/mL Gleason score is between 8 and 10 Very high risk. The tumor is classified as T3b or T4. The histologic grade is 5 for the main pattern of cell growth, or more than 4 biopsy cores have Gleason scores between 8 and 10. ** BTW in my case, I had been referring to my current radiation treatment as 'SRT' before I knew enough to figure out that it was actually ART. I was told immediately after surgery that I would need radiation at six months post-op due to the SVI. But at six months I was still near fully incontinent so was put on ADT to keep my PSA down until such time that continence could return. PSA rise was minimal, but the 12 month milestone was approaching. Why that was important is a different discussion. Anyway, my RT is referred to as \"delayed adjuvant\".",

You have a post-op followup and he would do periodic checkup's and any injections (HT) that may be deemed necessary. But your treatment would be directed by your RO. So ask you Uro for a referral to a RO (you should have gotten such a referral beforehand, prior to surgery, for consultation regarding alternatives to surgery).

      "Content": "The grade and extent of your father's cancer does indeed make surgery questionable, however there are advantages to removal followed by EBRT as opposed to merely radiating the entire prostate area, especially if your father already has problems with urination. You will find, especially online, many proponents - even zealots, of radiation as monotherapy and view surgery as brutal and barbaric. Often it turns out that these individuals have had only intermediate grade cancer and/or have not dealt with long term after effects of living with a toasted prostate. I personally had RP+RT+HT over the past two years. The prostate gland and surrounding tissues were removed and thoroughly examined in a pathology lab and the extent of disease was well known once the surgeon was finished. All three forms of therapy have had lasting after effects. The surgery left me incontinent and I required a prosthetic implant to proceed on with radiation. The adjuvant radiation left me with persistent bowel problems. And the hormone therapy is a \"gift that keeps on giving\" as for how it has impacted my life. But my PSA is now zero, I have no problems with voiding and my gastroenterologist says my next colonoscopy will be in seven years. My current urologist stated that high risk, high grade PCa patients who undergo the trifecta treatment protocol have the lowest incidence of recurrence compared to those men who had RP or RT (of any form) alone, with or without HT. Also please be aware that of the guys with G8-10 and stage T3a-b there is a 50% possibility that they would not have needed the adjuvant radiation, however given your father's advanced condition I do not believe he would be fortunate enough to get by without it. Additionally be aware that there are limitations to the accuracy of external scans regarding their ability to identify and locate the extent of spread until the disease has progressed much further. The only way to be sure that it stopped at the SV and capsule is to actually get in there. Some surgeons will likely even be unwilling to operate on a man your dad's age and condition, and radiation oncologists will likely give highly optimistic predictions for their own particular form of RT which they practice. Don't dismiss any possible options. Your father is only a few years older than me and has a slightly worse prognosis, but for me at least for now, prostate cancer appears to now be in the past.",

But at six months I was still near fully incontinent so was put on ADT to keep my PSA down until such time that continence could return. PSA rise was minimal, but the 12 month milestone was approaching. Why that was important is a different discussion. Anyway, my RT is referred to as \"delayed adjuvant\".",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by DjinTonic For Intermediate risk, did you mean G7 or G7-10? My pre-surgery PSA (correcting for Proscar by doubling) was <10. What risk group am I? Intermediate? I think I need post-surgery classification. Post-surgery one has the detailed path report and doesn't have to rely (only) on the biopsy. I'm hoping, despite the G9, my Uro will say I don't need ART and we can just monitor the PSA. The good and the bad in my case led me to ask my URO for the Decipher test. From what I've read, high G is included; that's my dilemma. DT - the table was copied directly from from the NCCN guidelines and I didn't add or subtract anything, but merely added emphasis for clarity. It is difficult to find such straightforward information now because these guidelines are currently in the process of being revised by committee (!) ... However, the 'higher' risk categories generally include \"G8-10\" and \"primary grade 5\" both of which your case meets. I can't really read any more 'into' the tables as your case is rather odd (as I'm sure you already know!) Here's a link to the complete guidance in PDF form. Pop open a beer and plan to spend the evening in your recliner. What you want is probably on pages 10-11. https://www.tri-kobe.org/nccn/guidel...h/prostate.pdf Originally Posted by rmotacek1 I was scheduled to have ART as soon as I could after RP because of my adverse pathology report (see signature). I didn't even question them because I was still kind of shell shocked from the whole cancer diagnosis. On one hand, I kind of wish I would have waited and watched my PSA levels first and maybe did more research on the pros & cons of ART. It wasn't cheap and I worry about the long term SE's. On the other hand, I think it was important to throw a one-two punch at my aggressive cancer. Anyway, I am playing the cards I was dealt. Now I just play the waiting game every six months and hope for the best. Rmotacek, you did the right thing imo. Looking at all the (+)'s in your sig, primary 4, secondary 5, 12 cores positive... if it didn't get you now, it would probably come back and bite you later. Glad to see your PSA is still dropping and your continence appears to be excellent. Well played!",

FWIW (and off topic for this thread) during the pre-op mtg with my Uro I dismissed any effort to \"nerve sparing\". The tumor was represented as being high grade and aggressive, and my only thoughts were getting it out, without regard to my future sex life.

Surgery is typically the logical choice in these cases, as stated by others, because if there is residual cancer after surgery then radiation can still be used to treat it (the converse is not true). I was originally scheduled to begin radiation next month, but it has now been postponed due to other complicating factors (long story... one being my wife of 35 years now also has cancer). I wish you and your husband good luck in the months ahead. He is probably not as scared as you are because he may already have a sense that this is serious but very treatable.",

There are a number of us on here who had RP's and had, are having, or will be having SRT, are currently on HT and have PSA's in the low >0 range. Plus, as pointed out, your SRT is still underway. Probably best to see what shakes out once that is over with. I'm guessing there's not much they can do about a little PSA once the prostate is out (it's not like they can go back in and take out the other one!) and doubtful that more RT would do any more good, especially soon after the first... other than extending HT, given that there is not already widespread systemic metastasis. How well have you handled the Lupron? I'm about 6-8 weeks in and have just had a few bouts of sweats and feel a little foggy in the brain, otherwise not much.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by garyi Other than what your RO said, did you have anything else to support continuing HT? I ask because I can\u2019t locate any citations about HT helping with the residual effects of post radiation treatment. No actual hard data, just an engineer's hunch as to how things work. The Uro who did my RP said 2-3 years was typical. Then my RO said the only relevant studies he relied upon were either six months or 24 months. Then there were the studies often referenced on HW showing little difference between 18 months and 24 months, and that 18 months was emerging as the new standard. Add to that the fact that I started Lupron eight months before starting the two months of RT, and it would last another two months afterwards (8+2+2=12) and adding another six months would bring me up to new standard of 18 months. I had already learned how to cope with the Lupron and figured I may as well go all in. I believe that starving the cancer cells an additional six months while they're dying from radiation exposure would only assist in their demise. And I suspect that if I quit HT at the first opportunity that some weakened cells might recover and come back to haunt me someday later on. And again, going off Lupron only to need to start again at some later date seemed counterproductive. As I said, throw everything at the beast while it's down for the count. There's nothing in all that I read or heard which said that I couldn't or shouldn't remain on HT for another six months, and as long as the doctor concurs, the insurance will pay for it. In other words, the decision was all mine... My fear now is, what happens when this finally wears off?",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by Gary e Been done with RP 2years ago... Done with radiation last month but have my 6th monthly firmagon injection coming up. I am beginning to hate firmagon as it makes me tired and gives me hot flashes. Gary, I suspect that your fatigue may be largely due to the residual affect of the SRT. Yes, HT does cause fatigue, but the last few weeks of radiation and a month or so afterwards also contributes to extreme fatigue. I'm well into my second year of HT now and the most difficult SE's have been brain fog, emotional volatility and the hot flashes/night sweats, in that order. I too take Venlafaxine (generic for Effexor) which has helped with the hot flashes and emotional instability, but the brain fox persists. No major financial blunders so far, but have done a few stupid things, can't remember names etc. Regarding the duration of adjuvant HT, I heard everything everything from nine months to three years. I could have opted to end HT a few months ago following the end of ART, but elected to go with an additional six month shot, which should start to wear off in July. My Uro says it will take a year for my testosterone to return and will never return to full level. My decision was based on current data indicating there is little difference between 18 months and 24 months of HT. But primarily it was because my RO told me that the residual effects of the adjuvant radiation would continue to kill cancer cells for an additional 8-9 months after the conclusion of RT. Doing some quick math I recognized that another six months of HT and then both the HT and RT would work together during that time. Our cases, yours and mine, are slightly different in that my ART was one year post-op and yours was two years. But neither of us reached undetectable status until after HT+RT. Yes, it's tough, and we don't get cut much slack by anyone because of it. Only those who have been on HT can appreciate it. Women think it's like menopause and we are getting testosterone shots like HRT. And most men don't realize just how dependent they are on testosterone for much of their drive and motivation. As you are looking for opinions, mine would be to throw everything at the beast now while you still can. Possibly having to go back on HT in the future may not be nearly as effective as it would be to just continue with it now. In the long run, it's only a few more months.",

      "Content": "IMO \"should be 0\" is a rather broad statement. There are a number of us on here who had RP's and had, are having, or will be having SRT, are currently on HT and have PSA's in the low >0 range. Plus, as pointed out, your SRT is still underway. Probably best to see what shakes out once that is over with. I'm guessing there's not much they can do about a little PSA once the prostate is out (it's not like they can go back in and take out the other one!) and doubtful that more RT would do any more good, especially soon after the first... other than extending HT, given that there is not already widespread systemic metastasis. How well have you handled the Lupron? I'm about 6-8 weeks in and have just had a few bouts of sweats and feel a little foggy in the brain, otherwise not much.",

She began chemo and radiation and was finally discharged the night of Dec 23rd, just the night before Christmas Eve. Then on December 28th she was rushed into emergency surgery. Quite the Christmas to remember! 2017 was a year full of treatments for both of us, following an even more eventful 2016. Here's hoping for a peaceful and HEALTHY 2018 for us all!",

The upside is that tumors located at the apex are more easily diagnosed being closer to the rectum. Tumors at the base are more difficult to locate because they sit directly beneath the bladder and away from the rectum. They cannot be felt by DRE and are more difficult to biopsy. There is a greater likelihood of bladder neck involvement and seminal vesicle invasion, but rarely (I think) leave a PSM as the tissues are distinct.",

      "Content": "In the Gleason score, the pathologist examines tissue samples from the prostate biopsy and identifies the most prevalent and predominant types of cancer cells in the samples and the second most predominant or in some cases the \"worst type\" but less predominant cells and adds the two numbers together. The cells are graded on a scale of one to five, with five being the worst. Grade 3 cells are the lowest grade that are considered to be cancerous. Grade 1 and 2 are not cancerous. Thus the most common cancers found in men who do have prostate cancer are: G6 (3+3), G7(3+4) also known as favorable G7, a worse G7 with the grade 4 more prevalent (4+3) or unfavorable, next is G8 which is usually (4+4) and G9 or G10 which have grade 5 cells as either the most predominant or next most or both... so 4+5, 5+4, and 5+5. Sounds confusing, but it is not really. A newer method of grading PCa still uses the Gleason grades, but combines the various Gleason scores into grade groups, from least to most severe... Grade Group 1: (3+3) Grade Group 2: (3+4) Grade Group 3: (4+3) Grade Group 4: (4+4) Grade Group 5: (4+5) and above.",

That's what it was supposed to do anyway, not necessarily the Eligard. The HT is intended to keep your PSA down between RP and SRT (or at least, that's how I understand it's supposed to work). Also tenderize the cancer cells so to speak.. it starves them of that tasty testosterone they love so much. It's a bit disappointing that some of the more knowledgeable guys haven't replied yet. Hopefully they will soon. If you could provide your exact pathology... margins, LNI, SVI or whatever, that might help.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by garyi Other than what your RO said, did you have anything else to support continuing HT? I ask because I can\u2019t locate any citations about HT helping with the residual effects of post radiation treatment. No actual hard data, just an engineer's hunch as to how things work. The Uro who did my RP said 2-3 years was typical. Then my RO said the only relevant studies he relied upon were either six months or 24 months. Then there were the studies often referenced on HW showing little difference between 18 months and 24 months, and that 18 months was emerging as the new standard. Add to that the fact that I started Lupron eight months before starting the two months of RT, and it would last another two months afterwards (8+2+2=12) and adding another six months would bring me up to new standard of 18 months. I had already learned how to cope with the Lupron and figured I may as well go all in. I believe that starving the cancer cells an additional six months while they're dying from radiation exposure would only assist in their demise. And I suspect that if I quit HT at the first opportunity that some weakened cells might recover and come back to haunt me someday later on. And again, going off Lupron only to need to start again at some later date seemed counterproductive. As I said, throw everything at the beast while it's down for the count. There's nothing in all that I read or heard which said that I couldn't or shouldn't remain on HT for another six months, and as long as the doctor concurs, the insurance will pay for it. In other words, the decision was all mine... My fear now is, what happens when this finally wears off?",

      "Content": "Personally I don't think you have much to worry about. Your numbers are low and this was caught early. Read through the bio's of some of the guys who post here and you will see +perineural invasion noted often. There are many other possible findings that are worse then PNI, but typically are associated with higher Gleason scores. There is a possibility that the final pathology may elevate your Gleason from 7 to either 8 or 9, and that does happen, but then some even have theirs lowered once the prostate has been removed and examined under a microscope. Your surgeon should tell you what you should be prepared for. Your greatest concerns now should be about the day of surgery and the week or two that follow. 99.99% the guys pull thru this without any complications. The soreness and immobility and the catheter are inconvenient and uncomfortable, but not very painful. If you've had major surgery before you may rank the RP fairly low on the scale, so to speak. Your surgeon has probably done this procedure many hundreds or possibly thousands of times and is likely well equipped to handle anything that may come up. You should have every reason to be confident of the outcome. Good luck!",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by Gary e Been done with RP 2years ago... Done with radiation last month but have my 6th monthly firmagon injection coming up. I am beginning to hate firmagon as it makes me tired and gives me hot flashes. Gary, I suspect that your fatigue may be largely due to the residual affect of the SRT. Yes, HT does cause fatigue, but the last few weeks of radiation and a month or so afterwards also contributes to extreme fatigue. I'm well into my second year of HT now and the most difficult SE's have been brain fog, emotional volatility and the hot flashes/night sweats, in that order. I too take Venlafaxine (generic for Effexor) which has helped with the hot flashes and emotional instability, but the brain fox persists. No major financial blunders so far, but have done a few stupid things, can't remember names etc. Regarding the duration of adjuvant HT, I heard everything everything from nine months to three years. I could have opted to end HT a few months ago following the end of ART, but elected to go with an additional six month shot, which should start to wear off in July. My Uro says it will take a year for my testosterone to return and will never return to full level. My decision was based on current data indicating there is little difference between 18 months and 24 months of HT. But primarily it was because my RO told me that the residual effects of the adjuvant radiation would continue to kill cancer cells for an additional 8-9 months after the conclusion of RT. Doing some quick math I recognized that another six months of HT and then both the HT and RT would work together during that time. Our cases, yours and mine, are slightly different in that my ART was one year post-op and yours was two years. But neither of us reached undetectable status until after HT+RT. Yes, it's tough, and we don't get cut much slack by anyone because of it. Only those who have been on HT can appreciate it. Women think it's like menopause and we are getting testosterone shots like HRT. And most men don't realize just how dependent they are on testosterone for much of their drive and motivation. As you are looking for opinions, mine would be to throw everything at the beast now while you still can. Possibly having to go back on HT in the future may not be nearly as effective as it would be to just continue with it now. In the long run, it's only a few more months.",

Also tenderize the cancer cells so to speak.. it starves them of that tasty testosterone they love so much. It's a bit disappointing that some of the more knowledgeable guys haven't replied yet.

      "Content": "Thanks Mike. After wading thru the gobbledygook, the following quite might be most significant for those guys who may be grappling with the decision whether or not to proceed with radiation after RP or waiting to see just what shakes out... When this literature is examined as a whole, it appears that ART patients generally have better outcomes compared to SRT patients. For example, ART study arms generally report lower rates of biochemical recurrence and metastatic recurrence than do SRT study arms at similar post-RP follow-up durations.",

      "Content": "Welcome to your sixties, our \"Golden years\" lol. I had been planning our retirement for years. There was a powerful urge to start taking SS at 62. Plus there were, and still are, people urging my wife to take it early saying \"do the math, you're throwing money away\" rather than listening to informed financial experts who say delay it as long as possible. Two responses I always use are \"that's not math, that's arithmetic\" (those who say do the math don't know the difference between the two) and I ask my wife if she would rather have $2000 a month now or $3000 a month in a few years. That usually makes sense to most sensible people. So the fact that we both have had cancer sort of altered our perceptions, but did not change the plan. Things got complicated though. The first biopsy (false negative, but my doc didn't share that info) was on my wife's insurance. Probably just as well. I turned 64 later that year and the plan began to solidify. We planned when to move our furniture to Florida and when to put our house on the market. The process took several years. I filed for SSRI three months before my 65th birthday, as it takes 90 days to process. The objective was for medicare premiums to come directly out of the SSA as that simplifies everything. If you do not already have an online acct at SSA.gov do so now. It will give you your projected payout for future years, and you can interpolate for the years in between. She and I both had to let our employers know in advance. For me that involved finding and training a replacement, as I was sort of a one man band where I worked. I started on that four years in advance. We knew what my wife would get on her pension and what our investments were/would be worth. I'm sure you have all that figured out as well. Once my medicare started things kicked into high gear. I had a new doctor in Florida who caused me to question my urologist's approach. Coincidentally he announced his retirement at our next and last meeting. I quickly had the MRI and fusion biopsy, bone scan, all that. Medicare paid for everything. We drove our last truckload of stuff to Florida, made arrangements for renovations to our new place and flew back north for my prostatectomy. Six weeks later our place sold and we drove our second car and most of the last of our stuff back to Florida. As I was on medicare and she is two years younger than me she went on Obamacare for a year, which was cheap but meant paying a HUGE deductible when she was diagnosed just a couple months later. Fortunately we had just sold a house. The delays with her chemo and my AUS and radiation caused for my Excel spreadsheet (\"the plan\") to grow extensively. Medical expenses grew much more than we had planned, but has worked out okay. Now she gets about the same monthly amount from her pension that I do from SSRI. Since our income is now very low, she is drawing down her taxable IRA as we delay starting her SSRI, which is still a couple years off (we've compromised on 68 rather than 70) but the plan is still working. Being in your line of work I'm sure you have a lot of this figured out already. Medicare is awesome. Now she has been on it for a year already but has not much needed it. OTOH I've had all this weird medical problems. I hate to be a burden on society, but then people like you and me and my wife have paid into it for most of our lives so it is \"supposed\" to be our money anyway, right? As you approach medicare age, you will get all kinds of junk mail from insurance companies. Do your research and choose wisely. Occasionally my wife will some back from one of her activities and tell me that someone told her that she should be taking spousal benefit from MY SSRI. All stuff I've already looked into, and I have to convince her to have faith in the plan. It's like a chronic backache. You recognize it when it pops back up again and know how to deal with it, but it's still annoying anyway. Good luck in the coming years. I've been meaning to call you and see how your AUS is working out. I won't bother trying to call anyone today, as I realize that it is a very special day for a lot of guys. Take care and TTYL.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by DavefromMD There is more to it than just the amount you get at what age. How long do you expect to live? There's your gamble. You will have to do this calculation for your situation and decide what is best for you. The final gamble is how long will you live. True. That's why I said our cancers changed our perspective but not our plan. The plan was created before either of us had cancer. We were retired and had moved. What would we do differently at that point? There are those who say to take the money now and spend it before you die. I still plan to live into my eighties and her into her nineties. And there will still be inflation during all those years. That's where $3000/mo looks a lot better than $2000. If one of us relapses and die within the 5-10 year window instead of the 10-20 year window, we're going to wish we'd taken our SS earlier? Perhaps. More likely we'll be thankful for the time we had together and glad that the survivor has an extra $1000 every month. And yeah, I've heard the \"take it now and invest it\", but there are not many investments that can guarantee 6.7%. And in most cases, you spend whatever you make. So if we can afford to live on a little less and still be happy, then we feel comfortable having the added cushion for our survivor.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by Chico Dave This summer, my PSA went up from 1.6 to 3.7. DRE was negative for any lumps... if I need a biopsy I would like to do what I can to assure it is as accurate as possible. My hunch is that Dr. Karpman's plan is a standard twelve core biopsy done in the office. I wish I had pursued my elevated PSA more aggressively four years ago. It was not until I retired and got a new primary care physician that he found two bumps during a DRE. I had been getting DRE's from my Uro for several years, plus what I understood to be a random biopsy which was 100% negative. My new PCP asked if I'd had an MRI associated with the biopsy and I said no. Returning to my Uro he said those bumps were \"concretions\". Note that all this time my PSA was going thru the roof. He recommended that I should be sure to drink plenty of water. It was not until he retired and his partner picked up my case that an MRI fusion biopsy was performed (like ten weeks ago) and everything accelerated rapidly from there. I suspect that if I had pursued treatment more aggressively when my PSA hit 9 that perhaps the PC might not have spread to the seminal vesicles and I might not be facing possible radiation treatment six months from now. Maybe I would have instead heard \"we got it all, you are cancer free\". So like I said, don't just take the word of your hot shot Hollywood uro. Shop around and ask LOTS of questions.",

      "Content": "Welcome to your sixties, our \"Golden years\" lol. I had been planning our retirement for years. There was a powerful urge to start taking SS at 62. Plus there were, and still are, people urging my wife to take it early saying \"do the math, you're throwing money away\" rather than listening to informed financial experts who say delay it as long as possible. Two responses I always use are \"that's not math, that's arithmetic\" (those who say do the math don't know the difference between the two) and I ask my wife if she would rather have $2000 a month now or $3000 a month in a few years. That usually makes sense to most sensible people. So the fact that we both have had cancer sort of altered our perceptions, but did not change the plan. Things got complicated though. The first biopsy (false negative, but my doc didn't share that info) was on my wife's insurance. Probably just as well. I turned 64 later that year and the plan began to solidify. We planned when to move our furniture to Florida and when to put our house on the market. The process took several years. I filed for SSRI three months before my 65th birthday, as it takes 90 days to process. The objective was for medicare premiums to come directly out of the SSA as that simplifies everything. If you do not already have an online acct at SSA.gov do so now. It will give you your projected payout for future years, and you can interpolate for the years in between. She and I both had to let our employers know in advance. For me that involved finding and training a replacement, as I was sort of a one man band where I worked. I started on that four years in advance. We knew what my wife would get on her pension and what our investments were/would be worth. I'm sure you have all that figured out as well. Once my medicare started things kicked into high gear. I had a new doctor in Florida who caused me to question my urologist's approach. Coincidentally he announced his retirement at our next and last meeting. I quickly had the MRI and fusion biopsy, bone scan, all that. Medicare paid for everything. We drove our last truckload of stuff to Florida, made arrangements for renovations to our new place and flew back north for my prostatectomy. Six weeks later our place sold and we drove our second car and most of the last of our stuff back to Florida. As I was on medicare and she is two years younger than me she went on Obamacare for a year, which was cheap but meant paying a HUGE deductible when she was diagnosed just a couple months later. Fortunately we had just sold a house. The delays with her chemo and my AUS and radiation caused for my Excel spreadsheet (\"the plan\") to grow extensively. Medical expenses grew much more than we had planned, but has worked out okay. Now she gets about the same monthly amount from her pension that I do from SSRI. Since our income is now very low, she is drawing down her taxable IRA as we delay starting her SSRI, which is still a couple years off (we've compromised on 68 rather than 70) but the plan is still working. Being in your line of work I'm sure you have a lot of this figured out already. Medicare is awesome. Now she has been on it for a year already but has not much needed it. OTOH I've had all this weird medical problems. I hate to be a burden on society, but then people like you and me and my wife have paid into it for most of our lives so it is \"supposed\" to be our money anyway, right? As you approach medicare age, you will get all kinds of junk mail from insurance companies. Do your research and choose wisely. Occasionally my wife will some back from one of her activities and tell me that someone told her that she should be taking spousal benefit from MY SSRI. All stuff I've already looked into, and I have to convince her to have faith in the plan. It's like a chronic backache. You recognize it when it pops back up again and know how to deal with it, but it's still annoying anyway. Good luck in the coming years. I've been meaning to call you and see how your AUS is working out. I won't bother trying to call anyone today, as I realize that it is a very special day for a lot of guys. Take care and TTYL.",

      "Content": "Thomas, it sounds like you truly have your head in the right place. Congratulations on your earlier battle with colon cancer and also on your recent prostatectomy. As you said, it appears \"clean\", though your prostate was quite large (I think our moderator Chuck still holds the record though). Admittedly, cancer becomes easier to face after the first time around. My wife and I are survivors and I have faced a couple other possible cancers... one scare about a year ago and another pending surgery right now. I too never read Gary's lengthy self pity post, though I must say that around 18 months ago I was deeply upset and in the pit of despair... and seem to be thru that now. For those so affected, it is very difficult to deal with. Seeing so many people affected by cancer it is hard to believe that only a relatively small percentage of people either have it or have had it. I think it's either 15% or 15 million... Lupron brain makes it hard to keep figures straight, and also makes me not really care anyway. But enough about me. Anyway, It appears that this one is for all intents and purposes behind you, other than the usual post-op stuff... regaining continence and dealing with what is usually a lengthy period of ED. You haven't mentioned nerve sparing, but one would assume that your surgeon was able to retain most of your nerve tissue. Good luck to you in the months and years ahead!",

      "Content": "I still use the buttoned diapers. Easy to change. Just unbutton the front, drop it down a little and slide a new one in. Pull the old one out and button up the new one. No need to drop trou any further than the knees. Then I roll up the old one and stuff it into a one quart zipper baggie. Each baggie can hold two. I carry the fresh diaper along with the extra pair of straps in the baggie until the first change. The brand I use is called Prevail. They are identical to the CVS generics but cost about 30% less from Amazon. I use the diaper once or twice a week to give myself a break from the cath and leg bag, as I am able to hold a full bladder as long as I am sitting or laying down (or sleeping). Usually about 8 diapers per day as they do not hold a lot. As far as the pad/briefs combo, yeah, I still have a closet shelf full of them. The trick is to tear off just the bottom of the strip of paper that covers the adhesive strip on the pad, then stick it to the bottom of the brief, then it doesn't tear off so much of the liner inside the brief. I've found you can get 3-4 pad changes before going with just the brief, padless. Briefs require that eventually you need to remove the trousers, which generally means removing the shoes as well. Major operation for a typical bathroom stall. Main problem I had with the briefs is perspiration. If I may mention it, Forum Brother Jamie developed jock itch from wearing briefs too long each day using the pad replacement approach. In the end I gave up entirely on the pad/brief approach as my leakage while on my feet is too voluminous for any absorbency product to accommodate. Even the belted diapers don't hold much. They appear to be made more for women (the blue strip is between your legs, not up front) even though the package claims that they are \"unisex\".",

Anyway, It appears that this one is for all intents and purposes behind you, other than the usual post-op stuff... regaining continence and dealing with what is usually a lengthy period of ED. You haven't mentioned nerve sparing, but one would assume that your surgeon was able to retain most of your nerve tissue. Good luck to you in the months and years ahead!",

You're another one who had normal DRE's and negative biopsies, only to be shot down when pathology revealed a far worse condition than the earlier tests had indicated. Now I know you're pretty much boxed in. I'm sorry to say it, but reading your story makes me realize just how fortunate I truly am. If there's a silver lining, that's it.

It was not until I retired and got a new primary care physician that he found two bumps during a DRE. I had been getting DRE's from my Uro for several years, plus what I understood to be a random biopsy which was 100% negative. My new PCP asked if I'd had an MRI associated with the biopsy and I said no. Returning to my Uro he said those bumps were \"concretions\". Note that all this time my PSA was going thru the roof. He recommended that I should be sure to drink plenty of water. It was not until he retired and his partner picked up my case that an MRI fusion biopsy was performed (like ten weeks ago) and everything accelerated rapidly from there. I suspect that if I had pursued treatment more aggressively when my PSA hit 9 that perhaps the PC might not have spread to the seminal vesicles and I might not be facing possible radiation treatment six months from now.

      "Content": "Originally Posted by DavefromMD There is more to it than just the amount you get at what age. How long do you expect to live? There's your gamble. You will have to do this calculation for your situation and decide what is best for you. The final gamble is how long will you live. True. That's why I said our cancers changed our perspective but not our plan. The plan was created before either of us had cancer. We were retired and had moved. What would we do differently at that point? There are those who say to take the money now and spend it before you die. I still plan to live into my eighties and her into her nineties. And there will still be inflation during all those years. That's where $3000/mo looks a lot better than $2000. If one of us relapses and die within the 5-10 year window instead of the 10-20 year window, we're going to wish we'd taken our SS earlier? Perhaps. More likely we'll be thankful for the time we had together and glad that the survivor has an extra $1000 every month. And yeah, I've heard the \"take it now and invest it\", but there are not many investments that can guarantee 6.7%. And in most cases, you spend whatever you make. So if we can afford to live on a little less and still be happy, then we feel comfortable having the added cushion for our survivor.",

      "Content": "Cpro, I had IMRT a year after RP. Actually I was told right after surgery that I would need adjuvant radiation in about six months but I had problems with continence. They usually prefer to allow 3-6 months before starting RT for everything to heal, as RT will also affect continence. Proton was available locally but as Southsider said is expensive and my insurance would not cover it. The machine used for my IMRT was the Varian Rapidarc. Details are in my sig below. Did your urologist mention anything about hormone therapy? And do you yet know your post-op PSA? These will be important factors. Studies have shown that ART (adjuvant radiation) administered within the first 21 months following surgery (yes, nearly two years) is more effective than waiting for PSA to cross some threshold, known as salvage radiation. The threshold for SRT was formerly 0.2 but more recently they have been using 0.03, though I believe they still use .02 as the threshold for BCR or biochemical recurrence. There are differing opinions over the need for ART in T3a cases with PSM and T3b with SVI. Some studies show as many as half might have comparable overall survival with or without post-op radiation, or something like that. Again, studies differ. I've never heard of proton therapy being used or even recommended for ART or SRT. In my case the IMRT left some persistent bowel disruption which will suposedly improve over the next year or two. But I am approaching two years since RP and my PSA is 0.00, though it is still artificially suppressed by ADT. I won't know for sure until sometime in 2020. Several other guys here have gone thru the same trifecta or RP, RT and HT and in some cases did not fare as well as I did. Good luck to you.",

      "Content": "I was in the same situation, and was told right after the RP that I would need radiation in about six months. My wife and I had a lot going on at the time, as my diagnosis occurred the summer that we had retired and were moving out of our house of 33 years and into a condo in Florida, a thousand miles away. I was going thru 10-12 pads a day. My new Uro in FL set me up with a kegel coach (therapist) and trained with an anal plug and monitoring equipment. She had me doing more and more kegels, but some others here and elsewhere say it is possible to over exert and actually strain the muscles involved. And as soon as we moved, my wife was diagnosed with lymphoma and needed to go thru six months of chemo. I was her driver and caregiver for that time. My RO put me on Lupron to halt progression of the cancer. He told me that most healing of incontinence occurs within 9 months of surgery. So at seven months I had to make a decision, for as you know, radiation requires that you hold a quart or so of water for a couple of hours. It was a very stressful time. I knew that getting the AUS would change something that I do all day, every day, for the rest of my life. I did extensive research, and questioned the surgeon about lifespan and revisions etc. He assured me that everything would be okay. The big day came and everything was a disaster. He had to replace it two weeks later. My carefully planned schedule was thrown way off. But ultimately I was able to get thru the two months of daily RT, despite numerous hurdles thrown before me. Please note that at that time, there was no one else here on this message board who'd had an AUS. I was in uncharted territory. But since then, I have corresponded with several other implant recipients and they all had the quick and uncomplicated procedure that I had been promised. So I guess it's just me that everything seems to go wrong for. I started a group on FB for AUS patients but so far there's only two of us there. But I can give you some resources if you are interested, you can PM me here. Good luck to you!",

      "Content": "Typically when there is adverse pathology identified during RP then RT is recommended at the six month mark to allow for adequate healing, or regaining sufficient continence to hold a full bladder, which is a requirement of RT. The apex of the prostate is more prone to result in positive surgical margins, as is the case with yours. If you are ready to go ahead with RT then I would say go for it. In my case it took a whole year of anguish and additional surgeries just to get to the point where I could do the RT. Men I've known who had +SM and SRT have done very well years later. You're right, sex isn't as important as is your own longevity. As I understand it, studies have shown that the PSA level before starting SRT is the most significant factor in affecting the outcome. It would make sense that starting RT before detectable PSA appears would be even better. If your PSA is still undetectable then it is unlikely that you would require hormone therapy.",

      "Content": "Greetings, Gentlemen. I learned of my PC just two months ago from my second biopsy in two years, but this was my first MRI biopsy. My PSA had risen from 4 to 9 then teens and finally 25, Gleason 8 (4+4), two cores 100% plus two 4+3 some lesser value but all localized to the lower right lobe... all others negative. Elected surgery as that would allow examination of surrounding tissue and at 65 I am relatively young and healthy. I just got home yesterday and fell asleep in the recliner, then had a fairly good night's sleep in my bed last night. Still a little loopy from the anesthesia and morphine. Just started passing gas this morning but still waiting for the big poo (yeah, I'm really full of it) and avoiding the percocet for that reason. Pathology report is due next Tuesday after the holiday, but I am optimistic as bone scan and blood work were negative. Fortunately I had joined this forum a month ago and read a few posts here, and they have been a big help. I bought one of those big orange Home Depot buckets and keep the overnight bag hooked in there with a few other accessories. This morning I experienced some leakage around the foley but the nurse confirmed by phone that this is likely due to a bladder spasm. Fortunately my wife of 35 years was a rehab nurse and has lots of catheter experience so I haven't had to do much hands on myself except emptying the bag this morning. Initially I had intended to post here pre-op but we've had a lot going on lately, as we both recently retired and are in the process of moving to Florida. We just got back last weekend for this surgery and put the house on the market. We left Florida just days before Hurricane Hermine. My Urologist had also retired in the meantime but his partner has done thousands of DaVinci's and so far everything has gone well. Everyone at the hospital was friendly and cheerful, and as some of the staff recognized my wife it seemed they had put me in the executive suite, so the first night was as quiet and restful as could be expected. Well that's about all I know for now. I will figure out this signature thing later. I hope everyone who lives here stateside has fun this Labor Day weekend. See you later!",

      "Content": "Typically when there is adverse pathology identified during RP then RT is recommended at the six month mark to allow for adequate healing, or regaining sufficient continence to hold a full bladder, which is a requirement of RT. The apex of the prostate is more prone to result in positive surgical margins, as is the case with yours. If you are ready to go ahead with RT then I would say go for it. In my case it took a whole year of anguish and additional surgeries just to get to the point where I could do the RT. Men I've known who had +SM and SRT have done very well years later. You're right, sex isn't as important as is your own longevity. As I understand it, studies have shown that the PSA level before starting SRT is the most significant factor in affecting the outcome. It would make sense that starting RT before detectable PSA appears would be even better. If your PSA is still undetectable then it is unlikely that you would require hormone therapy.",

      "Content": "You will definitely need to find a radiological oncologist, preferably one who specialized in prostate cancer exclusively. The urologist should be able to refer you to one. Your husband's travel schedule will likely be a problem as radiation is typically administered daily over a period of many weeks in a row. The RO may recommend hormone therapy as well. Your husband's diagnosis is indeed unfortunate, particularly such an advanced case... but in the vast majority of cases this is not a death sentence. You have obviously already done a good deal of homework and are familiar with much of the terminology. The surgical report and the final pathology report after the prostate has been examined under a microscope will provide invaluable information necessary to plan his treatment. Though I am not familiar with this particular variety of PCa (signet cell), I suspect that even with his high numbers he still has a good chance of surviving his prostate cancer, though it will be a very long road. Certainly there will soon be a number of additional replies to this thread from others, perhaps some who had a similar case. Good luck to both you and your husband!",

Yeah, we're great because your PSA and tumor location seems to be exactly like mine! I'll tell you, those two years when mine went from PSA=9 to 25 were years I would NOT want to re-live! Others are right... at your age (you are my late older brother's age) surgery is probably not recommended, however some radiation therapy could add years to your life. Given that your G7 breaks down as 3+4 indicates that there is grade 4 PCa growing in there (grade 3 already established). Yes, you have some time on your side, for now. I'd say go ahead and get this treated, and live long enough to die from something else. You do NOT want metastatic bone disease in your old age!",

We are all in the same boat - a boat we'd rather not be in, but a boat that floats and is better than being in the water. And we are in it together. We are praying for you, Jack.",

      "Content": "Greetings, Gentlemen. I learned of my PC just two months ago from my second biopsy in two years, but this was my first MRI biopsy. My PSA had risen from 4 to 9 then teens and finally 25, Gleason 8 (4+4), two cores 100% plus two 4+3 some lesser value but all localized to the lower right lobe... all others negative. Elected surgery as that would allow examination of surrounding tissue and at 65 I am relatively young and healthy. I just got home yesterday and fell asleep in the recliner, then had a fairly good night's sleep in my bed last night. Still a little loopy from the anesthesia and morphine. Just started passing gas this morning but still waiting for the big poo (yeah, I'm really full of it) and avoiding the percocet for that reason. Pathology report is due next Tuesday after the holiday, but I am optimistic as bone scan and blood work were negative. Fortunately I had joined this forum a month ago and read a few posts here, and they have been a big help. I bought one of those big orange Home Depot buckets and keep the overnight bag hooked in there with a few other accessories. This morning I experienced some leakage around the foley but the nurse confirmed by phone that this is likely due to a bladder spasm. Fortunately my wife of 35 years was a rehab nurse and has lots of catheter experience so I haven't had to do much hands on myself except emptying the bag this morning. Initially I had intended to post here pre-op but we've had a lot going on lately, as we both recently retired and are in the process of moving to Florida. We just got back last weekend for this surgery and put the house on the market. We left Florida just days before Hurricane Hermine. My Urologist had also retired in the meantime but his partner has done thousands of DaVinci's and so far everything has gone well. Everyone at the hospital was friendly and cheerful, and as some of the staff recognized my wife it seemed they had put me in the executive suite, so the first night was as quiet and restful as could be expected. Well that's about all I know for now. I will figure out this signature thing later. I hope everyone who lives here stateside has fun this Labor Day weekend. See you later!",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by Jack1954 ... lymp nodes and seminal V involvement. My gleason is now 10 as well. I was quite shocked with the outcomes however I have to accept the reality. Shocking news indeed. We don't see a lot of G10's here. Not to sound glib, but I thought I had it bad, until I read about you. But I am curious... You have likely had this growing in you for some time now... certainly longer than your first urinary issues were addressed just one year ago. Did you have any suspicions that there was something wrong? Maybe hoping it might go away, or too afraid to find out for sure? In my case, the trouble started three years ago, but all the preliminary tests were negative. Because there was a lot going on in my life during the second year - and a very poor emotional state (perhaps because there was an unknown cancer eating away inside me) I did nothing when it probably would have been the best time to pursue further investigation aggressively, and before it began to spread. Unfortunately, that is not how it happened, and now it has. I wish you luck. Admittedly this does not look good. But the good news is you are doing something about it now. This is going to be a tough road ahead, but you are over the first hurdle. There are a few other guys here who have had, or who like us are facing post op RT and/or HT. We are all in the same boat - a boat we'd rather not be in, but a boat that floats and is better than being in the water. And we are in it together. We are praying for you, Jack.",

      "Content": "A couple of factors to consider, based upon my own experience... 1) A TRUS biopsy has some risks associated with it. It involves the blind, random, unguided poking of needles thru your rectum and into your prostate in the hopes that one of the needles might bump into some portion of a tumor. Only about one third of the prostate can be sampled in this way... the bottom half up to almost halfway up to the bladder. A relatively large number of initial TRUS biopsies come back negative, even though there is cancer present in the prostate. In other words, the needles totally missed any of the tumors. 2) Most insurance companies require a negative TRUS biopsy before they will authorize a MRI, which is a safe, non-invasive and relatively inexpensive procedure. Such an MRI is able to pinpoint any tumors that may exist in prostate that are large enough to differentiate from normal healthy prostate tissue. If the MRI finds any problem areas, the image can be fused with the ultrasound in order to biopsy the tumors directly. Therefore a larger number of the samples would be likely to have cancerous tissue and fewer of the samples would come back negative. Why the insurance industry insists on subjecting men to a blind biopsy which carries with it a significant risk of introducing infection into the prostate before they will allow a safe and generally effective external scan is beyond me. I have questioned this practice here in this forum and in others at length in the past. Yet the practice persists. Furthermore, you seem to be in a better position to have your case taken seriously by a urologist than I was, because your DRE is suspicious... even though your PSA is very low. On the other hand, I had a steadily rising PSA plus persistent physical symptoms that were disrupting my sleep and such. Yet my urologist allowed my cancer to grow for several years without action, because my DRE's were in his words normal and the TRUS biopsy was negative. The blind TRUS biopsy is IMO useless... even if it comes back with cancerous tissue from that one-third of the prostate, it is quite possible that it retrieved one of the lower grade tumors and other high grade tumors were missed. I don't mean to scare you, but I believe there are more men walking around with untreated prostate cancer today because of the hysteria regarded reported \"overtreatment\" of men with low grade cancers during a period around ten years ago. Therefore urologists are reluctant to treat PCa's until there is overwhelming evidence that the cancer is spreading... which in many cases means it is already too late. I had trusted my urologist and had been seeing him for over a decade. He took my right testicle from me years earlier, which fortunately was benign. But when it came to my prostate, his unwillingness to act allowed me to postpone more aggressive pursuit of my condition... finding other doctors or investigating other procedures, such as you are doing now. If you are able to cancel this idiotic TRUS for now and look into other LEGITIMATE treatments (not alternative treatments) then please do so. This disease is potentially far more deadly than most in the general public are even able to comprehend. And good luck to you!",

      "Content": "You will definitely need to find a radiological oncologist, preferably one who specialized in prostate cancer exclusively. The urologist should be able to refer you to one. Your husband's travel schedule will likely be a problem as radiation is typically administered daily over a period of many weeks in a row. The RO may recommend hormone therapy as well. Your husband's diagnosis is indeed unfortunate, particularly such an advanced case... but in the vast majority of cases this is not a death sentence. You have obviously already done a good deal of homework and are familiar with much of the terminology. The surgical report and the final pathology report after the prostate has been examined under a microscope will provide invaluable information necessary to plan his treatment. Though I am not familiar with this particular variety of PCa (signet cell), I suspect that even with his high numbers he still has a good chance of surviving his prostate cancer, though it will be a very long road. Certainly there will soon be a number of additional replies to this thread from others, perhaps some who had a similar case. Good luck to both you and your husband!",

      "Content": "I'll try to tell you what I can, but understand that this is only speculation based on what you have presented here, and is not intended as any form of medical advice. The biopsy is the ONLY way to know if (!) it is cancer, and if so how bad. But the very high PSA level and the appearance of either lymph node involvement or bone involvement makes it not look good. There is a slight possibility that his cancer is still contained in the area of his pelvis, which is good for possible radiation treatment. Prostate cancer - even aggressive PCa, is very slow growing and generally chemotherapy is not the first line approach, because the prostate has very little blood supply and the chemo just isn't delivered effectively. Perhaps the chemo mentioned is actually hormone therapy... an injection and/or pills that are very commonly used for advanced PCa. If indeed it has spread to his bones, whether to his spine or pelvis, he will probably be on hormone therapy (ADT) for the rest of his life. If he is a candidate for radiation he may be on HT for a couple months beforehand to weaken the cancer, and then once the radiation is complete, then the chemotherapy (likely docetaxel) is started to deliver the final blow to the cancer. That's pretty much it as far as first line treatments are involved. There are newer forms of HT that can be administered in addition to or as follow up to first line HT, and some additional therapies for those who have not responded well to the first line. He is likely not a candidate for surgery, so if the biopsy is inconclusive there won't be much to work with. I am not telling you this from experience, but I personally came very close to going down the path of your husband. My PSA rose and my cancer progressed for four years before I changed doctors and finally was given an MRI which found my tumor... which was hidden away up under my bladder. I was staged at 3B, which is just before stage 4 which involves metastasis and lymphatic involvement. There are various \"grades\" of advanced prostate cancer, such as he may be \"T3bN1\" if it is still in his prostate bed, has invaded some lymph nodes but has not metastasized into his bones. From there it only gets worse. I don't mean to be the deliverer of doom and gloom, but you should probably be prepared for some tough times ahead.

      "Content": "A couple months back I asked here in this forum the difference between adjuvant and salvage therapy. Today I stumbled upon the answer... Adjuvant treatment is defined as RT or HT given within 90 days after RP while salvage treatment is given post-operatively after 90 days. This according to an article on the ncbi.nlm.nih.gov website. The full article can be read here: Role of Surgery in locally advanced prostate cancer. The article targets patients who were what I will refer to as \"RP candidates\"... typically those whose Gleason was high enough to justify surgery but less than G9/10 whose clinical stage proscribed RP due to its potential to spread the disease. In general this would be those who were not elevated from a G6/7 by post-op pathology, and extending to those with extraprostatic extension but short of lymphatic involvement. Locally advanced prostate cancer is the one extending beyond the prostate capsule with invasion of peri-capsular tissue, apex, bladder neck or seminal vesicles but without any lymph node involvement or distant metastasis (i.e. T3-T4, N0, M0 disease). Nearly 20-25% of cases present as locally advanced disease. These patients are at increased risk of prostate specific antigen (PSA) failure, metastatic progression and cancer specific death. This definition can be interchangeably used with the high risk prostate cancer. The article is dated 2015 and is from the Pakistan Journal of Medical Science. There is a lot of good information here regarding adjuvant and salvage therapies, which would be of specific interest to those who are or might eventually be in a situation similar to my own. There is still so much that I am learning \"by the seat of my pants\" so to speak, but just this morning I remarked to my wife about just how extensively our vocabularies have expanded in only four months, from a time when we had never even heard of RCHOP or Lupron.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by Nicole8 Hi, I am writing to get some advice about my father. He is 83 and a retired dr. Nicole - I cannot answer regarding the practicality of a biopsy while on HT, but I understand as Southsider mentioned that HT affects the prostate cells and causes them to shrink. I am wondering how much of his story you know first hand or is this only what your father has told you. You may be hearing only partial facts and some fabrication to save face. Doctors tend to be very secretive and even deceptive about their own health. My father was also a physician and never told anyone in my family about his illnesses and apparently was self medicating until his death. The only thing he told us was that he did not want to die in a hospital. He did in fact pass away at home in his own bed. If I may say, what I suspect is that your father wants to leave this world gracefully. At 83 he might have another decade at most, and a decade possibly filled with pain and suffering. With a PSA of 32 there is a good chance that his prostate cancer has at least become locally advanced (stage 3) and possibly on the verge of lymphatic involvement or bone metastasis. Within the \"secret society\" of physicians, doctors can be brutally honest with one another, and understanding how similar cases may progress, decide to allow himself to succumb to this disease rather than survive long enough only to battle some other possibly less dignified condition. Regarding scans, if there is distant metastasis, there is a minimum size that can be detected by even the most sensitive scans. And if there are distant mets, then what? Chemo? And how much time would that buy for him? Of course you love your father, and you do not want him to go. Please forgive me for being blunt or insensitive here, but he may be telling you only a cover story to spare himself some pain and spare you and the rest of his family from enduring watching him suffer. The six month HT shot may be enough to relieve some of his own symptoms, which he may be hiding from you, and preventing the cancer from progressing further until he can prepare himself and you for his inevitable departure.",

      "Content": "Infection is indeed a serious possible side effect of TRUS biopsies. I think it happens to one in twenty patients. But your PSA is above 10, which is the level where you should be concerned. It would probably be a good idea to get an MRI if possible to see if there are any abnormalities in your prostate. Waiting for your PSA to double would not be wise, but if you have it checked again in a few weeks it may have not risen any further or perhaps only slightly. I was hesitant to go for a second \"blind\" biopsy after my experience with the first one. My GP requested an MRI and I was fortunate that it found my tumor. My experience has also been that DRE's are unreliable in detecting PCa.",

      "Content": "Infection is indeed a serious possible side effect of TRUS biopsies. I think it happens to one in twenty patients. But your PSA is above 10, which is the level where you should be concerned. It would probably be a good idea to get an MRI if possible to see if there are any abnormalities in your prostate. Waiting for your PSA to double would not be wise, but if you have it checked again in a few weeks it may have not risen any further or perhaps only slightly. I was hesitant to go for a second \"blind\" biopsy after my experience with the first one. My GP requested an MRI and I was fortunate that it found my tumor. My experience has also been that DRE's are unreliable in detecting PCa.",

      "Content": "I'm just throwing this out there, but you may actually have another condition, and possibly cancer, which is NOT prostate cancer. My wife had severe back, neck and hip pains and it was only discovered by an MRI that there is a tumor on her spine. Further scans revealed tumors in her pelvis and skull. Her diagnosis of lymphoma could only be confirmed by taking a biopsy from one of the tumors and several days of lab analysis. I don't mean to scare you, but there are so many things that could cause the symptoms you've described that nothing can truly be ruled out without extensive testing, which often means one or more biopsies (I get biopsies for another condition every two years. just to determine that it has not progressed). If your pain is severe enough to affect your quality of life, do not give up until you have discovered the cause. Good luck!",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by MichiganMan16 ... the last thing I want to do is come across as complaining or whining... Oh, come on John. Everyone here knows you never complain about anything... honest! If there truly is a silver lining here at cancer forums, it has to be you. This disease has forever changed my life. Honestly, it's been quite depressing. And here all this time I thought that I was the only one! I wish I would have never had the surgery. I would have been much better off with RT and ADT... It has been a unmitigated disaster. I'm not knowledgeable on RT, but it seems to me to be a shotgun approach. Just irradiate everything and hope to fry the tumor. Plus there's no post-op dissection. I see it as little more than educated guesswork. Then of course, there are no do-overs. And when guys come back years later with rising PSA's after RT, what is there left to do? No, I never second guess the RP decision. There's a lot of things I would do differently, but given that my (our) PCa was already growing by leaps and bounds, it was either cut it out or \"watchfully wait\" until it spread to the bones. Besides, once it's done, it's done. Can't go back and change it anyway. Maybe just use what we have learned to give guidance to others who come after us who may be in a similar situation.",

Yesterday in the waiting room at my Uro's office there was an information video playing on their TV screen showing an animation of a non-invasive surgical treatment for enlarged prostate that basically involved putting two pairs of \"clips\" thru the prostate on either side of the urethra. I don't recall the name, but these clips look like those annoying little plastic T's that hold the price tag on you new clothes. The T's squeeze the walls of the prostate together, thereby widening the opening for the urethra.",

Everyone here knows you never complain about anything... honest! If there truly is a silver lining here at cancer forums, it has to be you. This disease has forever changed my life. Honestly, it's been quite depressing. And here all this time I thought that I was the only one! I wish I would have never had the surgery. I would have been much better off with RT and ADT... It has been a unmitigated disaster. I'm not knowledgeable on RT, but it seems to me to be a shotgun approach. Just irradiate everything and hope to fry the tumor. Plus there's no post-op dissection. I see it as little more than educated guesswork. Then of course, there are no do-overs. And when guys come back years later with rising PSA's after RT, what is there left to do? No, I never second guess the RP decision. There's a lot of things I would do differently, but given that my (our) PCa was already growing by leaps and bounds, it was either cut it out or \"watchfully wait\" until it spread to the bones. Besides, once it's done, it's done. Can't go back and change it anyway. Maybe just use what we have learned to give guidance to others who come after us who may be in a similar situation.",

      "Content": "I'm just throwing this out there, but you may actually have another condition, and possibly cancer, which is NOT prostate cancer. My wife had severe back, neck and hip pains and it was only discovered by an MRI that there is a tumor on her spine. Further scans revealed tumors in her pelvis and skull. Her diagnosis of lymphoma could only be confirmed by taking a biopsy from one of the tumors and several days of lab analysis. I don't mean to scare you, but there are so many things that could cause the symptoms you've described that nothing can truly be ruled out without extensive testing, which often means one or more biopsies (I get biopsies for another condition every two years. just to determine that it has not progressed). If your pain is severe enough to affect your quality of life, do not give up until you have discovered the cause. Good luck!",

July we are back to our \"Cancer Couple\" grind. Lori sees her eye doctor (she'd had emergency surgery immediately after her discharge last December) and then her Hemo-Oncologist for a three month blood workup. I'm having a colonoscopy two years early, as radiation will change the texture of any abdominal tissues... so getting that out of the way now. Then I get my next six month Lupron shot, and the artificial sphincter will be activated - \"turned on\". The tissues surrounding the implant must be fully healed before the device is allowed to operate. Then I see my RO near the end of July to setup our radiation schedule. He goes on vacation in early August, so we are taking a week at the beach Aug 6-12 before starting SRT the following week, assuming the AUS functions properly in the interim. Hopefully RT will all be done by mid October, then Lori is due for her next CT scan. The Lupron will stay with me thru the end of this year. I need to ask the RO if he will want me to continue on it into and throughout next year as well. Then the \"big wait\" to see where the PSA stabilizes (hopefully). PS - as I was typing this the doorbell rang. It was UPS delivering the case of diapers. BTW good luck with your RALP this month. When is the big day?",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by Pat m At my yearly physical my psa went from 2 to 13. I had a biopsy 3 weeks ago showing 2out of 16 with a Gleason 4+5 =9 Bone and CT negative. My doctor is great but seems to think there'll be more treatment after surgery. I asked about an MRI but it'll put treatment off for a couple of months. Appreciate any advice. Pat- You appear to have a high risk case IMO. G9 is serious (though yours is better than 5+4 would be). An MRI would help identify the location and nature of the tumor, but your biopsy has already done that. Note that you will be required to wait another month (about) before your surgery. Typically Uro's like 6-8 weeks healing between BX and RP. Don't delay any longer than is necessary. Your G9 and PSA >10 could indicate extraprostatic extension is already present (cannot be confirmed until after surgery) which would call for post surgical radiation and possibly hormone therapy. I'd say you caught this just in time.",

      "Content": "I just noticed this thread this morning. Guess I must have been busy that day. My choice of surgery was primarily made due to my particular set of circumstances. We were selling our Ohio home and had for the most part already moved to Florida. Contracts had been signed. Winter was coming. In the end I had surgery plus two months of radiation (and HT to boot). How does that fit into the FB groups? Sorry, I only keep a FB account so a few people can contact me, nothing more. It's cute but it all seems to be a waste of time and terribly complicated for someone who already has Lupron brain. I suppose the one thing that \"gets me\" most is that in radiation groups, people refer to HT plus two types of radiation as the triple play. I guess those of us who have had a \"true\" triple play are stuck with the term trifecta. Another is the guys who proclaim that it's time to make a decision, or a choice... and what they're deciding is which form of radiation. Granted, I realize that for some guys, surgery is already out due to age or health. It's sort of like \"your choice of desserts\" really means what kind of pie do you want. In a way I am a bit envious of the guys who actually had the luxury of time to make a leisurely choice between a variety of options... even \"maybe I'll get treated, and maybe I won't\". We are all of us in different situations and there are a variety of external as well as internal factors that influence our decisions. I've worked directly with a number of CEO's and COO, and they have the gift of making quick decisions and just going with them. I think the choices over which I agonized the most were those where I had months to consider what to do, and still ended up later recognizing that I could have done something differently. But isn't that just life?",

Pat- You appear to have a high risk case IMO. G9 is serious (though yours is better than 5+4 would be). An MRI would help identify the location and nature of the tumor, but your biopsy has already done that. Note that you will be required to wait another month (about) before your surgery. Typically Uro's like 6-8 weeks healing between BX and RP. Don't delay any longer than is necessary. Your G9 and PSA >10 could indicate extraprostatic extension is already present (cannot be confirmed until after surgery) which would call for post surgical radiation and possibly hormone therapy.

Everyone here knows you never complain about anything... honest! If there truly is a silver lining here at cancer forums, it has to be you. This disease has forever changed my life. Honestly, it's been quite depressing. And here all this time I thought that I was the only one! I wish I would have never had the surgery. I would have been much better off with RT and ADT... It has been a unmitigated disaster. I'm not knowledgeable on RT, but it seems to me to be a shotgun approach. Just irradiate everything and hope to fry the tumor. Plus there's no post-op dissection. I see it as little more than educated guesswork. Then of course, there are no do-overs. And when guys come back years later with rising PSA's after RT, what is there left to do? No, I never second guess the RP decision. There's a lot of things I would do differently, but given that my (our) PCa was already growing by leaps and bounds, it was either cut it out or \"watchfully wait\" until it spread to the bones. Besides, once it's done, it's done. Can't go back and change it anyway. Maybe just use what we have learned to give guidance to others who come after us who may be in a similar situation.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by Michael F What are your thoughts about heading up to Tampa to Moffitt Cancer Center? It is an NCI Designated Cancer Center. You will have the option of being in their expert care ... I spent a week at Moffitt last month (not inpatient, but was there every day) and it is a well run operation. Everyone was very friendly and efficient from the start, willing to listen and informed me what was going on. Ultimately the tests provided no new information other than confirming that whatever it is growing in me it has to come out. When I asked if there would be any advantage to having the surgery there, the doctor said that if I have a surgeon whom I trust that I should have it done locally (which I am, next Monday). If I had this to do all over again, I'm not sure I would start there, but would at least have them involved, as I did this time. Given that it is less than an hour away from us it was worth the drive... but we did stay in a nearby motel for a couple of nights, for our convenience and to avoid morning rush hour traffic for those NPO early morning tests. Good luck to you Gene!",

      "Content": "My two cents, I think that you do have reason to be concerned... but it is unlikely that anything could be done now, at this point. Your PSA is definitely rising. If this continues, it will eventually cross some arbitrary tipping point. For me, it was PSA=4. My GP sent me to see a Uro after my PSA went from 2 - 2.5 - 3 - 3.5 and eventually 4.0 over a number of years... and I do mean years, like between from 50 to 60. My Uro, whom I had been seeing for prostate infections and such for probably 20 years, said he is not alarmed by rising PSA, but by any sudden spike in PSA. He did a digital (which as much as it is the brunt of many jokes, isn't really all that bad if your Dr is gentle). All was normal. Fast forward one year later, my PSA jumped to 9.5 ... I was put on Cipro but it kept rising. Then I underwent the biopsy. It was negative. When asked what do we do next, my Uro said another biopsy. Now, the problem with a series of negative tests is that it leads one to believe that there is nothing wrong. But I kept experiencing what lets call \"symptoms\". I was not anxious to undergo another biopsy. Other issues/life problems took priority and that second biopsy got put off until two years later, when it was discovered that yes it is cancer and it has spread. I guess my point is, whatever happens, don't be mislead into believing that your rising PSA means nothing. If it continues to rise, and your Dr seems to dismiss it, get someone else involved. Be concerned. Be aggressive. BTW I agree with the remark by forum brother 'Another' that a younger urologist will have the advantage of still being alive when you will probably need him the most.",

Might have taken multiple biopsies to catch the aggressive stuff due in part to the long, skinny shape it had. We all like to have our decisions validated, so I'm taking that as a big positive for me. Congrats on pulling thru the surgery and getting past that BP problem. I chose RP over radiation for expediency (we were right in the middle of moving 1000 miles away) but the results afterwards reassured me that it was the right decision. Like you, my tumor was somewhat \"hidden\" and what appeared on the MRI to be close to the capsule turned out to be thru the wall and into the nerves and vesicles.

      "Content": "Originally Posted by Sabertex36 LVI is positive. LVI is indeed serious, so is bladder neck invasion. Maybe MM will chime in here on LVI. Waiting six months post-op for healing is customary. My PSA was tested by uPSA every five weeks during that period. Adjuvant RT was recommended as soon as my path report came in, and my RO started ADT after four months. By seven months post-op I was faced with the decision whether or not to get an artificial sphincter implant - two more surgeries which required additional healing - so that I could proceed with radiation. Before RT my PSA rose from a tiny <.02 to .03 (no \"<\"). Small as that may seem, it was enough to indicate a rise and therefore the presence of residual prostate cells. With .03 being the \"new\" cutoff for BCR, I am glad the HT was started before the rise was confirmed. My point being that you want to hit the cancer with everything you can as early as you can. You won't get a chance to go back for a do-over. Many of us who end up in a forum such as this do so because we did not end up being the fortunate ones who got it all the first time. We tend to be the more complicated cases... those who did not get the lucky breaks or for whom things didn't go quite as well as might have been expected. Good luck going forward!",

      "Content": "Well the vacation is almost over. Following the first implant surgery I couldn't pee for two weeks. I had a Foley the whole time, which made it difficult to sleep (most of us have been there). Then one week ago I had emergency surgery to revise the AUS. Following that surgery I was surprised to find that my diaper was usually dry. I had lost some bladder capacity during the two weeks with the Foley, but at least I could feel the urge and could hold it long enough to make it to the bathroom. Usually the inside of my diaper was maybe just a little moist from perspiration, or sometimes a little discoloration up front. I mentioned this to the urologist and he said this newfound continence was probably just due to swelling from the surgery. I said let me enjoy it while I can. Then a couple nights ago I noticed I dripped a few times after getting out of the shower. Starting today my pad is routinely soaked, so I ordered another case of diapers. Soon the swelling will have subsided enough that I will be able to back to the condom caths and leg bag. Well, it was fun while it lasted.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by Pratoman I don't understand, though, isn't it expected that you'll be incontinent until the sling is activated? Yes. The AUS implant surgery must be fully healed before the device is turned on.** Until that time, I will remain incontinent. I had a brief period this past week of \"fake\" continence because swelling from the surgery was squeezing my urethra, making it difficult to urinate. BTW the Sling and AUS are different devices, though both are made by the same company. The Sling is a mesh cradle for the bladder that relieves pressure from the natural sphincter. The AUS is actually a tiny hydraulic system with a pump, fluid reservoir and expandable cuff. ** I think I posted on that other message board under \"AUS saga continues\" that the day of the initial implant surgery, when I was unable to urinate, the surgeon had to manipulate my swollen scrotum while I was awake to check that the device had not been accidentally activated. That was an \"8\" on the pain scale!",

      "Content": "Welcome to the forum Shanis and it is good to see that you have agreed to throw everything possible at your cancer. I've heard that early docetaxel is far more effective as opposed to reserving it as a last resort, which used to be the norm. And congratulations on your rapid decline in PSA. But most likely it is not yet due solely to the Lupron. Stats I've seen indicate that it takes four weeks for the Lupron depot to reduce testosterone to the <50 level required for maximum effectiveness. Starting you on Casodex in advance was also a wise move. Has spot radiation been mentioned for your mets and nodes? To facilitate other responses here you may want to complete your \"signature\" page as outlined in one of the sticky posts at the top of the forum page. Basically you go into \"settings\" at the top of your screen and click on \"signature\" on the left. Then simply enter your dates and values regarding your diagnosis and treatment so far.

      "Content": "Originally Posted by Another I never understood the overtreatment mantra. I think it is linked to the other myth you will die of something else before you die of PC. As life expectancy increases and the cancer expands to more and younger men and more aggressive forms public perception will change. I think social stigma also plays a role. Men are reluctant to accept the responsibility for the disease, will not discuss it, and practice denial and delay which feeds complaint and bitterness over the natural outcome of delayed detection and treatment. The denial and delay syndrome is driven by men themselves not stepping up and taking responsibility for their health. It's easy to \"blame the victim. My treatment was delayed because my urologist downplayed the significance of my steadily rising PSA, and seemed to be unaware of my family history. Yes, he told me that my PSA was high, but my GP has always told me that my LDL and triglycerides are high. Neither of these last two have tried to kill me, yet. My urologist never even mentioned the word cancer. How was I to know? I expected him to be the expert on the subject. When I went along with the biopsy... no minor procedure... he only told me that it was negative. He just gave me more and more antibiotics. It is hard for me to not feel resentful of the way I was treated... or more precisely, NOT treated. And it makes my blood boil every time I read someone talking about \"overtreatment\". Yes, I understand what happened, to SOME men. But that's no reason to throw out the baby with the bathwater. It wasn't until I changed doctors and asked my Uro several very pointed questions that he dropped me like a hot potato. I only wish it had happened two years earlier. The \"lucky\" men who received treatment when their cancer was only a G6 or G7 should consider themselves very fortunate. The alternative could have been to end up with an artificial sphincter and pelvic radiation disease, all because some gov't panel scared a doctor into downplaying PSA screening. Yes, it is so much easier to simply blame the patient for trusting his doctor.",

You will need to decide the \"When\" & \"What.\" The questions to consider is: \"Will this violate the capsule and when?\" & \"What happens if the capsule is violated?\" Probably more a matter of when rather than if. Granted, 7 is borderline intervention stage, but my experience is the Gleason tends to be elevated with time rather than lowered. If there is a tumor it will spread. The question is, when is a good time to stop it in its tracks? It won't get better on its own.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by redbelly7 I will be meeting w/ radiology on the 30th and will probably start radiation mid Sept. Right now, I am incontinent. I can hold some, but if I walk, bend, etc, I leak. The Dr gave me a foam clamp to wear during radiation, so I can keep something in my bladder to protect it. I am planning to start PT for kegels soon. Since I've already had a RP, is there anything that I can do to protect my colon and rectum? What should I be looking for during the process? I'm planning on having radiation and go back to work. Uh, this is something your RO should be doing for you! I started RT a week ago (for SVI) and have jumped thru all kinds of hoops since January getting ready for this. Two of the most common methods to minimize bowel and bladder toxicity are a rectal balloon and a requirement to hold a full bladder. I asked my RO twice about the balloon and he says half of RO's use it, and half do not. He does not. But he does require that patients be able to hold a full quart of water (32 oz) while under the zapper. Also be aware that what little continence you may have now will likely be diminished after RT. I've heard this from several guys. They had decent continence going into RT but came out with little remaining. In my case, it required an AUS implant, which ideally should be implanted before radiation begins. Like many other surgical procedures, it becomes more complicated when performed on irradiated tissues. I would suggest that you ask your RO about these topics, and I suspect that other bro's here would say the same. Good luck, especially with that clamp. I tried it, didn't work for me.",

      "Content": "Mike - Your T3B/SVI automatically qualifies your for ART. I had 70Gy IMRT using the Varian RapidArc like Chester, but as MF points out, your PSA is essentially undetectable. However, your primary grade 4 component of your G7 plus the bladder neck involvement tips the scale back toward ART. The fact that you seem to be fully continent is another green flag. I'd say talk with a RO who is not promoting Proton. PB is a high priced option that I believe is aimed at intermediate risk patients. It is more accurate at delivering targeted primary radiation to known tumors. You should probably have your entire prostate bed flooded with radiation to wipe out any escaped cancer cells in the area of the SV and bladder neck before they take advantage of the opportunity for systemic spread. It's a bit of a crap shoot. I think the stats show it's 50/50 whether you would ever have BCR without having ART. But it is my belief to zap everything while it's still localized. There are some drawbacks to getting radiation, but if there's a chance you might need it later on, you'd be better of getting it now. Good luck, and best regards to your lovely wife.",

Around noon we were told the surgeon would be delayed about an hour, so I sent my wife home. I remember they finally wheeled me into the OR at 2PM. Next thing I remember was being wheeled into a room where my wife was waiting at 6PM. The day finally ended after 8PM with the Dr inserting a Foley cath. What happened in the meantime? I suspect that I was \"out\" much longer than expected. I do remember someone telling me \"you don't remember because of the drugs we gave you\". Well if such drugs exist then I want some NOW because my head keeps going back to that day. Today I had my first followup. The Foley was out briefly, then went back in for another week. I'm still pretty beat up but am gradually returning to normal. I have to keep reminding myself that I am doing this not to be pad free but so I can start radiation before the cancer spreads any further. Looking forward to rejoining the group here...",

I keep bumping into it myself. The settings screen flashes a message about 1000 characters, but I don't believe my sig is longer than that. I've had to remove a lot of bold highlighting and eliminate some duplicate stats to fit in the important new developments. It looks like you use a lot of bolding as well as duplication of terminology such as %free PSAD and spelling out months. With a few tricks you should be able to fit it what need to convey here. It's curious, I see some sigs here that take up a full page. I wonder how they got around the character limit.",

      "Content": "I do know of the Duet catheter. It has an upper balloon to prevent the tip from poking the top of the bladder. It is new, so I suspect that crusty old doctors who are set in their ways may have never run across it. On the other hand, as there are two balloons, I suspect that it may also fill more space inside the bladder and possibly produce even MORE of the sensation that you are now experiencing... that you have to pee. I had one in for two weeks recently and that sensation was quite bothersome. Removal of the Foley is a bit more complicated than you thought. DO NOT pull it out, or you can do some damage. Removal required a 10ml syringe to extract the saline solution that fills the balloon. Once drained, it is fairly easy and quite painless to pull out... it even tickles a little. In some countries with socialized medicine patients are expected to remove their own. In the US it is generally done by a medical professional, typically a nurse.",

      "Content": "I've heard everything from six months to three years. My RO said it is important to be on HT before and after RT. Initially that was supposed to be just six months, then my SRT was postponed by five months. The Uro who did my RP said it would be three years. When I asked about two he said two or three years is typical. (As a movie buff this reminded me of Mr & Mrs Smith). Then my RO most recently said just one year. Since my SRT starts next month, then that satisfies the before and after requirement. I know that the guys with stage 4 and metastatic PCa are typically on it for three years and even longer, but it typically becomes ineffective after several years... which leads to the intermittent HT protocol (xx months on, xx months off).",

      "Content": "Flying all over the country and staying in motels was nothing that I could ever afford. My GP had been monitoring my PSA and recommended consulting a urologist when it hit 4. My mistake was trusting the wrong doctor. My urologist only told me three things between 2012 and when I was finally diagnosed in 2016 after he retired: 1) your PSA is nothing to be concerned about, 2) your biopsy was negative, and 3) your prostate is normal. I am certain that if he had ever mentioned the word \"cancer\" then I might have been motivated to look further. Now, today, when a doctor tells me that I might have cancer, I make sure to get additional testing. Lesson learned from my urology experience. Had I been a wealthy person it might have been a fun getaway to maybe drive up to Cleveland Clinic for a second opinion. After all, I drove to Cedar Point in Sandusky many times. But making the four hour drive up there just to see if there might be a doctor there who could tell me something different from what my local Uro told me was not a priority. Never even occurred to me.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by Another I never understood the overtreatment mantra. I think it is linked to the other myth you will die of something else before you die of PC. As life expectancy increases and the cancer expands to more and younger men and more aggressive forms public perception will change. I think social stigma also plays a role. Men are reluctant to accept the responsibility for the disease, will not discuss it, and practice denial and delay which feeds complaint and bitterness over the natural outcome of delayed detection and treatment. The denial and delay syndrome is driven by men themselves not stepping up and taking responsibility for their health. It's easy to \"blame the victim. My treatment was delayed because my urologist downplayed the significance of my steadily rising PSA, and seemed to be unaware of my family history.

My urologist never even mentioned the word cancer. How was I to know? I expected him to be the expert on the subject. When I went along with the biopsy... no minor procedure... he only told me that it was negative. He just gave me more and more antibiotics. It is hard for me to not feel resentful of the way I was treated... or more precisely, NOT treated. And it makes my blood boil every time I read someone talking about \"overtreatment\". Yes, I understand what happened, to SOME men. But that's no reason to throw out the baby with the bathwater. It wasn't until I changed doctors and asked my Uro several very pointed questions that he dropped me like a hot potato. I only wish it had happened two years earlier. The \"lucky\" men who received treatment when their cancer was only a G6 or G7 should consider themselves very fortunate. The alternative could have been to end up with an artificial sphincter and pelvic radiation disease, all because some gov't panel scared a doctor into downplaying PSA screening.

You will need to decide the \"When\" & \"What.\" The questions to consider is: \"Will this violate the capsule and when?\" & \"What happens if the capsule is violated?\" Probably more a matter of when rather than if. Granted, 7 is borderline intervention stage, but my experience is the Gleason tends to be elevated with time rather than lowered. If there is a tumor it will spread. The question is, when is a good time to stop it in its tracks? It won't get better on its own.",

      "Content": "Mike - Your T3B/SVI automatically qualifies your for ART. I had 70Gy IMRT using the Varian RapidArc like Chester, but as MF points out, your PSA is essentially undetectable. However, your primary grade 4 component of your G7 plus the bladder neck involvement tips the scale back toward ART. The fact that you seem to be fully continent is another green flag. I'd say talk with a RO who is not promoting Proton. PB is a high priced option that I believe is aimed at intermediate risk patients. It is more accurate at delivering targeted primary radiation to known tumors. You should probably have your entire prostate bed flooded with radiation to wipe out any escaped cancer cells in the area of the SV and bladder neck before they take advantage of the opportunity for systemic spread. It's a bit of a crap shoot. I think the stats show it's 50/50 whether you would ever have BCR without having ART. But it is my belief to zap everything while it's still localized. There are some drawbacks to getting radiation, but if there's a chance you might need it later on, you'd be better of getting it now. Good luck, and best regards to your lovely wife.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by redbelly7 I will be meeting w/ radiology on the 30th and will probably start radiation mid Sept. Right now, I am incontinent. I can hold some, but if I walk, bend, etc, I leak. The Dr gave me a foam clamp to wear during radiation, so I can keep something in my bladder to protect it. I am planning to start PT for kegels soon. Since I've already had a RP, is there anything that I can do to protect my colon and rectum? What should I be looking for during the process? I'm planning on having radiation and go back to work. Uh, this is something your RO should be doing for you! I started RT a week ago (for SVI) and have jumped thru all kinds of hoops since January getting ready for this. Two of the most common methods to minimize bowel and bladder toxicity are a rectal balloon and a requirement to hold a full bladder. I asked my RO twice about the balloon and he says half of RO's use it, and half do not. He does not. But he does require that patients be able to hold a full quart of water (32 oz) while under the zapper. Also be aware that what little continence you may have now will likely be diminished after RT. I've heard this from several guys. They had decent continence going into RT but came out with little remaining. In my case, it required an AUS implant, which ideally should be implanted before radiation begins. Like many other surgical procedures, it becomes more complicated when performed on irradiated tissues. I would suggest that you ask your RO about these topics, and I suspect that other bro's here would say the same. Good luck, especially with that clamp. I tried it, didn't work for me.",

JJ, Rich and I are the PC \"three Caballeros\"... we always seem to be posting together, as all three of us just had DaVinci surgery in the past few weeks and are recently liberated from the cath... currently day four cathless for me, and going thru an awful lot of pads - probably ten a day. I haven't experienced split stream since the surgery, but knew it well over the previous years of prostate infections. In my case, my concern is that the full length of my urethra is still sore and the tip of the penis tender from the catheter. I have good control most of the time but experience frequent \"squirts\" throughout the day... bending over, getting up from a chair or passing gas are most common. I am going to say that most likely - unless a doctor or nurse says it is unusual - that all these things we experience are probably normal and will pass eventually.",

They didn't hold enough and my shaft had the tendency to flop off to one side or the other and miss the pad altogether. I came to rely primarily on external catheters and have written extensively on several different forums on the subject. My favorite, most comfortable and most reliable was the Freedom silicone with aloe, about $1.25 ea on Az, leg bag by Rusch about $2 ea also from Az. I would try to go a day or two each week w/o the CC and would use Prevail belted shields, which are also sold at CVS as their own brand. I think we discussed this in an earlier thread, so maybe you tried these and they did not work for you. Different strokes, as they say. Several ppl had suggested to me to place a pad inside a Depends brief, with only a small portion of the adhesive exposed. That way you can change the pad without changing the brief. I found it all to be way too bulky... but then I am slender and wear snug fitting trousers, so it definitely looked like I was wearing a diaper. Today I wear only a Tena moderate absorbent pad, the \"3 drops\" package.",

      "Content": "Flying all over the country and staying in motels was nothing that I could ever afford. My GP had been monitoring my PSA and recommended consulting a urologist when it hit 4. My mistake was trusting the wrong doctor. My urologist only told me three things between 2012 and when I was finally diagnosed in 2016 after he retired: 1) your PSA is nothing to be concerned about, 2) your biopsy was negative, and 3) your prostate is normal. I am certain that if he had ever mentioned the word \"cancer\" then I might have been motivated to look further. Now, today, when a doctor tells me that I might have cancer, I make sure to get additional testing. Lesson learned from my urology experience. Had I been a wealthy person it might have been a fun getaway to maybe drive up to Cleveland Clinic for a second opinion. After all, I drove to Cedar Point in Sandusky many times. But making the four hour drive up there just to see if there might be a doctor there who could tell me something different from what my local Uro told me was not a priority. Never even occurred to me.",

      "Content": "I just got my second PSA results, now six months after completing adjuvant radiation and fifteen months into my 18 months of Lupron alone. There was some difficulty getting the results as my Uro's office is undergoing some management changes and I cannot log into their web portal, but a phone call to his nurse (again, confounded by techno issues with their phone system) and got the results verbally. PSA is \"undetectable\".. I don't know the actual value due to glitch above but I asked the nurse, is it 0.00? and she said yes. I asked about testosterone and she said 23.2, or was it 27.2? Anyway she said it's normal for Lupron. And this whole cognitive impairment thing where I can't remember what the heck I'm doing is also \"normal for Lupron\". So I know there are lots of guys here who are on ADT and I was wondering how you guys are doing? I try read all of your posts (MichiganMan, my \"joined at the pelvis\" bro) and everyone else who has finished the aggressive treatment and are on the long slow, slide back to normalcy (hopefully) and trying to live life partially impaired and limping along with no other goals right now other then waiting for the next PSA test and hoping it hasn't moved in the wrong direction. Sorry I don't remember everyone's name, but I recognize you when scanning the thread list and always read whatever you guys have to say. Two years into this (or four or six, depending on how you count) I don't read every thread, and only respond where it seems my input may be more valuable than it would be demoralizing... so forgive me if this has been discussed here before. I was reading on that other message board about testosterone recovery following ADT, which concurred with something MM mentioned earlier about a six months half life after the end of the therapeutic period of the last last shot (ie, six months after the last six month shot). So I realize that after I DO NOT get another six month shot in July, three months from now, that by next January 2019 I will have about half as much of the LNRH or whatever it is in my system and should see recovery of testosterone during that year, 2019. My Uro said for it to take about a year for the Lupron to wear off and start getting accurate PSA tests. But what I'm probably more interested in now is testosterone recovery. In fact I'm a little bit worried about what \"life after Lupron\" will be like. My T level was never tested before starting HT so I have no idea what my baseline would be. But I've read that two factors affect testosterone recovery... age of the patient and length of time on ADT. The thread I found on that other website suggests that early on into one's PCa journey, T levels actually decline, as the cancer is actually consuming testosteron as it grows. And in my case, as my cancer has apparently been around for quite a long while before it was clinically detectable, I'm thinking I was probably hypogonadal or low-T even before that first biopsy. Granted, I was able to keep my very sexy wife satisfied before things started going south, and did father two very healthy sons. But after that period of time I did lose a testicle and recall that more than four years ago (or twenty years ago, depending on how one counts) I was experiencing hot flashes and severe mood swings, and wondering if my baseline T level was lower than most guys anyway. I've never been an athlete, exercise enthusiast or even a sports fan. OK, enough of my usual rambling. But a final thought. I just told my wife about this and she just said, why don't the doctors tell people about any of this? To which I could only say, doctors don't want an informed patient, they just want to call all the shots, and the less they say, the less they can be held to. Have a happy 4/20 everyone! I'll be on the table with a scope up my butt for my first post-RT colo.",

      "Content": "I tried another brand of belted shield that has velcro and they were not as good as the CVS/Prevail. I still have most of that pack left. Problem I had was the elastic belts were too tight and tend to curl. I buttoned two straps back to back on both sides (the buttons at either the front of back are then reversed). If you are mechanically inclined you can figure it out. I think the shields are intended primarily for women hence the shortcomings but are marketed as unisex. As for the CC's, different manufacturers have staked out different sizes along the scale. The Freedoms are at 28, 31, 34 etc. Another brand has 29, 32, 35 and so on. I liked the silicon freedoms w/aloe for all they were, though once the Lupron started they were a bit too large (but next size down was too tight). There was one brand, Coveen I think, that had 30mm which seemed to be the best fit, but were a different animal... had like an accordion flex point at the end. Each variety has their pluses and minuses. Apply them smoothly then squeeze all around to make the adhesive stick. There seem to be no good tutorials available on this. Presumably anything on youtube would be banned unless using a fake phallus, which is actually not very realistic.",

      "Content": "Within a few months post-RP I was dry most nights but had very little control during the day. The situation never improved. My Uro sent me to PT with a Kegel coach but my continence was never reliable. I would leak often enough that I had to wear some form of protection 24 hours a day. Even now, with the AUS implant I sometimes drip during the night. And as Rooster stated, my bladder seems to hold less now than it did previously and I get up several times during the night to pee. I now go thru 1-2 pads daily and at night I sleep with a dry washcloth in my crotch covering my penis and scrotum. I bought a supply of yellow or beige washcloths so my wife doesn't use them to wash her face (ehwww). The leaking isn't always a problem but I can feel even just a few drops on my thigh and it wakes me up. And there's still the occasional wet spot on the sheets. It doesn't seem to matter what I drink or when, it just happens. It's the new normal.",

      "Content": "I just got my second PSA results, now six months after completing adjuvant radiation and fifteen months into my 18 months of Lupron alone. There was some difficulty getting the results as my Uro's office is undergoing some management changes and I cannot log into their web portal, but a phone call to his nurse (again, confounded by techno issues with their phone system) and got the results verbally. PSA is \"undetectable\".. I don't know the actual value due to glitch above but I asked the nurse, is it 0.00? and she said yes. I asked about testosterone and she said 23.2, or was it 27.2? Anyway she said it's normal for Lupron. And this whole cognitive impairment thing where I can't remember what the heck I'm doing is also \"normal for Lupron\". So I know there are lots of guys here who are on ADT and I was wondering how you guys are doing? I try read all of your posts (MichiganMan, my \"joined at the pelvis\" bro) and everyone else who has finished the aggressive treatment and are on the long slow, slide back to normalcy (hopefully) and trying to live life partially impaired and limping along with no other goals right now other then waiting for the next PSA test and hoping it hasn't moved in the wrong direction. Sorry I don't remember everyone's name, but I recognize you when scanning the thread list and always read whatever you guys have to say. Two years into this (or four or six, depending on how you count) I don't read every thread, and only respond where it seems my input may be more valuable than it would be demoralizing... so forgive me if this has been discussed here before. I was reading on that other message board about testosterone recovery following ADT, which concurred with something MM mentioned earlier about a six months half life after the end of the therapeutic period of the last last shot (ie, six months after the last six month shot). So I realize that after I DO NOT get another six month shot in July, three months from now, that by next January 2019 I will have about half as much of the LNRH or whatever it is in my system and should see recovery of testosterone during that year, 2019. My Uro said for it to take about a year for the Lupron to wear off and start getting accurate PSA tests. But what I'm probably more interested in now is testosterone recovery. In fact I'm a little bit worried about what \"life after Lupron\" will be like. My T level was never tested before starting HT so I have no idea what my baseline would be. But I've read that two factors affect testosterone recovery... age of the patient and length of time on ADT. The thread I found on that other website suggests that early on into one's PCa journey, T levels actually decline, as the cancer is actually consuming testosteron as it grows. And in my case, as my cancer has apparently been around for quite a long while before it was clinically detectable, I'm thinking I was probably hypogonadal or low-T even before that first biopsy. Granted, I was able to keep my very sexy wife satisfied before things started going south, and did father two very healthy sons. But after that period of time I did lose a testicle and recall that more than four years ago (or twenty years ago, depending on how one counts) I was experiencing hot flashes and severe mood swings, and wondering if my baseline T level was lower than most guys anyway. I've never been an athlete, exercise enthusiast or even a sports fan. OK, enough of my usual rambling. But a final thought. I just told my wife about this and she just said, why don't the doctors tell people about any of this? To which I could only say, doctors don't want an informed patient, they just want to call all the shots, and the less they say, the less they can be held to. Have a happy 4/20 everyone! I'll be on the table with a scope up my butt for my first post-RT colo.",

      "Content": "Mike - Your T3B/SVI automatically qualifies your for ART. I had 70Gy IMRT using the Varian RapidArc like Chester, but as MF points out, your PSA is essentially undetectable. However, your primary grade 4 component of your G7 plus the bladder neck involvement tips the scale back toward ART. The fact that you seem to be fully continent is another green flag. I'd say talk with a RO who is not promoting Proton. PB is a high priced option that I believe is aimed at intermediate risk patients. It is more accurate at delivering targeted primary radiation to known tumors. You should probably have your entire prostate bed flooded with radiation to wipe out any escaped cancer cells in the area of the SV and bladder neck before they take advantage of the opportunity for systemic spread. It's a bit of a crap shoot. I think the stats show it's 50/50 whether you would ever have BCR without having ART. But it is my belief to zap everything while it's still localized. There are some drawbacks to getting radiation, but if there's a chance you might need it later on, you'd be better of getting it now. Good luck, and best regards to your lovely wife.",

From the perspective of the scans - which did your doctor have done to ensure it has not spread? -I am concerned bc my dad's current urologist had a bone scan and pelvic MRI done. A different uro we saw last week recommended he also have a Prostate MRI and a Cat Scan of his mid section to ensure no spread. From the perspective of other surgery suitability, did your uro have you see a cardio doc? get a physical? meet with an anesthesiologist? Sounds like your Dad has already had more tests than I did. In my case, an MRI first identified the location of my tumor, then my new Uro ordered some blood work and a nuclear bone scan. That's all. No CT. The hospital required a routine physical exam by my GP (I had recently had an annual physical within the past three months, which I think included EKG and chest x-ray). Then I met with the pre-op team at the hospital who were all very good, explained what to do when and provided Sage wipes and Impact nourishment supplement beforehand. No anesthesiologist until the day of surgery. All in all, the RRP was the best surgical experience I have ever had, ever.",

      "Content": "I tried another brand of belted shield that has velcro and they were not as good as the CVS/Prevail. I still have most of that pack left. Problem I had was the elastic belts were too tight and tend to curl. I buttoned two straps back to back on both sides (the buttons at either the front of back are then reversed). If you are mechanically inclined you can figure it out. I think the shields are intended primarily for women hence the shortcomings but are marketed as unisex. As for the CC's, different manufacturers have staked out different sizes along the scale. The Freedoms are at 28, 31, 34 etc. Another brand has 29, 32, 35 and so on. I liked the silicon freedoms w/aloe for all they were, though once the Lupron started they were a bit too large (but next size down was too tight). There was one brand, Coveen I think, that had 30mm which seemed to be the best fit, but were a different animal... had like an accordion flex point at the end. Each variety has their pluses and minuses. Apply them smoothly then squeeze all around to make the adhesive stick. There seem to be no good tutorials available on this.

      "Content": "I tried another brand of belted shield that has velcro and they were not as good as the CVS/Prevail. I still have most of that pack left. Problem I had was the elastic belts were too tight and tend to curl. I buttoned two straps back to back on both sides (the buttons at either the front of back are then reversed). If you are mechanically inclined you can figure it out. I think the shields are intended primarily for women hence the shortcomings but are marketed as unisex. As for the CC's, different manufacturers have staked out different sizes along the scale. The Freedoms are at 28, 31, 34 etc. Another brand has 29, 32, 35 and so on. I liked the silicon freedoms w/aloe for all they were, though once the Lupron started they were a bit too large (but next size down was too tight). There was one brand, Coveen I think, that had 30mm which seemed to be the best fit, but were a different animal... had like an accordion flex point at the end. Each variety has their pluses and minuses. Apply them smoothly then squeeze all around to make the adhesive stick. There seem to be no good tutorials available on this. Presumably anything on youtube would be banned unless using a fake phallus, which is actually not very realistic.",

      "Content": "Practically every man here started his prostate cancer journey with a TRUS (transrectal ultrasound guided biopsy). The urologist will insert a small probe into your rectum and a needle will punch out a dozen or so core samples. Usually the patient is sedated for this, though some docs seem to go cheap and just use Novocaine. If you are awake you may just feel a little sting. You will probably be required to take an enema or two the morning of the procedure. You should be given an antibiotic, as there is a risk of passing fecal material into the prostate. Afterwards, your urine will be bloody for several days. I experienced some passing of clots that restricted urine flow, but that was the worst of it. Semen will be dark red then brown for several weeks afterwards, perhaps as long as a month or more. Then it will clear up. Good luck with your procedure. Sometimes the TRUS will yield false negative results, meaning that there may actually be cancer in there, but the needle missed it. In that case you should request or demand an MRI before another biopsy. That is important (I was never offered that option). Following the biopsy, any further procedures such as prostatectomy, further biopsy or colonoscopy must be postponed by 6-8 weeks while the prostate and surrounding tisue heals.",

I looked like an eggplant down there. Hopefully you iced your goods off and on for the first few days. I read other guys say they were instructed to pull down on the pump twice a day to keep it from retracting upward into the abdomen. I didn't have to as the pump was placed where my right testicle used to be. I don't know the particulars about the retraction, but have heard about it so it must be important. I'm trying to get an AUS support group going on FB if either of you guys might be interested. But of course, most guys don't have any problems with their AUS, so it's been kind of lonely. It won't take long to get used to your new hardware. In the meantime, good luck!",

      "Content": "I've heard everything from six months to three years. My RO said it is important to be on HT before and after RT. Initially that was supposed to be just six months, then my SRT was postponed by five months. The Uro who did my RP said it would be three years. When I asked about two he said two or three years is typical. (As a movie buff this reminded me of Mr & Mrs Smith). Then my RO most recently said just one year. Since my SRT starts next month, then that satisfies the before and after requirement. I know that the guys with stage 4 and metastatic PCa are typically on it for three years and even longer, but it typically becomes ineffective after several years... which leads to the intermittent HT protocol (xx months on, xx months off).",

      "Content": "Within a few months post-RP I was dry most nights but had very little control during the day. The situation never improved. My Uro sent me to PT with a Kegel coach but my continence was never reliable. I would leak often enough that I had to wear some form of protection 24 hours a day. Even now, with the AUS implant I sometimes drip during the night. And as Rooster stated, my bladder seems to hold less now than it did previously and I get up several times during the night to pee. I now go thru 1-2 pads daily and at night I sleep with a dry washcloth in my crotch covering my penis and scrotum. I bought a supply of yellow or beige washcloths so my wife doesn't use them to wash her face (ehwww). The leaking isn't always a problem but I can feel even just a few drops on my thigh and it wakes me up. And there's still the occasional wet spot on the sheets.

      "Content": "Congrats Red, I hope your procedure went well. Unfortunately you'll need to wait another month before you can play with it. My swelling and bruising was pretty bad... I looked like an eggplant down there. Hopefully you iced your goods off and on for the first few days. I read other guys say they were instructed to pull down on the pump twice a day to keep it from retracting upward into the abdomen. I didn't have to as the pump was placed where my right testicle used to be. I don't know the particulars about the retraction, but have heard about it so it must be important. I'm trying to get an AUS support group going on FB if either of you guys might be interested. But of course, most guys don't have any problems with their AUS, so it's been kind of lonely. It won't take long to get used to your new hardware. In the meantime, good luck!",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by IceStationZebra But it sounds like there is nothing that will ever rule out that I have cancer, it looks like we\u2019re just delaying it until we hit a ringer and some test finds something. Something that another doctor told me around 35 years ago was \"we can rule it in, but not out\". I wish my urologist had told me the same thing, about two years earlier. My cancer might not have progressed as it did, while he led me believe that my prostate was normal. As you've been at this for six months (?) ... I don't see any stats other than your PSA, I'm guessing that you are in the same boat I was in four years ago... consistently rising PSA but all tests \"negative\" so far. If my urologist had offered me a prostatectomy back then I might have taken him up on it, rather than fumbling around with false negative biopsies which were doomed to failure unless a different approach was taken. Of course, standards of care wouldn't permit that. Whatever loop you find yourself currently caught up in, I hope you can find an exit soon!",

I was starting to wonder if that was all urologists (I've had four). Well anyway, your 50-60% chance honestly doesn't sound that great, so I'm guessing maybe you had lymphatic involvement? Without a sig it's hard to tell why your odds aren't higher. My doc just tells me that my PSA may go up \"a little\" once the HT wears off. Maybe another year from now.

My PSA rose steadily for four years, but because DRE's were normal and initial biopsy was negative, nothing was done until a fusion biopsy two years ago found a G8 tumor at the base. Yes, a difficult area to read. My new Uro simply said \"you can never find them up there\".

I'm at the end of my rope trying to find something that I can use with a pad and will stay up around my hips when they begin to get heavy. The thong reference really was intended as a joke. Do they still make those? Anyway, I use snug fitting low cut bikini style briefs that are made of stretch polyester rather than cotton. Cotton stretches out too much and does sag when the pad gets heavy. And the bikini briefs (which I bought at Target) have more of a pronounced pouch up front for the junk, and the pad. Only problem was the tight waistband, which as I mentioned earlier, can be stretched out before wearing. Good luck finding something that works well for you!",

      "Content": "Welcome to the board Mauricio. My initial impression is that RT this early is overkill, especially given your low numbers and no adverse pathology. However, as you have already started RT I would recommend that you proceed with HT and throw everything at it while it is still early. Of course, in my case I did have adverse pathology and took this approach, starting HT soon after surgery. Also I had a pretty rough time with RT. Presumably your HT would be a short course (3-6 months) and you should not be concerned about castrate resistance. Most guys with T3a and negative SM would wait for a pronounced and continual PSA rise before initiating further treatment. However, once you have started you should likely do as much possible now. You only get one first chance at this. Good luck!",

      "Content": "I'm wondering if anyone here has had the AMS800 artificial urinary sphincter implant or if anyone here has had their level of incontinence described as \"intrinsic sphincter deficiency\", as opposed to stress urinary incontinence or the other one, the urgency thing (which I don't have). Anyway, my six month anniversary of my RP was last week and I had already been told that I am not a candidate for the \"sling\". But up until this point, I had pretty much been led to believe that I could still expect some improvement in control up until around ten months... at least that's what I was told by my RO. But today I was seen by the prosthetic urologist who said, yes he's seen healing up to nine months, but from where I am now, no way that's going to happen. So basically I'm scheduled for surgery in around ten weeks from now. By then my wife's chemo should be wrapped up and we will even have time for another little getaway before I go back under the knife. I had hoped to postpone the AUS until my PSA began to rise again. Reason being is as soon as the device goes in, the deterioration begins. The inflatable cuff causes the urethra to erode and so it needs to be surgically relocated every 8-10 years (paraphrasing here) and as it \"eats\" about 2cm of urethra each time, they can move it twice. So I can expect maybe thirty years out of it. (BTW usually they just replace the device rather than simply move it, as after ten years or so the risk of mechanical failure increases). I told him that I have been fortunate so far with a similar ticking time bomb, namely my left leg, which I was told twelve years ago that I could expect around ten years before needing a TKR. And I was hoping to do the same thing here, postpone the AUS until the cancer reappears. He basically said the real ticking time bomb is delaying the radiation, that the Lupron will keep it in check for a while but it's not a cure, and I really should proceed with the SRT as soon as possible... and they prefer that the AUS goes in before the radiation begins. Plus there's a six week window afterwards for tissue healing before the RT essentially freezes the recovery process. Now, I realize that the doctors are basically selling something, and I felt that I could at least get by for a while before being once again carved up. The big \"ah-hah\" moment came when I considered just how much time I could possibly hope to save... sort of a \"how long can you tread water\" question. Is it worth jeopardizing recurrence of the cancer just to save a few months in the lifespan of a mechanical device? Then the answer became obvious. I've read as much as I can from users on other forums who have had experience with this device, and was wondering if anyone here might have some thoughts on the matter. Thanks.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by MichiganMan16 What was your level of continence at the six month mark? By the 4-5 month mark, I was about a 9 on the scale of 10. Then I had SRT/HT, and I went back a bit to where I am now, about 7/8. One pad a day... First, thanks for your kind words for what Lori & I have been thru. I remember you are T3b and I know you have been thru a lot yourself. As far as continence, I am right now at six months, and continence is I'd guess 50% at best. Nights are dry, and I am fine sitting or lying down. And I can \"hold it\" as long as I need to when I get up. But at some point in the day, I must direct my attention to other things in daily life. That's when whatever I am wearing just fills up and I leak like a faucet. As far as \"pads per day\" (they always ask that question) I only say that pads can't hold enough. I wear diapers, and they hold about a half pound each. When I use an external cath and leg bag I dump out about a half liter several times a day. I think what the Dr meant was that I'm simply not going to go from 50% to 80-90% in just a few more months. He said if I was using \"only\" 2 or 3 pads a day then I could go ahead with the RT. But since I use 8-10 even 12 diapers a day, then I basically have no control at all, at least for most of the day. Yes, it settles down at night, but during the day, my condition is described as intrinsic sphincter deficiency.",

      "Content": "Welcome to the board Mauricio. My initial impression is that RT this early is overkill, especially given your low numbers and no adverse pathology. However, as you have already started RT I would recommend that you proceed with HT and throw everything at it while it is still early. Of course, in my case I did have adverse pathology and took this approach, starting HT soon after surgery. Also I had a pretty rough time with RT. Presumably your HT would be a short course (3-6 months) and you should not be concerned about castrate resistance. Most guys with T3a and negative SM would wait for a pronounced and continual PSA rise before initiating further treatment. However, once you have started you should likely do as much possible now. You only get one first chance at this. Good luck!",

Some sag as bad as boxer briefs but the bikini style is more snug fitting. But I don't like the waistband that is usually made too tight on that style, so I stretch out the waistband overnight around the mouth of a bucket or trash can before wearing.",

However, as you have already started RT I would recommend that you proceed with HT and throw everything at it while it is still early. Of course, in my case I did have adverse pathology and took this approach, starting HT soon after surgery. Also I had a pretty rough time with RT. Presumably your HT would be a short course (3-6 months) and you should not be concerned about castrate resistance. Most guys with T3a and negative SM would wait for a pronounced and continual PSA rise before initiating further treatment. However, once you have started you should likely do as much possible now. You only get one first chance at this. Good luck!",

I have previous pathology with several adenomas removed a decade ago, and colonoscopies every 2-3 years since. More good news, next colo in seven years! I guess he felt I was in good shape in that department. The not so good news, I do have radiation colitis. He says that's why I'm still experiencing frequent urgency and diarrhea six months after the conclusion of IMRT. I'm going to avoid consulting Dr Google on this one. Doc says he took a biopsy and if it comes back negative then the RC should ease gradually over the coming years. We don't hear much about RC as a result of prostate treatment. Anyone else have knowledge on the matter?",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by po18guy Here is a doctor/researcher oriented video on the difficulties of T-Cell Lymphomas. Give it a brief watch and maybe ask her to watch with you. Look at the extreme depth of knowledge and the desire to control or eliminate these rare lymphomas. The jargon is very technical, but shows the profound efforts made by medical science in the effort to spare human life. These researchers hate cancer and live in the micro-cellular world in man's best attempt to eradicate it. http://www.oncologytube.com/video/ne...homas/10001079 Thanks, but first off I gotta say (and I'm sure you'll fix it) the video link is wrong... the text is correct if you copy and paste, but clicking on the link brings up a reply window. With that out of the way, I want to welcome you to the prostate forum. I know you've been here before as I've seen your replies to a few other posts. And of course I know you as moderator of the HL/NHL forum here. Interesting video. I enjoyed watching it as I have a deep appreciation for the seriousness and difficulty of the fight against cancer. I'm afraid if I show it to my wife the best I can hope is that it might make her feel fortunate to not have T-cell lymphoma. Worst case, well, she is one who feels that everything can be remedied with herbs and prayers, diet and exercise, essential oils, Reiki... I've seen it all. I have ordered the book and hope (and pray) that she will read it and maybe take it to heart. It says there is a Ken Burns documentary... I am slightly dyslexic and choose audio books if possible (it takes me forever to compose a post or reply here). Thanks for the reply and the links. I'm trying to work thru this.",

If you have one, you would call a roofer because he is the one most trained to repair the damage. With that in mind, you may want to seek professional therapeutic help to ease your emotional pain. Depression can fester, if left untreated. Thanks Jim. I've considered that, and I know that mental state can affect one's health. I knew about your wife, but not your son. Very sad. We have two adult sons who are terrific (and I have told them so!) and feel so fortunate that neither of them ever associated with the drug crowd... never even had a tattoo or piercing. We feel so blessed! Surely that must have been very difficult to learn how to cope with, and now living with your wife's hemi behavior. I'm sure you two have been together so long that either one of you would be lost without the other, so you value the time you have left together.",

      "Content": "I agree with Fairwind. Such was my case. Same age at time of surgery. I chose surgery for expediency and the surgeon had an excellent track record (I am still very pleased with his work). However I ended up needing SRT anyway for SVI. Given that your cancer includes the apex, you may need RT+HT as well, as most positive margins occur at the apex. BTW I just learned yesterday that my HT will be one full year and probably no more. And BTW my father received his radiologic training at Loyola. Good choice!",

      "Content": "For the record, I have never been depressed, and still believe I am not. Certainly not 'clinically' depressed nor profound. Yes, I get mad sometimes, I get anxious, I get stressed. I composed that post and emailed it to every living relative I have, as they have all witnessed me going over the edge. We all live near the edge, but some are better at pulling back when they feel themselves being pushed forward. I had to accept the diagnosis because I couldn't convince my doctor that the side effects of the Lupron have been too much for me. Yes, I could just grin and bear it. But there are medications that can help. When I talk with my doctor about it, it just goes over his head. I once told him \"everyone I know who's on Lupron is also on antidepressants\" and he just said that would just make me feel weird. That didn't help either. MM, I feel a greater kinship with you than I think any other guy here. We have similar diagnoses, yours a bit worse, and you are further along. And yes I am pissed that I got this disease, but I am MOST pissed that I couldn't get it treated sooner. My Uro dismissed all the signs (that can happen) but then just when I had caught my breath and was ready to go back and fight the good fight, my wife did something that sent me over the edge. Way over. It was innocent but thoughtless, and because I was in a terrible emotional state I could only think about getting out of the well, not about getting yet another biopsy. You see, when you mention depression, everybody starts treating you differently... and not necessarily better. It's more like \"be careful around him\". It's happening already. But again, I am not \"depressed\", I'm just experiencing the kind of deep mood swings that are TYPICAL for the disease and medications that we are all experiencing. I do not for one minute believe that the new meds will make me any more happy than I already am. I am a happy person. However, if they can reduce the frequency and severity of hot flashes and LET ME SLEEP, if they can help stabilize some of the deep mood swings THAT EVERYONE ON LUPRON REPORTS, and if it can at the same time make it a little easier to avoid going over the edge, then it is entirely worth it to be called \"depressed\".",

      "Content": "No, I don't mean I'm extremely depressed... no, I mean I am now OFFICIALLY depressed. After much anguish I finally swallowed my pride and accepted an unpleasant medical diagnosis in order to get the medications I need. There is so much stigma associated with having \"major depressive disorder\" on one's medical record, but my wife finally convinced me that I need not be so concerned... after all, it's not like I'm going to be applying for a job or anything like that. Believe me, the view from the bottom of the well is a LOT different from how it looks up top. Most days I can walk past \"the well\", even approach the edge and look down into the well and think \"gee, that doesn't look so bad... that shouldn't be so hard to climb out of\". But I never know just when I'm going to fall in, or when I do, how long I'll be down there. And as I'm flailing about down there, screaming for help, I can look up and see all the people standing around the edge looking down and thinking \"that doesn't look so bad\". And once I finally manage to get out, then I have to apologize to everyone that I may have offended when I was down there.... which doesn't make me feel any better. And some of them may have actually given me a little shove, granted it's never intentional, just some little thing that pushed me over the edge. According to the American Cancer Society, 15 to 35% of cancer patients experience depression. That means either one out of three or one out of seven. That's a huge gap. I suppose it's actually 1 in 3 that are depressed but only 1 in 7 report it, or feel they need to do something about it. Thinking back, I remember at least a half dozen times I've visited doctors and described what should be classic symptoms... endless crying fits, tightness in the chest, unable to breath, feeling a need to escape (how many times in the past three years since my prostate cancer symptoms first appeared have I left the room rather than engage in an uncomfortable discussion). As I describe to my doctor(s) what I feel are serious problems I just see this blank look on his face, like all he's thinking is \"what's the least I can do to get this guy out of my office\". I was amazed at the difference in medical care between what my wife has had compared to what I get. I've sat with her thru her many doctors visits. Her doctor asks are you in pain, and how is your emotional state? She even looked at each of us and said \"you have cancer, and YOU have cancer, this is going to be difficult... you will need to be sure that you do not let it affect your mental state\". My doctor just says \"I'm putting you on hormone therapy... there will be some side effects\". My wife finally told me \"doctors don't take hints, you need to come right out and tell him what you need\". I had this sense of pride a couple weeks ago getting a routine endoscopy when asked if I had ever been treated for anxiety or depression and I immediately said no. I guess in reality it's just another question, like have you ever had headaches. And since I no longer need to be concerned with background checks and security clearances, there's really no reason to be so obstinate about it. So the plan is I'll be going on Cymbalta and Gabapentin once my surgery is out of the way. First step was getting off the narcotics I've been on for the past decade since my leg injury... that's been rough. I tried cutting back by half every two days. Five of the last six nights have largely been sleepless. It's tough knowing you have a drawer full of pills that could end the fits and sweats, but if I take one then I'll just have to start all over again. But there's some sort of interaction between SRNI's like Cymbalta and opiate derivatives. For now I'm taking Lyrica for the OA pain... man, that stuff is expensive! And it wear off quickly. Once the AUS surgery is out of the way, much of the therapeutic effects of the new meds is \"off label\"... the Gabapentin is often prescribed for hot flashes, Cymbalta for osteoarthritis. But my Dr says he can't prescribe off label and expect to be reimbursed. So after all the discussion we had, I logged into my chart online and saw this HUGE (or so it seemed) \"F32.9 - major depressive disorder\". My sig has been updated accordingly.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by zaldamo ... my step dad is very stubborn, angry and not communicating very well right now. He has prostate cancer, verified via biopsy. He had an MRI last week and confirmed it had metastasized into his bones. I don't know which ones. He said they would try to give him \"a few years\" and he's getting a shot of some kind at the urologist in 10 days. That's all I know... Assuming I can get him to communicate, can anyone give some general tips about how to proceed? I want him to go to a the local teaching university, or even The James in Columbus or The Cleveland Clinic. (We live in Cincinnati.) What questions should he ask? Second opinion? Should he not be seeing an oncologist or a uro who specializes in cancer? He is angry and grumpy because he is in pain. At least he had the biopsy and MRI and has shared enough that he will be getting \"a few more years\" probably from the shot of Lupron (or similar androgen deprivation therapy) which will lower his PSA until the cancer becomes castrate resistant, which is usually several years but sometimes never gets that far. He may also get Prolia or Xgeva injection to keep his bones as strong as possible. Bone metastasis is typically end stage. Sorry to be blunt. Sometimes men live for a decade or more after reaching stage 4. I think I read the average is four or five years (average meaning some live more than ten and some maybe only months). There is generally no cure. A last resort injection would be radium 223 but I don't think that's what he'll be getting. Sometimes prostate cancer is not detected until it is already too late. People think cutting it out cures everything. They are not informed. You can try to get him to go to another facility if he is willing. They may only be able to subject him to more tests and painful treatments and yet be unable to give him any better news. I know the urology business in Cincinnati is pretty much monopolized by the Urology Group (on Sanger Blvd in Norwood, with some satellite offices) and once you're in there you don't have much choice, especially in the area of urologic oncology. If I could go back four or five years I would have camped out at Cleveland Clinic. I don't know what's available in Cols. My cousin has kidney cancer and was at James for several months. They saved his life, but there again were basically delaying the inevitable. If you really want to help him you need to talk with him about getting access to his medical records and be ready to make a LOT of phone calls and do a lot of driving. More than anything, do what you can to make him comfortable. If the situation is truly as you have presented it, then don't try to believe in miracle cures or lift his spirits with we can beat this pep talks. There is a small possibility that it could happen, but the odds are more likely against him. Don't fight it, but don't let him give up just yet. Be prepared for an emotional struggle. And remember to take care of yourself too.",

      "Content": "Your confusion is understandable... the same thing happened to me - rising PSA but negative DRE and negative biopsy. I had been seeing the same urologist for twenty years, and when asked what to do next he said another biopsy. It seemed pointless to me. Then I heard about the MRI fusion biopsy. My uro said that required special training and his partner took over and yes it was cancer. My understanding is that the MRI fusion biopsy is fairly new and some insurance will not pay for it unless there has already been another previous biopsy (which you had). The traditional ultrasound guided biopsy uses ultrasound to locate the prostate but does not indicate varied densities within the prostate gland, which might suggest a tumor. With the MRI guided biopsy the surgeon can be guided directly to a suspicious region of the gland. In my case, only the lower right lobe was affected, but with an aggressive tumor. I don't want to frighten you, but this could possibly be your case as well. There are other ways your PSA could be elevated without the presence of a tumor, and it sounds like your uro is pursuing those. Getting another opinion from a different urologist is a good idea, though he may not find anything different. I lost a year between biopsies during which time the tumor spread, but fortunately not too far. In your case you say you have no other symptoms. In mine it was subtle. Up once every night around 4AM to pee which is not unusual at our age. I had reduced ejaculate but also thought maybe age. Just because the tests so far are negative doesn't necessarily mean there is nothing wrong. I guess all I can really say is you may become discouraged but don't give up. Good luck!",

      "Content": "No, I don't mean I'm extremely depressed... no, I mean I am now OFFICIALLY depressed. After much anguish I finally swallowed my pride and accepted an unpleasant medical diagnosis in order to get the medications I need. There is so much stigma associated with having \"major depressive disorder\" on one's medical record, but my wife finally convinced me that I need not be so concerned... after all, it's not like I'm going to be applying for a job or anything like that. Believe me, the view from the bottom of the well is a LOT different from how it looks up top. Most days I can walk past \"the well\", even approach the edge and look down into the well and think \"gee, that doesn't look so bad... that shouldn't be so hard to climb out of\". But I never know just when I'm going to fall in, or when I do, how long I'll be down there. And as I'm flailing about down there, screaming for help, I can look up and see all the people standing around the edge looking down and thinking \"that doesn't look so bad\". And once I finally manage to get out, then I have to apologize to everyone that I may have offended when I was down there.... which doesn't make me feel any better. And some of them may have actually given me a little shove, granted it's never intentional, just some little thing that pushed me over the edge. According to the American Cancer Society, 15 to 35% of cancer patients experience depression. That means either one out of three or one out of seven. That's a huge gap. I suppose it's actually 1 in 3 that are depressed but only 1 in 7 report it, or feel they need to do something about it. Thinking back, I remember at least a half dozen times I've visited doctors and described what should be classic symptoms... endless crying fits, tightness in the chest, unable to breath, feeling a need to escape (how many times in the past three years since my prostate cancer symptoms first appeared have I left the room rather than engage in an uncomfortable discussion). As I describe to my doctor(s) what I feel are serious problems I just see this blank look on his face, like all he's thinking is \"what's the least I can do to get this guy out of my office\". I was amazed at the difference in medical care between what my wife has had compared to what I get. I've sat with her thru her many doctors visits. Her doctor asks are you in pain, and how is your emotional state? She even looked at each of us and said \"you have cancer, and YOU have cancer, this is going to be difficult... you will need to be sure that you do not let it affect your mental state\". My doctor just says \"I'm putting you on hormone therapy... there will be some side effects\". My wife finally told me \"doctors don't take hints, you need to come right out and tell him what you need\". I had this sense of pride a couple weeks ago getting a routine endoscopy when asked if I had ever been treated for anxiety or depression and I immediately said no. I guess in reality it's just another question, like have you ever had headaches. And since I no longer need to be concerned with background checks and security clearances, there's really no reason to be so obstinate about it. So the plan is I'll be going on Cymbalta and Gabapentin once my surgery is out of the way. First step was getting off the narcotics I've been on for the past decade since my leg injury... that's been rough. I tried cutting back by half every two days. Five of the last six nights have largely been sleepless. It's tough knowing you have a drawer full of pills that could end the fits and sweats, but if I take one then I'll just have to start all over again. But there's some sort of interaction between SRNI's like Cymbalta and opiate derivatives. For now I'm taking Lyrica for the OA pain... man, that stuff is expensive! And it wear off quickly. Once the AUS surgery is out of the way, much of the therapeutic effects of the new meds is \"off label\"... the Gabapentin is often prescribed for hot flashes, Cymbalta for osteoarthritis. But my Dr says he can't prescribe off label and expect to be reimbursed. So after all the discussion we had, I logged into my chart online and saw this HUGE (or so it seemed) \"F32.9 - major depressive disorder\". My sig has been updated accordingly.",

      "Content": "For the record, I have never been depressed, and still believe I am not. Certainly not 'clinically' depressed nor profound. Yes, I get mad sometimes, I get anxious, I get stressed. I composed that post and emailed it to every living relative I have, as they have all witnessed me going over the edge. We all live near the edge, but some are better at pulling back when they feel themselves being pushed forward. I had to accept the diagnosis because I couldn't convince my doctor that the side effects of the Lupron have been too much for me. Yes, I could just grin and bear it. But there are medications that can help. When I talk with my doctor about it, it just goes over his head. I once told him \"everyone I know who's on Lupron is also on antidepressants\" and he just said that would just make me feel weird. That didn't help either. MM, I feel a greater kinship with you than I think any other guy here. We have similar diagnoses, yours a bit worse, and you are further along. And yes I am pissed that I got this disease, but I am MOST pissed that I couldn't get it treated sooner. My Uro dismissed all the signs (that can happen) but then just when I had caught my breath and was ready to go back and fight the good fight, my wife did something that sent me over the edge. Way over. It was innocent but thoughtless, and because I was in a terrible emotional state I could only think about getting out of the well, not about getting yet another biopsy. You see, when you mention depression, everybody starts treating you differently... and not necessarily better. It's more like \"be careful around him\". It's happening already. But again, I am not \"depressed\", I'm just experiencing the kind of deep mood swings that are TYPICAL for the disease and medications that we are all experiencing. I do not for one minute believe that the new meds will make me any more happy than I already am. I am a happy person. However, if they can reduce the frequency and severity of hot flashes and LET ME SLEEP, if they can help stabilize some of the deep mood swings THAT EVERYONE ON LUPRON REPORTS, and if it can at the same time make it a little easier to avoid going over the edge, then it is entirely worth it to be called \"depressed\".",

      "Content": "Gleason 6 is borderline. Most docs would probably not do surgery at this stage (I'd guess). PSA is a little high. If it goes into double digits then you may need to take action. The thing is, at your age the clock is running out. Assuming you have no other significant health problems (heart or liver disease) then you are - as I was - \"young and healthy enough\" for surgery. After age 70, or if other health problems are present then surgery may no longer be an option. You do know that if you have surgery first then you can always have radiation (and or HT) later... not necessarily the other way around. That was the clincher for me. But my cancer was G8 and PSA 25, higher than yours, so taking action was more urgent in my case. You have time to consider options, but I'd say you're probably looking at your case becoming more complicated in a few years. Just my two cents. Good luck with whatever comes out of this.",

If you have one, you would call a roofer because he is the one most trained to repair the damage. With that in mind, you may want to seek professional therapeutic help to ease your emotional pain. Depression can fester, if left untreated. Thanks Jim. I've considered that, and I know that mental state can affect one's health. I knew about your wife, but not your son. Very sad. We have two adult sons who are terrific (and I have told them so!) and feel so fortunate that neither of them ever associated with the drug crowd... never even had a tattoo or piercing. We feel so blessed! Surely that must have been very difficult to learn how to cope with, and now living with your wife's hemi behavior. I'm sure you two have been together so long that either one of you would be lost without the other, so you value the time you have left together.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by po18guy Here is a doctor/researcher oriented video on the difficulties of T-Cell Lymphomas. Give it a brief watch and maybe ask her to watch with you. Look at the extreme depth of knowledge and the desire to control or eliminate these rare lymphomas. The jargon is very technical, but shows the profound efforts made by medical science in the effort to spare human life. These researchers hate cancer and live in the micro-cellular world in man's best attempt to eradicate it. http://www.oncologytube.com/video/ne...homas/10001079 Thanks, but first off I gotta say (and I'm sure you'll fix it) the video link is wrong... the text is correct if you copy and paste, but clicking on the link brings up a reply window. With that out of the way, I want to welcome you to the prostate forum. I know you've been here before as I've seen your replies to a few other posts. And of course I know you as moderator of the HL/NHL forum here. Interesting video. I enjoyed watching it as I have a deep appreciation for the seriousness and difficulty of the fight against cancer. I'm afraid if I show it to my wife the best I can hope is that it might make her feel fortunate to not have T-cell lymphoma. Worst case, well, she is one who feels that everything can be remedied with herbs and prayers, diet and exercise, essential oils, Reiki... I've seen it all. I have ordered the book and hope (and pray) that she will read it and maybe take it to heart. It says there is a Ken Burns documentary... I am slightly dyslexic and choose audio books if possible (it takes me forever to compose a post or reply here). Thanks for the reply and the links. I'm trying to work thru this.",

At other big name cancer centers, it's 70-72 GY. Maybe that's why I am on ADT longer, to make up for the smaller dosage. MM - I posted about my RO visit yesterday on that other forum, but was going to wait until after tomorrow when I will have more info before posting here. My RO apparently plans on 68.4 Gy but no boost mentioned. Also learned that I will only be on Lupron thru the end of this year. Big relief. Next (and hopefully last) Lupron shot tomorrow, along with AUS activation. Will post more later.",

      "Content": "I agree with Fairwind. Such was my case. Same age at time of surgery. I chose surgery for expediency and the surgeon had an excellent track record (I am still very pleased with his work). However I ended up needing SRT anyway for SVI. Given that your cancer includes the apex, you may need RT+HT as well, as most positive margins occur at the apex. BTW I just learned yesterday that my HT will be one full year and probably no more. And BTW my father received his radiologic training at Loyola. Good choice!",

At other big name cancer centers, it's 70-72 GY. Maybe that's why I am on ADT longer, to make up for the smaller dosage. MM - I posted about my RO visit yesterday on that other forum, but was going to wait until after tomorrow when I will have more info before posting here. My RO apparently plans on 68.4 Gy but no boost mentioned. Also learned that I will only be on Lupron thru the end of this year. Big relief. Next (and hopefully last) Lupron shot tomorrow, along with AUS activation. Will post more later.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by ANWANK ... he needs to go to urologist. His psa was 4.04. I started researching and thought that was not really high but we went earlier this week. Dr does another psa, dre and schedules a biopsy. DRE negative again and psa 4.1. He also said that his psa should not be over 2.5 at his age and typically should be about 0.7 or so. He recommended genetic testing. He stated that if his biopsy comes back negative he will submit to his insurance for an MRI guided biopsy. I guess I am slightly confused. I understand his family history plays a factor but with two negative dre,no symptoms, and slightly elevated psa, why does this urologist seem pretty confident that there is cancer? Has anyone here had a similar experience? Your doctor and the urologist are indeed doing a good job, and you are also fortunate that they are keeping you informed. Yes, I had somewhat of a similar experience, however my urologist kept me in the dark for a couple of years. Doctors are restricted in what they can do at various stages of diagnosis and treatment by standards of practice and even moreso by what the insurance companies will pay. Several years ago a gov't panel decided that PSA tests were resulting in too many men being \"over treated\". When my GP noted that my PSA was high for my age, he recommended that I see a urologist. The uro did a DRE which was \"normal\". In fact, every DRE was normal right up until the day four years later when my prostate was removed. You are fortunate that your doctor is recommending genetic testing and has informed you of the steps your fiance will go thru to be diagnosed and treated. I must also point out to you that if at any time you disagree with anything the doctor says then you always have the option of seeing another doctor (though may need insurance approval). Also he has the right to refuse ANY treatment he does not approve of. And of course, do your best to do your own research and educate yourself as much as you can, which apparently you are doing now. Good luck to you and your fiance, and hopefully in your lives together.",

      "Content": "John - I have not had that specific surgery, but have been advised that I may need an artificial sphincter - a different surgery. I am only five months post op and my RO says he has seen improvement up to ten months, so I am only halfway there. Problem is I have no urgency... I leak when I sneeze or pass gas, otherwise my urine just runs out of me and I am totally unaware of it... so much that pads or diapers are very impractical, and I tend to rely on an external or condom cath and leg bag. I see my Uro again in about ten days and hope to discuss options with him, as the therapist just keep saying more kegels, more kegels. I will ask my Uro if the sling is an option (honestly I haven't looked into it). The artificial sphincter would be a good fit in my case as I only have one testicle and the inflator bulb would take the place of the other one. I'll be watching this thread to see how you progress! As a former scout leader myself, I fully understand your concerns.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by ASAdvocate RobLee, Your case may fall into the category of constant inflammation increasing your odds of eventually getting significant prostate cancer. http://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/news/...rostate_cancer This is not unique to the prostate. It seems that wherever there is constant irritation, the chances for developing cancer are higher. Thank you ASA. I had considered that long term inflammation of the prostate probably contributed to or possibly brought about my PCa. I had been having difficulty urinating for several years and my Urologist had recommended saw palmetto, which I did use for many years. It did seem to help. So I cannot be certain just when it actually became prostate cancer, but I chose the point in time when my PSA shot up from 4 to 9.5, though I know that BPH can also cause an increase in PSA. From the first 9.5 in early 2014 onward it continued to climb steadily, so I have assumed that was when it became cancerous.",

      "Content": "I just gotta say, as everyone's saying that non-metastatic prostate cancer does not cause any pain, I had \"discomfort\" that went on for several years. While not like what the OP has described, I frequently had a constant burning sensation in my urethra. The only time it didn't burn was while I was urinating, so I knew it was probably not a venereal disease. My urologist put me on Cipro and that took care of it. He explained the burning and the elevated PSA as likely due to prostatitis. The burning would eventually return and require longer and longer courses of Cipro to yield relief. Turns out eventually that it was indeed prostate cancer. I can't entirely blame him though. I was content to know that it certainly appeared that I did not have cancer. I would have rather known up front, but everything was pointing to something else... other than the steadily escalating PSA. Fate finally intervened when my Uro retired and his partner took over my case. By then I just wanted to get it over with. So he long and short of it is, at least in my case, there can be physical symptoms of PCa. And looking back to when my PSA began to rise and remembering how crummy I was feeling both physically and emotionally, I can tell now that there were more than just a few warning signs.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by ASAdvocate RobLee, Your case may fall into the category of constant inflammation increasing your odds of eventually getting significant prostate cancer. http://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/news/...rostate_cancer This is not unique to the prostate. It seems that wherever there is constant irritation, the chances for developing cancer are higher. Thank you ASA. I had considered that long term inflammation of the prostate probably contributed to or possibly brought about my PCa. I had been having difficulty urinating for several years and my Urologist had recommended saw palmetto, which I did use for many years. It did seem to help. So I cannot be certain just when it actually became prostate cancer, but I chose the point in time when my PSA shot up from 4 to 9.5, though I know that BPH can also cause an increase in PSA. From the first 9.5 in early 2014 onward it continued to climb steadily, so I have assumed that was when it became cancerous.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by FeatherBoy Hi Rob, If you don't mind my asking, how long have you been on Lupron and why are you stopping it? It's been one full year, and originally it was only supposed to be one shot for six months to boost my adjuvant radiation... two months before, two months during, and two months after. But because of my incontinence and the requirement of holding a full bladder during RT, I had to make a tough decision on getting the AUS... then that required a revision surgery two weeks later, and all that had to heal a couple months before starting RT. Long story short, I wasn't able to start RT until about a year after the RALP, and my RO kept me on Lupron the whole time in order to hold my PSA down. Upon completion of the radiation, there was still two months left on the last six month Lupron shot, so it sounded like perfect timing. Then my RO told me that the radiation would continue to kill cancer cells for another 8-9 months afterwards. I had been reading a lot about various studies on how HT improves the effectiveness of RT by making the cancer cells more sensitive to destruction. That was the RO's original purpose in starting me on Lupron in the first place (reread first sentence of first paragraph). He said there were two studies, one with HT lasting for six months and one for two years, which concluded this added benefit. And the surgeon who did my RALP had told me that I would likely be on HT for three years! There is much discussion on another forum that I frequent about the optimal timing for HT. Many agree that the new standard is eighteen months. Sooo... by now I had heard everything from six months, to one year, 18 months, two years, and even three years. My RO was ready to stop the HT at one year, which is now this month. But as he had said the radiation would still be working for another six months from now, I \"volunteered\" to extend the HT by getting another six month shot this month. That way, both the radiation and the Lupron will be wearing off around the same time. My rationale was that I would rather throw everything I could at this cancer, rather than end treatment now and then find out later on down the road that I might need to go back on HT due to BCR. And because I've already had the maximum dose of radiation, there's no more rounds in the clip, so to speak. The cancer cells dying from the radiation will cause my PSA to bounce around until midway thru this year, and the Lupron shot I get next week will be effective until July, then will also take a while for it to exit my system. For that reason, I tell people that I won't know whether or not all this has worked until probably another year (2019 at the earliest). I have not discussed extending the Lupron any further with any of my doctors. Frankly, if it hasn't done its job at eighteen months, then I'm potentially risking the cancer becoming castrate resistant. I'd like to avoid that. At some point, I have to stop the treatments and see which way the PSA is going to go on its own, up or down. Sorry for the long story, and I hope it helps with the decisions you must make.",

      "Content": "Your confusion is understandable... the same thing happened to me - rising PSA but negative DRE and negative biopsy. I had been seeing the same urologist for twenty years, and when asked what to do next he said another biopsy. It seemed pointless to me. Then I heard about the MRI fusion biopsy. My uro said that required special training and his partner took over and yes it was cancer. My understanding is that the MRI fusion biopsy is fairly new and some insurance will not pay for it unless there has already been another previous biopsy (which you had). The traditional ultrasound guided biopsy uses ultrasound to locate the prostate but does not indicate varied densities within the prostate gland, which might suggest a tumor. With the MRI guided biopsy the surgeon can be guided directly to a suspicious region of the gland. In my case, only the lower right lobe was affected, but with an aggressive tumor. I don't want to frighten you, but this could possibly be your case as well. There are other ways your PSA could be elevated without the presence of a tumor, and it sounds like your uro is pursuing those. Getting another opinion from a different urologist is a good idea, though he may not find anything different. I lost a year between biopsies during which time the tumor spread, but fortunately not too far. In your case you say you have no other symptoms. In mine it was subtle. Up once every night around 4AM to pee which is not unusual at our age. I had reduced ejaculate but also thought maybe age. Just because the tests so far are negative doesn't necessarily mean there is nothing wrong. I guess all I can really say is you may become discouraged but don't give up. Good luck!",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by ANWANK ... he needs to go to urologist. His psa was 4.04. I started researching and thought that was not really high but we went earlier this week. Dr does another psa, dre and schedules a biopsy. DRE negative again and psa 4.1. He also said that his psa should not be over 2.5 at his age and typically should be about 0.7 or so. He recommended genetic testing. He stated that if his biopsy comes back negative he will submit to his insurance for an MRI guided biopsy. I guess I am slightly confused. I understand his family history plays a factor but with two negative dre,no symptoms, and slightly elevated psa, why does this urologist seem pretty confident that there is cancer? Has anyone here had a similar experience? Your doctor and the urologist are indeed doing a good job, and you are also fortunate that they are keeping you informed. Yes, I had somewhat of a similar experience, however my urologist kept me in the dark for a couple of years. Doctors are restricted in what they can do at various stages of diagnosis and treatment by standards of practice and even moreso by what the insurance companies will pay. Several years ago a gov't panel decided that PSA tests were resulting in too many men being \"over treated\". When my GP noted that my PSA was high for my age, he recommended that I see a urologist. The uro did a DRE which was \"normal\". In fact, every DRE was normal right up until the day four years later when my prostate was removed. You are fortunate that your doctor is recommending genetic testing and has informed you of the steps your fiance will go thru to be diagnosed and treated. I must also point out to you that if at any time you disagree with anything the doctor says then you always have the option of seeing another doctor (though may need insurance approval). Also he has the right to refuse ANY treatment he does not approve of. And of course, do your best to do your own research and educate yourself as much as you can, which apparently you are doing now. Good luck to you and your fiance, and hopefully in your lives together.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by po18guy Here is a doctor/researcher oriented video on the difficulties of T-Cell Lymphomas. Give it a brief watch and maybe ask her to watch with you. Look at the extreme depth of knowledge and the desire to control or eliminate these rare lymphomas. The jargon is very technical, but shows the profound efforts made by medical science in the effort to spare human life. These researchers hate cancer and live in the micro-cellular world in man's best attempt to eradicate it. http://www.oncologytube.com/video/ne...homas/10001079 Thanks, but first off I gotta say (and I'm sure you'll fix it) the video link is wrong... the text is correct if you copy and paste, but clicking on the link brings up a reply window. With that out of the way, I want to welcome you to the prostate forum. I know you've been here before as I've seen your replies to a few other posts. And of course I know you as moderator of the HL/NHL forum here. Interesting video. I enjoyed watching it as I have a deep appreciation for the seriousness and difficulty of the fight against cancer. I'm afraid if I show it to my wife the best I can hope is that it might make her feel fortunate to not have T-cell lymphoma. Worst case, well, she is one who feels that everything can be remedied with herbs and prayers, diet and exercise, essential oils, Reiki... I've seen it all. I have ordered the book and hope (and pray) that she will read it and maybe take it to heart. It says there is a Ken Burns documentary... I am slightly dyslexic and choose audio books if possible (it takes me forever to compose a post or reply here). Thanks for the reply and the links. I'm trying to work thru this.",

      "Content": "John - It's good to hear that you survived the surgery and here's hoping the sling does for you what you need. I remember that fish hook sensation from some testicular surgery I had mentioned earlier. Good thing, for me anyway, was that it wasn't there all the time. But when it hit, man, did it make itself known! As I recall, I used a bag of frozen veggies on my scrotum, rotating on and off every 15 minutes. That seemed to help more than anything else. Not sure if your doc said anything about that. Also slept on the recliner a lot. About the AMS800, I got the \"official\" word a couple weeks ago that I am definitely NOT a candidate for the sling, and it looks like the AUS is definitely in my future. I've posted a couple times here in the PCa forum and got zero replies. I guess most of the other bros here haven't had to deal with these issues (or at least not among currently active members). I've been spending some time on the American Cancer Society Cancer Survivors Network as there seem to be more guys who have had surgeries related to incontinence. Main problems there are the board is not as easy to navigate as this one (cancerforums.net) and a lot of the posts are several years old. I post comments and no one ever replies (I guess there's a lot of that about). Regarding the comments by Jeb above (I hope you're doing okay if you're reading Jeb) I had the opportunity to \"play\" with an AMS800 and speak with a mfr's rep. The device is a lot smaller than I expected. Jeb's comment about two replacements in a lifetime is actually due to tissue erosion rather than mechanical failure. Also there is a 25% revision rate, mostly due to replacement and sizing issues, again rather than mechanical failure. The cuff \"eats\" 2cm of urethra over a decade, and generally they can relocate the cuff twice before running out of urethra. While they're in there, they just replace the unit anyway, as a ten year old device is more likely to actually fail. You mentioned in your first post above that the sling would likely take you back to the level of urgency you had prior to your RP. As I've never had the urgency (I can hold as long as I need to, just not forever!) I am trying to think of what that would be like. I guess you will still wear a pad in case you don't \"make it?\" Oh well, I suppose only time will tell. Do not ever look back and question your decision to have the surgery... that will only drive you crazy. You had to do something, and it's done, over. Good luck in your continued recovery! Be sure to come back and tell us how things have worked out.",

      "Content": "Mike, congrats on the ultra-low PSA. I'm guessing you are not on any form of HT? If not then you are indeed fortunate! After my prostatectomy it was pretty much a given that I would need adjuvant radiation, and everything that followed was aimed at getting that underway... even though my PSA was low (\"undetectable\" by some measures, and .02-.03 by others). The T3B was what was always cited as justification. From what I've read it's 50/50 as to whether ART is actually necessary in such cases. I just wanted to get it over with. Since your PSA is so low I suppose the ball is up in the air. Good luck in your meeting with the doc next month. Mine was not very informative, but I just did what I was advised. I didn't do any shopping around, but did consider some alternatives and went with offices that were close to home rather than driving a couple hours a day in order to go to a \"center of excellence\" or whatever. I think it probably comes down to what you are comfortable with.",

      "Content": "I just gotta say, as everyone's saying that non-metastatic prostate cancer does not cause any pain, I had \"discomfort\" that went on for several years. While not like what the OP has described, I frequently had a constant burning sensation in my urethra. The only time it didn't burn was while I was urinating, so I knew it was probably not a venereal disease. My urologist put me on Cipro and that took care of it. He explained the burning and the elevated PSA as likely due to prostatitis. The burning would eventually return and require longer and longer courses of Cipro to yield relief. Turns out eventually that it was indeed prostate cancer. I can't entirely blame him though. I was content to know that it certainly appeared that I did not have cancer. I would have rather known up front, but everything was pointing to something else... other than the steadily escalating PSA. Fate finally intervened when my Uro retired and his partner took over my case. By then I just wanted to get it over with. So he long and short of it is, at least in my case, there can be physical symptoms of PCa. And looking back to when my PSA began to rise and remembering how crummy I was feeling both physically and emotionally, I can tell now that there were more than just a few warning signs.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by ASAdvocate ... RP would likely be left for only the more \"difficult\" cases.\" During a recent conversation with another RP(+HT+ART) survivor, the topic of Cyberknife came up and my wife reminded me that I was not a candidate for CK. I'm glad she remembered hearing that as my \"second set of ears\". CK also has its ardent proponents, who tend to believe that it is \"the only way to go\". During ART I met and got to know several other guys who were undergoing EBRT/SBRT as primary therapy. Bowel disruption was a big problem for some, and even more so for me, who had fewer treatments than them, but experienced disturbing SE's throughout the course. I'm guessing that the \"HDR/BT\" which seems to be the current rage is probably also not without side effects. I would suspect that these are typically downplayed before going into treatment and quickly forgotten afterwards, especially by those who had it and advocate it for everyone without regard to individual pathology. Not everyone goes into this with a G(3+3).",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by IceStationZebra I had shoulder surgery once and they gave me something called Versed while I was waiting\u2014not sure why\u2014but I don\u2019t remember anything from that point on despite having conversations with anesthesiologists and others. That is the purpose of administering Versed (usually with Fentanyl) pre-op is it blocks the formation of memories. So stuff happens, but you don't remember it... mainly, the pain. Been there many times myself. As for the TRUS biopsy and insurance... if it weren't for that, my cancer would have likely been discovered much sooner, and probably with a much better prognosis. Unfortunately, my urologist also never mentioned anything about this. Makes me mad just thinking about it. It seems to be so \"penny wise and pound foolish\". If they had been willing to pay for an inexpensive and painless MRI before my first prostate biopsy five years ago (this month!) then a simple RP probably would have eliminated the cancer before it had spread. But instead, there was much \"adjuvant\" therapy necessitated, at a high cost both to the healthcare system and to me in the way of lasting complications. It's just senseless. Especially since my latest Uro commented that it is nearly impossible to find tumors up near the bladder without an MRI.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by ANWANK ... he needs to go to urologist. His psa was 4.04. I started researching and thought that was not really high but we went earlier this week. Dr does another psa, dre and schedules a biopsy. DRE negative again and psa 4.1. He also said that his psa should not be over 2.5 at his age and typically should be about 0.7 or so. He recommended genetic testing. He stated that if his biopsy comes back negative he will submit to his insurance for an MRI guided biopsy. I guess I am slightly confused. I understand his family history plays a factor but with two negative dre,no symptoms, and slightly elevated psa, why does this urologist seem pretty confident that there is cancer? Has anyone here had a similar experience? Your doctor and the urologist are indeed doing a good job, and you are also fortunate that they are keeping you informed. Yes, I had somewhat of a similar experience, however my urologist kept me in the dark for a couple of years. Doctors are restricted in what they can do at various stages of diagnosis and treatment by standards of practice and even moreso by what the insurance companies will pay. Several years ago a gov't panel decided that PSA tests were resulting in too many men being \"over treated\". When my GP noted that my PSA was high for my age, he recommended that I see a urologist. The uro did a DRE which was \"normal\". In fact, every DRE was normal right up until the day four years later when my prostate was removed. You are fortunate that your doctor is recommending genetic testing and has informed you of the steps your fiance will go thru to be diagnosed and treated. I must also point out to you that if at any time you disagree with anything the doctor says then you always have the option of seeing another doctor (though may need insurance approval). Also he has the right to refuse ANY treatment he does not approve of. And of course, do your best to do your own research and educate yourself as much as you can, which apparently you are doing now. Good luck to you and your fiance, and hopefully in your lives together.",

      "Content": "John - I have not had that specific surgery, but have been advised that I may need an artificial sphincter - a different surgery. I am only five months post op and my RO says he has seen improvement up to ten months, so I am only halfway there. Problem is I have no urgency... I leak when I sneeze or pass gas, otherwise my urine just runs out of me and I am totally unaware of it... so much that pads or diapers are very impractical, and I tend to rely on an external or condom cath and leg bag. I see my Uro again in about ten days and hope to discuss options with him, as the therapist just keep saying more kegels, more kegels. I will ask my Uro if the sling is an option (honestly I haven't looked into it). The artificial sphincter would be a good fit in my case as I only have one testicle and the inflator bulb would take the place of the other one. I'll be watching this thread to see how you progress! As a former scout leader myself, I fully understand your concerns.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by ANWANK ... he needs to go to urologist. His psa was 4.04. I started researching and thought that was not really high but we went earlier this week. Dr does another psa, dre and schedules a biopsy. DRE negative again and psa 4.1. He also said that his psa should not be over 2.5 at his age and typically should be about 0.7 or so. He recommended genetic testing. He stated that if his biopsy comes back negative he will submit to his insurance for an MRI guided biopsy. I guess I am slightly confused. I understand his family history plays a factor but with two negative dre,no symptoms, and slightly elevated psa, why does this urologist seem pretty confident that there is cancer? Has anyone here had a similar experience? Your doctor and the urologist are indeed doing a good job, and you are also fortunate that they are keeping you informed. Yes, I had somewhat of a similar experience, however my urologist kept me in the dark for a couple of years. Doctors are restricted in what they can do at various stages of diagnosis and treatment by standards of practice and even moreso by what the insurance companies will pay. Several years ago a gov't panel decided that PSA tests were resulting in too many men being \"over treated\". When my GP noted that my PSA was high for my age, he recommended that I see a urologist. The uro did a DRE which was \"normal\". In fact, every DRE was normal right up until the day four years later when my prostate was removed. You are fortunate that your doctor is recommending genetic testing and has informed you of the steps your fiance will go thru to be diagnosed and treated. I must also point out to you that if at any time you disagree with anything the doctor says then you always have the option of seeing another doctor (though may need insurance approval). Also he has the right to refuse ANY treatment he does not approve of. And of course, do your best to do your own research and educate yourself as much as you can, which apparently you are doing now. Good luck to you and your fiance, and hopefully in your lives together.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by ASAdvocate ... RP would likely be left for only the more \"difficult\" cases.\" During a recent conversation with another RP(+HT+ART) survivor, the topic of Cyberknife came up and my wife reminded me that I was not a candidate for CK. I'm glad she remembered hearing that as my \"second set of ears\". CK also has its ardent proponents, who tend to believe that it is \"the only way to go\". During ART I met and got to know several other guys who were undergoing EBRT/SBRT as primary therapy. Bowel disruption was a big problem for some, and even more so for me, who had fewer treatments than them, but experienced disturbing SE's throughout the course. I'm guessing that the \"HDR/BT\" which seems to be the current rage is probably also not without side effects. I would suspect that these are typically downplayed before going into treatment and quickly forgotten afterwards, especially by those who had it and advocate it for everyone without regard to individual pathology. Not everyone goes into this with a G(3+3).",

      "Content": "John - It's good to hear that you survived the surgery and here's hoping the sling does for you what you need. I remember that fish hook sensation from some testicular surgery I had mentioned earlier. Good thing, for me anyway, was that it wasn't there all the time. But when it hit, man, did it make itself known! As I recall, I used a bag of frozen veggies on my scrotum, rotating on and off every 15 minutes. That seemed to help more than anything else. Not sure if your doc said anything about that. Also slept on the recliner a lot. About the AMS800, I got the \"official\" word a couple weeks ago that I am definitely NOT a candidate for the sling, and it looks like the AUS is definitely in my future. I've posted a couple times here in the PCa forum and got zero replies. I guess most of the other bros here haven't had to deal with these issues (or at least not among currently active members). I've been spending some time on the American Cancer Society Cancer Survivors Network as there seem to be more guys who have had surgeries related to incontinence. Main problems there are the board is not as easy to navigate as this one (cancerforums.net) and a lot of the posts are several years old. I post comments and no one ever replies (I guess there's a lot of that about). Regarding the comments by Jeb above (I hope you're doing okay if you're reading Jeb) I had the opportunity to \"play\" with an AMS800 and speak with a mfr's rep. The device is a lot smaller than I expected. Jeb's comment about two replacements in a lifetime is actually due to tissue erosion rather than mechanical failure. Also there is a 25% revision rate, mostly due to replacement and sizing issues, again rather than mechanical failure. The cuff \"eats\" 2cm of urethra over a decade, and generally they can relocate the cuff twice before running out of urethra. While they're in there, they just replace the unit anyway, as a ten year old device is more likely to actually fail. You mentioned in your first post above that the sling would likely take you back to the level of urgency you had prior to your RP. As I've never had the urgency (I can hold as long as I need to, just not forever!) I am trying to think of what that would be like. I guess you will still wear a pad in case you don't \"make it?\" Oh well, I suppose only time will tell. Do not ever look back and question your decision to have the surgery... that will only drive you crazy. You had to do something, and it's done, over. Good luck in your continued recovery! Be sure to come back and tell us how things have worked out.",

One year anniversary of RP at the end of this month. Had an early endoscopy a cpl months ago, as I start RT in ten days. Tried to fit in a colonoscopy also but all my docs said I was trying to do too much. Taking Nexium every morning since back when it was Rx. Fortunately one of only a few meds I take regularly. I've been told one in five cases of Barrett's becomes cancerous.",

When I was diagnosed 3 years ago my doc told me only about 2-3% of Barrets becomes cancer. Looks like I was given some erroneous information. Wikipedia says: \"The study found that every year, 0.12 percent of the Barrett's patients \u2014 or about one in 860 people \u2014 go on to develop cancer of the esophagus, a disease that is particularly lethal. The figure was much lower than the estimate of 0.5 percent stemming from earlier studies. The 0.5 figure was probably misread by the doctor who told me one in five. Dave - no side effects from long term use of Protonix? Of course, three years is a little different from ten years. Still, I'm wondering why my doctor had me on Prevacid and then Nexium, when Protonix might have worked better. It was never mentioned.",

Looking back on your last posts and it was just after we got the all clear from my wife's oncologist and just before my AUS surgery, which didn't work out very well. Long story. Anyway, today the AUS was NOT activated, which was supposed to be the \"big day\". Long and short of it is, I'm still waiting to schedule my SRT, but hopefully it will still be within the 12 month window post-RP. So good luck with your own SRT. Do you have a target date yet? What I know about RT is just what I've read here, but I'm hoping to get some pointers from the RO at our next meeting in about a month. Isn't it a bite in the arse when you come out of surgery and are told, \"great news! We got MOST of the cancer.\"",

      "Content": "HT with ART/SRT has become standard procedure nowadays, whether or not clinical recommendations are yet to be published. There have been enough studies to show that there is an advantage to concomitant HT with RT. What varies is the actual protocol. In a moderate risk situation such as your own, most likely it will be Lupron only for six months... two months before starting RT, two months during RT and two months afterwards. This is easily accomplished with a single six month depot shot. In cases of higher grade PCa or active mets, oral Casodex is administered for two weeks prior to the injection to minimize the Lupron \"flare\" which can exacerbate existing tumors. Also in higher grade cancers the HT may be extended to a total of 18 months. Prior standards went to 2 or 3 years, but recent evidence shows that 18 months is equally effective. Also, the radiation will continue to kill cancer cells for 8-9 months after treatment ends. If you do end up in the HT/RT boat, there are a number of us here who have been down the same path. So don't hesitate to ask questions. We've probably already been through it before you. Good luck!",

      "Content": "Greetings from another T3B'er. Medical marijuana is now legal where we live, but finding it is not easy. My wife recently overcame lymphoma and asked her Hemoncologist about CBD and MMJ. He advised against buying 'street' drugs because you don't know what else might be in it and it could interfere with her chemo. He said that he was not licensed to prescribe MMJ. We found a 'doctor' who does but never paid him a visit. It looked like it was going to be expensive and of course not covered by insurance (our co-pay last year was $10,000). We have purchased several bottles of CBD oil. I did not like the taste and it did nothing for me, but she used it for some time, then stopped. As far as pain relief, perhaps if I had bone mets I might think differently about it. Since I've had three abdominal surgeries in the past nine months and she had spinal, pelvic and cranial tumors, we both have a large collection of narcotics, anti-spasmotics, mood stabilizers and so on that are far more effective. She likes to get high sometimes now that she is done with chemo, and even though I spent probably a third of my life getting high, I no longer enjoy it. Occasionally someone in chat will ask about CBD oil and I refer them to the manufacturers website. We do have a lot of information between my wife and I on alternative treatments. But I strongly believe in traditional medicine. Her doctors have explained the importance of empirical evidence to us and I believe them. There is none that support any claims of efficacy for MMJ or CBD oil other than the relief of nausea and a perceived reduction of pain.",

      "Content": "Well, you definitely have cancer, and you are fortunate that it was found on the first biopsy (though unfortunate that it struck you at a fairly young age). Good news is that if your pathology remains 3+4 then it has just recently begun to progress. Now is the time to strike, while it is in its infancy, so to speak. For someone still young, and assuming in good health, surgical prostatectomy is generally suggested as you have an excellent chance of full recovery, plus the prostate gland once removed can be dissected and thoroughly examined in a lab to determine the true extent of the cancer. If it perhaps may have begun to spread, which is unlikely for grade 3 but possible for grade 4, then you will still have the option of radiation treatment \"down the road\". If radiation is chosen as the first line treatment, that is generally no longer an option. Still you should speak with several specialists before making your decision. Good luck in you treatment and your recovery!",

      "Content": "HT with ART/SRT has become standard procedure nowadays, whether or not clinical recommendations are yet to be published. There have been enough studies to show that there is an advantage to concomitant HT with RT. What varies is the actual protocol. In a moderate risk situation such as your own, most likely it will be Lupron only for six months... two months before starting RT, two months during RT and two months afterwards. This is easily accomplished with a single six month depot shot. In cases of higher grade PCa or active mets, oral Casodex is administered for two weeks prior to the injection to minimize the Lupron \"flare\" which can exacerbate existing tumors. Also in higher grade cancers the HT may be extended to a total of 18 months. Prior standards went to 2 or 3 years, but recent evidence shows that 18 months is equally effective. Also, the radiation will continue to kill cancer cells for 8-9 months after treatment ends. If you do end up in the HT/RT boat, there are a number of us here who have been down the same path. So don't hesitate to ask questions. We've probably already been through it before you. Good luck!",

      "Content": "Well, you definitely have cancer, and you are fortunate that it was found on the first biopsy (though unfortunate that it struck you at a fairly young age). Good news is that if your pathology remains 3+4 then it has just recently begun to progress. Now is the time to strike, while it is in its infancy, so to speak. For someone still young, and assuming in good health, surgical prostatectomy is generally suggested as you have an excellent chance of full recovery, plus the prostate gland once removed can be dissected and thoroughly examined in a lab to determine the true extent of the cancer. If it perhaps may have begun to spread, which is unlikely for grade 3 but possible for grade 4, then you will still have the option of radiation treatment \"down the road\". If radiation is chosen as the first line treatment, that is generally no longer an option. Still you should speak with several specialists before making your decision. Good luck in you treatment and your recovery!",

      "Content": "First let me extend an unwanted welcome to the cancer forums network. A few things that may not be immediately apparent. Yes, Gleason 8 is serious, and considered to be very high risk. And I do have a lot of personal experience with it. Because of the positive seminal vesicle invasion, your husband is at stage 3B, which is the last stage before stage 4 or distant metastasis. You were fortunate to have caught it when you did. The bone scan will hopefully rule out bone metastasis and the CT/PET scan any organ involvement. If that is the case, then his cancer remains very treatable. Of the three treatments mentioned above, I am currently in phase three (first surgery, then hormone therapy, and currently radiation). It will admittedly be difficult. Looking back, if I had to do this over again I would have investigated everything there is to learn about PCa (as you are doing now) and second, headed straight to a major cancer center, such as JH. But we don't get any do-overs. But I should reassure you that even though there is nothing wrong with changing to another doctor or treatment facility, your husband probably has every likelihood of being successfully treated locally. The doctor's cavalier attitude and remark about discussing the results over a drink were not to downplay the seriousness of this diagnosis, but to put you both at ease so that you can CALMLY make this very important decision. Your doctor sees this every day. On the other hand, this is your first (and hopefully only) cancer diagnosis, or at least prostate cancer. The urologist can be calm about it and speak of unemotionally, and he would prefer that you not make any decision in haste. And as Michael mentioned above, there is a necessary cooling off period following a biopsy before treatment can begin. Take a deep breath. Study as much as you can. Prepare a list of questions. Talk with others... you will be amazed at how many men in their sixties have or had prostate cancer.This is not to diminish your fear and anxiety, but please realize that many MANY men have been thru this. Some are even worse off, and many more had it much easier. In your husband's case, there will be many unknowns ahead of you, because G8 is not the best, but neither is it the worst.

      "Content": "I would say that you have good reason to be concerned. It may indeed be nothing to be alarmed about, but as you said, it may become an entirely different situation a few years from now. Your PSA is rising rapidly, but urologists tend to be unconcerned about PSA alone. I suspect there was something left behind that your surgeon isn't going to own up to, so to speak. As Djin and Fairwind stated, you need to be speaking with a radiation oncologist now. Your urologists job is done, other than maybe checking your PSA now and then to measure your progress. Generally recurrence is declared when PSA reaches 0.2, though more recently they have been using 0.03 as the threshold. You are well beyond that now. And you are correct that scans will likely not detect anything at your low levels. In general, various types of scans have a minimum threshold PSA level necessary for detection: PET-PSMA = 0.6 ng/ml PET-F18 Flurocholine = 1.8 ng/ml PET- F18 (Axumin) = 2.0 MRI-Feraheme = 2.5 MRI-C11/F18 = 2.5 MRI-Ga = 10.0 Traditional CT = 20.0 Nuclear Bone scan = 30.0 As you can see, you would need a PSA of 2.0 for the majority of these, and your pre-op scan was probably the same nuclear bone scan that most of us had. Statistics show that radiation initiated within the first two years following RP usually has a better outcome than waiting to cross a BCR threshold.",

Fortunately your lymph nodes and seminal vesicles were apparently not involved. I don't know how that actually causes your body to produce the PSA, but apparently it does. Here is a good article on extraprostatic extension http://www.harvardprostateknowledge....-prostatectomy ... The author states that 10-20% of RP patients have positive margins. I think you're handling it pretty well. You knew there would be radiation afterwards, and this is why. Similar situation for me. I too see my RO next week, and I have been afraid that my PSA might start to climb but have been lucky so far. You will pull thru this just fine. There are a few of us T3 guys here and they're all still posting. Keep your spirits up and remember that none of this is abnormal. If anything, the fact that your PSA has already begun to rise will likely mean that you will probably need to begin radiation sooner rather than later. Good luck!",

If anything, the fact that your PSA has already begun to rise will likely mean that you will probably need to begin radiation sooner rather than later. Good luck!",

Also, who prescribed the Welbutrin, and for what? Perhaps your meds need to be adjusted. Just having cancer can cause depression. I believe that if you believe there may be something wrong, then that is reason enough to have it investigated.",

      "Content": "I would say that you have good reason to be concerned. It may indeed be nothing to be alarmed about, but as you said, it may become an entirely different situation a few years from now. Your PSA is rising rapidly, but urologists tend to be unconcerned about PSA alone. I suspect there was something left behind that your surgeon isn't going to own up to, so to speak. As Djin and Fairwind stated, you need to be speaking with a radiation oncologist now. Your urologists job is done, other than maybe checking your PSA now and then to measure your progress. Generally recurrence is declared when PSA reaches 0.2, though more recently they have been using 0.03 as the threshold. You are well beyond that now. And you are correct that scans will likely not detect anything at your low levels. In general, various types of scans have a minimum threshold PSA level necessary for detection: PET-PSMA = 0.6 ng/ml PET-F18 Flurocholine = 1.8 ng/ml PET- F18 (Axumin) = 2.0 MRI-Feraheme = 2.5 MRI-C11/F18 = 2.5 MRI-Ga = 10.0 Traditional CT = 20.0 Nuclear Bone scan = 30.0 As you can see, you would need a PSA of 2.0 for the majority of these, and your pre-op scan was probably the same nuclear bone scan that most of us had. Statistics show that radiation initiated within the first two years following RP usually has a better outcome than waiting to cross a BCR threshold.",

      "Content": "Yes, Tena does offer a trial pack with one each of three different absorbances at http://www.tena.us/mens-products/Men,en_US,sc.html The moderate absorbency (\"three drops\") guards are the most popular and for some reason are the cheapest at $10 per 48 count pack. The light \"shields\" (one drop) cost around a dollar each, which I don't understand why that is. I've never tried the heaviest or the ultra light. I tried Tena because a nurse when I had my prostatectomy said her husband uses them because they are the quietest ones and do not make swishing sounds when you walk. I had tried Depends and found they were way too bulky. Ultimately I landed upon maternity nursing pads from Amazon. They are $10 for a pack of 120, are highly absorbent and stick right where you want them in your shorts without creating a bulge in your pants, and they do not become lumpy.",

Will you be continuing the Lupron after that last shot in December? You and I came here around the same time. My biopsy was a week before yours and I too just passed the two year mark. This past week was my first time NOT getting another six month shot, and I am anxiously waiting for the stuff to finally wear off over the next couple of years. I'm guessing you still have the option of SRT in the future if things go south, but hopefully you won't be needing that. God bless.",

      "Content": "OTS - if I may, I suspect one of your \"problems\" is that you have entirely too much information! Granted, data collection and analysis is an important important step in any project, but in my experience, this is not just another project. My employers, and in most cases I worked directly for the CEO, COO or CFO, they relied upon my instinct and intuition... hunches, gut feelings, even more than my analytical skills. Among the best executives I worked with were those who were able to make quick decisions based upon limited information, and deal with the fallout later. And I suppose that's how it went with my cancer. I knew very little going in (as has been my entire life, it seems). I knew my PSA was high at 25, after a couple years of frequent testing. It was finally suggested that I should get an MRI. The uro interpreted the radiology report, suggesting that my PCa was contained but was near the capsule. I knew I only had months to act, and that I might need radiation after surgery. That's about it. Turns out the tumor had already invaded the capsule. Did that occur during the two months between biopsy and surgery? I don't know. In the months following surgery I learned quite a lot. I'm not sure that ANY of it would have altered my course of treatment. When I read of other guys who had PHI's and deciphers and pirads and all this other \"information\" to work with, it burns me up that my original Uro never offered anything other than Cipro. And even though my tumor consumed 25% of my prostate, he managed to miss it entirely. Makes me mad just thinking about it. But I did by necessity need to act swiftly. In addition, we had put our house on the market. Contracts had been signed. We were renovating our retirement condo a thousand miles away. My entire PCa debacle was but another annoyance that I had to deal with, and deal with quickly. Those who have the luxury of time often spend too much of it trying to calculate the odds in a game where you have little control and absolutely no foreknowledge of on which side of the coin you will ultimately land. From my post-op pathology it was shown that my greatest \"tumor contact length\" (though it wasn't called that) was 6mm. Yet the CA had invaded both seminal vesicles. Presumably had I waited much longer it would have been on its way to the lymphatic system, and the story would likely have an entirely different outcome. Sometimes you just gotta fly with the seat of your pants.",

      "Content": "MM & mjimsr, your cases are different but have one thing big thing in common... you are considering elective surgery that will make a major change in something that you do all day, every day for the rest of your life. I am not trying to talk anyone out of getting the AUS, as I understand that the majority of recipients are totally satisfied with their implant, and I wish I were one of them. There are a number of guys with the AMS800 who post in other forums. Only a few had any problems. I thoroughly researched the AMS800 before having the surgery. It was a time of great anxiety. MM, I had forgotten about the radiation thing, but now I do remember my Uro informing me that it is better to have the device implanted before radiation rather than after. This was about 7 months after my RP and I was trying to schedule my adjuvant RT, and due to my severe incontinence, I needed the AUS in order to proceed with my next phase of treatment. I have spoken with several other guys who had the implant and one guy who'd had radiation before the surgery had his removed immediately. I think he said he would try again after further time to heal from the RT. Another guy told me his was not installed properly. That's pretty much what happened on my first attempt. He never tried again and now wears pads. Most others seems happy. Let's say you decide you are going to buy a pickup truck to drive to work (I've always owned a sedan or small wagon). I've never owned one but I'm guessing there are some tradeoffs that maybe you never thought of before making that decision, like where you can park it and how many passengers and how much luggage you can transport. And you can't magically turn it into a six passenger sedan when you need to. So with the AUS, you can't pee without squeezing the pump in your scrotum. Sounds simple, but this is EVERY TIME you have to pee. There's no way without doing that. Mjimsr, this is for you. I understand your need, but you're thinking of the horse and not the wagon. Plus there is a lot of discomfort involved. Simply sitting down becomes a different matter. When the cuff makes contact with a hard seat such as a bench, it causes a little squirt. Plus such seats become painful quickly. You end up squirming in your seat and ppl winder what's going on. My scrotum was tender for about the first year and finding a \"numb\" spot to squeeze became a challenge. Plus, in my case, when the surgeon replaced the original AUS with a new one, he somehow damaged a nerve, which causes some pain even sitting in some cushioned seats. And now, as some surgeons do, he seems to want nothing to do with me now, or at least not acknowledge in any way that his treatment was less than optimal. So I'm just saying that \"it can happen\". You MAY be buying a lemon, so to speak. The device itself is reliable, and the reason for having it routinely replaced is because the cuff eventually erodes the urethra, which requires another surgery, and while they're in there they just replace all the hardware. This is every 5-10 years, and each surgery carries its own risks. Mine just happened sooner than most. And eventually you run out of a viable space on your urethra to place the cuff. I'd love to write more and more, but there's a lot more material to cover than I can express here. This forum in particular, CFN, has no other AUS recipients that I know of. That's one reason why I was so stressed last year when I was making my decision. I found a few other forums with guys who have the AUS, and as I said, most are happy with theirs. So you probably stand to gain everything you hope for, but it won't be \"cheap\" in the form of physical, bodily costs. So not trying to discourage either of you, but just to make you aware that it's not a panacea. It's like anything else you buy... beforehand it seems like it will do everything you hoped for. But once you own it, you discover the flaws. I'm sure we'll be writing more about this in the future. Good luck, guys!",

      "Content": "MM, presumably by now you are in the doc's office or back from there. I did not want to present any \"bad news\" when you have your hopes up, but... You already know how well my AUS went, and I blame it all on choosing a younger surgeon rather than going with the older, arrogant, and likely more experienced guy. I had pressed my would-be surgeon for a number of how many of these he had done, but he evaded the question twice. That should have been a red flag, but I wanted to stay with his practice because their facilities are nearby and they might still be around when I'm 80. I was promised a 45 minute procedure, home that afternoon, and no catheter. Well, it was nothing like that. But eventually it did work, and I got my adjuvant radiation done. The AUS leaks and I must wear a pad at all times, and I sleep with a dry washcloth in my crotch... even when I need to get up in the middle of the night. If I don't, then sure enough, I either drip or sometimes even squirt. But, it is still better than going thru 8-10 wet pads every day. If I had it to do over again, I would still do it, but would do it differently. As for the implant, the whole things seems to me to be very bulky and awkward. If sex is REALLY important to you, then I guess you could put up with it. My wife is a nurse and says some of her patients had one and it was heavy and whenever the patient turned in bed it was like having a tail. I say \"no way\". I have enough hardware to manage already. The AUS's fittings sometimes pinch in my shorts.. I couldn't imagine having even more mechanical parts to deal with. I know you are a younger man, and in my case the testosterone is taking it's time coming back. I still don't feel a damn thing and wonder if and when I ever will again. With my wife and I both having had to deal with multiple cancers, we just consider ourselves fortunate to be alive and mobile. We still have great memories of the great sex we had for several decades, but life is telling us it's time to move beyond that. As I understand it, both implants can be done during the same surgery. But remembering how bruised up I was after the AUS and the residual nerve damage that I still have from that procedure, I'm glad I never considered an additional implant. Be sure you talk to other guys who have the pump up penis and get their take on it. I've heard they work well, but I'm sure there is a price to pay in the form of discomfort when you're NOT using it. Good luck John.",

The light \"shields\" (one drop) cost around a dollar each, which I don't understand why that is. I've never tried the heaviest or the ultra light. I tried Tena because a nurse when I had my prostatectomy said her husband uses them because they are the quietest ones and do not make swishing sounds when you walk. I had tried Depends and found they were way too bulky. Ultimately I landed upon maternity nursing pads from Amazon. They are $10 for a pack of 120, are highly absorbent and stick right where you want them in your shorts without creating a bulge in your pants, and they do not become lumpy.",

My Uro then informed me that the MRI guided biopsy requires specialized training. Once my case was turned over to to another Uro, I was given the MRI and a fusion biopsy which identified the tumor in my prostate. I wish this had been done two years earlier, as I am certain I could have avoided a lot of complications from the cancer having spread and requiring more aggressive treatment. The fact that your Uro is willing to order additional tests is a good sign that he/they are taking your case seriously. I feel as though my Uro just blew off my case and left me up the creek.

      "Content": "As has been mentioned, I think the perceived discrepancy in statistics can be attributed to just how big is the yardstick being used. The figure I've heard most is that one in twenty or 5% will have not regained continence within one year, with the average being six months... some enjoying immediate continence but more realistically three months, and most healing having occurred by 9-10 months. So just what is full continence? The guy who wears a pad because he may leak once a week probably balances out the guy who DOESN'T wear a pad because he only leaks once a week. Does the guy who has a headache or indigestion a couple times a month have a chronic condition, or is that just life? It's like trying to \"grade your pain level\" at the clinic... for some people everything is a 10. When my leg was crushed by a truck I called it a 4. There's a big difference in how continence statistics are reported as it is all subjective and anecdotal. And of course, the hysteria over incontinence and \"overtreatment\" that sent everyone running to radiation has guys disregarding the real risks (including incontinence) of RT, with the RO's downplaying or even refuting some serious SE's by merely stating that \"some bowel disruption is the be expected\". Unfortunately I've had a lot of experience with incontinence, but for anyone dropping in on this thread you should realize that my situation is not typical. Most guys who get RP seem to recover just fine. If you were like me, your ability to pee wasn't all that terrific before having RP, or RT for that matter. But I was in a bit of a time crunch and my treatments had to progress on to the next phase without a lot of time to enjoy a full recovery in between crises.",

He never tried again and now wears pads. Most others seems happy. Let's say you decide you are going to buy a pickup truck to drive to work (I've always owned a sedan or small wagon). I've never owned one but I'm guessing there are some tradeoffs that maybe you never thought of before making that decision, like where you can park it and how many passengers and how much luggage you can transport. And you can't magically turn it into a six passenger sedan when you need to. So with the AUS, you can't pee without squeezing the pump in your scrotum. Sounds simple, but this is EVERY TIME you have to pee. There's no way without doing that. Mjimsr, this is for you. I understand your need, but you're thinking of the horse and not the wagon. Plus there is a lot of discomfort involved. Simply sitting down becomes a different matter. When the cuff makes contact with a hard seat such as a bench, it causes a little squirt. Plus such seats become painful quickly. You end up squirming in your seat and ppl winder what's going on. My scrotum was tender for about the first year and finding a \"numb\" spot to squeeze became a challenge. Plus, in my case, when the surgeon replaced the original AUS with a new one, he somehow damaged a nerve, which causes some pain even sitting in some cushioned seats. And now, as some surgeons do, he seems to want nothing to do with me now, or at least not acknowledge in any way that his treatment was less than optimal. So I'm just saying that \"it can happen\". You MAY be buying a lemon, so to speak. The device itself is reliable, and the reason for having it routinely replaced is because the cuff eventually erodes the urethra, which requires another surgery, and while they're in there they just replace all the hardware. This is every 5-10 years, and each surgery carries its own risks. Mine just happened sooner than most. And eventually you run out of a viable space on your urethra to place the cuff. I'd love to write more and more, but there's a lot more material to cover than I can express here. This forum in particular, CFN, has no other AUS recipients that I know of. That's one reason why I was so stressed last year when I was making my decision. I found a few other forums with guys who have the AUS, and as I said, most are happy with theirs. So you probably stand to gain everything you hope for, but it won't be \"cheap\" in the form of physical, bodily costs. So not trying to discourage either of you, but just to make you aware that it's not a panacea. It's like anything else you buy... beforehand it seems like it will do everything you hoped for. But once you own it, you discover the flaws. I'm sure we'll be writing more about this in the future. Good luck, guys!",

      "Content": "As has been mentioned, I think the perceived discrepancy in statistics can be attributed to just how big is the yardstick being used. The figure I've heard most is that one in twenty or 5% will have not regained continence within one year, with the average being six months... some enjoying immediate continence but more realistically three months, and most healing having occurred by 9-10 months. So just what is full continence? The guy who wears a pad because he may leak once a week probably balances out the guy who DOESN'T wear a pad because he only leaks once a week. Does the guy who has a headache or indigestion a couple times a month have a chronic condition, or is that just life? It's like trying to \"grade your pain level\" at the clinic... for some people everything is a 10. When my leg was crushed by a truck I called it a 4. There's a big difference in how continence statistics are reported as it is all subjective and anecdotal. And of course, the hysteria over incontinence and \"overtreatment\" that sent everyone running to radiation has guys disregarding the real risks (including incontinence) of RT, with the RO's downplaying or even refuting some serious SE's by merely stating that \"some bowel disruption is the be expected\". Unfortunately I've had a lot of experience with incontinence, but for anyone dropping in on this thread you should realize that my situation is not typical. Most guys who get RP seem to recover just fine. If you were like me, your ability to pee wasn't all that terrific before having RP, or RT for that matter. But I was in a bit of a time crunch and my treatments had to progress on to the next phase without a lot of time to enjoy a full recovery in between crises.",

      "Content": "MM, presumably by now you are in the doc's office or back from there. I did not want to present any \"bad news\" when you have your hopes up, but... You already know how well my AUS went, and I blame it all on choosing a younger surgeon rather than going with the older, arrogant, and likely more experienced guy. I had pressed my would-be surgeon for a number of how many of these he had done, but he evaded the question twice. That should have been a red flag, but I wanted to stay with his practice because their facilities are nearby and they might still be around when I'm 80. I was promised a 45 minute procedure, home that afternoon, and no catheter. Well, it was nothing like that. But eventually it did work, and I got my adjuvant radiation done. The AUS leaks and I must wear a pad at all times, and I sleep with a dry washcloth in my crotch... even when I need to get up in the middle of the night. If I don't, then sure enough, I either drip or sometimes even squirt. But, it is still better than going thru 8-10 wet pads every day. If I had it to do over again, I would still do it, but would do it differently. As for the implant, the whole things seems to me to be very bulky and awkward. If sex is REALLY important to you, then I guess you could put up with it. My wife is a nurse and says some of her patients had one and it was heavy and whenever the patient turned in bed it was like having a tail. I say \"no way\". I have enough hardware to manage already. The AUS's fittings sometimes pinch in my shorts.. I couldn't imagine having even more mechanical parts to deal with. I know you are a younger man, and in my case the testosterone is taking it's time coming back. I still don't feel a damn thing and wonder if and when I ever will again. With my wife and I both having had to deal with multiple cancers, we just consider ourselves fortunate to be alive and mobile. We still have great memories of the great sex we had for several decades, but life is telling us it's time to move beyond that. As I understand it, both implants can be done during the same surgery. But remembering how bruised up I was after the AUS and the residual nerve damage that I still have from that procedure, I'm glad I never considered an additional implant. Be sure you talk to other guys who have the pump up penis and get their take on it. I've heard they work well, but I'm sure there is a price to pay in the form of discomfort when you're NOT using it. Good luck John.",

      "Content": "David, welcome to CFN, and good luck with your remaining RT treatments! You may be pleased to know that I just had my third post-trifecta checkup with my Uro (RP+HT+RT) and he informed me that T3B's who undergo the trifecta are the least likely to ever experience future recurrence, compared to those who go with RP or RT+HT alone. I know it is not an easy decision deciding which way to go, but it was my choice to throw everything at the beast and it appears at least for now that I have won. I am assuming that you regained continence quickly as you went into RT in just four months post-op. And I'm curious if you are also on HT. Many RO's now include HT with adjuvant radiation. Be sure to read the sticky in the blue area at the top of the main page on \"what to expect from EBRT\". There are potential side effects but many can be controlled thru using a modified diet (and no, it's NOT all veggies!) Good luck to you going forward and we're all hoping you can soon join me here in the 0.0 PSA club.",

      "Content": "Yesterday was my 35th ART treatments using the RapidArc, and also had my final meeting with my RO. I now have only four more treatments to go! We discussed how long I should remain on Lupron and between the two of us concluded 18 months total. I asked if 2 years would be preferable and he said no, that it could reduce the efficacy of HT in the event of a future recurrence. He also said we could stop at one year if I was not tolerating it well, and I said I can do another six months okay. Note this is just Lupron, no Casodex. My only other meds are Venlafaxine and Gabapentin for the hot flashes and mood swings. Additionally he informed me that the radiation will continue to kill cancer cells for about another nine more months after RT ends, so another nine months of HT (when my next shot will wear off) will nicely cross over with the curve of the RT's effective life. It seems like a good plan. Also he said that my testosterone should return around nine months after the Lupron wears off. Also we will not know for sure whether or not all this has worked until after three consecutive PSA tests after everything has ended, worn off, and stabilized... so we're looking at 2019 (yes, 2019) before we know for sure. It's going to be a long 18 months, which will bring my struggle to a total of five years since my first biopsy. We will be glad when all this is over with. BTW Lori has her first six month CT in a couple of weeks, and she is currently in the throes of 'scanxiety'. We still discuss which of us might outlive the other. It is a necessary discussion, to keep things real. But after dealing with two cancers, a hurricane, a bat infestation and renovating two homes, I think I can handle another 18 months of watchful waiting. We're just looking forward to a time when we might go an entire month without one of us undergoing some form of treatment.",

      "Content": "I'm just about five years behind you, Jim.... 66 years old, prostate removed last year, and was originally supposed to begin salvage radiation next month because the cancer had already begun to spread beyond the prostate. However, I still have very little bladder control PLUS I need to drive my wife to all-day chemo four times a month. The radiation will halt any continence healing and requires treatment every day for two months (essentially). So the SRT has been postponed for now until 1) I get some bladder control and 2) my wife ends her chemo. I've had one meeting with the radiation oncologist and will see him in a couple weeks. As I understand, you (or I) need to show up every weekday with an empty bowel and full bladder. I'm guessing the empty bowel part is what requires the 'prep' mentioned above. And without bladder control, mine won't be full upon arrival. As far as side effects, the only one I've heard others mention is fatigue. Some who had treatment in earlier years experienced bowel changes, but that may have been before the procedure had improved. Once you've seen your RO and I have seen mine, maybe we can compare notes. Mine says it is best to get started on RT before the PSA begins to rise. He also says hormone therapy administered along with RT has demonstrated superior results, so he started me on that last month to prevent the PSA from rising. My next PSA is in about ten days. So far it has remained low. At your age, I don't know to say. I do know a guy now 82 who underwent RP plus SRT when he was around my age and says everything went well. I'm sure other guys with more experience under their belt will chime in here. Good luck, Jim!",

      "Content": "OTS - if I may, I suspect one of your \"problems\" is that you have entirely too much information! Granted, data collection and analysis is an important important step in any project, but in my experience, this is not just another project. My employers, and in most cases I worked directly for the CEO, COO or CFO, they relied upon my instinct and intuition... hunches, gut feelings, even more than my analytical skills. Among the best executives I worked with were those who were able to make quick decisions based upon limited information, and deal with the fallout later. And I suppose that's how it went with my cancer. I knew very little going in (as has been my entire life, it seems). I knew my PSA was high at 25, after a couple years of frequent testing. It was finally suggested that I should get an MRI. The uro interpreted the radiology report, suggesting that my PCa was contained but was near the capsule. I knew I only had months to act, and that I might need radiation after surgery. That's about it. Turns out the tumor had already invaded the capsule. Did that occur during the two months between biopsy and surgery? I don't know. In the months following surgery I learned quite a lot. I'm not sure that ANY of it would have altered my course of treatment. When I read of other guys who had PHI's and deciphers and pirads and all this other \"information\" to work with, it burns me up that my original Uro never offered anything other than Cipro. And even though my tumor consumed 25% of my prostate, he managed to miss it entirely. Makes me mad just thinking about it. But I did by necessity need to act swiftly. In addition, we had put our house on the market. Contracts had been signed. We were renovating our retirement condo a thousand miles away. My entire PCa debacle was but another annoyance that I had to deal with, and deal with quickly. Those who have the luxury of time often spend too much of it trying to calculate the odds in a game where you have little control and absolutely no foreknowledge of on which side of the coin you will ultimately land. From my post-op pathology it was shown that my greatest \"tumor contact length\" (though it wasn't called that) was 6mm. Yet the CA had invaded both seminal vesicles. Presumably had I waited much longer it would have been on its way to the lymphatic system, and the story would likely have an entirely different outcome. Sometimes you just gotta fly with the seat of your pants.",

      "Content": "Just a couple quick notes... PNI is frequently found in the lab following gland removal, so it is not at all uncommon. Sometimes it is discovered upon biopsy if one of the needle pokes happens to hit one of the nerves. It's like everything else involved in the initial TRUS biopsy... you're lucky if the needle happens to hit one of the tumors, even luckier if it happens to be one of the higher grade tumors. Worst case is the needle totally misses everything and your doctor tells you that your biopsy was negative. Then you spend the next year or two believing that you do not have cancer. Which brings me to the second point. One of his samples had a primary grade 4 component. This is far worse then a G7 that was (3+4), with the grade 4 component being secondary. Grade 4 is the type of cancer that spreads outside of the prostate into the pelvic cavity. Generally it is not as bad as grade 5 which quickly progresses beyond the prostate area and spreads into the lymphatic system or metastasizes into bones. So you are fortunate that it is \"only\" 4, but you are right to act soon. It is not \"urgent\", but if treatment is delayed while you \"research other options\" it can quickly escalate to a higher level. If he does have surgery, the prostate will be thoroughly examined by a pathologist and the true extent of the disease will be well known. If there is residual cancer, then follow-up or adjuvant treatment is warranted... hormone deprivation therapy and adjuvant radiation. Several of us here have been thru that. The combination is a difficult course to get thru, but generally results in the least likelihood of recurrence in later years. It is important to consider other treatments, but choosing radiation first introduces additional complications. Primary radiation has its strong advocates, even zealots. They will no doubt tell you how superior it is to having surgery, while downplaying any of the side effects. Just be aware. And good luck!",

      "Content": "David, welcome to CFN, and good luck with your remaining RT treatments! You may be pleased to know that I just had my third post-trifecta checkup with my Uro (RP+HT+RT) and he informed me that T3B's who undergo the trifecta are the least likely to ever experience future recurrence, compared to those who go with RP or RT+HT alone. I know it is not an easy decision deciding which way to go, but it was my choice to throw everything at the beast and it appears at least for now that I have won. I am assuming that you regained continence quickly as you went into RT in just four months post-op. And I'm curious if you are also on HT. Many RO's now include HT with adjuvant radiation. Be sure to read the sticky in the blue area at the top of the main page on \"what to expect from EBRT\". There are potential side effects but many can be controlled thru using a modified diet (and no, it's NOT all veggies!) Good luck to you going forward and we're all hoping you can soon join me here in the 0.0 PSA club.",

      "Content": "Yup, you made the decision, now just go with it. I'll be watching for your updates in THIS THREAD. I know what you mean about the feeling of detachment. That happens with big institutions. Regarding supplements, I stopped anything with high levels of antioxidants and began taking Walmart's generic version of Centrum silver. It is my understanding (from reading forums) that the \"free radicals\" are what kills the cancer cells, and antioxidants would counteract that. Just to be safe. My RO said the radiation would continue to work for three months after the completion of RT, so I stayed off the expensive supplements during that period. When I tried to go back to my usual Twinlab vitamins, they made me feel weird. I may try again after my current bottle of generics runs out. But oddly, I have not felt any worse without the high priced vitamins. The greatest problem I encountered with RT was dietary. I chronicled this for a while in the EBRT sticky here on CFN. I still have problems with onions, which I had never had a problem with before. Also I still have to limit my intake of fruits and veggies... limit them to single servings. Never a problem before RT, but now I think this may all may be due to the carcinoid tumor that was discovered in my small bowel last month. BTW I have two days of 90 minute scans this week (ugh!). Surgery had been scheduled for next Monday, but I cancelled that for the time being, to let Moffitt do their thing. Hopefully when you are through with your thing and I am through with mine, we may get together sometime when you are down here. Good luck with your treatments!",

Typically this is treated with eight weeks of daily radiation starting a few months after surgery.

The fly in the ointment is that radiation halts all healing process and therefore there would be no further improvement in both ED or incontinence once it starts. In my case, I was supposed to start radiation next month (six months post op) but the RO has delayed that because I still have little bladder control and have not had an erection of any form since the surgery (sorry for the bad news). Instead he has started me on hormone therapy until I hit ten months. He said typically there is little improvement in continence after ten months, so that is when I will begin RT. Good thing, because I have to drive my wife to two all day chemos twice a month, and she should be done with that before my rad starts. Good luck working on the incontinence. It is a slow process. You will probably start having dry nights, if you haven't already. For me, nights are better than before the surgery. Most guys only have leaking when standing. It is annoying but just be prepared for it to go on for a while. Good luck!",

      "Content": "Last winter I was merrily winding my way thru this maze of prostate cancer treatment and terminology when my wife's nagging back pain finally came to a head. After much persistence and a lot of rejectionism, we finally paid cash for a couple MRI's that revealed a spinal tumor. The doctor's said they could see her next month. Another week passed and I finally drove her to the ER. That was another \"night of terror\". Some of you who have been reading my postings may remember what I was going thru at the time. The Lupron didn't help that either. Rather than repeat everything here, I've posted a brief wrap-up of her prognosis and what's next for us in the Non-Hodgkins Lymphoma Forum here: Chemo-is-over-final-LP-is-done! Thanks everyone for putting up with me. I fell like a tremendous weight has been lifted from us, and now it's time for my wife and I to enjoy each other's company for a while.",

      "Content": "Just a couple quick notes... PNI is frequently found in the lab following gland removal, so it is not at all uncommon. Sometimes it is discovered upon biopsy if one of the needle pokes happens to hit one of the nerves. It's like everything else involved in the initial TRUS biopsy... you're lucky if the needle happens to hit one of the tumors, even luckier if it happens to be one of the higher grade tumors. Worst case is the needle totally misses everything and your doctor tells you that your biopsy was negative. Then you spend the next year or two believing that you do not have cancer. Which brings me to the second point. One of his samples had a primary grade 4 component. This is far worse then a G7 that was (3+4), with the grade 4 component being secondary. Grade 4 is the type of cancer that spreads outside of the prostate into the pelvic cavity. Generally it is not as bad as grade 5 which quickly progresses beyond the prostate area and spreads into the lymphatic system or metastasizes into bones. So you are fortunate that it is \"only\" 4, but you are right to act soon. It is not \"urgent\", but if treatment is delayed while you \"research other options\" it can quickly escalate to a higher level. If he does have surgery, the prostate will be thoroughly examined by a pathologist and the true extent of the disease will be well known. If there is residual cancer, then follow-up or adjuvant treatment is warranted... hormone deprivation therapy and adjuvant radiation. Several of us here have been thru that. The combination is a difficult course to get thru, but generally results in the least likelihood of recurrence in later years. It is important to consider other treatments, but choosing radiation first introduces additional complications. Primary radiation has its strong advocates, even zealots. They will no doubt tell you how superior it is to having surgery, while downplaying any of the side effects. Just be aware. And good luck!",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by wbigs When I was talking to my urologist about surgery options he noticed from my record that I have had previous hernia surgery and kind of grimaced and asked if there was a bunch of mesh in there. I asked if that would be a problem and he brushed if off and said that it can just be a bit more tricky. Has anybody else heard this or had any experience with it? Its been something that been stuck in my head for the last couple of days. I had a hernia repair over thirty years ago on the same side as the prostate cancer, plus a bowel resection some time later and the Urologist noticed the two scars (which form an inverted arrow head on my abdomen). He made no mention of them when he examined my belly, only stated that he had to make sure there was a \"way in\". And both surgeries are prominent in my chart as the pre-op staff verified them during my admission. I was concerned after the RP because of the six new incisions, only one was painful and still is, and it is midway between my two previous scars. And the pain is very similar to the pain that led me to seek treatment back circa 1980. Today at my cath removal visit I mentioned to the Urologist about the pain of that one incision and he stated that \"that one will pull more than the others\". I briefly told him of my earlier experience and he just re-stated the pull more than others line. I'm guessing either that the prior surgeries presented no additional obstacles to his surgery, or at least nothing he was not prepared to address at the time. I still have concerns about the pain on my right side, as I cannot turn onto my right side and when I try to bend over only the right side hurts. But this is only like nine days post-op so I'll give my body more time to heal before I really start to worry. But yeah, stuff like that can get stuck in your head. Remember that your Uro is a professional and has trained to deal with numerous various scenarios. Have faith and hopefully everything will go perfectly for you.",

      "Content": "Yup, you made the decision, now just go with it. I'll be watching for your updates in THIS THREAD. I know what you mean about the feeling of detachment. That happens with big institutions. Regarding supplements, I stopped anything with high levels of antioxidants and began taking Walmart's generic version of Centrum silver. It is my understanding (from reading forums) that the \"free radicals\" are what kills the cancer cells, and antioxidants would counteract that. Just to be safe. My RO said the radiation would continue to work for three months after the completion of RT, so I stayed off the expensive supplements during that period. When I tried to go back to my usual Twinlab vitamins, they made me feel weird. I may try again after my current bottle of generics runs out. But oddly, I have not felt any worse without the high priced vitamins. The greatest problem I encountered with RT was dietary. I chronicled this for a while in the EBRT sticky here on CFN. I still have problems with onions, which I had never had a problem with before. Also I still have to limit my intake of fruits and veggies... limit them to single servings. Never a problem before RT, but now I think this may all may be due to the carcinoid tumor that was discovered in my small bowel last month. BTW I have two days of 90 minute scans this week (ugh!). Surgery had been scheduled for next Monday, but I cancelled that for the time being, to let Moffitt do their thing. Hopefully when you are through with your thing and I am through with mine, we may get together sometime when you are down here. Good luck with your treatments!",

      "Content": "Last winter I was merrily winding my way thru this maze of prostate cancer treatment and terminology when my wife's nagging back pain finally came to a head. After much persistence and a lot of rejectionism, we finally paid cash for a couple MRI's that revealed a spinal tumor. The doctor's said they could see her next month. Another week passed and I finally drove her to the ER. That was another \"night of terror\". Some of you who have been reading my postings may remember what I was going thru at the time. The Lupron didn't help that either. Rather than repeat everything here, I've posted a brief wrap-up of her prognosis and what's next for us in the Non-Hodgkins Lymphoma Forum here: Chemo-is-over-final-LP-is-done!

      "Content": "Tink - I was trying to compose a response in my head, then headed over to CSN and saw your same post there. Vasco has given you some extremely valuable information there. Personally I would still be inclined toward surgery, which will most likely then lead to more HT plus some form of adjuvant RT. Your Dad has already been thru the urinary issues, and at his age ED likely not a concern. Surgery will allow a thorough examination of the prostate and surrounding tissues to determine exactly what is going on in there. All this assuming he is physically fit for surgery, and the current HT has not made the RP too difficult. As far as which doctor, there is a definite quandary here. An arrogant surgeon with a terrible bedside manner seems scary, but may be the best available choice... unless you want to go shopping for another Uro. You do want a highly experienced and confident surgeon. His presumptions going in (stage 4, 5 years, etc) will basically be irrelevant once his hands get onto or into your father. He becomes just a professional doing the job put before him. Once the surgeon is done, the RO's job begins. Choices regarding HT and RT can be determined once your Dad has recovered from the surgery. If his cancer is indeed as advanced as some feel it may be now, then concerns over incontinence and ED become irrelevant, and a medical oncologist should take over. As regards to Moffitt... I dunno. I called them to see how soon they could fit me in just in case things here in Clearwater went south. They were very professional, but for me that would be an hour each way, and I stayed with the local guy. One patient in my group (our time slot under the zapper) drives over from Winter Haven, which is over near Orlando, just to see this guy, so I figure he must be pretty good. But then you already have RO's to choose from. My wife's hemo-oncologist was from Moffitt and did a good job but even her treatment was not without hiccups as well. One never knows going into these things.",

      "Content": "This past week saw the first anniversary of the fusion biopsy that found my tumor and the phone call I got on July 5th informing me that I have cancer... the first time that word had ever been mentioned to me. And it was also the ten month anniversary of my RP. We had planned to fly back to Ohio and rent a van to finally drive back the stuff we had left in a storage locker when we moved. Actually that was originally supposed to happen last December, but that ended up being the week that my wife had the MRI that revealed her spinal tumor, which led to her lymphoma diagnosis. This time the AUS surgery required revision, which set the entire calendar back (seems it's always something) so we just flew up and back, staying with my sister for a week, and had a nice family reunion... what's left of it anyway. So I decided that would be a good opportunity to visit the surgeon who did my biopsy and RP and fill him in on what has happened... tell him about Lori's lymphoma as they used to work together, and get his take on the AUS. He examined it and said everything seemed good. About the pain in my leg he said maybe a nerve got snagged while my feet were in the stirrups. About the revision and my surgeon's remark that it had never happened to him before, he said if a surgeon does enough of those that eventually it will happen. And about the incontinence he stated that is always a risk when using the \"broad cut\", saying that a lot of nerve tissue had been removed and re-emphasized that I had negative nodes and negative margins. I told him I felt he had done a great job and I wish he were still my doctor. I asked him for more info about my SVI, as I have read that there are different forms, referred to as direct vs distal or \"mucosal\" and he said he didn't know about that, but that my seminal vesicles were definitely involved. Finally I gave him my upcoming schedule regarding AUS activation, starting SRT and my next Lupron shot. Then he dropped the bombshell that I would likely be on Lupron for three years! I had always assumed that I would be on HT possibly for a year after SRT, but not two. I do see my RO next week to hopefully set up our SRT schedule so I will definitely ask him about that. For those who have been thru SRT, what were you told? Or were you? So big month ahead... RO visit #3, Lupron shot #2, AUS activation and Lori's three month in-remission checkup with her hemoncologist. Hoping for the best, as they say.",

      "Content": "Ditto on what MichiganMan said. If you're T3b with SVI that puts you into the very high risk category. The first link provided by Djin leads to a discussion from just a few months ago... actually my post right after Djin's is where we get into the risk categories. This is one treatment protocol that I did not question at all. In fact I spent the first year post RP preparing for ART. Immediately following my RP I was informed that I would need ART, and my RO was quite insistent that it was very important. Also, my PSA a month after RP was declared \"undetectable\", which to my surgeon's standards meant that it was <.1 ... That wasn't good enough for me, nor for my Uro. Subsequent PSA's were run using ultrasensitive and was always .02 - .03 for the subsequent months, including the time while on HT. It turned out that this lab used <.02 as the cutoff for undetectable, so I kind of get the feeling that the term undetectable doesn't mean much anymore. Nor does the term \"zero\". My latest PSA is 0.00, and I'm still a bit skeptical. I want to know if it was somewhere between 0.001 and 0.005 and was rounded down to \"zero\". I think what I've read is that 50% of T3b's may be overtreated, meaning they didn't really need RT. But how can you be sure that you fall into that 50% or the other 50% that ultimately would have required treatment. All studies point to earlier radiation is better than waiting for a PSA threshold. Regarding SRT without prior adverse pathology, even the \"three consecutive rises\" in PSA is useless if they don't test at least every three months.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by Livinit I had Da Vinci prostatectomy in 2008. All ok but for the incontinence. Glad to hear all is okay since your RP. I assume that means consistently low PSA's over the past ten years... that's pretty awesome. Big congratulations are in order. I too went with Tena. They were recommended by a nurse at the hospital following my RP. She said her husband uses them because they are quieter and less bulky than Depends. I gave away all my Depends and CVS pads and get the Tena from Amazon for around the same price as those Walmart pads, though I may give those a try. Thanks for the link. Finding the right pad is not easy. Too light and I need to change too often, too bulky and they bulge out and stay wet. The selection on store shelves is limited. My pad usage has been steadily increasing. The AUS seems to be getting looser and I need to discuss this with my Uro... not looking forward to that, as he had to replace it once already.",

      "Content": "Hi, and welcome to the \"horses have left the barn\" club. Our cases are not dissimilar, as you can tell by my sig below. I had radiation a full year after RP and was told I would be on HT for one to three years. Research I did showed a 50/50 chance of recurrence if I declined adjuvant Tx and an 85% likelihood of 10 year survival if I went thru with it. There were complications that delayed my treatment, but in the end it appears to have all worked out. I know another man who is now 82 and had RP+RT fifteen years ago, when he was my age, and his PSA is still zero. So if you go ahead with the recommended post-op treatments, you will most likely live to die of something else (okay, I know that's not comforting). BTW the new \"standard\" duration for adjuvant HT is 18 months. Living with ADT is tough, but not devastating. Metastasis is devastating, so I chose to throw everything possible at my PCa. Good luck to you!",

      "Content": "This past week saw the first anniversary of the fusion biopsy that found my tumor and the phone call I got on July 5th informing me that I have cancer... the first time that word had ever been mentioned to me. And it was also the ten month anniversary of my RP. We had planned to fly back to Ohio and rent a van to finally drive back the stuff we had left in a storage locker when we moved. Actually that was originally supposed to happen last December, but that ended up being the week that my wife had the MRI that revealed her spinal tumor, which led to her lymphoma diagnosis. This time the AUS surgery required revision, which set the entire calendar back (seems it's always something) so we just flew up and back, staying with my sister for a week, and had a nice family reunion... what's left of it anyway. So I decided that would be a good opportunity to visit the surgeon who did my biopsy and RP and fill him in on what has happened... tell him about Lori's lymphoma as they used to work together, and get his take on the AUS. He examined it and said everything seemed good. About the pain in my leg he said maybe a nerve got snagged while my feet were in the stirrups. About the revision and my surgeon's remark that it had never happened to him before, he said if a surgeon does enough of those that eventually it will happen. And about the incontinence he stated that is always a risk when using the \"broad cut\", saying that a lot of nerve tissue had been removed and re-emphasized that I had negative nodes and negative margins. I told him I felt he had done a great job and I wish he were still my doctor. I asked him for more info about my SVI, as I have read that there are different forms, referred to as direct vs distal or \"mucosal\" and he said he didn't know about that, but that my seminal vesicles were definitely involved. Finally I gave him my upcoming schedule regarding AUS activation, starting SRT and my next Lupron shot. Then he dropped the bombshell that I would likely be on Lupron for three years! I had always assumed that I would be on HT possibly for a year after SRT, but not two. I do see my RO next week to hopefully set up our SRT schedule so I will definitely ask him about that. For those who have been thru SRT, what were you told? Or were you? So big month ahead... RO visit #3, Lupron shot #2, AUS activation and Lori's three month in-remission checkup with her hemoncologist. Hoping for the best, as they say.",

      "Content": "Hey Jim, welcome to the \"club that no one wants to join\". It sounds like your treatment is following the \"normal\" path for someone of your age and period of time within which your PSA was detected. A little background information... 8-10 years ago (as I understand it) some urologists were removing prostates of older men who had fairly low grade cancers. This was apparently a ploy for financial gain, and a govt panel (USPSTF or 'the task force') \"suggested\" that GP's stop testing PSA's as it was causing too many unnecessary surgeries. The results were that urologists were less likely to intervene when there was 'only' a higher than usual PSA and as in my case, a family history. The sad thing is that a positive DRE would get you treated immediately, where a combination of other factors would get you shown the door. Recently the same panel woke up to the realization that the outcome now, six years later, is that many more men now have advanced high risk prostate cancer, because their cases were not seen as justifying treatment. Personally, my path was not unlike yours, except that I am five years younger and was told that had I been five years older I would not have been eligible for surgery. Also due to the advanced nature of my case I was ineligible for some of the more recent innovations in radiation. But otherwise, followed a similar path... was put on several longer and longer courses of Cipro in an attempt to knock out this infection that was causing my PSA to skyrocket. Eventually diagnosed following an MRI and bone scans were negative... had RP surgery and still required hormone therapy and 39 treatments of radiation about a year later. It sounds like you are receiving excellent care now, other than the 'fits and starts' several years ago when doctors were reluctant to treat anything but the most obvious cases of prostate cancer for fear of risking lawsuits. Good luck to you in completing your EBRT and your time on HT. If you haven't done so already, you should read the sticky's at the top of the thread list on EBRT and HT. Lots of valuable information in there. Hopefully your recovery will proceed well and you will not have more than a just a few months on HT.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by Gary e Hi roblee. I was always curious about the AUS. Did you have jitters having it installed the first time. My Uro doc said one Con he fears is that I will not know when to pee which may risk bladder infection. So what is it like if you don't mind telling Thx Gary e Certainly, glad to help in any way I can. I felt it might be better to start a new thread in case anyone else might be interested. The thread is here: https://www.cancerforums.net/threads/54694-Incontinence-and-AUS-experience?p=360369#post360369 ... The first two paragraphs are duplicated here: Not knowing your condition, I'd say that your doctor's concern should not be a problem, unless there is some reason such as a neurological condition that might cause you to not be able to feel when your bladder is full. Bladder sensations are normal with the AUS, in fact, my natural sphincter still works to some extent but is unreliable. I can tell when my bladder needs to be emptied, and when in front of the urinal or toilet must remember to both manually release the AUS as well as tell my natural sphincter to open up. There is sometimes some pressure buildup and it squirts at first, so it's a bit tricky getting everything right. Regarding the jitters, yes, this was probably one of the most difficult decisions of my life. I was extremely stressed at the time. I knew immediately following the prostatectomy that I would require salvage radiation (called adjuvant radiation) within six months, and that the RT would require holding a full bladder every day long enough for the radiation treatment, about two hours. As mentioned, my sphincter worked but I had little control and would leak copiously at times. Furthermore getting the AUS would change the way I would have to do something that I do all day every day for the rest of my life!",

      "Content": "If and when you have the biopsy, it would save you some anguish and grief if you ascertain that there is a MRI beforehand or at the time of the biopsy. Without the MRI biopsies are random, and in my case was negative despite an aggressive tumor being present because it was \"missed\" by the random biopsy. Fortunately I had heard of MRI guided biopsies on TV and when my family doctor asked about an MRI I knew what he was talking about. There is an excellent recent post here somewhere in the PC forum titled \"need your opinion\" or something like that, with a response from a doctor who I believe is a radiologist. He explains the various types of biopsies and their advantages. In light of what happened to me, I can't understand why there are still random biopsies.

      "Content": "Originally Posted by redbelly7 I have read that putting in an artificial sphincter is tougher to do after radiation, is that true? Can it be done? I'm fairly confident that I will not gain continence after radiation. You will in all likelihood actually lose continence as a result of radiation. RT does a real number on abdominal tissues. Consequently any pelvic procedure such as an AUS implant or even a routine colonoscopy becomes a complicated procedure... hence the \"fact\" that salvage postatectomy following primary radiation generally just isn't done. The only case I know of of a totally failed AUS implant was a man who'd had primary radiation for PCa and the AUS had to be taken back out almost immediately. BTW AFAIK I am the ONLY forum member here who has had the AUS implant. It was a VERY difficult decision and no one here was able to provide any guidance. If interested you can read about my AUS journey in the link CancerCoupleBlog.com below.",

      "Content": "Welcome to the AUS club Pottk! For me it was a difficult decision, as it changes the way you have to do something that you do all day, every day for the rest of your life. My point was that there was no one in this forum at the time who could share their experiences with me on the AUS. Another forum elsewhere had several guys who have one and they all had nothing but glowing reports. Yet another site only had a few with mixed results. None had my experience. I hope you had, and will continue to have, the kind of results that I had been promised by the surgeon. My primary reason for getting the AUS was so that I could start adjuvant radiation, which had already been delayed by several months due to my own incontinence as well as my duties as caregiver to my wife. Then the AUS itself caused additional delays. Much of this is detailed in my blog at CancerCoupleBlog.com or in my personal page at the American Cancer Societies' Cancer Survivors Network Rooster - I had twice requested the balloon as you had recommended, but my RO refused. I do understand why. As for the colonoscopy, I had hoped to get one in before starting ART. My RO said that the colonoscopy had to heal for ten weeks (two and a half months) before I could start ART, which had already been delayed. In fact, the colonoscopy had been scheduled and then rescheduled twice before all three docs (PCP, RO, GI) all told me that I was trying to do too much... then later my RO told me that I should not have a colonoscopy until six months have elapsed following the conclusion of RT. You may have read something different elsewhere, but I was just acting on what my doctor had instructed.",

It is somewhat uncomfortable having it inserted, but once inside, it doesn't feel bad. It really helps push a good portion of the colon out of the path of the radiation beam to keep the colon from being radiated. A good radiation machine is the Varian Rapid Arc. Hope you get treated by one of those. I had asked my RO about the balloon back in April and he said he does not use them. I brought it up again this past week and he said 50% of RO's use it and 50% do not. This guy has an excellent track record so I trust him... though I would not be averse to the balloon if offered. And BTW I will be treated with the RapidArc.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by Jbs71616 I just found out that my 70 year old dad has prostate cancer. The good news is that it has not spread far if at all (according to the bone scan which was clear although I understand it cannot detect anything less than 1cm?). He has a Gleason of 9(4+5), PSA 13.12, 1 positive core and 12 negative cores from biopsy, staged T1c. He has started hormone therapy (a shot plus pills). We are trying to decide between radiation and surgery and I'm having a hard time understanding why we wouldn't do surgery and then add radiation and hormone therapy... I also don't understand if he is technically \"high risk\" just because of his Gleason score alone since his PSA is less than 20? Some of the things I am reading say that to be high risk you must have a Gleason score of 8-10 PLUS a PSA of greater than 20. Generally if your dad is not over the age of 70 then he is a possible candidate for surgery UNLESS he already in poor health or has certain comorbities. It's all about how likely he is to survive the surgery plus whether or not he is likely to die from something other than prostate cancer before the side effects of radiation would appear. There is a very vocal group of radiation advocates who proclaim that today's radiation therapy is not the same as it was 10-20 years ago, however I would counter that there are not many living examples of men who have lived more than 20 years having undergone treatment using 10-20 year old technology. The choice is still yours, or more precisely, your father's. The primary advantage(s) of surgery over radiation are 1) that a physician is actually able to examine the prostate gland and its surrounds and treat accordingly, and 2) if surgery fails, there is always radiation. Be sure to consult with a radiation oncologist before deciding, but be sure to ask the RO what are the available options should the radiation fail. Note that without post-op pathology it is difficult to categorize your father as high risk. What you have cited it nearly correct. Te criteria are as follows: High risk: The tumor has 2 or more of these characteristics: Classified as T3a PSA level is higher than 20 ng/mL Gleason score is between 8 and 10 Very high risk: The tumor is classified as T3b or T4. The histologic grade is 5 for the main pattern of cell growth, or more than 4 biopsy cores have Gleason scores between 8 and 10. Based upon a single having a secondary grade 5 core definitely keeps him out of the VHR category. However, biopsies are known to also miss significant tumors, so there are likely more grade 4 or 5 cells in his prostate. Removal of the prostate and pathological dissection is the only way to know for sure. Radiation is a lot less messy for sure, but IMO the radiologist is essentially shooting in the dark, guided only by external imaging (scans). Additionally surgery will have immediately known and apparent side effects, while radiation has more indefinite side effects which may not appear until many years later.",

      "Content": "Yes, most of us are here on this forum because we were at one point in the same situation. Your 8.8 (nine-ish) is somewhat high. At that point I was sent for a biopsy as well... this was even though the digital exam was negative. When the biopsy came back negative, I asked my Uro what should we do next and he said another biopsy. If there was one thing I would change, it would be to have had that second biopsy a year earlier. It wasn't until my regular doctor said I had two lumps on my prostate that I returned to the Uro, who dismissed the lumps. Fortunately I was able to see another Uro who did an MRI guided biopsy right away. All I can say to you is do what the doctor tells you to so. If you are not satisfied with what he says, find another doctor. I suspect you will sooner or later end up with RP surgery or maybe radiation, depending on your age, or go under \"surveillance\"... and hope that *IF* there is indeed cancer in there, that it is treated before it begins to spread. I don't mean to scare you, but it is easy to put off treatment, whether on your part or your doctor's. Sometimes an elevated PSA can be caused by an infection, and a lump does not necessarily mean there is cancer... so you may just end up on Cipro or something... but you probably will end up with prostate treatment at some point in your life. It happens to about half of all men eventually. Good luck!",

RP two years ago and RT one year ago. I could have stopped HT after finishing RT last year if I wanted to but elected to stick with it for what has now become the recommended eighteen months. Considering that my Uro who did my RP said I'd probably be on HT for three years, I figure I'm doing okay. And my last 3 PSA's have been undetectable. Of course, the Lupron is still sticking with me. I figure I won't know for sure if the PCa is really gone until a few more years have passed. I sleep well now and rarely get the blues anymore. And the hot flashes are a nuisance but I've learned how to live with them. I figure if I'd dropped out of HT at the one year mark and something came back later on, then I'd probably regret not sticking with it.",

      "Content": "Yesterday I learned that I will definitely need post-op radiation therapy next spring because my cancer had metastasized into the seminary vesicles. Those of you who read my posts know that I am in the process of moving to Clearwater Florida. I already have a primary care physician there, and will seek his recommendations for a urologist to take over my case. But I am curious if any of my R/P brothers here have had radiation treatment in the Tampa/St Pete area and if you could recommend what is a good group to go with for a urologist and a radiation oncologist. I am close to Morton Plant and also know of the Moffitt cancer center. Here at my home in Ohio there are several large groups that control everything. Even in my urology group my original Uro was okay but missed my cancer. His partner who took over my case is a super guy so I realize that sometimes it is hit and miss. We are moving to Florida at the end of this month (long after Matthew has passed) and I kind of just want to know what I'm getting into. Another forum member Michael F has made some suggestions in another thread here: http://www.cancerforums.net/threads/...l=1#post319573 Thanks everyone!",

      "Content": "If and when you have the biopsy, it would save you some anguish and grief if you ascertain that there is a MRI beforehand or at the time of the biopsy. Without the MRI biopsies are random, and in my case was negative despite an aggressive tumor being present because it was \"missed\" by the random biopsy. Fortunately I had heard of MRI guided biopsies on TV and when my family doctor asked about an MRI I knew what he was talking about. There is an excellent recent post here somewhere in the PC forum titled \"need your opinion\" or something like that, with a response from a doctor who I believe is a radiologist. He explains the various types of biopsies and their advantages. In light of what happened to me, I can't understand why there are still random biopsies.

      "Content": "Yes, most of us are here on this forum because we were at one point in the same situation. Your 8.8 (nine-ish) is somewhat high. At that point I was sent for a biopsy as well... this was even though the digital exam was negative. When the biopsy came back negative, I asked my Uro what should we do next and he said another biopsy. If there was one thing I would change, it would be to have had that second biopsy a year earlier. It wasn't until my regular doctor said I had two lumps on my prostate that I returned to the Uro, who dismissed the lumps. Fortunately I was able to see another Uro who did an MRI guided biopsy right away. All I can say to you is do what the doctor tells you to so. If you are not satisfied with what he says, find another doctor. I suspect you will sooner or later end up with RP surgery or maybe radiation, depending on your age, or go under \"surveillance\"... and hope that *IF* there is indeed cancer in there, that it is treated before it begins to spread. I don't mean to scare you, but it is easy to put off treatment, whether on your part or your doctor's. Sometimes an elevated PSA can be caused by an infection, and a lump does not necessarily mean there is cancer... so you may just end up on Cipro or something... but you probably will end up with prostate treatment at some point in your life. It happens to about half of all men eventually. Good luck!",

In that movie, a space ship returns to earth with an unknown object, a glowing sphere, in the cargo bay. The researchers begin to experience horrifying events. It turns out that the sphere was a gift from an alien race. It was a device able to make dreams come true. Instead the crew brought their nightmares to reality.

He said she can swim with it and everything. They put it in on her last morning in the hospital and removed her PICC line later that afternoon.

      "Content": "Originally Posted by Michael F Discuss with the Urologist about having an MP 3T MRI that can be later \"fused\" with a TRUS Biopsy. I'm not sure about health insurance coverage for the MRI. If it will cover it, then definitely go with it. If your current Uro does not do these, then find one who does. These are two very important points... unfortunately, in my case, my cancer had an additional year to grow and spread because initial tests were all negative. It wasn't until after my Uro, whom I had been seeing for twenty years, retired and meanwhile I retired and went on Medicare, that the fusion biopsy was done by his partner and identified the cancer. An unfortunate coincidence. He did not \"do\" fusion and my insurance at the time would not have covered it anyway. There was a thread here about six months ago started by a doctor on this board titled \"is it time for MRI fusion biopsy to be the standard\" (I don't remember the title exactly) but that was the point of the post, as it is far more accurate at identifying and localizing PCa, rather than fusion being reserved for use only after a random biopsy has turned up negative... and also therefore requiring further delay between procedures while the tissues heal.",

      "Content": "I am proud to say that I totally missed whatever happened here. I had read Denis's post, saw that the thread had been locked, and went directly to Chuck's final post. I don't even want to know what was said in between. People being people indeed. Whenever I witness an online dispute, I always liken the internet to the movie \"Sphere\". In that movie, a space ship returns to earth with an unknown object, a glowing sphere, in the cargo bay. The researchers begin to experience horrifying events. It turns out that the sphere was a gift from an alien race. It was a device able to make dreams come true. Instead the crew brought their nightmares to reality. As others have said above, this is the best prostate cancer forum on the internet. Several others forums here that I've touched upon also seem to be equally well attended and managed. I once had an issue here, and it turned out the problem was all in my head. I am glad that we are usually able to work things out between ourselves and get on with the important things in life.",

      "Content": "It is difficult to tell exactly when the end will be. From the information you presented, it seems he has not been on any form of hormone deprivation therapy (ADT or HT) that might have arrested the progression of his bone mets. Or he may have been on HT as part of the radiation... But I am guessing that the radiation was spot treatment to his bone mets to reduce his pain. Traditionally, chemo had been reserved as a \"last resort\" but more recently is administered following radiation in order to take out micromets. It sounds like your husband was probably already beyond that before his treatment started. He will continue to hve good days and bad days, as both the cancer and its treatments saps all stamina from its victims. You can't necessarily blame it on doing too much on a good day. It is unfortunate that no one here was able to provide you with more information, but this particular message board is generally frequented by guys (and their wives or children) who have been recently diagnosed and/or currently undergoing treatment for a cure. Your husband's case is far beyond that. There are two other message boards where you will find men with more advanced cases... stage 4, metastatic cancer.",

      "Content": "To reiterate what ASA has mentioned above, and hopefully as some reassurance to you, PSA's immediately following radiation as primary therapy are of little value, as the cancer cells spew out PSA as they are dying from the radiation, and this process takes many months afterwards before PSA levels stabilize. Unlike surgery, where PSA is measured frequently afterwards in order to determine whether or not any cancerous tissue remains, PSA's following radiation rarely or never go down to zero and rather is charted to determine a downward trend until it reaches a nadir or low point, then stabilizes. So it sounds like everything is progressing normally... even the insurance nightmare that seems to be unavoidable these days.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by DjinTonic Speaking about DREs, just this morning I came across a study that looked at DREs for prostate screening and, remarkably, concluded that they were not necessary. If we eliminate the DRE and frown upon PSA screening, as some do, what is the symptom docs should use to wake up, bone pain from mets??? Originally Posted by MrEd I had no symptoms and DRE and ultrasound showed nothing. I guess if you don't use PSA's to trigger further investigation you can push the treatment to a later time and let the Medicare system take care of the costs. Originally Posted by DjinTonic You mean the cost of my funeral? There is still research in support of, and a push toward, not doing PSA screening for PCa. The problem is that early PCa has only signs and rarely symptoms. If docs are told not to check for the signs, where does that leave us? With a load of patients who are told out of the blue they have advanced, perhaps metastatic, prostate cancer. Don't get me started!!! For years, my DRE's were always \"normal\" and my PSA was \"elevated\", so I was told it was \"nothing to be concerned about.\" Thank goodness I changed doctors following my retirement. When my new Urologist showed me on a graphic where my tumor was located, high up behind the pubic bone and just below the bladder, I said no wonder my DRE's were always normal... to which he replied, yeah, you can never find those without an MRI. So when my wife's persistent back pain was repeatedly dismissed as a muscle strain, we paid CASH for an MRI. That was sixteen months ago, and she just passed the one year mark from completing chemo. We just received a letter from her insurance company rejecting payment for the MRI. Where the @#$%#& do they find these people???!!",

Now have as of yesterday PSA .190 Regards..... My first PSA post op was \"<.1\" and the second \"<.02\", then I was put on Lupron. They have been \"<.03\" ever since. Originally I was supposed to start radiation in March (at six months) but now will begin in August, at one year post-op. Sorry to hear that your PSA is rising, even after radiation.

For those just now tuning in, I am going to completely hijack this thread and post a link to one of the more pertinent posts in your earlier thread. At this point (today, Cinco de Mayo) your post count is only eight, so I am going to take a big leap here... hopefully you don't mind. PSA going up after prostate removal and radiation Forgive me Rooster for hijacking your thread. BTW thank you for your advocacy on the balloon - I will definitely ask my RO if he even has the capacity to do that. His facility is literally around the corner from where I live, so changing RO's would probably be totally impractical. Michael and Rooster - good luck for your time ahead - years, on HT. It's been four months for me now and will likely be the rest of this year at least. I am actually getting used to it. My RO basically shot me down when I asked for help with the SE's. I worked with my PCP for some Rx and still working on that - trying different stuff, and I will definitely be posting at some point just how that worked out. Again, best of luck to you both.

      "Content": "Both my biopsies were under anesthesia, thank goodness, and the second one was an MRI guided fusion biopsy. As I understand this is a specialized procedure that requires training and experience. Be sure if you proceed with a second biopsy that it is a FUSION biopsy. Recovery from my first biopsy was what caused me to delay getting the second one. I bled a lot and had difficulty urinating. No catheter though. The second biopsy was totally without after effects. Again, no catheter, but no bleeding and no problem urinating... and it is the one that probably saved my life. I'm thinking the usual biopsy they just randomly poke around at your prostate and hope they hit something, possibly puncturing the urethra in the process. That's the only thing I can think of that would cause the bleeding. If you need surgery and proceed with a prostatectomy then you will definitely have a catheter for 7-10 days afterward. It is uncomfortable and terribly inconvenient, but that's all. It is NOT painful. Removing it is actually ticklish. I know what you mean about the waiting lists in Florida. My wife developed what (likely) turned out to be lymphoma. She couldn't see a doctor for a month. Fortunately a nurse practitioner ordered a MRI two weeks ago and she is now being treated, after much struggle and fighting with the system. I don't blame snowbirds... we were one briefly before moving to the Tampa bay area. Good luck with whatever you end up doing. Do not let fear keep you from getting treatment. You must be your own advocate.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by rmotacek1 I had my RALP in December 2015 and then because of my high gleason score I had 40 rounds of radiation in May. The radiation was really no problem except for some fatigue near the end. I am hoping that the combination of the surgery and radiation has knocked the cancer out. I just want to let you know that the radiation was very easy and not to worry about it. Originally Posted by Replicant I had salvage radiation .... Best of all, the treatment worked. Six months is the same timeline that my Urologist laid out for me (DaVinci three months ago and RT to start three months from now). The more I read about it the more apprehensive I become about it. Several guys have said it was no big deal, and everyone I've spoken with about it say it worked and there were no ill affects. But I'm still hoping that maybe I won't need to go thru with it. My PSA's have been <0.02 and categorized as undetectable. Still, the RT is recommended because my cancer had spread into both seminary vesicles. I really don't know if there's any way to determine whether or not it has or will spread beyond that. Eight weeks of daily RT seems like a tremendous risk as well as inconvenience just because there \"might be\" some residual cancer. My greatest concern is in regard to incontinence. Like several other guys here who had surgery around the same time as myself, I still have very little control over leaking urine. Everything I've read says to expect 6-12 months for full continence to return, but if I have RT at six months, then any progress (or lack thereof) comes to a complete halt. That is probably the scariest part.",

I saw Depends shields for $15 at CVS. The same package was $12 at Target and $10 from Amazon. Moral of the story: shop around. BTW one of my nurses said her husband prefers Tena as they are not as \"noisy\" as Depends. I also tried Depends Flex Fit briefs, but they have so much elastic that disposal becomes a problem. They fill the trash can too fast. For pad/shield/diaper disposal I use quart size zipper plastic bags. $6 for a box of 100, and I can fit two pads in each baggie. Keeps the bath/bedroom from smelling like urine. Personally I do not like shields, at least not at this point in my recovery. I haven't found one with enough of a \"pouch\" in front. Most of them are flat or nearly flat and tend to squish my poor penis too much. And for the first few days after cath removal, rubbing against the pads was too irritating. I've found that I like \"belted shields\". These are unisex pads that button in front and back. They come with a pair of elastic straps with a button on each end. They ride low on the hips and do not irritate my incision sites as they do not have a waist band. Initially I bought them at CVS because my wife had a 30% off extra care coupon, but I found the same shields available on AZ under the name Prevail.",

Some of us who are in our first month post-op have been posting remarks about leakage, Kegels, and other such matters in JJackson's \"Post-op Day 10\" thread... read it here: (http://www.cancerforums.net/threads/...Post-op-Day-10 Jamie, Rich and I (\"the three caballeros\") are all in our first month post-op and struggling with these issues. There has already been a lot of info put forward in that thread, but he/we discussed starting a properly titled thread on the topic. So here it is. I just wanted to get this up and running so we can add our thoughts and experiences here rather than there (as Day 10 has long passed!) Personally I have been experimenting with various pads, shields, diapers (ok, I'm going to call them that) as well as some \"external plumbing\" devices. I hope to post my thoughts and opinions here on various products in the days ahead. AZ has been a terrific resource, offering testimonials as well as decent prices, better than you might find in a drug store or superstore. For any newbies (and yes, we are all newbies at this, if not now, we were only recently) what I've read and been told is that typically we should not expect to have much control for the first two months, with full control over urinary continence being attained between six and twelve months. As usual, your mileage may vary. Some report better control early on and others still having accidents more than a year out. So don't worry if you don't fit some standard. There is none. Good luck everyone! We've already taken the greatest step on this journey.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by MDeckert RobLee (Sir) Can I ask what your PSA levels were after the DaVinci? I have had both removal and radation. Radiation after surgery came quickly because of the PSA . Informed yesterday that PSA still shows rise (each 3 months) since surgery and then after radiation . Next week is the Lupron discussion. Now have as of yesterday PSA .190 Regards..... My first PSA post op was \"<.1\" and the second \"<.02\", then I was put on Lupron. They have been \"<.03\" ever since. Originally I was supposed to start radiation in March (at six months) but now will begin in August, at one year post-op. Sorry to hear that your PSA is rising, even after radiation. That may mean going on HT possibly for years.",

      "Content": "Michael - I remember reading and responding extensively in your thread back in January (now four months ago). Your story has stuck in my head, and now you are faced with what is essentially a failure of treatment... after all that you have been thru. For those just now tuning in, I am going to completely hijack this thread and post a link to one of the more pertinent posts in your earlier thread. At this point (today, Cinco de Mayo) your post count is only eight, so I am going to take a big leap here... hopefully you don't mind. PSA going up after prostate removal and radiation Forgive me Rooster for hijacking your thread. BTW thank you for your advocacy on the balloon - I will definitely ask my RO if he even has the capacity to do that. His facility is literally around the corner from where I live, so changing RO's would probably be totally impractical. Michael and Rooster - good luck for your time ahead - years, on HT. It's been four months for me now and will likely be the rest of this year at least. I am actually getting used to it. My RO basically shot me down when I asked for help with the SE's. I worked with my PCP for some Rx and still working on that - trying different stuff, and I will definitely be posting at some point just how that worked out. Again, best of luck to you both. Cancer doesn't just stay overnight, it sets up housekeeping and resists eviction.",

I wanted a better outcome and found it with my second urologist. So I\u0092m currently considering RP for the following reasons: 1) I\u0092m early stage so there is a better chance at getting it all out (a cure). 2) I can take a major surgery now a lot better than I can five or ten years from now. 3) I\u0092m currently working and have reasonable healthcare. 4) Incontinence and ED suck, but not as much as prostate cancer and I\u0092m willing to make that trade off. I\u0092ve read that if you\u0092ve had radiation you are no longer able to have a RP? Is that correct and does that also apply to a CyberKnife treatment? I\u0092ve also read that once you\u0092re over 70 years old you\u0092re not considered a good candidate for RP? If this is true then it\u0092s another reason to just get it done now. You have done your research well, and your decisions are sound. Even your assumptions have full merit. And you are to be commended in particular for dumping your first urologist early on.

You have also been conscientious with regard to dismissing fashionable and trendy treatment forms. Be sure to actually SPEAK with several individuals who have been thru such treatments.

The well worn path is RP for young healthy men, with HT and SRT if there are any complications. My surgeon told me that if I had been five years older then his recommendations would have been different. And as it was, at my advanced stage (by the time I finally confronted my original uro about his methods) then I only had a one in 20 chance of being incontinent. And with my luck, I was the one. At your age and early stage you probably have a 99% chance of being one of the once-and-done RP patients whom we never even hear from on message boards like this one. And speaking of message boards, if you had perchance visited another popular prostate cancer message board, one which I shall not name, your decisions would have been met with DOZENS of responses to the effect of \"why are you even thinking of surgery, you should have Hi Def Brachy\". I get tired of fighting them off. Hold your ground. RP has a long track record. If you prefer to wait til after a few more biopsies that's probably okay. And finally, I am curious what prompted you to seek treatment with such low stats as you've listed above? My GP first sent me to a urologist when my PSA hit 4.0 ... The uro was unconcerned. Had he ever even mentioned the word cancer then I likely would have done some research as you did. As far as I knew, he was treating me for prostatitis. Once again, congratulations on a job well done, and I wish you good fortune on the path ahead of you.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by DjinTonic Speaking about DREs, just this morning I came across a study that looked at DREs for prostate screening and, remarkably, concluded that they were not necessary. If we eliminate the DRE and frown upon PSA screening, as some do, what is the symptom docs should use to wake up, bone pain from mets??? Originally Posted by MrEd I had no symptoms and DRE and ultrasound showed nothing. I guess if you don't use PSA's to trigger further investigation you can push the treatment to a later time and let the Medicare system take care of the costs. Originally Posted by DjinTonic You mean the cost of my funeral? There is still research in support of, and a push toward, not doing PSA screening for PCa. The problem is that early PCa has only signs and rarely symptoms. If docs are told not to check for the signs, where does that leave us? With a load of patients who are told out of the blue they have advanced, perhaps metastatic, prostate cancer. Don't get me started!!! For years, my DRE's were always \"normal\" and my PSA was \"elevated\", so I was told it was \"nothing to be concerned about.\" Thank goodness I changed doctors following my retirement. When my new Urologist showed me on a graphic where my tumor was located, high up behind the pubic bone and just below the bladder, I said no wonder my DRE's were always normal... to which he replied, yeah, you can never find those without an MRI. So when my wife's persistent back pain was repeatedly dismissed as a muscle strain, we paid CASH for an MRI. That was sixteen months ago, and she just passed the one year mark from completing chemo. We just received a letter from her insurance company rejecting payment for the MRI. Where the @#$%#& do they find these people???!!",

To underscore this, 3+3 is grade group 1, 3+4 jumps to group 2, and 4+3 is group 3. Put into a list: 3+3=1 3+4=2 4+3=3 4+4=4 4+5 or 5+4 = group 5, essentially terminal You do not want to be halfway up the totem pole. That's how narrow the dividing line really is.

All side effects are present. Not a happy camper. Sorry about your friend, Ano. FWIW my surgeon used a broad cut, and in his words, removed a lot of tissue. Hence the permanent ED and as you know, persistent incontinence. Now we won't know the true outcome until after RT ends and HT wears off, but I would much rather be in my shoes than your friend's.

      "Content": "Originally Posted by rmotacek1 I had my RALP in December 2015 and then because of my high gleason score I had 40 rounds of radiation in May. The radiation was really no problem except for some fatigue near the end. I am hoping that the combination of the surgery and radiation has knocked the cancer out. I just want to let you know that the radiation was very easy and not to worry about it. Originally Posted by Replicant I had salvage radiation .... Best of all, the treatment worked. Six months is the same timeline that my Urologist laid out for me (DaVinci three months ago and RT to start three months from now). The more I read about it the more apprehensive I become about it. Several guys have said it was no big deal, and everyone I've spoken with about it say it worked and there were no ill affects. But I'm still hoping that maybe I won't need to go thru with it. My PSA's have been <0.02 and categorized as undetectable. Still, the RT is recommended because my cancer had spread into both seminary vesicles. I really don't know if there's any way to determine whether or not it has or will spread beyond that. Eight weeks of daily RT seems like a tremendous risk as well as inconvenience just because there \"might be\" some residual cancer. My greatest concern is in regard to incontinence. Like several other guys here who had surgery around the same time as myself, I still have very little control over leaking urine. Everything I've read says to expect 6-12 months for full continence to return, but if I have RT at six months, then any progress (or lack thereof) comes to a complete halt. That is probably the scariest part.",

I saw Depends shields for $15 at CVS. The same package was $12 at Target and $10 from Amazon. Moral of the story: shop around. BTW one of my nurses said her husband prefers Tena as they are not as \"noisy\" as Depends. I also tried Depends Flex Fit briefs, but they have so much elastic that disposal becomes a problem. They fill the trash can too fast. For pad/shield/diaper disposal I use quart size zipper plastic bags. $6 for a box of 100, and I can fit two pads in each baggie. Keeps the bath/bedroom from smelling like urine. Personally I do not like shields, at least not at this point in my recovery. I haven't found one with enough of a \"pouch\" in front. Most of them are flat or nearly flat and tend to squish my poor penis too much. And for the first few days after cath removal, rubbing against the pads was too irritating. I've found that I like \"belted shields\". These are unisex pads that button in front and back. They come with a pair of elastic straps with a button on each end. They ride low on the hips and do not irritate my incision sites as they do not have a waist band.

      "Content": "Thanks, Rich, for the excellent list. Kozmic - yes, AZ is Amazon (I was trying to avoid advertising... but then they don't really need it, do they?) I saw Depends shields for $15 at CVS. The same package was $12 at Target and $10 from Amazon. Moral of the story: shop around. BTW one of my nurses said her husband prefers Tena as they are not as \"noisy\" as Depends. I also tried Depends Flex Fit briefs, but they have so much elastic that disposal becomes a problem. They fill the trash can too fast. For pad/shield/diaper disposal I use quart size zipper plastic bags. $6 for a box of 100, and I can fit two pads in each baggie. Keeps the bath/bedroom from smelling like urine. Personally I do not like shields, at least not at this point in my recovery. I haven't found one with enough of a \"pouch\" in front. Most of them are flat or nearly flat and tend to squish my poor penis too much. And for the first few days after cath removal, rubbing against the pads was too irritating. I've found that I like \"belted shields\". These are unisex pads that button in front and back. They come with a pair of elastic straps with a button on each end. They ride low on the hips and do not irritate my incision sites as they do not have a waist band. Initially I bought them at CVS because my wife had a 30% off extra care coupon, but I found the same shields available on AZ under the name Prevail.",

They fill the trash can too fast. For pad/shield/diaper disposal I use quart size zipper plastic bags. $6 for a box of 100, and I can fit two pads in each baggie.

Most of them are flat or nearly flat and tend to squish my poor penis too much. And for the first few days after cath removal, rubbing against the pads was too irritating. I've found that I like \"belted shields\". These are unisex pads that button in front and back. They come with a pair of elastic straps with a button on each end. They ride low on the hips and do not irritate my incision sites as they do not have a waist band. Initially I bought them at CVS because my wife had a 30% off extra care coupon, but I found the same shields available on AZ under the name Prevail.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by JJackson I had a Robotic Assisted Radical Prostatectomy on 9/26. My surgery was pretty uneventful. I was released to home the following day. Of course with a Foley cath, 5 puncture wounds (subcuticular stitches covered with Dermabond) and no JP or any other drain. I share the majority of experiences I\u0092ve read here\u0085no issues with the catherter really, very sore lower abdomen and pain in the shoulders. But the discomfort lessened each and by Post Op Day 4 all was fine. I had my catherter removed Sept 2nd. My anxiety over the removal was much worse than the act itself\u0085minimal discomfort that was over, done and gone in a few seconds. My cath was removed in my Surgeon\u0092s office. He was able to spare both nerves and said the lymph nodes were clear. Originally Posted by Rich2.0 Hi Jamie, It looks like we both had our surgery on the same day! I am a bit behind schedule on the catheter removal. I'm scheduled to have mine removed first thing tomorrow morning. I know I'm going to leak like a sieve the first day but getting rid of this ball and chain will be quite liberating. I don't have any pearls of wisdom to share at this point -just some words of encouragement. Hang in there and please post back often. I will be following this thread closely. Hello guys - I'm just a week behind you two, so I will be referring back to this thread often to check on your progress. Unfortunately I did not have much time to practice Kegels pre-op, but have also read that it has limited value until afterwards. My surgery was pretty much uneventful, much like JJackson's. My cath comes out in two days. Others I have spoken with mention six months as most common time to regain full control over continence. Good luck everyone!",

Some of us who are in our first month post-op have been posting remarks about leakage, Kegels, and other such matters in JJackson's \"Post-op Day 10\" thread... read it here: (http://www.cancerforums.net/threads/...Post-op-Day-10 Jamie, Rich and I (\"the three caballeros\") are all in our first month post-op and struggling with these issues. There has already been a lot of info put forward in that thread, but he/we discussed starting a properly titled thread on the topic. So here it is. I just wanted to get this up and running so we can add our thoughts and experiences here rather than there (as Day 10 has long passed!) Personally I have been experimenting with various pads, shields, diapers (ok, I'm going to call them that) as well as some \"external plumbing\" devices. I hope to post my thoughts and opinions here on various products in the days ahead. AZ has been a terrific resource, offering testimonials as well as decent prices, better than you might find in a drug store or superstore. For any newbies (and yes, we are all newbies at this, if not now, we were only recently) what I've read and been told is that typically we should not expect to have much control for the first two months, with full control over urinary continence being attained between six and twelve months. As usual, your mileage may vary. Some report better control early on and others still having accidents more than a year out. So don't worry if you don't fit some standard. There is none. Good luck everyone! We've already taken the greatest step on this journey.",

      "Content": "Very interesting thread... VERY interesting, probably one of the best I've found here. ASA, nice clear stratification of treatment choices vs Gleason score. Denis, I've watched your decision process on multiple forums from the very beginning. James, you hit the nail on the head... salvage radiation vs salvage surgery sealed the deal. Plus a bit of input from Ed and Another... not to omit anyone else (sorry). My brain is a bit foggy from a year on Lupron, so please bear with me. I started having serious problems right around the same time that my wife and I were planning our retirements and ultimate move to Florida... literally the same month. It was just an annoyance. I had been seeing my Urologist for twenty years. He never mentioned the C word. He did a biopsy, which was negative. DRE's were always 'normal'. He frequently told me that my PSA was high, but he never told me what that meant. So I went about with my life... retirement and relocation. When he ultimately retired and I had to find a new doctor, it was a relief when I was finally told that I have cancer. By this time, it was just one more thing I had to deal with (read my blog for more insight). It appeared surgery would the quickest and most efficient means of accomplishing an end. Some radiation options required too much time, others I was not even eligible for due to pathology. The issue of possible salvage sealed the deal. I was told following surgery that I would require radiation. And now I've had both. With surgery I pretty much knew what might happen and when... and in most cases, it did. I can accept that. After radiation, I have no idea what's next. I'm still dealing with bowel issues since the second week of radiation. It was a surprise and it is scary. When I mention it in forums some guys say, yeah, that can happen. Why was I not told about this beforehand? So with regard to surgery, I knew the risks going in and a year later I know which ones became an issue and which ones have not. But with radiation, I just don't know. My final meeting with the RO he told me that I wouldn't know for at least a year whether or not it worked. I would be very concerned if I had chosen primary radiation monotherapy and have no idea whether or not it had cured me, and that I had no further options. And I should add, what other surprises are in store? Will I someday hear that I have colorectal cancer and wonder whether or not it was caused by the radiation? I already have to wait another four months before I can even have a colonoscopy, because of the radiation. Again, it's all a big unknown. I'm just rolling with the punches here. Life throws me a curve ball and I deal with it the best I can.",

      "Content": "Thanks, Rich, for the excellent list. Kozmic - yes, AZ is Amazon (I was trying to avoid advertising... but then they don't really need it, do they?) I saw Depends shields for $15 at CVS. The same package was $12 at Target and $10 from Amazon. Moral of the story: shop around. BTW one of my nurses said her husband prefers Tena as they are not as \"noisy\" as Depends. I also tried Depends Flex Fit briefs, but they have so much elastic that disposal becomes a problem. They fill the trash can too fast. For pad/shield/diaper disposal I use quart size zipper plastic bags. $6 for a box of 100, and I can fit two pads in each baggie. Keeps the bath/bedroom from smelling like urine. Personally I do not like shields, at least not at this point in my recovery. I haven't found one with enough of a \"pouch\" in front. Most of them are flat or nearly flat and tend to squish my poor penis too much. And for the first few days after cath removal, rubbing against the pads was too irritating. I've found that I like \"belted shields\". These are unisex pads that button in front and back. They come with a pair of elastic straps with a button on each end. They ride low on the hips and do not irritate my incision sites as they do not have a waist band. Initially I bought them at CVS because my wife had a 30% off extra care coupon, but I found the same shields available on AZ under the name Prevail.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by JJackson I had a Robotic Assisted Radical Prostatectomy on 9/26. My surgery was pretty uneventful. I was released to home the following day. Of course with a Foley cath, 5 puncture wounds (subcuticular stitches covered with Dermabond) and no JP or any other drain. I share the majority of experiences I\u0092ve read here\u0085no issues with the catherter really, very sore lower abdomen and pain in the shoulders. But the discomfort lessened each and by Post Op Day 4 all was fine. I had my catherter removed Sept 2nd. My anxiety over the removal was much worse than the act itself\u0085minimal discomfort that was over, done and gone in a few seconds. My cath was removed in my Surgeon\u0092s office. He was able to spare both nerves and said the lymph nodes were clear. Originally Posted by Rich2.0 Hi Jamie, It looks like we both had our surgery on the same day! I am a bit behind schedule on the catheter removal. I'm scheduled to have mine removed first thing tomorrow morning. I know I'm going to leak like a sieve the first day but getting rid of this ball and chain will be quite liberating. I don't have any pearls of wisdom to share at this point -just some words of encouragement. Hang in there and please post back often. I will be following this thread closely. Hello guys - I'm just a week behind you two, so I will be referring back to this thread often to check on your progress. Unfortunately I did not have much time to practice Kegels pre-op, but have also read that it has limited value until afterwards. My surgery was pretty much uneventful, much like JJackson's. My cath comes out in two days. Others I have spoken with mention six months as most common time to regain full control over continence. Good luck everyone!",

      "Content": "Unless you have other health problems that may shorten your life, I would recommend ART as soon as your continence and erectile function reach an acceptable level of healing (6 mos). Your SVI plus primary grade 4 pathology puts you in the very high risk category, just as I was. In fact, my first year post-op was chaos as I tried to get adjuvant RT underway within twelve months. During that time, my PSA was checked monthly and it crept up ever so slightly from <.02 to .02 to <.03 and so on. Even though I've read that men with such adverse pathologies stand a 50/50 chance of getting by without ART, I didn't want to wait for BCR to get a foot hold. If there is residual cancer left in your abdomen, you definitely want to zap it before it moves on to greener pastures. But again, this is assuming otherwise good health on your part, or at least as good as one can expect. Good luck to you!",

      "Content": "Unless you have other health problems that may shorten your life, I would recommend ART as soon as your continence and erectile function reach an acceptable level of healing (6 mos). Your SVI plus primary grade 4 pathology puts you in the very high risk category, just as I was. In fact, my first year post-op was chaos as I tried to get adjuvant RT underway within twelve months. During that time, my PSA was checked monthly and it crept up ever so slightly from <.02 to .02 to <.03 and so on. Even though I've read that men with such adverse pathologies stand a 50/50 chance of getting by without ART, I didn't want to wait for BCR to get a foot hold. If there is residual cancer left in your abdomen, you definitely want to zap it before it moves on to greener pastures. But again, this is assuming otherwise good health on your part, or at least as good as one can expect. Good luck to you!",

      "Content": "You were right to take time to enjoy the summer and ponder your choices. True, your predominantly G6 tumor(s) will grow slowly and likely present no problem. But the grade 4 core, though only 20%, can be quite aggressive. Furthermore, that core was located at the apex, where a positive surgical margin is more likely to occur in the event of extraprostatic extension. I'd say you can't afford to wait much longer. Also IMO, based on your age and assuming good health, you are an ideal candidate for robotic prostatectomy, and are most likely to enjoy a rapid and full recovery. Regarding radiation, often that is chosen for older men or those who are poor surgical candidates, and those whose cancer is much more advanced. Older in that the after effects of radiation may not show up for twenty years, and I believe that you would not want to find out in your seventies that perhaps you should have chosen surgery twenty years earlier. Just my opinions. Good luck!",

      "Content": "Mike - Sorry to hear the news, but I just gotta say... you're breaking the news in someone else's thread (unless you are Kim's husband, then I'm sorry, I misunderstood). If so the moderator should move your post to its own thread. So about the cancer, your G8 is higher than most of the guys here. Typically G7's are when guys come here asking about options. For G8 things are a bit further along than you'd like. There is a possibility that it has already spread outside the prostate. Just a possibility. There are a few of us here with that. Generally the option most often chosen is surgery, with the primary reason being that if the surgery does not get all the cancer out, then you can have radiation afterwards (referred to as salvage radiation) to clean up the abdominal bed. If radiation is performed first, the tissues become deformed and follow up surgery if needed is far less likely to be successful. If you're thinking traditional chemotherapy, that is unlikely for PCa at your stage. Typically that is reserved for G9 or G10, where the cancer has already left the prostate bed and spread throughout the body. There are probably more guys here at that stage than at yours and mine... that is, assuming your scans don't reveal something worse then your G8 rating and moderate PSA level would indicate. Good luck, Mike. Keep us informed.",

Yeah, I'm on Lupron, about halfway thru my course. Next and hopefully final six month shot will be in January. Worst things about it for me are the hot flashes and mood swings. I fought to get a Rx for Venlafaxine which has made the hot flashes tolerable and the mood swings bearable. I'd say it has reduced the frequency, intensity and duration of both, but I keep a fan by my Sheldon seat on the sofa and one at my bedside. I bought an external on/off switch to make it easier generally it's on only a minute or so. Good luck Jay and see you in chat! One Day More!",

I was referring to his PSA as being in line with a G8 and possible T3 pathology, rather than the triple digit PSA's associated with stage 4 G9/10 guys here. Perhaps \"moderately high\" would have been more accurate, but my intent was to allay any fears that he might need to undergo chemo.

      "Content": "Congrats on your consistently low PSA level Hammer, and here's hoping that continues for you (and for me... next PSA is in two weeks). Regarding the balloon, Rooster strongly recommended it and I asked my RO about it twice. He told me that about half of G/U RO's use the balloon and half do not, and he does not. That was that. The treatment facility is right around the corner from my home so I wasn't about to drive an hour away every day just to get to experience a rectal balloon (as much as I may have wanted to ). They were however quite adamant about the full bladder thing, and several times, especially when I was sick, warned me that they wouldn't treat me the next day if it wasn't full. The treatments were about ten minutes each, and generally I was seen on time or even a little early. One of the tech's informed me that the alignment, pre-scan and treatment takes about seven minutes, plus a few for getting the pt on and off the table. This was using fairly new equipment. I'd imagine some older machines required more time on the table and therefore the balloon is necessitated. I can only imagine the delay that it's insertion, filling and removal would introduce, plus time allowance for any \"accidents\". So I did not have the balloon, and that's all I can add to this discussion. I did however experience persistent diarrhea, gas and frequent BM's... several per day, starting the second week of RT and extended several months afterwards. The RO did not warn me in advance and I only knew about the possibility of bowel distress by reading forums. There are of course other forums where everyone would have us believe that radiation has zero side effects. When I was really sick with the diarrhea was when the tech's would warn me about my bladder not being full. No one seemed to be very concerned about the GI SE's. The RO instructed me to eat Activia 2X daily. Additionally I found there were foods even beyond the extensive list they had given me that I had to eliminate from my diet during RT and on Dr's orders for several weeks afterwards. Good luck going forward, brothers.",

      "Content": "My AUS was finally turned on last Friday. Life with the AUS is certainly better than without it. Yesterday we went to the beach and it was only the second time in the past year that I was able to wear a swimsuit. It was great... lounging on the beach, swim in the gulf, pool, hot tub, shower... all without feeling that I had to hide something or eventually go back into some awkward, inconvenient plumbing or soaking thru my clothes. All is not totally dry however. The swimsuit was not a problem as it is typically wet anyway. But by the end of each day the thin pad I wear inside my shorts has numerous stains... just spots, nothing soaked. Now and then I can feel a bit of a surge, a sensation that were it not for the AUS would have been a squirt. Typically bending or lifting a certain way. I do already have fairly good control of my natural sphincter and it takes some getting used to it knowing how to squeeze the pump and then release my natural sphincter to pee normally. So I find sitting is slightly more convenient than standing. I suppose that if I had waited long enough, eventually I might regain something close to full control. However the matter of radiation pretty much meant that I had to proceed with having the AUS implanted. First off, my SRT had already been delayed too long, now approaching a full year since RP. It was necessary to be able to hold a full bladder in order to proceed with IMRT. It could not wait another six months for me to regain full control. Secondly, I have heard speaking with others who have undergone SRT that the radiation actually worsened their urinary control. So they ended up less continent than they were going into it. All that plus the fact that my Urologist told me early on that it was better to have it implanted before receiving radiation rather than after. The only cases of totally failed AUS implants that I know of were guys who had it put in after having radiation. I did not want to be in that boat. But all is not perfect though. Somehow the revision surgery two weeks after the original implant left me with some sort of trigger nerve pain in my groin involving my upper thigh and my one remaining testicle. It feels somewhere between sciatica and a kick in the balls. I must be very careful getting in and out of the car, even walking. My original Uro said that maybe a nerve got hooked while my legs were in the stirrups. The prosthetic surgeon dismissed that as a possibility. The pain is so intense that even poking around in my groin to find the source of the pain is enough to cause it to hurt for several days. I suspect that it is the fitting on the side of the cuff where the tubing connects to the cuff. But there's nothing I can do about it now, and I would not want to further delay SRT while a re-revision would need to heal. Hopefully in another 8-10 years when the whole thing will need replacing that this problem will go away... assuming I am still alive at that point. Tomorrow I return to the RO for my mapping scans and get my marks. Then on Friday my wife is finally having her port removed. Her next CT scan will be in October, probably just after I finish SRT. I've heard that the next two months will go quickly. The dietary restrictions are inconvenient, but hopefully that will be the worst of it. Waiting anxiously for this crazy roller coaster ride to finally come to an end.",

      "Content": "Mike - Sorry to hear the news, but I just gotta say... you're breaking the news in someone else's thread (unless you are Kim's husband, then I'm sorry, I misunderstood). If so the moderator should move your post to its own thread. So about the cancer, your G8 is higher than most of the guys here. Typically G7's are when guys come here asking about options. For G8 things are a bit further along than you'd like. There is a possibility that it has already spread outside the prostate. Just a possibility. There are a few of us here with that. Generally the option most often chosen is surgery, with the primary reason being that if the surgery does not get all the cancer out, then you can have radiation afterwards (referred to as salvage radiation) to clean up the abdominal bed. If radiation is performed first, the tissues become deformed and follow up surgery if needed is far less likely to be successful. If you're thinking traditional chemotherapy, that is unlikely for PCa at your stage. Typically that is reserved for G9 or G10, where the cancer has already left the prostate bed and spread throughout the body. There are probably more guys here at that stage than at yours and mine... that is, assuming your scans don't reveal something worse then your G8 rating and moderate PSA level would indicate. Good luck, Mike. Keep us informed.",

      "Content": "Hey Sudds, sorry about your streak of bad luck, but you are not alone. I think one out of four RP's return a final Gleason higher than the biopsy, so it happens. Several other FB's here have had that happen. Fortunately yours was organ confined other than the possible surgical margin, which is not uncommon for a tumor at the apex. You're probably looking at a year or two on HT and two months of RT. I'm now in my seventh week with just nine treatments left (total 7000 rads). My tumor was also 25% volume, about the same as yours. So you're in good company here. We're all fighting for you and we're all behind you. Good luck going forward. Just keep your chin up and move ahead. Eventually this will all end and you will come out on top.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by Pratoman ... on my way home from a 10 day trip to Baton Rouge, Orlando, and Lake Worth, Florida... I have to say, it was a great respite. I thought less about cancer. Which was nice, because lately it seems like cancer has occupied my thoughts more than any other topic. Which truly sucks. Anyone else feel this way? Hello, Captain! Glad you got away from the gloomy world of cancer. I know that the busy mind does not drift into darker thoughts. Sometimes when I'm researching something related to cancer I just get sick of it and shut down. We are in fact right now in Orlando for a week... actually Kissimmee... well actually my phone says Celebration. Anyway, we spent yesterday at Universal Studios and IOA. We decided to buy season passes this year, and are planning for some of our family to join us here around Thanksgiving.[/QUOTE] Anyway, my respite is about to end... I'll go for my blood draw for PSA. On top of that, my wife is having a CT Scan on Friday, 1st one since finishing chemo for ovarian cancer, 5 weeks ago. Oh the joys of being a \"cancer couple\" ... Next week Lori has her post-chemo PET/CT scans to see if the cancer is gone, or if she goes back on chemo for a couple more rounds. Then the following Monday I go under the knife for my implant. Yes, sweating bullets indeed! I remember when you lost your \"<\". How sad... I guess mainly because it generally does not go back down again. But you still have a lo-o-o-o-ong way to go before the .1 mark. I would think that after two years you probably have a lot of time before any continual rise would reach the point of requiring action. Perhaps you may join us in the wonderful world of Lupron. Good luck with you PSA, end especially good luck to your wife with her scans. And welcome back, Captain!",

With the apical margin and tert 5, it's better to treat now before the horses get too far away from to corral. I think these days they use .03 as the threshold for possible future recurrence. Good luck going forward. It takes a couple of week to get into the swing of things... when to drink and how much, what you can eat and a hint of what side effects may be ahead for you. Weeks 3-5 were pretty rough for me, and it seemed like it will never end... then the fatigue hits you all of a sudden at week 6.

You do not mention his Gleason score or pathology staging. Sometimes cancer escapes the prostate for example along nerve pathways. If his PSA reaches 0.1 then two consecutive PSA tests will determine his doubling rate and give you an idea when he might need salvage radiation. At least that's what I understand how it works.

      "Content": "My understanding is - and this is purely non-technical and non-medical, that positive margins mean that some cancer cells remain in the area of the prostate after the prostate itself has been removed. First one must realize that EVERYTHING in the body is squished together. Various \"parts\" are not distinct from each other as clearly as they are in drawings or in the plastic models we may have seen. When the surgeon gets in there, basically EVERYTHING is red, and all looks very much the same. Tissues have different textures and contours and the surgeon must distinguish them from each other by visual and tactile recognition. So I'm guessing that he/she must cut away just enough but not too much. Cutting too deep means they've cut into something else. My surgeon used a \"broad cut\" and he told me afterwards that he \"removed a lot of tissue\". This was because my cancer was more extensive than the scans had indicated, and when asked about nerve sparing, both my wife and I emphasized that eliminating the cancer was to be the highest priority. Consequently I lost much in the way of urinary and sexual functioning... But he proudly told me \"negative nodes and negative margins\". I have observed in these prostate forums that many of the men who experienced recurrence had a positive margin, sometimes at the bladder neck, but more often in the area of the apex where the prostate is anchored to the pelvic floor... even though they may have had a relatively low Gleason score and lesser pathological stage. The surgeon may have been focused on more conservative treatment to avoid cutting away too much of the surrounding tissue.",

I must apologize to my friends here as there is no way I will be able catch up on all these back threads (I'm still in a narcotic fog and can't even remember what I've said in which threads). Anyway, I had Foleys in for two weeks following the implant surgery, then had a cystoscopy Tuesday morning following the holiday weekend and was admitted for emergency surgery that night to revise the AUS. Procedure went well, or seems to anyway... much better than two weeks ago. Still have an abdominal drain tube that comes out tomorrow morning. I posted on HW for those who are there also. Not much else has changed, just hate that I have to go thru the whole constipation thing all over again, just when things seemed to have finally settled down. Interesting side effect... I can't pee standing now, and have to sit like a girl... not sure if this is still an issue with the AUS. Good news is I stay dry when on my feet (yay!). Dr assures me that the urethra will fully heal and that I haven't lost any time on the SRT schedule. June is a big month, marking the one year anniversary since the MRI that revealed my prostate tumor. Just thinking of all that's happened in the past year is mind boggling.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by TinkerbellRM27 Regarding his Gleason score, the urologist said I shouldn't really read the report as 4 + 3 = 7 I should read it as 4 + 4 = 8; he said they had to document the 3 because they saw some but that it was predominately 4's. I need serious help determining how to forge ahead with a treatment plan and options. What is the difference for example between a radiation oncologist and a medical oncologist? Also his urologist yesterday when talking made a comment almost how we want to steer away from these oncologists who will pump full of even more toxins that will kill him instead... When you're talkin' 4+4 you're talkin 'bout me! Anyway, I'd say the RO is now you're Dad's doctor. The MO won't be needed unless the bone scan turns up mets. The RO does primary radiation treatment \"of your choice\" (IMRT, SBRT, \"seeds\") ... there's a baker's dozen when it comes to primary RT, which is often chosen if there are complicating medical conditions such as heart disease or diabetes. The RO may also come back into the picture if your dad has surgery, as often is the case of grade 4, the cancer has become \"locally advanced\" also known as stage 3, meaning the cancer had escaped the prostate capsule and become embedded in the pelvic floor. I'm guessing he will end up with radiation anyway, whether as primary treatment or as either adjuvant or salvage radiation following prostatectomy, if for no other reason because of his age and very high PSA.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by TinkerbellRM27 ROBLEE: So when \"shopping\" for multiple opinions do I shop just among Radiation Oncologists which I assume is what RO stands for? Also, I was surprised his urologist said surgery/removal of the prostate was unlikely from his perspective, for now. Said wanted to wait for bone scan. His Urologist is saying he has \"high grade, high risk, metastatic prostate cancer\". I am not sure how he knows it has metastasized - he said even if the bone scan was negative there are many time cancer sells embedded missed. But I think he is assuming it has spread based on the PSA, DRE, and 21 of 21 all cancerous. Given his PSA I would not be surprised if it has indeed already metastasized, but I did not want to be too blunt about that just yet. But it sounds like the Urologist is on top of this, if I understand, steering you away from both surgery AND away from going straight to a medical oncologist. In my opinion, yes, a radiation oncologist, preferably one who exclusively does urologic radiation oncology, would be your best bet at this point. You are also right that the number of positive cores indicates that the cancer is pervasive throughout his prostate gland, and the solid G8 score would indicate that your dad will come out of this with a minimum of stage 3A, more likely stage 3B or stage 4, all of which are considered very high risk. If stage 4 he would go straight into hormone therapy (ADT) in order to shrink his prostate and alleviate the urinary symptoms, and also to prepare him for further treatment. Good luck. It certainly sounds like he has a very serious case and what happens over the next few weeks will be critical.",

      "Content": "For my friends, the surgery that had been scheduled for today was cancelled. Instead I spent most of last week at Moffitt cancer center for a variety of scans which in the end turned out to be inconclusive. So still the only way to determine if this mass in my abdomen is cancer or not will be to have it removed. There are a number of complicating factors involved, which cannot be fully appreciated by anyone who has never experienced them first hand. Let's just say it's a long story. So now I'm looking at maybe mid November... unfortunate as that is the start of the holidays. We had already booked a couple weeks in Orlando which will most likely be non-refundable. But my symptoms are worsening by the day, and despite being assured that this tumor is slow growing, I know I would be worried about it constantly... for it could at any moment develop into an emergency situation, and I certainly don't want that to happen. I know that everyone here has been in this type of very stressful situation , where you have to make potentially life altering decisions with very little information to go on and no useful guidance from others. Every situation is different, and what may have worked for one person may not necessarily work for another. This stuff just never lets up.",

It was supposed to be a simple procedure, and I thought that I had done everything right as far as pre-op research and all that, but still I had a terrible experience. But the implant does work, and is much better than total incontinence. It leaks a little and I still use a light pad, around one a day. Others have asked about it but when I respond no one replies, so I will not waste any more time on it. And so far I have not received any PM. This forum is not a very good source of info regarding the AUS. When I asked here earlier in the year no one replied. Anyway, good luck on Dec 22.

      "Content": "Very interesting thread... VERY interesting, probably one of the best I've found here. ASA, nice clear stratification of treatment choices vs Gleason score. Denis, I've watched your decision process on multiple forums from the very beginning. James, you hit the nail on the head... salvage radiation vs salvage surgery sealed the deal. Plus a bit of input from Ed and Another... not to omit anyone else (sorry). My brain is a bit foggy from a year on Lupron, so please bear with me. I started having serious problems right around the same time that my wife and I were planning our retirements and ultimate move to Florida... literally the same month. It was just an annoyance. I had been seeing my Urologist for twenty years. He never mentioned the C word. He did a biopsy, which was negative. DRE's were always 'normal'. He frequently told me that my PSA was high, but he never told me what that meant. So I went about with my life... retirement and relocation. When he ultimately retired and I had to find a new doctor, it was a relief when I was finally told that I have cancer. By this time, it was just one more thing I had to deal with (read my blog for more insight). It appeared surgery would the quickest and most efficient means of accomplishing an end. Some radiation options required too much time, others I was not even eligible for due to pathology. The issue of possible salvage sealed the deal. I was told following surgery that I would require radiation. And now I've had both. With surgery I pretty much knew what might happen and when... and in most cases, it did. I can accept that. After radiation, I have no idea what's next. I'm still dealing with bowel issues since the second week of radiation. It was a surprise and it is scary. When I mention it in forums some guys say, yeah, that can happen. Why was I not told about this beforehand? So with regard to surgery, I knew the risks going in and a year later I know which ones became an issue and which ones have not. But with radiation, I just don't know. My final meeting with the RO he told me that I wouldn't know for at least a year whether or not it worked. I would be very concerned if I had chosen primary radiation monotherapy and have no idea whether or not it had cured me, and that I had no further options. And I should add, what other surprises are in store? Will I someday hear that I have colorectal cancer and wonder whether or not it was caused by the radiation? I already have to wait another four months before I can even have a colonoscopy, because of the radiation. Again, it's all a big unknown. I'm just rolling with the punches here. Life throws me a curve ball and I deal with it the best I can.",

      "Content": "Gary-e replied in the incontinence pad experience thread, but I felt it might be better to start a new thread in case anyone else might be interested. Original thread: https://www.cancerforums.net/threads/54632-Incontinence-pad-experience Originally Posted by Gary e Hi roblee. I was always curious about the AUS. Did you have jitters having it installed the first time. My Uro doc said one Con he fears is that I will not know when to pee which may risk bladder infection. So what is it like if you don't mind telling. Thx Gary e Certainly, glad to help in any way I can. Not knowing your condition, I'd say that your doctor's concern should not be a problem, unless there is some reason such as a neurological condition that might cause you to not be able to feel when your bladder is full. Bladder sensations are normal with the AUS, in fact, my natural sphincter still works to some extent but is unreliable. I can tell when my bladder needs to be emptied, and when in front of the urinal or toilet must remember to both manually release the AUS as well as tell my natural sphincter to open up. There is sometimes some pressure buildup and it squirts at first, so it's a bit tricky getting everything right. Regarding the jitters, yes, this was probably one of the most difficult decisions of my life. I was extremely stressed at the time. I knew immediately following the prostatectomy that I would require salvage radiation (called adjuvant radiation) within six months, and that the RT would require holding a full bladder every day long enough for the radiation treatment, about two hours. As mentioned, my sphincter worked but I had little control and would leak copiously at times. Getting the implant I've had a number of other surgeries in my life (the AUS and its revision were numbers 11 and 12 as best I can recount). All had been life and death type situations. The AUS was an elective surgery, not entirely necessary, but would be required to proceed with the radiation in a timely manner. The clock was ticking, and the cancer was growing. Furthermore there are required delays for healing following any surgery and a window of several months before and after radiation. And furthermore getting the AUS would change the way I would have to do something that I do all day every day for the rest of my life! I thought I did everything right. I got literature from the manufacturer. I attended what was basically a sales presentation by a urologist and a RN representative of the manufacturer. I interviewed several urologists and discussed the procedure and recovery. There is a fairly high rate of failure, about 25%, which would further delay getting the radiation underway. I had everything mapped out in a spreadsheet. I had already been thru several months of Kegel coaching with physical therapist. Additionally, to add to my stress level, my wife was undergoing five months of chemotherapy plus a spinal infusion every few weeks. Finally the day came. I was to be the first surgery of the day. By noon I noticed that everyone who had come in after me had already been taken in. Like much of my experience in restaurants, when everyone who came in after me already had there food and I hadn't been served yet. Around noon they told me that the doctor would be late (DUH!) I hadn't had anything to eat or drink all morning and became, uh, emotional. At 2PM they finally took me in and gave me some drugs. I never saw the doctor. I woke up around 6PM and they asked me to pee. I couldn't. The surgeon came in around 8 and inserted a foley catheter after squeezing my nuts to make sure everything was in place. Very painful. For some reason I have never heard of anyone else having such an experience with the AUS. Most say they got the quick and simple procedure that I had been promised. I don't mean to discourage you, because normally this doesn't happen. Apparently. It's Murphy's Law... if anything can possibly go wrong, it will happen to you! For two weeks following the surgery I had a Foley. Everything down there was dark red and purple. Twice the cath was removed and I still couldn't pee. Finally the urologist did a cystoscopy and I was rushed to the hospital for emergency surgery and the AUS was replaced... which seemed to go fairly well. The AUS is left turned off for six weeks afterwards to let things heal. It was good to be rid of the cath, but I started having pains in my left thigh, something I described as being somewhere between sciatica and a kick in the balls. The urologist attributed it to swelling. Sitting is still uncomfortable now after nearly a year I don't worry about the pain (it couldn't be anything too serious, and is not as severe as it was the first month). Again, I've never read of anyone else experiencing this. Living with the implant Life with the AUS is certainly better than being totally incontinent. I wore a leg bag and condom cath for nearly a year before the AUS was finally turned on. The AUS leaks a bit. My natural sphincter is still unreliable. I can feel the AUS cuff in my groin between my butt cheeks. Sitting on hard surfaces I can feel it getting pressured. Sitting in a car for long trips I still feel the pains at the top of my thigh. Again, not normal. But stuff like squirting when sitting and occasional drips requiring wearing a light pad seem to be fairly common. Those who ride bikes require a special seat that is split down the middle. Many guys say they lost what continence they had after radiation. Mine stayed about the same, though it was never very good to start with. I seem to have less nighttime continence than I did before the AUS. Previously I could sleep \"dry\" with confidence. Nowadays I have to sleep with a dry washcloth in my crotch. I bought a bunch of yellow ones to differentiate between the ones my wife uses on her face. I wear a medical ID bracelet anytime I am in the car or away from home, in the pool etc. It says I should only be cathed by a urologist, someone who knows how to cath past the AUS. Many doctors, nurses and paramedics I know have never heard of an artificial sphincter implant. I understand that the AUS cuff gradually erodes the urethra and must be periodically relocated, at which time they just replace everything. Typically it's every seven years, though some go as long as ten. The dripping is an issue especially in a dry swim suit. Once everything is wet, no problem. There is no maintenance required, other than needing constant backup protection, even when in loungewear. Remembering that it may squirt when first squeezed. Knowing ahead of time how weak or strong the stream may be. It's better than incontinence, but it is not total continence. Some guys report having no problems. I guess they're lucky. I guess I shouldn't be surprised. There was a one in twenty chance that RP would leave me incontinent. I was one of the unlucky 5%. There was a one in four chance that the AUS would require revision. I was one of the unlucky 25%. And I don't know what the odds are of still having issues long term after the implant activation. Same thing with RT. Most guys say they had no problem. I developed diarrhea the second week which persisted beyond the end of treatments. Just one lucky guy I guess, wink.",

      "Content": "Dave, in my opinion you should consider yourself well on the way to BCR and looking into SRT. I remember seeing the same report mentioned by Prato that urologists tend to recommend SRT much later than RO's do. The same website also has a report that starting SRT before 21 months post-op has far better outcomes than waiting until the .2 threshold is crossed. This is what has led the the current thinking that three consecutive rises above .03 should trigger SRT (I'm generalizing here). With your positive surgical margin and small secondary grade 4 pathology I believe that should be considered sufficient adverse pathology to at least consider initiating SRT. Remember that grade 4 is the type that spreads, and essentially there is no grade 1 or 2 in this scoring method. The philosophy behind early SRT (eSRT) is to zap any remaining cancer cells that may have escaped (+SM) while they are still localized and before they leave the prostate bed and move on to other areas of the body... which is probably what Prato is facing right now. Even a small number of grade 4 cells could have easily been missed in pathology but are enough to set up residence. Please realize that I have no medical training and my opinions are often refuted because I don't cite specific studies and such, but I've seen enough and been thru enough that I recognize a duck when I see a duck. At this stage, one year post-op, you are playing a game of odds. Your condition may progress or it may not... there is no way to know now what the future will hold. I think you have made the right decision having your PSA re-evaluated and recognized that you are not in Kansas anymore. When it is your life that you are betting on, it becomes an entirely different game than the one your doctors are facing. Let's say it's like a bacon and eggs breakfast... a chicken was involved, but the pig was committed. Your urologist was involved, but you are committed. Any possibility of BCR means to your Uro that his surgery failed, and he may be reluctant to consider that as a possibility. But it is your future and your life that is on the line. You want to do all you can now, and not allow the beast to gain the upper hand. Good luck!",

      "Content": "Sorry to read about your problems, and all I can say is we all have them. Read the last line of my signature below. I'll tell you a bit about our problems and try to weave them into yours. Anyway, we've been married for 36 years and our problems began around fifteen years ago when little Peter couldn't perform the way he used to. We had both been sexually active, totally monogamous and very satisfied until around the time that I turned 50. Turns out I had a strangled cord on one testicle. I had surgery, but by then my wife had become bitter that I \"didn't love her anymore\"... which couldn't be further from the truth. She was also less sexual but blamed it on menopause. None of this helped our situation. About five years ago the testicle was removed and I had pretty much given up on mutual sex. Even going solo had become curiously painful. My PSA was rising but my Urologist just kept putting me on longer and longer courses of antibiotic. Our relationship had become strained and I began having long episodes of crying. I asked my GP but he was no help. I was hoping we might be referred to counseling or something. Finally I changed doctors and was given an MRI and diagnosed with prostate cancer. Good news, right? At least after three years I finally had something to work with. Well, the cancer was worse than expected, and I resented the time that had been lost. Then a few months after surgery my wife was complaining of severe back pain. Several doctors dismissed it and just gave her more and more pain meds. Sounded familiar to me, so we paid cash for an MRI, which revealed a tumor on her spine, and ultimately turned out to be lymphoma. All this was last December and she finally got out of the hospital very late at night the night before Christmas eve. Merry Christmas! So for the next few months I drove her to her chemotherapy and also to the spinal infusions three days after each chemo. Lots of scans etc in there also. My own treatment for the PCa was also ongoing and as soon as she finished chemo I had two surgeries to implant an artificial urinary sphincter because I was still leaking like crazy and needed to get started on follow up radiation for my own cancer. That finally ended just two months ago, and we had a wonderful Thanksgiving with our sons and their families. Because we both have suffered thru each others' cancers, we now realize that what we have left is nothing like what we had before but have are fortunate to be alive and that we still have each other, which has brought us much closer to each other. I am still on hormone blockade... chemical castration to starve the remaining cancer, and sex is totally out of the realm of possibility. But after what we have been thru together we are looking forward to hopefully a \"normal\" Christmas this year. So I guess for your case I have to say that if your leaking is an issue you can look into the AUS. If that is appropriate for you, it's the same company that makes the penile implant, which can be put in during the same surgery. I suspect that at your age (and not knowing how old your new bride may be) you probably can't expect to ever be the virile young man you used to be. But tackle each problem one at a time. This past year I also started taking antidepressants, also for the first time ever in my life for something like that, but I feel it has saved my sanity as well as my marriage. Look into that as well, and perhaps also into counseling. Depression and despair can become crippling. I know sometimes it seems there's no way to climb out of the dark hole. And cancer can strike anyone at any time. It sounds like in your case you emerged the victor, for now. Relish the time you have together. Hopefully your wife can be understanding and appreciate what you have been thru. Let her know that you are doing the best you can. Sometimes it takes a brush with death to make one realize just how frail we truly are.",

He said she has a 70% likelihood of remaining in remission for the rest of her life and \"of the other 30% we usually can save about half\"... so right around 85%, which is what I had read when I first began to research her PBL back in December. Now she is in surveillance and is supposed to get CT scans every six months, starting in October... which is right around when I hope to finish SRT, assuming everything goes well with the AUS on Monday.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by derbyrobert My brother recently had a prostatecomy and has never been the same since. I am a Clinical Psychologist and have noticed the significant changes... but these in no way account for this personalty change. The changes that result from prostate cancer and more importantly cancer treatment certainly changes ones outlook on life. However, I had an experience that began long before my diagnosis and treatment. I started having some troubling prostate symptoms nearly four years ago, and had a biopsy a few months later which was negative, but turned out later to be a false negative... in other words, the biopsy completely missed the tumor. That was the beginning of a very rough year, and for the next two years I was prone to episodes of crying and my wife frequently told me that I was depressed. I have never had any psych or emotional problems, but spoke with my doctor and he pretty much dismissed the symptoms that I presented to him. Two years later another biopsy identified the tumor and I had a prostatectomy, was started on Lupron and the antidepressant Effexor, had a urinary implant and underwent two months of radiation. My life has definitely changed as a result of the treatments, but mentally I feel far better off than I did two or three years ago. I believe now that during those two years between the negative biopsy and the positive one and subsequent treatments that I actually did have a tumor growing in me and that it affected my personality and my mental and emotional state, perhaps chemically. I have never heard anyone else mention this, but what I experienced was real. Perhaps your brother is obsessed with his new project as an item on his bucket list. But maybe the cancer growing in his prostate actually affected his personality by means of a physical process.",

The location of the extension can be an indicator of risk recurrence and treatment success. Cancer at the base is higher risk in general. It may be more difficult to reach effectively without unacceptable side effects. SVs extend up and behind the bladder. Early detection and treatment may still be a gold standard.

      "Content": "Thank you to those who have already contacted me personally. We are in northern Pinellas county and until just recently it looked like we were going to be directly in the storm's path. Recent landfall at Marco Island and it's current northern track will put the storm just east of Tampa when it passes us overnight tonight. The outermost rain bands passed us about five hours ago and spawned some tornadoes further inland. We have had light rain and gusty winds until right around 4PM. The winds are now picking up and our power has flickered a few times. Our biggest fear is losing power, possibly for several days. They now say on the news that this storm has already sucked most of the water right out of Tampa bay... bad news is the water will return later, with a surge. As much as I would like to see that personally, I'm happy to be indoors right now. Our place is sturdy and I feel safe and on the top floor. Big question was whether or not to move our cars away from trees. I'd hate to move one out into the open and get struck by some other projectile. We had to take in a relative whose home is right on the water. She is not sure what will be left afterwards. We have plenty of food, water and batteries, thank goodness. As far as we know, no one living in our immediate community has had to evacuate. My RO's office called and cancelled treatments for both Monday and Tuesday, which is good news, as I will have a few more days to recover from the SE's... which have been more difficult than expected. Bowel disruptions. Nineteen treatments completed, twenty more to go. Best of luck to the others here in Florida and those to the north who will be affected by this storm. I will try to update more later, assuming we keep our service.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by Tybeeman I think I am more nervous about this then my RP. Understood. I was more apprehensive about the AUS implant surgery than about the RP. Difference is the RP was necessary, and the AUS is elective. Also, once in, the implant would change how I use the bathroom for the rest of my life. Think about how much you take that for granted. Oh, also the AUS was necessary so that I can proceed with salvage radiation to get the rest of the cancer, or so I hope. You are fortunate that this has not been an issue for you. ... find someone that will help you with depression. It can be tough on some of us. Important indeed. I understand that the loss of sexual function can undermine a man's sense of identity and purpose. Genuine depression can result from the uncertainty of how many years you have left. Many doctors don't get that. They see cancer every day, but for you and me it is a \"big deal\". When it happens to YOU, it's very personal.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by Tim5965 ... my surgeon says I have a high probability of recurrence. Diagnosed 18 months ago with Gleason 9, 11/12 biopsy cores >50%, PSA 23. Some seminal vessical invasion and extraprostatic extension. Had six months of Lupron and Zytiga, PSA immediately came down to .3 and then to .2, Radical Prostatectomy on March 1. 24 lymph nodes clear and negative margins. PSA of zero at 30 days and zero again at 5 months. My testosterone is only 12 after 5 months so I guess that could be keeping my PSA at zero but that it\u2019s likely to reappear as testosterone recovers. Does that sound right? Sounds like you are actually doing very well. I'm curious if your G9 is (4+5) or (5+4)... I'm assuming 4+5 as I've noticed that in cases with a grade 5 primary component (if known from biopsy) surgeons are less likely to operate and instead prefer move the patient on to an RO+MO. Our cases are not dissimilar... I was solid 4+4, extensive EPE and bilateral SVI, and like you, neg margins and neg nodes. My last PSA five months pre-op was 25. Post-op it was around .02-.03 and was put on Lupron. My first three PSA's after completing adjuvant radiation have been 0.0 Of course, none of us will know just which way this will go until all the treatments have worn off a couple of years from now. My doc says my PSA may go up to \"one\" (I'm hoping he means .01). OTOH I know an 82 year old who had RP+RT fifteen years ago and his PSA is zero. Originally Posted by G24 I understand that you are having ADT now. Since you are high risk, it is correct to combine the radiation with ADT. Here is a trial that shows how long high risk patients will live if they had two years of ADT after surgery. Most of them well over ten years. G24, thanks for the link. It was interesting that the MP arm of the study (Mitoxantrone** plus Prednisone) had a higher incidence of other cancers and only slightly better increase in PCa specific survival. Most interesting is: \"Conclusion MP did not improve OS and increased deaths from other malignancies. The DFS and 10-year OS in these patients treated with 2 years of ADT were encouraging compared with historical estimates...\"",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by 58andscared DRE always reveals normal prostate so far. My concern is that in spite of these frequent PSAs and DREs, I might end up with an aggressive form that gets out of the capsule between exams - which are not conclusive anyway AFAIK. Which is exactly what happened to me, as well as a very small number of others here. I don't know about the Canadian healthcare system, but apparently here in the US, the only thing that will get you treated right away is a DRE, which is often the last thing to show up. Afterwards, I learned from my most recent urologist that at the base of the prostate is nearly impossible to detect tumors by DRE or TRUS. So dividing the prostate into three parts, apex, mid and base, it is not hard to see why approximately one third of TRUS biopsies are falsely negative. I have said it here often that doctors today are more concerned about overtreating than they are about curing.",

After a dozen or so it's just another surgery. Yes, there are risks. And stuff can happen. And the more surgeries you have, the narrower your odds become. Usually everything goes just fine. The thing that scares me most is \"intraoperative recall\".",

MichiganMan and I are G8's with T3B and SVI, which is just one step behind you. I for one consider myself fortunate to have caught it when I did. I do remember reading bio's of some guys here who had G9 and metastatic PCa even though their PSA's were not that high. I have not seen them on the forum in recent months though (I do remember their screen names so could track them down.. hoping they may jump in). I would imagine they are quite busy with their treatments or are out living their lives... I won't go any further into it than that. Whatever comes I wish you the best of luck in dealing with this terrible disease.",

      "Content": "My Urologist had me taking saw palmetto for years, in fact it must have been a couple of decades. I will say that I seemed to do better with it than without it. I bought the whole herb supplement at first, but later bought only the extract form. Look at the label to see the concentration, as it varies widely. I would normally take it once in the morning with something like buttered toast to transport the fat plus buffer the digestive acids. It can be very hard on your stomach or could be ineffective if not taken with food. The SP was a curse as well as a blessing. It seemed to help with my urinary problems, and as my Urologist had recommended it, I trusted that it was safe and effective. Over the years, other than asking me if I was still taking it, he did little else other than prescribing the occasional antibiotic... even when it turned out that I actually had cancer. I'm not sure who I blame more for the outcome, him or my own belief in him. If you find yourself in a similar situation, I would say it wouldn't hurt to use it if it helps, but if your problems persist then you should look beyond OTC supplements.",

      "Content": "All I can say is thank goodness for GP's because my Uro did do anything. I've told the story here before, but will repeat it again. My GP was concerned about my rising PSA, so I went to the Urologist I had been seeing for more than a decade. He said he was not concerned. I requested a DRE which he said was normal. A year later I experienced persistent urethral burning. He tested my PSA and it was 9.5 so he did a biopsy, which was negative. He put me on Cipro which alleviated the burning, and so for the next two years I kept going on longer and longer courses of Cipro, until we moved and I had to find a new doctor. My new GP found two bumps on the right side of my prostate and asked if I'd had an MRI. My PSA was 25. I returned to my Uro and told him about the bumps. He dismissed that and called them \"concretions.\" When I asked him about the MRI he said he does not do MRI's. Then he said he was retiring and his partner would take over my case. Suddenly I was flooded with calls to setup appointments for all kinds of tests. Two months later my prostate was removed. Had I known then what I know now, I would have sought out another urologist years earlier.",

I can read but have to repeatedly start over and over to finish a sentence, especially if someone has used internet jargon \"u r\", or when they use the wrong their there or the wrong wear where. Another - I am always impressed with the depth of your knowledge and your mastery of language. I am jealous. In light of what I've said in the previous paragraph, perhaps you understand why. Also perhaps you can appreciate the amount of effort that I must conjure up to respond to posts here on cancer forums. People ask what I do in my retirement... this is what I do. It takes a lot of my time. In the months and years ahead when one or the both of us have moved on I will miss reading your insights... as well as that of many other forum brother here. Tybee - is your PSA rising? Are you doing anything about it? Sorry if I missed something, but your numbers and your timeline look awful (no offense please).",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by Tom182 I went over the results with my urologist and he recommended salvage radiation in the near future. He thought I should wait ... to give my body more time to heal since it's only been a little over a year from my surgery. I'm guessing the radiation oncologist would want to start immediately. Tom, sorry you got the not-so-good news. Presumably the rising PSA is attributable to your positive margin, as I don't see any other extraprostatic extension mentioned in your sig. But I see that you are using only 1 pad per day. I can't imagine just what kind of \"healing\" your uro expects to occur by waiting longer. If your PSA is in fact doubling, you probably want to get SRT underway asap. I was originally scheduled to begin SRT this month, but the RO hopes that my incontinence might improve by waiting a few months... currently 8-10 pads/day. You have that one licked. What would you be waiting for? Originally Posted by Another Newer information just posted recently on these threads may indicate sooner rather than later. Even as soon as .03. Not sure this is mainstream yet, but something to ask the oncologist. I don't recall reading that, but I do believe it could be true. Currently mine is hovering just below .03, and RO wants to proceed as soon as possible. Current plan is to have the AMS800 implant and begin SRT as soon as that heals up. (I've posted a few times here seeking opinions on that but have had zero replies). If I were down to one pad per day, SRT would begin tomorrow.",

      "Content": "I've been getting colonoscopies every three years and was due for one just before starting radiation, but my RO said that if I had it done that I would have to postpone the start of radiation (again!) so I dlayed the colo until six months after the end of RT. This was a joint decision between my RO and my gastro, as I had also developed radiation colitis during the ART. I think the only requirement of the colo with regard to RT is that there be six months of healing between one and the another. It's probably a good idea to have your colon checked for damage. Two years on Lupron for me. I was not put on Casodex as my PSA was still fairly low following RP. But the Lupron keeps hanging on, and I'm getting really fed up after two years of hot flashes and brain fog.",

      "Content": "Nick - If you truly have seminal vesicle involvement then you are already in the high risk group, where you join MM and me. MM knows what he's talking about. And Jim's remark about the professor's mental state should also be considered. My PCa appeared three and a half years ago, yet my Urologist took his time dealing with it. Later it turned out he had health problems of his own and mine was not addressed seriously until he retired. By then it had already begun to spread... as has yours. Our cases are different, but given your mention of SVI then you are also (for lack of a signature) stage pT3B. Next stage is bone metastasis, which becomes MUCH more difficult to treat. None of us are medical professionals, but it's obvious to all of us (I think) that you should at least be on HT now... and that only buys time. You do NOT want to allow this to progress any further! The window typically closes after 18-24 months. Good luck!",

At least his appears to be relatively low grade and without extraprostatic tissue invasion. And he had you in his corner. And possibly the urologist. True, many would see a negative biopsy as good news. But to me it was disturbing because I had so many symptoms and my urologist wasn't doing anything to help me. I'm sorry everyone. I've been really down all day and it shows in my posts.",

For men with advanced, nonmetastatic prostate cancer, conservative treatment alone was associated with a 4 times higher likelihood of prostate cancer mortality compared with men treated with surgery... the results of the current study did affirm advantages in the setting of locally advanced disease.

      "Content": "Originally Posted by Tom182 I went over the results with my urologist and he recommended salvage radiation in the near future. He thought I should wait ... to give my body more time to heal since it's only been a little over a year from my surgery. I'm guessing the radiation oncologist would want to start immediately. Tom, sorry you got the not-so-good news. Presumably the rising PSA is attributable to your positive margin, as I don't see any other extraprostatic extension mentioned in your sig. But I see that you are using only 1 pad per day. I can't imagine just what kind of \"healing\" your uro expects to occur by waiting longer. If your PSA is in fact doubling, you probably want to get SRT underway asap. I was originally scheduled to begin SRT this month, but the RO hopes that my incontinence might improve by waiting a few months... currently 8-10 pads/day. You have that one licked. What would you be waiting for? Originally Posted by Another Newer information just posted recently on these threads may indicate sooner rather than later. Even as soon as .03. Not sure this is mainstream yet, but something to ask the oncologist. I don't recall reading that, but I do believe it could be true. Currently mine is hovering just below .03, and RO wants to proceed as soon as possible. Current plan is to have the AMS800 implant and begin SRT as soon as that heals up. (I've posted a few times here seeking opinions on that but have had zero replies). If I were down to one pad per day, SRT would begin tomorrow.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by DjinTonic I really don't see how the risk of overtreatment we read about is an argument against PSA screening... If by overtreatment they are talking about biopsies, better screening tests should be here very soon--until then, docs should explain to the patient their PSA level and trend, what that means, and the pros and cons of doing a biopsy. Amen. IMO there is not enough education of prostate patients by their urologists. My original Uro never said more than a dozen words to me, and at that only when I asked questions. I have informed both of my sons, now in their thirties, that their father had high risk, advanced prostate cancer, that his (my) grandfather died from it, and that they should insist on PSA tests when they are in their forties. Furthermore, I will once again get on my soap box and extol the importance of getting an MRI when there is ANY suspicion of potential prostate problems. ANY, whether from PSA or symptoms or otherwise. It is a relative simple, inexpensive and painless procedure that can identify trouble spots without poking needles thru the bowel and into this critical piece of anatomy that is intricately tied into many body systems and that is well known to eventually develop problems with age. Why an insurance company would risk paying out hundreds of thousands of dollars for adjuvant and salvage therapies for late stage prostate cancer rather than invest a few hundred dollars into reliable early detection of prostate tumors is just beyond me. Penny wise and pound foolish I tell you. In effect, decades of successful prostate cancer screening and treatment have been wiped out in five years since the 2012 USPTF decision. A remarkable change in events that has no parallel in public health history. It was buffoonery of the highest order in 2012; today marks a terse shift back to normalcy. Public health students will be studying this debacle for decades. American men will be dying from it for years. The significance of this final paragraph cannot be overstated. What a pity that so many of us got snared by this political snafu... a typically disastrous side effect of governmental overreach. Read each sentence carefully. Meditate to it in second level. And memorize its implications. Consider yourself fortunate if you were diagnosed early, and pity those of us who screamed from the rooftops for years before anyone would listen. */Rant off/*",

      "Content": "That is possible, but unlikely. I'm no expert, but what I've read is that the Lupron is effective for several weeks after the timed release has expired. I assume it was a six month shot. I too am due for my next 6-mo Lupron shot next week but the nurse said she had to make it one week later (now two weeks from today) so that the insurance would not be nit picky over the date. It is probably more likely that his cancer is becoming castrate resistant. His MO has several other avenues to pursue as this is not uncommon. In many cases Lupron does become ineffective after 2 or 3 years. I'm sure others with more experience will contribute more info here. Good luck!",

After three negative \"blind\" TRUS biopsy you are probably concerned that there is a tumor in there that they just haven't found yet. The fusion biopsy requires special training, and if your Uro is not experienced doing this then find someone else who is. In my case, a false negative biopsy led to an eventual locally advanced very high risk prostate cancer diagnosis following a fusion biopsy.

Hopefully you have addressed this with him and you know his feelings on this. I feel so sorry for you, having watched my own father and mother wither away. My Dad, himself a physician, chose to let himself deteriorate eventually die at home, where he was comfortable. My mother went thru several care facilities, but watched all of her friends go before her and felt terribly alone. You must ask yourself, and your father, how much longer you expect him to live, and what will his final years be like? Good luck with your decision. This is never easy.",

      "Content": "You were right to take time to enjoy the summer and ponder your choices. True, your predominantly G6 tumor(s) will grow slowly and likely present no problem. But the grade 4 core, though only 20%, can be quite aggressive. Furthermore, that core was located at the apex, where a positive surgical margin is more likely to occur in the event of extraprostatic extension. I'd say you can't afford to wait much longer. Also IMO, based on your age and assuming good health, you are an ideal candidate for robotic prostatectomy, and are most likely to enjoy a rapid and full recovery. Regarding radiation, often that is chosen for older men or those who are poor surgical candidates, and those whose cancer is much more advanced. Older in that the after effects of radiation may not show up for twenty years, and I believe that you would not want to find out in your seventies that perhaps you should have chosen surgery twenty years earlier. Just my opinions. Good luck!",

Put into a list: 3+3=1 3+4=2 4+3=3 4+4=4 4+5 or 5+4 = group 5, essentially terminal You do not want to be halfway up the totem pole. That's how narrow the dividing line really is.

      "Content": "One thing that gets repeated often here in the forum is that PSA is not a test for cancer, but for prostate inflammation. As Southsider pointed out, you've had a lot of procedures that can irritate the prostate and cause inflammation. DRE is another. The lump may be suspicious and justify investigation, but in the event the biopsy turns up negative it is no guarantee that there is NOT cancer in your prostate. False negatives are common. As I mentioned in your earlier thread, most insurance requires a negative ultrasound biopsy before they will authorize an MRI guided biopsy, so most likely it is still a good idea to get the first one out of the way. It won't necessarily resolve your urinary problem. As Southsider also mentioned, your PSA isn't all that high for a man your age. But you will at least have a baseline for moving forward with future investigation.",

My Gleason increased from a 3+3 to a 3+4 with 27% of the prostate involved (22% right lobe and 32% left lobe). Unfortunately the cancer had also escaped the prostate with perineural and right seminal vesicle invasion. All not news I wanted to hear. The best news is negative margins on all biopsied tissues so maybe everything was gotten... My urologist mentioned he would likely want to do radiation regardless of the PSA level. I'm not jumping on that bandwagon until I see the numbers and can do some more radiation research. My father ultimately developed and died from bladder cancer and I believe that prostate cancer radiation he received years earlier was a part of the source of that problem. I'll proceed with caution as far as radiation is concerned. Post surgical recovery is going well... I went through a half dozen pads in my first afternoon/evening of freedom. Jeff, I think I've read that post-op pathology is upgraded in about a third of cases and downgraded in another third, which if true would mean that less than half are \"spot on\" with the pre-op biopsy results. Your case is similar to my own but is in many ways better. Same scenario with MM. All three of us (and a few other guys) are members of the \"horses have left the barn\" gang, and learning soon after surgery that adjuvant radiation is recommended \"regardless\" is very common. You can look up the NCCN stages and grades sometime, but you probably do not want to see that just now. Your prostate size was about the same as mine, which was 53g and the RO told me that is \"larger than normal but not terribly large\". So don't fret that. Also as your grade 4 component, the type that spreads, was secondary... but due to the large number of cores involved is probably the cause of the extracapsular extension despite your relatively low PSA's. In other words, you had a lot of cancer, but it wasn't all that bad. I'd gladly trade places with you. Don't worry about the continence. In all likelihood you will return to full continence in around 3-6 months. Only 5% of RP patients end up incontinent. And the radiation would not commence until you have regained sufficient continence. Typically it is recommended in six months. Your concerns about radiation are understandable, but the recommendations are based on a lot of historical data. It is far better to zap any remaining cells existing in your prostate bed before they move on to greener pastures... in other words, before your PSA begins to rise.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by DjinTonic I really don't see how the risk of overtreatment we read about is an argument against PSA screening... If by overtreatment they are talking about biopsies, better screening tests should be here very soon--until then, docs should explain to the patient their PSA level and trend, what that means, and the pros and cons of doing a biopsy. Amen. IMO there is not enough education of prostate patients by their urologists. My original Uro never said more than a dozen words to me, and at that only when I asked questions. I have informed both of my sons, now in their thirties, that their father had high risk, advanced prostate cancer, that his (my) grandfather died from it, and that they should insist on PSA tests when they are in their forties. Furthermore, I will once again get on my soap box and extol the importance of getting an MRI when there is ANY suspicion of potential prostate problems. ANY, whether from PSA or symptoms or otherwise. It is a relative simple, inexpensive and painless procedure that can identify trouble spots without poking needles thru the bowel and into this critical piece of anatomy that is intricately tied into many body systems and that is well known to eventually develop problems with age. Why an insurance company would risk paying out hundreds of thousands of dollars for adjuvant and salvage therapies for late stage prostate cancer rather than invest a few hundred dollars into reliable early detection of prostate tumors is just beyond me. Penny wise and pound foolish I tell you. In effect, decades of successful prostate cancer screening and treatment have been wiped out in five years since the 2012 USPTF decision. A remarkable change in events that has no parallel in public health history. It was buffoonery of the highest order in 2012; today marks a terse shift back to normalcy. Public health students will be studying this debacle for decades. American men will be dying from it for years. The significance of this final paragraph cannot be overstated. What a pity that so many of us got snared by this political snafu... a typically disastrous side effect of governmental overreach. Read each sentence carefully. Meditate to it in second level. And memorize its implications. Consider yourself fortunate if you were diagnosed early, and pity those of us who screamed from the rooftops for years before anyone would listen. */Rant off/*",

      "Content": "If by \"mesh\" you are referring to a sling procedure, then yes there are a number of men who experienced problems or the device was ineffective. Most continence returns within 9 months post-op but some experience additional healing between 12-24 months, but I'm guessing that if you have a problem now then you likely always will. After several months of PT with a Kegel coach, my Uro informed me that I was not a candidate for the sling, and referred me to a surgeon to implant an AUS. That process had its own complications, and now 18 months later I am still as incontinent as you are even with the AUS, but that is far better than the 8-12 pads I used to go thru in a day. And now I sleep commando with a dry washcloth tucked in my crotch for nighttime dripping, as just a few drops of wetness on my thigh is enough to wake me up. The AUS is a more drastic surgery than the sling, but I do know of several guys who had their sling removed and an AUS implanted because the sling just didn't work well enough, or even made matters worse.",

      "Content": "This is not yet the end for your father. Several men here went into surgery with Gleason scores of 7 or 8 and came out with a path report indicating a more aggressive cancer. It is apparent that you have done your homework as you have already mentioned bone mets and clinical trials. Castrate resistance typically develops after 2-3 years on the standard first line hormone therapies. Perhaps you could provide a little more information, such as your father's age and full post-op path report if available. Also in what part of the country is he located? Are you near a major cancer center? If your father is still in good general health other than the cancer and its ravages, he could still qualify for further treatments that could add months or years to his life. To be honest, this message board is not the best place to obtain detailed information on advanced metastatic cancer. There are a couple of other message boards which you can find using the same google search you probably used to find this one. Good luck to both you and your father.",

Gary, this is at Morton Plant hospital (that's the factory where they make salt, right?). It's the main hospital in the Baycare chain that owns most of the medical facilities in Pinellas county... Clearwater/St Pete. It's a nice building right on the intercoastal waterway. It would be nice if I \"luck out\" like I did with my RP back in Ohio. Someone must have recognized my wife's name and I was put in the executive suite... private room with a sofa, conference table and a panoramic view of our city of seven hills. But hopefully I will remember to inquire about paying the upcharge to get a private room... if I can think of it Monday morning. The surgeon said two days if he can do it laproscopically, and five days if he has to open me up (one in three possibility of that). Don't let the forum fall apart while I'm gone MF Hopefully I'll be online over the weekend, and if I remember to take my tablet, feel up to posting from the hospital.",

      "Content": "Thanks, Rich, for the excellent list. Kozmic - yes, AZ is Amazon (I was trying to avoid advertising... but then they don't really need it, do they?) I saw Depends shields for $15 at CVS. The same package was $12 at Target and $10 from Amazon. Moral of the story: shop around. BTW one of my nurses said her husband prefers Tena as they are not as \"noisy\" as Depends. I also tried Depends Flex Fit briefs, but they have so much elastic that disposal becomes a problem. They fill the trash can too fast. For pad/shield/diaper disposal I use quart size zipper plastic bags. $6 for a box of 100, and I can fit two pads in each baggie. Keeps the bath/bedroom from smelling like urine. Personally I do not like shields, at least not at this point in my recovery. I haven't found one with enough of a \"pouch\" in front. Most of them are flat or nearly flat and tend to squish my poor penis too much. And for the first few days after cath removal, rubbing against the pads was too irritating. I've found that I like \"belted shields\". These are unisex pads that button in front and back. They come with a pair of elastic straps with a button on each end. They ride low on the hips and do not irritate my incision sites as they do not have a waist band. Initially I bought them at CVS because my wife had a 30% off extra care coupon, but I found the same shields available on AZ under the name Prevail.",

      "Content": "It's time to address the elephant in the room. What elephant? Post-op incontinence following prostatectomy. Some of us who are in our first month post-op have been posting remarks about leakage, Kegels, and other such matters in JJackson's \"Post-op Day 10\" thread... read it here: (http://www.cancerforums.net/threads/...Post-op-Day-10 Jamie, Rich and I (\"the three caballeros\") are all in our first month post-op and struggling with these issues. There has already been a lot of info put forward in that thread, but he/we discussed starting a properly titled thread on the topic. So here it is. I just wanted to get this up and running so we can add our thoughts and experiences here rather than there (as Day 10 has long passed!) Personally I have been experimenting with various pads, shields, diapers (ok, I'm going to call them that) as well as some \"external plumbing\" devices. I hope to post my thoughts and opinions here on various products in the days ahead. AZ has been a terrific resource, offering testimonials as well as decent prices, better than you might find in a drug store or superstore. For any newbies (and yes, we are all newbies at this, if not now, we were only recently) what I've read and been told is that typically we should not expect to have much control for the first two months, with full control over urinary continence being attained between six and twelve months. As usual, your mileage may vary. Some report better control early on and others still having accidents more than a year out. So don't worry if you don't fit some standard. There is none. Good luck everyone! We've already taken the greatest step on this journey.",

      "Content": "One thing that gets repeated often here in the forum is that PSA is not a test for cancer, but for prostate inflammation. As Southsider pointed out, you've had a lot of procedures that can irritate the prostate and cause inflammation. DRE is another. The lump may be suspicious and justify investigation, but in the event the biopsy turns up negative it is no guarantee that there is NOT cancer in your prostate. False negatives are common. As I mentioned in your earlier thread, most insurance requires a negative ultrasound biopsy before they will authorize an MRI guided biopsy, so most likely it is still a good idea to get the first one out of the way. It won't necessarily resolve your urinary problem. As Southsider also mentioned, your PSA isn't all that high for a man your age. But you will at least have a baseline for moving forward with future investigation.",

      "Content": "Good luck, Jack. Certainly this was not an easy decision, but with a Gleason 9 you made the right choice to stop this thing in its track. Hopefully they will find everything else in there (margins, lymph nodes, seminary vesicles) are negative and the cancer has not spread. What you need to do now is prepare for your post-op recovery. When you wake up from surgery you will have an indwelling catheter and a drainage bag. In a way, it is a kind of convenience... you don't have to pee. I remember I kept thinking I had to get up to go to the bathroom, only to realize there's nothing I could do in there except maybe empty the bag. But you do need to tend to he cath and bag. Have a supply of rubbing alcohol, tissues, and some antibiotic ointment. And get a new large bucket... this was a tip I read here before my surgery and it was quite handy to keep the drainage bag in the bucket by your bed overnight. During the day you can just carry around the bucket, so you always have a place to hold your bag when doing stuff around the house. Also buy a pack of waterproof pads for your bed and your easy chair (you have one of those, right?) There may be some leakage around the cath... not a lot, but it can stain clean sheets. The greatest difficulty post-op is getting in and out of bed. Many guys spend the first few nights sleeping in a recliner. Your stomach will have about a half dozen small cuts that don't really hurt that much, but the muscles underneath are also cut and it makes it painful to bend or twist your abdomen. You will be sleeping flat on your back for a few days, wishing there was a trapeze over your bed... but your flexibility will return gradually. I remember I could lay on my left side after a few days and it took a couple weeks before I could turn onto my right side. In another thread here someone told me the cut on the far right is where they pulled out the prostate. Post-op you will need to eat stuff that is easy to digest. It will be difficult to bear down to poop, so you don't want to make that any more difficult than it already is! Also you will have weight lifting restrictions for about a month post-op. For me it was ten pounds... some guys say theirs was 15 or maybe twenty. So that means you will not be allowed to lift more than XX pounds for 4 weeks. Ten pounds is about the size of a small suitcase or a bag of groceries if there are liquids, meat or canned goods. So plan ahead and try to anticipate getting at things you will need around the house when you are unable to bend or lift. The cath will come out after about ten days. You will need a supply of incontinence pads. Wear one on your cath removal day and take a spare with you. There is a thread we started here on incontinence questions. The cath removal is totally painless (for me it tickled a little). The incontinence goes on for several months, but gradually improves. It is a tremendous annoyance and inconvenience but everyone goes through it. Good luck next month. Know that most guys pull through this with zero issues. And this is something you had to do. You probably just added twenty years to your life.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by MRJ RAD-- Just for clarity, let's separate two terms: orgasm and erection, as either can be accomplished independent of the other. You asked about orgasms. You should be able to achieve orgasms now. It's more difficult without an erection but it should be manageable manually or with a little help from electronics. Exactly. I waited four weeks post-op before attempting to masturbate. I figured if they say to wait that long before lifting anything, then it should be safe. And by then I was so horny and in need of some relief. I was able to accomplish it without using any electronics... well, other than porn (who gets their porn on paper these days?) Of course after RALP there is no ejaculate, but there is definitely an orgasm. I refer to it as a pelvic orgasm, and was able to enjoy them for several months post-op. Then came the Lupron. I wasn't given Casodex beforehand, so I experienced the full blown \"Lupron flare\" for about ten days after the shot. I think I spent more time \"in the bathroom\" than since I was a teenager for those first few days. Since the Lupron kicked in, however, about three months ago, just once, and that wasn't very satisfying. More like it was something I felt I had to do, something to take care of. Oddly enough, last night I woke up with an erection. It seemed so real. But now that I am actually awake I realize that it must have been a dream. It was fun while it lasted. I remember how surprised I felt... and proud. But then I really woke up. Texas cath, leg bag and two feet of tubing. That's my ball and chain that I take to bed with me most nights. The past week has largely been sleepless due to changing meds... it must have been the first night I slept long enough to actually have a dream.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by Tybeeman It has been 10 months since my robotic radical prostatectomy. I have had my consistency back since the 3rd month, with just a little leakage, mainly when I drink. Now no problem at all. Have not had an erection yet but I am taking Cialis daily and triple dose twice a week. Last night I woke up with a nocturnal erection. Was wondering if anyone else has experience this and could this be a sign that I will be getting my erections back. It is a long process and I am sure most of you know I am very anxious. Five months ago today for me, and have not had an erection of any kind since before the surgery. At my age I don't worry about it. I am able to work myself to a pelvic orgasm with much effort, but since the Lupron kicked in don't have much urge to do so. My greatest concern is that my RO said he has never seen any improvement in urinary continence after ten months, and I am halfway there now. I am dry all night, but have to get up once or twice to pee, and also do well when siting down. But when standing or walking I leak like a garden hose, going thru 8-12 pads a day pretty consistently. I've weighed them at around a half pound each. I am not even aware that I am leaking, just that the pads get heavy and very wet. My penis sometimes develop a rash from the moisture. My uro has had me in therapy for a couple months now. The therapist wants me to hold the Kegels for fifteen seconds and it just wears me out. Very hard to maintain. I guess the \"good\" news is I still have another five months before the RO has to proceed with SRT and hopefully I won't be leaking so much by then because it will stop any further improvement in continence.",

      "Content": "This morning I looked up the results of my blood draw from last Wednesday. PSA=0.00 and testosterone=18.7. This was my first PSA since completing adjuvant radiation in October. The testosterone had gone down from 30 before RT, but I was expecting there to be a little bounce in my PSA, as it was being artificially held down to .03 for the past year while on Lupron. Why am I not elated to see 0.00 for the first time in my life? The skeptic in me is suspicious that there must be something wrong. After all, I believed my first biopsy four years ago when it came back negative. At the end of treatment my RO told me that the radiation would continue to kill cancer cells for another six months or so. And as I understand it, dying cancer cells spew out PSA. And the Lupron only suppresses testosterone production. So why was there no bounce? Could the radiation have actually killed all the stray cells so quickly? While I should be popping open the champagne, instead I'm wondering how could this be? And does this mean that I could skip next week's Lupron shot? Hopefully I will know more after I discuss the results with my Uro on Wednesday. But while I would be overjoyed if I could just blindly accept these results, instead I only find myself with more questions. Still, I'd like to submit my application to Club Zero for my first time ever... and here's hoping I can stay there!",

I don't remember seeing any or at least \"that many\" guys have PSA trend upwards following RP only to go back down, though I suppose it could be possible. Unfortunately there are no black and white answers. We've all been thru it to some extent. At least you are only considering legitimate treatment choices, as you already eat well and really know your stuff. I would think that Medicare should cover this fully, assuming that you have standard Medicare part B and a decent supplement. Your RO should have your back on that one. RT was no picnic... not difficult, but I got sick early on and now six months later still have radiation colitis, not unlike Dan. But would I change anything? Unlikely. You don't get any do-overs in this game. So take a while and decide exactly how you're going to approach this, but I agree that doing nothing is not a viable option. Good luck!",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by SubDenis I have cancer in my body and my job is to keep it out of my spirit! The shock of cancer can only be understood by those who have it ... The first impact of cancer was a profound loneliness and a gut level of fear that I have never experienced ... Cancer is a lonely disease. Support groups, forums and the like take the edge off and there are just times that the Dis-Ease sets in in your heart and drags you down. The other force which makes it so difficult is the slowness of treatment decisions and how the medical system moves. Denis, even though it has only been a few months since you first posted, I can see that you obviously 'get it'. What you wrote is all very well said and exhibits great insight to what all of us are going thru. Soon after my wife was discharged from the hospital, we were talking about our cancers and she said \"it's the loneliest place you'll ever know\". You mentioned that several times, so you obviously understand. Just last night, I was troubled by memories of her calling me in the middle of the night saying \"I am so scared!\" ... I often worry that I was not supportive enough for her during that time. There was a LOT going on then. It was a very uncomfortable time. This being October marks five years since that visit to a Urologist that started everything for me. What followed was three and a half years of being mishandled by the medical system, confounded by my own ignorance of the situation and perhaps reluctance to even consider the possibility of cancer. (Despite numerous prior surgeries, this was my very first cancer). Unfortunately I apparently let it get to me. I recognize that it has affected my spirit and my attitude about just about everything. Once you have cancer, everything else becomes much less important. When you and your life mate both have cancer, everything changes. You have the benefit of an early diagnosis and it sounds like you have a good medical team working for you. Hopefully you will be able to enjoy 'smooth sailing' throughout your journey. And keep your head above water.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by derbyrobert My brother recently had a prostatecomy and has never been the same since. I am a Clinical Psychologist and have noticed the significant changes... but these in no way account for this personalty change. The changes that result from prostate cancer and more importantly cancer treatment certainly changes ones outlook on life. However, I had an experience that began long before my diagnosis and treatment. I started having some troubling prostate symptoms nearly four years ago, and had a biopsy a few months later which was negative, but turned out later to be a false negative... in other words, the biopsy completely missed the tumor. That was the beginning of a very rough year, and for the next two years I was prone to episodes of crying and my wife frequently told me that I was depressed. I have never had any psych or emotional problems, but spoke with my doctor and he pretty much dismissed the symptoms that I presented to him. Two years later another biopsy identified the tumor and I had a prostatectomy, was started on Lupron and the antidepressant Effexor, had a urinary implant and underwent two months of radiation. My life has definitely changed as a result of the treatments, but mentally I feel far better off than I did two or three years ago. I believe now that during those two years between the negative biopsy and the positive one and subsequent treatments that I actually did have a tumor growing in me and that it affected my personality and my mental and emotional state, perhaps chemically. I have never heard anyone else mention this, but what I experienced was real. Perhaps your brother is obsessed with his new project as an item on his bucket list. But maybe the cancer growing in his prostate actually affected his personality by means of a physical process.",

      "Content": "Mike - Sorry to hear the news, but I just gotta say... you're breaking the news in someone else's thread (unless you are Kim's husband, then I'm sorry, I misunderstood). If so the moderator should move your post to its own thread. So about the cancer, your G8 is higher than most of the guys here. Typically G7's are when guys come here asking about options. For G8 things are a bit further along than you'd like. There is a possibility that it has already spread outside the prostate. Just a possibility. There are a few of us here with that. Generally the option most often chosen is surgery, with the primary reason being that if the surgery does not get all the cancer out, then you can have radiation afterwards (referred to as salvage radiation) to clean up the abdominal bed. If radiation is performed first, the tissues become deformed and follow up surgery if needed is far less likely to be successful. If you're thinking traditional chemotherapy, that is unlikely for PCa at your stage. Typically that is reserved for G9 or G10, where the cancer has already left the prostate bed and spread throughout the body. There are probably more guys here at that stage than at yours and mine... that is, assuming your scans don't reveal something worse then your G8 rating and moderate PSA level would indicate. Good luck, Mike. Keep us informed.",

      "Content": "The 4+4 core is also aggressive, but the 5+4 is very serious as the primary grade is 5, which is the highest. Naturally the kidney is the highest priority. At your age that may be a difficult recovery. Whether or not you could possibly face another surgery for your prostate is questionable. It could be treated with radiation depending on a few other stats, such as the size of your prostate. One treatment that does not involve intervention per se would be to start HT... androgen deprivation therapy as soon as you have recovered from your surgery, and remain on it for the rest of your life. Basically this would be a shot twice a year. There are side effects, but this form of therapy is common for those with advanced prostate cancer. The shots would prevent your cancer from progressing any further. At some point your cancer may become resistant to the HT, but there are new treatments being developed all the time. Good luck to you!",

I fully intend to bring this up with my RO next meeting, as I will be jumping thru all kinds of hoops to fulfill the full bladder requirement for IMRT... all this knowing that what residual cancer remaining in my SV bed may be so minute that broad radiation may well miss it, thereby potentially causing more harm than good. Checking the Axumin website it appears that some portions of the cost may be approved for medicare. After shelling out upwards of $10K for my wife's chemo deductible, I believe it may be well worth the additional cost of this approach if it can possibly target the radiation more accurately, and thereby offer a greater chance of success and hopefully eliminate any possibility of recurrence.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by JJackson I had a Robotic Assisted Radical Prostatectomy on 9/26. My surgery was pretty uneventful. I was released to home the following day. Of course with a Foley cath, 5 puncture wounds (subcuticular stitches covered with Dermabond) and no JP or any other drain. I share the majority of experiences I\u0092ve read here\u0085no issues with the catherter really, very sore lower abdomen and pain in the shoulders. But the discomfort lessened each and by Post Op Day 4 all was fine. I had my catherter removed Sept 2nd. My anxiety over the removal was much worse than the act itself\u0085minimal discomfort that was over, done and gone in a few seconds. My cath was removed in my Surgeon\u0092s office. He was able to spare both nerves and said the lymph nodes were clear. Originally Posted by Rich2.0 Hi Jamie, It looks like we both had our surgery on the same day! I am a bit behind schedule on the catheter removal. I'm scheduled to have mine removed first thing tomorrow morning. I know I'm going to leak like a sieve the first day but getting rid of this ball and chain will be quite liberating. I don't have any pearls of wisdom to share at this point -just some words of encouragement. Hang in there and please post back often. I will be following this thread closely. Hello guys - I'm just a week behind you two, so I will be referring back to this thread often to check on your progress. Unfortunately I did not have much time to practice Kegels pre-op, but have also read that it has limited value until afterwards. My surgery was pretty much uneventful, much like JJackson's. My cath comes out in two days. Others I have spoken with mention six months as most common time to regain full control over continence. Good luck everyone!",

      "Content": "Hey Sudds, sorry about your streak of bad luck, but you are not alone. I think one out of four RP's return a final Gleason higher than the biopsy, so it happens. Several other FB's here have had that happen. Fortunately yours was organ confined other than the possible surgical margin, which is not uncommon for a tumor at the apex. You're probably looking at a year or two on HT and two months of RT. I'm now in my seventh week with just nine treatments left (total 7000 rads). My tumor was also 25% volume, about the same as yours. So you're in good company here. We're all fighting for you and we're all behind you. Good luck going forward. Just keep your chin up and move ahead. Eventually this will all end and you will come out on top.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by Southsider Thanks, men. I completed the test, it wasn't a problem although sort of disorientated. Got a little faint when the gal put in the IV for the contrast, but it wasn't uncomfortable getting the test done. Although at UPMC Presbyterian, its quite a maze figuring out where to go and where my car was parked. The hospital is built on a steep slope- appropriately called \"Cardiac Hill\", and although they do have elevators, you're on a different floor every time you move from building to building. My wife worked in a hospital like that, built on a hillside. Eventually they \"standardized\" the floors so at least the floor numbers stayed the same. Still quite weird. You entered on the sixth floor. What's worse, there were at least a dozen different groups of elevators, none of which could get you to every floor. So the elevator you get on might not even stop on the eighth floor because it was the psych ward and restricted access, or the surgical floor floor for example. I think since most hospitals were pieced together over the years, like Tetris, they all seem to have different shaped buildings and floors stuck together based on what funding was available at the time for each expansion. And the parking garages never make any sense... at least four of them, half of which are for staff only. I had quite a few procedures done in that hospital, and each time I went back it seemed they had moved everything around. Reminded me of the \"House that Jack Built\" episode of the Avengers, if anyone remembers that show (who could forget Emma Peel and John Steed). Also had a few MRI's of various body parts over the years, mostly with contrast. They eventually become de rigeur, but admittedly I still feel a bit apprehensive being trapped in that machine for an hour or so.",

      "Content": "Welcome to the other side Rick, and I hope everything went well with your surgery and your recovery so far. First off, do not be apprehensive about the catheter removal, it is painless, and for me even tickled a little. It seems much more scary than it actually is. About your question, there are two different matters here: erections and orgasms. When erections might return depends a lot on how much nerve tissue was spared during the surgery. Sometimes there is extensive nerve invasion and a lot of it has to be removed by the surgeon to be sure that all the cancer was eliminated. Erectile function is probably the last or final normal function to return. Your greatest concern in the months ahead will be regaining full continence or bladder control after the Foley catheter has been removed. You will need to do Kegel exercises as was probably directed by your urologist, or you can find instructions in one of the stickies at the top of this forum. The other matter is orgasms, which will return surprisingly soon. If you masturbate or are stimulated by your partner you will probably experience a \"pelvic\" orgasm, but there will be no ejaculation. There is no ejaculate because all the glands that produced semen were removed. There will likely be some urine shoot out though. Many guys experience this for some time. Just be prepared. The most important matter though is that you survived the surgery, hopefully without complications, and second to that, that the surgery hopefully removed all of the cancer. This will not be known until you get your pathology report from your urologist. In the weeks ahead, the first sign of urinary continence will be the ability to not leak while sleeping, called \"dry nights\". Then comes full control while sitting. Standing up from sitting comes next, then holding it while walking. Eventually for most men the ability to hold their urine without thinking about it takes anywhere from three to nine months. Good luck Rick!",

      "Content": "This morning I looked up the results of my blood draw from last Wednesday. PSA=0.00 and testosterone=18.7. This was my first PSA since completing adjuvant radiation in October. The testosterone had gone down from 30 before RT, but I was expecting there to be a little bounce in my PSA, as it was being artificially held down to .03 for the past year while on Lupron. Why am I not elated to see 0.00 for the first time in my life? The skeptic in me is suspicious that there must be something wrong. After all, I believed my first biopsy four years ago when it came back negative. At the end of treatment my RO told me that the radiation would continue to kill cancer cells for another six months or so. And as I understand it, dying cancer cells spew out PSA. And the Lupron only suppresses testosterone production. So why was there no bounce? Could the radiation have actually killed all the stray cells so quickly? While I should be popping open the champagne, instead I'm wondering how could this be? And does this mean that I could skip next week's Lupron shot? Hopefully I will know more after I discuss the results with my Uro on Wednesday. But while I would be overjoyed if I could just blindly accept these results, instead I only find myself with more questions. Still, I'd like to submit my application to Club Zero for my first time ever... and here's hoping I can stay there!",

      "Content": "Ken, I know you've been fretting over this for a long time... at least as long as I have been here and you were concerned over having lost your \"<\"... I don't remember seeing any or at least \"that many\" guys have PSA trend upwards following RP only to go back down, though I suppose it could be possible. Unfortunately there are no black and white answers. We've all been thru it to some extent. At least you are only considering legitimate treatment choices, as you already eat well and really know your stuff. I would think that Medicare should cover this fully, assuming that you have standard Medicare part B and a decent supplement. Your RO should have your back on that one. RT was no picnic... not difficult, but I got sick early on and now six months later still have radiation colitis, not unlike Dan. But would I change anything? Unlikely. You don't get any do-overs in this game. So take a while and decide exactly how you're going to approach this, but I agree that doing nothing is not a viable option. Good luck!",

      "Content": "Thank you to those who have already contacted me personally. We are in northern Pinellas county and until just recently it looked like we were going to be directly in the storm's path. Recent landfall at Marco Island and it's current northern track will put the storm just east of Tampa when it passes us overnight tonight. The outermost rain bands passed us about five hours ago and spawned some tornadoes further inland. We have had light rain and gusty winds until right around 4PM. The winds are now picking up and our power has flickered a few times. Our biggest fear is losing power, possibly for several days. They now say on the news that this storm has already sucked most of the water right out of Tampa bay... bad news is the water will return later, with a surge. As much as I would like to see that personally, I'm happy to be indoors right now. Our place is sturdy and I feel safe and on the top floor. Big question was whether or not to move our cars away from trees. I'd hate to move one out into the open and get struck by some other projectile. We had to take in a relative whose home is right on the water. She is not sure what will be left afterwards. We have plenty of food, water and batteries, thank goodness. As far as we know, no one living in our immediate community has had to evacuate. My RO's office called and cancelled treatments for both Monday and Tuesday, which is good news, as I will have a few more days to recover from the SE's... which have been more difficult than expected. Bowel disruptions. Nineteen treatments completed, twenty more to go. Best of luck to the others here in Florida and those to the north who will be affected by this storm. I will try to update more later, assuming we keep our service.",

They report that ADT is beneficial for high risk patients. Thanks for another interesting link G24. Of particular note in this article is the following graph, fig 3, which can be found in section 3.2, Benefits of adjunctive hormone therapy to SRT may not be universal, which seems to indicate that the benefits of neoadjuvant ADT combined with SRT continue to be realized throughout years 5 thru 8 after RT, where the RT-only arm flattens out and the ADT+RT arm continues to decline.

Some of us who are in our first month post-op have been posting remarks about leakage, Kegels, and other such matters in JJackson's \"Post-op Day 10\" thread... read it here: (http://www.cancerforums.net/threads/...Post-op-Day-10 Jamie, Rich and I (\"the three caballeros\") are all in our first month post-op and struggling with these issues. There has already been a lot of info put forward in that thread, but he/we discussed starting a properly titled thread on the topic. So here it is. I just wanted to get this up and running so we can add our thoughts and experiences here rather than there (as Day 10 has long passed!) Personally I have been experimenting with various pads, shields, diapers (ok, I'm going to call them that) as well as some \"external plumbing\" devices. I hope to post my thoughts and opinions here on various products in the days ahead. AZ has been a terrific resource, offering testimonials as well as decent prices, better than you might find in a drug store or superstore. For any newbies (and yes, we are all newbies at this, if not now, we were only recently) what I've read and been told is that typically we should not expect to have much control for the first two months, with full control over urinary continence being attained between six and twelve months. As usual, your mileage may vary. Some report better control early on and others still having accidents more than a year out. So don't worry if you don't fit some standard. There is none. Good luck everyone! We've already taken the greatest step on this journey.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by Southsider Thanks, men. I completed the test, it wasn't a problem although sort of disorientated. Got a little faint when the gal put in the IV for the contrast, but it wasn't uncomfortable getting the test done. Although at UPMC Presbyterian, its quite a maze figuring out where to go and where my car was parked. The hospital is built on a steep slope- appropriately called \"Cardiac Hill\", and although they do have elevators, you're on a different floor every time you move from building to building. My wife worked in a hospital like that, built on a hillside. Eventually they \"standardized\" the floors so at least the floor numbers stayed the same. Still quite weird. You entered on the sixth floor. What's worse, there were at least a dozen different groups of elevators, none of which could get you to every floor. So the elevator you get on might not even stop on the eighth floor because it was the psych ward and restricted access, or the surgical floor floor for example. I think since most hospitals were pieced together over the years, like Tetris, they all seem to have different shaped buildings and floors stuck together based on what funding was available at the time for each expansion. And the parking garages never make any sense... at least four of them, half of which are for staff only. I had quite a few procedures done in that hospital, and each time I went back it seemed they had moved everything around. Reminded me of the \"House that Jack Built\" episode of the Avengers, if anyone remembers that show (who could forget Emma Peel and John Steed). Also had a few MRI's of various body parts over the years, mostly with contrast. They eventually become de rigeur, but admittedly I still feel a bit apprehensive being trapped in that machine for an hour or so.",

      "Content": "Indeed... the quoted text is almost an advertisement against choosing RT as the first option. Technically challenging, few qualified to do the procedure, immediately surrounding tissues, ten years survival \"or more\". The stats for RP followed by SRT are far more promising. That was my secondary reason for choosing surgery first. The primary reason was because we were already in the process of moving from our home a thousand miles away and I frankly did not have time to shop around, or to dedicate the next eight weeks to daily treatments. A close friend of mine had cyberknife (I think he said) ten years ago, but said he was lucky that it was caught early and was well contained. He said he wanted to avoid the possibility of ED after surgery. Seems like backward thinking to me, but he's him and I'm me. My tumor was already known to be high grade and possibly advanced, and now requires SRT. I have no regrets whatsoever choosing surgery first. BTW good luck in your treatment, whichever path you choose. I hope all goes well for you and I wish you a full recovery.",

      "Content": "Thanks, Rich, for the excellent list. Kozmic - yes, AZ is Amazon (I was trying to avoid advertising... but then they don't really need it, do they?) I saw Depends shields for $15 at CVS. The same package was $12 at Target and $10 from Amazon. Moral of the story: shop around. BTW one of my nurses said her husband prefers Tena as they are not as \"noisy\" as Depends. I also tried Depends Flex Fit briefs, but they have so much elastic that disposal becomes a problem. They fill the trash can too fast. For pad/shield/diaper disposal I use quart size zipper plastic bags. $6 for a box of 100, and I can fit two pads in each baggie. Keeps the bath/bedroom from smelling like urine. Personally I do not like shields, at least not at this point in my recovery. I haven't found one with enough of a \"pouch\" in front. Most of them are flat or nearly flat and tend to squish my poor penis too much. And for the first few days after cath removal, rubbing against the pads was too irritating. I've found that I like \"belted shields\". These are unisex pads that button in front and back. They come with a pair of elastic straps with a button on each end. They ride low on the hips and do not irritate my incision sites as they do not have a waist band. Initially I bought them at CVS because my wife had a 30% off extra care coupon, but I found the same shields available on AZ under the name Prevail.",

      "Content": "It's time to address the elephant in the room. What elephant? Post-op incontinence following prostatectomy. Some of us who are in our first month post-op have been posting remarks about leakage, Kegels, and other such matters in JJackson's \"Post-op Day 10\" thread... read it here: (http://www.cancerforums.net/threads/...Post-op-Day-10 Jamie, Rich and I (\"the three caballeros\") are all in our first month post-op and struggling with these issues. There has already been a lot of info put forward in that thread, but he/we discussed starting a properly titled thread on the topic. So here it is. I just wanted to get this up and running so we can add our thoughts and experiences here rather than there (as Day 10 has long passed!) Personally I have been experimenting with various pads, shields, diapers (ok, I'm going to call them that) as well as some \"external plumbing\" devices. I hope to post my thoughts and opinions here on various products in the days ahead. AZ has been a terrific resource, offering testimonials as well as decent prices, better than you might find in a drug store or superstore. For any newbies (and yes, we are all newbies at this, if not now, we were only recently) what I've read and been told is that typically we should not expect to have much control for the first two months, with full control over urinary continence being attained between six and twelve months. As usual, your mileage may vary. Some report better control early on and others still having accidents more than a year out. So don't worry if you don't fit some standard. There is none. Good luck everyone! We've already taken the greatest step on this journey.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by oshguy I had my annual checkup at the Cleveland Clinic on Thursday and discussed my continuing incontinence with my surgeon. I explained to him that I'm mostly dry, but after standing for 15-20 minutes or more, leaning forward for more than 30 seconds or so, lifting heavy items, etc., I start to leak slightly. I can feel it coming on, and nothing I do seems to be able to stop it. I've Kegeled more, less, none at all, and no frequency seems to help. The total volume of urine that I leak in a 24 hour period is usually actually quite small, anywhere from 5-6 ml to a maximum of 20 ml. While that doesn't seem like a lot, it can be bothersome. My surgeon suggests that I have a mesh sling implanted, as it is likely that my incontinence will not improve at this point. He all but guaranteed that I would be very happy with the result. That sounds good, but the thought of recovering from a gash right behind my scrotum is not very appealing. Has anyone here had this done? If so, how painful was the recovery period? Side effects? Was it successful? As my surgeon pointed out, there is no rush to do this, so I can take all the time I want to reach a decision whether to undergo the procedure or not. On the plus side, he considers the surgery a success and thinks that the cancer is permanently gone. And my erections are as good as pre-surgery, which is a testament to his nerve-sparing skill. Osh - it sounds like you have classic stress incontinence. You have reached the point where the majority of the 5% left with some incontinence ultimately reach, that is, you leak a little now and then, especially upon exertion. Most guys get by with absorbency products... pads, shields, liners. There's an amazing number of guys in your situation. It is never discussed, but the male adult product market is some billions of dollars annually (can't remember if it was four or forty... it's in my notes somewhere.) Another guy came into this forum a few months inquiring about the sling. To be honest, I have found that this is not the forum to obtain first hand recommendations on obscure topics. If you do more searching you will find other forums frequented by guys with lets say more esoteric issues resulting from PCa. The cancer survivors network is one very good resource. This forum (cancer forums dot net) is a warm, friendly place where guys can feel comfortable discussing their problems, but a lot of what goes on here is congratulating each other on low PSA's. I don't mean to diss anyone, but questions about slings and AUS's largely go unanswered here. Anyway, something you need to keep in mind is that when a surgeon - and most urologists are surgeons - recommends an implant, he is in fact trying to sell you something. It may actually be for your better interest, but many many more guys opt for pads rather than surgery. We all have other, better things to do with our time and money. Personally I have no experience with the sling, only that my Uro said that I am definitely NOT a candidate for that device. As far as the surgery goes, I've had two scrotal surgeries related to the removal of my right testicle, and will be facing yet another one to implant the AUS in a couple weeks. I know what to expect. Some pain - mainly stinging rather than throbbing, lots of discoloration and maybe some swelling. Plan on spending a week or two with a bag of frozen peas on your groin. Not the worst experience. The decision is entirely yours, as to whether some discomfort - and the very real possibility that it does not completely resolve your problem - is worth the time and \"suffering\". And congratulations on the successes you've experienced since your RP. Good luck with whatever you choose.",

      "Content": "Dave, in my opinion you should consider yourself well on the way to BCR and looking into SRT. I remember seeing the same report mentioned by Prato that urologists tend to recommend SRT much later than RO's do. The same website also has a report that starting SRT before 21 months post-op has far better outcomes than waiting until the .2 threshold is crossed. This is what has led the the current thinking that three consecutive rises above .03 should trigger SRT (I'm generalizing here). With your positive surgical margin and small secondary grade 4 pathology I believe that should be considered sufficient adverse pathology to at least consider initiating SRT. Remember that grade 4 is the type that spreads, and essentially there is no grade 1 or 2 in this scoring method. The philosophy behind early SRT (eSRT) is to zap any remaining cancer cells that may have escaped (+SM) while they are still localized and before they leave the prostate bed and move on to other areas of the body... which is probably what Prato is facing right now. Even a small number of grade 4 cells could have easily been missed in pathology but are enough to set up residence. Please realize that I have no medical training and my opinions are often refuted because I don't cite specific studies and such, but I've seen enough and been thru enough that I recognize a duck when I see a duck. At this stage, one year post-op, you are playing a game of odds. Your condition may progress or it may not... there is no way to know now what the future will hold. I think you have made the right decision having your PSA re-evaluated and recognized that you are not in Kansas anymore. When it is your life that you are betting on, it becomes an entirely different game than the one your doctors are facing. Let's say it's like a bacon and eggs breakfast... a chicken was involved, but the pig was committed. Your urologist was involved, but you are committed. Any possibility of BCR means to your Uro that his surgery failed, and he may be reluctant to consider that as a possibility. But it is your future and your life that is on the line. You want to do all you can now, and not allow the beast to gain the upper hand. Good luck!",

      "Content": "Chuck, sorry to hear about your cousin's situation, but of course the good news is that it apparently was caught fairly early before the horses have left the barn. Unfortunate that it is 4+3 and PSA in the teens, but he does have many options available... granted, complicated by the blood thinner which seems to be universal these days. Most likely, traditional IMRT would be the best course to follow, probably 44 Tx for ~80 Gy. Lots of guys in their mid 70's were getting that protocol when I was in ART. The addition of Lupron would be a more aggressive approach if there were indeed more serious pathology. As I understand it, the advantage is 5-10% in addition to RT, but that stat is I believe for aSRT, not primary radiation. Some RO's would include Casodex in more advanced cases, and a few even recommend Casodex monotherapy where there is the risk of disease progression during RT. (My summation of what I've read... and I am certainly not an authority on this). Presumably Jerry is on Medicare, which if traditional A+B+supplemental, covers the cost of all Lupron injections. I do not believe it is the gold mine that many cancer patients believe to be driving the pharmaceutical industry. They use what works and has been proven safe and effective. Best wishes for your cousin's treatment, and for your family's concerns during this period.",

The PET scan from earlier this week was clear and all the tumors have disappeared. She asked why she was still having so much pain and he said it was because the cancer had eaten away at her bones, and now that it is gone, her bones are filling in again... so she is experiencing \"growing pains\". He said she has a 70% likelihood of remaining in remission for the rest of her life and \"of the other 30% we usually can save about half\"... so right around 85%, which is what I had read when I first began to research her PBL back in December. Now she is in surveillance and is supposed to get CT scans every six months, starting in October... which is right around when I hope to finish SRT, assuming everything goes well with the AUS on Monday.",

      "Content": "Welcome to the 5% club MRJ. One in 20 RALP patients never regain continence, or at least not down to single pad status. In my case, it became apparent at seven months that I would not be able to hold a full bladder long enough to undergo adjuvant radiation. I was in a bit of a time crunch due to adverse pathology and was told that most significant continence returns within the first nine months. I hate to say you've missed that boat. Certainly by 18 months you won't be healing much further. I've had the AUS for a full year now. It did not go well and I blame it all on the surgeon. Most other guys had a simple procedure... everything that my surgeon promised me, but what I experienced was anything but simple. So I don't mean to discourage you. I had the Kegel coach with the anal probe and everything before going ahead with the AUS. But one thing is certain... life with the AUS is far better than life without it. The surgery was supposed to be a quick 45 minute outpatient procedure and there would be no catheter. Well I was at the hospital for twelve hours before going home with a Foley which I had for two weeks before the AUS was finally replaced. I developed severe pelvic pain following the second surgery, but the device works and my radiation proceeded but was delayed by a month. I still drip and squirt unexpectedly and typically go thru one pad a day. What I have now is an inconvenience, a nuisance and an annoyance, but it's one I can deal with. I wore a leg bag for a year before last July and this is so-o-o-o much better. But it is still a life altering decision. There is a bit of a learning curve and the device has a limited lifespan and must be replaced periodically. AFAIK there are not many other AUS recipients on this msg board but I have found a few others. Also I had done a LOT of research into the AUS before going ahead with it, but that didn't help much. The surgeon said he has never had this happen to him before (note... I'm the one it happened to!) Also he is not the same surgeon as the one who did my RP. Anyway, I'd say you've done all you possibly can already and this is the final alternative... either get the AUS or spend your life with pads in your pants. If you want to discuss this any further I'd be happy to help in any way I can. Good luck to you!",

MM and ASA are correct, this is not a first line treatment for your grade of cancer. Zytiga with concomitant prednisone is typically reserved for stage 4 metastatic castration-resistant PCa, and then only after a variety of hormone therapies have failed. Let's say it is not for for casual use. All though your pathological stage is not listed in your sig, you do mention SVI so you are presumably pT3bN0Mx. Have you had a bone scan? How has Emory determined that you have metastatic cancer? This is important information for you to provide if you expect to garner appropriate replies when you post such questions here. How would anyone here know whether the combination with RT is safe when no one has ever even heard of that unusual pairing?",

      "Content": "My RO said that in two studies, one using six months of ADT and the other with two years of ADT, indicated improved outcome when ADT is combined with RT. I don't know the names of the studies, but my RO doesn't believe everything he reads. I brought up other studies and he was familiar with them but said they didn't apply and gave me specific reasons for him thinking so. It surprised me actually, that he could remember having read them and recall their particulars. After RP I heard everything from six months to three years regarding the length of ADT. I could have gotten off six months ago but after much research and discussion opted for 18 months of ADT based on recent reports. HT is rough, but you get used to it, sort of like being in the military. By the way, AFAIK IMRT is a form of EBRT. I guess it depends on the machine being used. But I think External Beam RT is maybe the oldest, followed by Intensity Modulated RT, then Image Guided RT, at least as near as I can figure.",

      "Content": "Yes my initial biopsy was totally negative... no sign of cancer. The fusion biopsy two years later showed that 25% of my prostate was grade 4, Gleason 8. How did that happen? Without an MRI and a fusion biopsy, the urologist can only access less than one half of the prostate. In other words, my original urologist - in my opinion, didn't even look. It's like opening the closet door and saying nothing in here but clothes, without bothering to at least look around. By the time I was on my third urologist, I remarked on a graphic he had hanging in his office which showed that the top half of the prostate (the \"base\") is entirely hidden behind the pubic bone. I said \"no wonder my other urologist couldn't find my cancer\" and he said \"yeah, you can never find them up there.\" So how could one's cancer progress from non-existent to very high risk and locally advanced in just two years? By a urologist who was not entirely honest with the patient. He made no attempt whatsoever to INFORM me of the possibility of a false negative biopsy. He only told me that my biopsy was negative and that my prostate was normal. In my mind, performing a biopsy that completely missed a sizable tumor should be grounds for a lawsuit. But of course that would likely be a futile effort and would just make me feel worse. And so because two years were lost, I am basically now an incontinent eunuch with major depressive disorder. I certainly hope you don't end up that way. I always assumed that a doctor would know what he's doing and that he would act only in the patient's best interest. Not so.",

I was on 10 days of Ciprofloxacin and Moxifloxacin for diverticulitis, two days later I had blood test for PSA. I did not tell my Urologist this ( a mistake). some say this may lower the PSA results. Is this true? FWIW my PSA shot up just after I had been on two different antibiotics for a stubborn infection in my jaw. The Dr was not sure if the PSA reading was false and possibly caused by the infection (but not the antibiotics). Then after the infection had been cured the PSA continued to rise. So in other words, infections may cause an elevated PSA but not necessarily antibiotics. Cipro was later prescribed after my first biopsy when the Uro wasn't sure if maybe the increased PSA may have been caused by another infection or perhaps prostatitis.",

      "Content": "Yes my initial biopsy was totally negative... no sign of cancer. The fusion biopsy two years later showed that 25% of my prostate was grade 4, Gleason 8. How did that happen? Without an MRI and a fusion biopsy, the urologist can only access less than one half of the prostate. In other words, my original urologist - in my opinion, didn't even look. It's like opening the closet door and saying nothing in here but clothes, without bothering to at least look around. By the time I was on my third urologist, I remarked on a graphic he had hanging in his office which showed that the top half of the prostate (the \"base\") is entirely hidden behind the pubic bone. I said \"no wonder my other urologist couldn't find my cancer\" and he said \"yeah, you can never find them up there.\" So how could one's cancer progress from non-existent to very high risk and locally advanced in just two years? By a urologist who was not entirely honest with the patient. He made no attempt whatsoever to INFORM me of the possibility of a false negative biopsy. He only told me that my biopsy was negative and that my prostate was normal. In my mind, performing a biopsy that completely missed a sizable tumor should be grounds for a lawsuit. But of course that would likely be a futile effort and would just make me feel worse. And so because two years were lost, I am basically now an incontinent eunuch with major depressive disorder. I certainly hope you don't end up that way. I always assumed that a doctor would know what he's doing and that he would act only in the patient's best interest. Not so.",

      "Content": "Yeah Nick, you're pretty normal. I was on Lupron for eight months before RT. My body and limb hair had become fine and wispy. Zero libido, and as George said, don't really care about that. In fact I can't believe how much time and attention I used to devote to things sexual in nature. I've had very little problem with weight gain and no manboobs, though appear more flabby because of muscle loss. I've become somewhat of a weakling too. Now with both muscle and bones weaker I need to be careful as it is easy to overestimate my strength (i.e., it's shocking how weak I've actually become). Greatest SE's are hot flashes and brain fog. My wife tells me I've become a dumb blonde. I keep a fan by the sofa, by my bed and in the bathroom door, and bought a remote control on Amazon for $20 that controls three appliances (Elekcity Zap). I generally only need the fan for a minute or two. What hair was left on my abdomen disappeared during RT. Also the mild weakness caused by the Lupron was far overshadowed by the fatigue from RT. Last month was the first month that I \"would have\" had another Lupron shot but did not. Now it's just a matter of waiting for the slow recovery of my T-level. As I understand it, that won't happen until 2020, and it will never be what it was before. I still spend a lot of time just laying around listening to music, though I do get involved in a few projects and get out now and then... but not much passion for anything. No \"drive\". I don't really miss the body hair or the obsession with sex. But I do miss having clarity of mind. And the hot flashes are annoying and inconvenient to say the least. Fortunately it won't last forever, but how much recovery I will experience and when when still remains to be seen.",

      "Content": "Interesting story... I can't say that I've run across a similar situation anywhere, at least in the past year. But this type of scenario may become more common today with so much genetic testing available (I recently did an Ancestry DNA myself). I believe you were smart to decide NOT to pass on the family curse, and I think - if I understand correctly - that your question is if anyone here agrees that you should pursue having preventative prostatectomy before you become stricken as have your ancestors. I would say, if Angelina Joley can have bilateral mastectomies based solely on genetic testing, then go for it. You may have some difficulty with the national healthcare system balking at circumventing protocol, but you may be able to find someone to champion your case. Good luck in your efforts. It sounds like you have really been on top of this so far and willing to move forward into uncharted territory.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by Tybeeman Boy that is a long post LOL. I am a bad reader and a worst writer so pardon my bad writing skills. ... with any radiation you will almost always have some type of recurrence in 20 years. that make you 87. At 56 I would be 76. My dad was 95 when he died and my mother is still alive at 93. I did want to deal with it at 76. Tybee - one bad reader to another, I'm guessing that you do NOT want to deal with it at 76... and I'm in the same boat as you. Called a \"slow reader\" or \"problem reader\" in high school, ended up not surprisingly with low verbal and high math SAT's... engineering material for sure. Today they call it mild dyslexia. I can read but have to repeatedly start over and over to finish a sentence, especially if someone has used internet jargon \"u r\", or when they use the wrong their there or the wrong wear where. Another - I am always impressed with the depth of your knowledge and your mastery of language. I am jealous. In light of what I've said in the previous paragraph, perhaps you understand why. Also perhaps you can appreciate the amount of effort that I must conjure up to respond to posts here on cancer forums. People ask what I do in my retirement... this is what I do. It takes a lot of my time. In the months and years ahead when one or the both of us have moved on I will miss reading your insights... as well as that of many other forum brother here. Tybee - is your PSA rising? Are you doing anything about it? Sorry if I missed something, but your numbers and your timeline look awful (no offense please).",

      "Content": "Nick - If you truly have seminal vesicle involvement then you are already in the high risk group, where you join MM and me. MM knows what he's talking about. And Jim's remark about the professor's mental state should also be considered. My PCa appeared three and a half years ago, yet my Urologist took his time dealing with it. Later it turned out he had health problems of his own and mine was not addressed seriously until he retired. By then it had already begun to spread... as has yours. Our cases are different, but given your mention of SVI then you are also (for lack of a signature) stage pT3B. Next stage is bone metastasis, which becomes MUCH more difficult to treat. None of us are medical professionals, but it's obvious to all of us (I think) that you should at least be on HT now... and that only buys time. You do NOT want to allow this to progress any further! The window typically closes after 18-24 months. Good luck!",

My radiation oncologist recommended that I have Activia yogurt 2X daily. No drugs. My RT ended two months ago and I still sometimes have proctitis... the urge to poop several times a day. This isn't discussed much anywhere online. You can read some of my recount of this in the RT sticky at the top of the forum list. It would be the last or next to last page. During RT I had to give up most fresh fruits and veggies. A small salad with dinner is all I could eat without problems. I found that the BRAT diet helped... Bananas, Rice, Apples and Toast.

      "Content": "Originally Posted by Photopassion He's now 66 and was diagnosed about 2.5 years ago. He had a Gleason score of 8 and a PSA of 22. The surgeon didn't really want to do surgery because the tumor was so large... If it is any consolation, those figures are nearly identical to mine. I am 66 and had a G8 and PSA 25. So your father's surgeon did what he should have done going into the surgery. But your dad should have been referred to a radiation oncologist immediately after surgery if there was adverse post-op pathology (as I was), or certainly when his PSA began to rise. MM, MF and Chuck have provided excellent recommendations. There are new hormone therapies and gene specific treatments available today that have appeared on the scene only within the past couple of years. It is unfortunate that appropriate action was not taken sooner, but it is certainly not too late for him, as I had stated in my initial reply to your post. There are many other guys on this and other message boards with far worse pathologies who have survived for years, so please don't be discouraged so soon. Your dad likely still has a long way to go if proper action is taken very soon.",

I am a bad reader and a worst writer so pardon my bad writing skills. ... with any radiation you will almost always have some type of recurrence in 20 years. that make you 87. At 56 I would be 76. My dad was 95 when he died and my mother is still alive at 93. I did want to deal with it at 76. Tybee - one bad reader to another, I'm guessing that you do NOT want to deal with it at 76... and I'm in the same boat as you. Called a \"slow reader\" or \"problem reader\" in high school, ended up not surprisingly with low verbal and high math SAT's... engineering material for sure. Today they call it mild dyslexia. I can read but have to repeatedly start over and over to finish a sentence, especially if someone has used internet jargon \"u r\", or when they use the wrong their there or the wrong wear where. Another - I am always impressed with the depth of your knowledge and your mastery of language. I am jealous. In light of what I've said in the previous paragraph, perhaps you understand why. Also perhaps you can appreciate the amount of effort that I must conjure up to respond to posts here on cancer forums. People ask what I do in my retirement... this is what I do. It takes a lot of my time. In the months and years ahead when one or the both of us have moved on I will miss reading your insights... as well as that of many other forum brother here. Tybee - is your PSA rising? Are you doing anything about it? Sorry if I missed something, but your numbers and your timeline look awful (no offense please).",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by rmotacek1 I am 3 .5 years post davinci & 3 years post radiation. I have been having regular dull ache in my stomach lately just above my navel. Anyone else experience this? Could it be from the old davinci incision? I am kind of worried it could be stomach cancer but my PSA has been really good lately. Just always worried about the cancer coming back some day I guess. Probably not cancer, probably not your stomach, and most likely not related in any way to your prostatectomy. DO see a doctor about it, but do not present any of your \"theories\"... You may eventually get a CT or similar scan. Interesting that you mention your DaVinci incision. The largest of mine is a horizontal, a few inches long and just above the navel. For a couple of years it was my ugliest scar. Then the mesenteric surgery last fall put a 7\" long vertical scar that crosses the RP scar, so I am forever branded with the sign of the cross. You gotta see it to fully appreciate it...

      "Content": "Thanks Rooster. I had been reading that 18 months was the new normal, and a year ago I requested to end mine at 18 months. Originally I had heard everything from nine months to three years. So my last six month shot expired in July (two months ago), but I'm still waiting for my SE's to subside. I'm still having major hot flashes. What I've also read is that the six month shots take longer to wear off (have a longer half life due to the more \"durable\" depot agent), plus being on HT for a longer time as well as just being older, all mean that it will take longer to wear off. So I figure sometime in the year 2020 things will probably be about as good as they're going to get. Good luck Rooster. I hope things are going well for you.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by Tybeeman Boy that is a long post LOL. I am a bad reader and a worst writer so pardon my bad writing skills. ... with any radiation you will almost always have some type of recurrence in 20 years. that make you 87. At 56 I would be 76. My dad was 95 when he died and my mother is still alive at 93. I did want to deal with it at 76. Tybee - one bad reader to another, I'm guessing that you do NOT want to deal with it at 76... and I'm in the same boat as you. Called a \"slow reader\" or \"problem reader\" in high school, ended up not surprisingly with low verbal and high math SAT's... engineering material for sure. Today they call it mild dyslexia. I can read but have to repeatedly start over and over to finish a sentence, especially if someone has used internet jargon \"u r\", or when they use the wrong their there or the wrong wear where. Another - I am always impressed with the depth of your knowledge and your mastery of language. I am jealous. In light of what I've said in the previous paragraph, perhaps you understand why. Also perhaps you can appreciate the amount of effort that I must conjure up to respond to posts here on cancer forums. People ask what I do in my retirement... this is what I do. It takes a lot of my time. In the months and years ahead when one or the both of us have moved on I will miss reading your insights... as well as that of many other forum brother here. Tybee - is your PSA rising? Are you doing anything about it? Sorry if I missed something, but your numbers and your timeline look awful (no offense please).",

So there is likely some cancerous tissue remaining local to your prostate bed.

At that point it would become incurable, and you would be destined for lifelong HT, or a slow painful death. You are much too young for that.

The bone scan is not as scary as it sounds. They inject a small amount of isotope and he comes back in a few hours and lies down on a table while a scanner takes some pictures. He will be given a card stating that he has this isotope in him for a period of weeks or months which will be very important to have if and when he travels by air. The scans are necessary if he has advanced PCa (which it sounds like he might have, based on his PSA) to determine if any cancer has spread to other parts of his body, where and how much.",

      "Content": "Busby, you are a young man and your pathology was not that bad. It appears from your sig that the cause of your PSA is your positive margin and lymphoascular invasion. So there is likely some cancerous tissue remaining local to your prostate bed. My non-professional recommendation would be to treat it NOW before it leaves the pelvic area and moves on to other parts of your body. At that point it would become incurable, and you would be destined for lifelong HT, or a slow painful death. You are much too young for that. Hit this thing with everything available NOW to knock it out before it takes over. Good luck!",

      "Content": "I'm three months into my first round of Lupron and it looks like I'll be on it for the rest of the year at least. Fortunately the side effects have been tolerable. However after reading about bone loss I mentioned to my RO that I am already osteopenic and also on PPI's so might already be at high risk of bone fractures. His LPN called today about scheduling a Prolia shot and I ran it past my PCP who said it's \"probably\" approved for men by Medicare, but I need to be sure as I know it is very expensive. Has anyone here had Prolia or any other osteoporosis injection while on long term ADT, and if so was it covered by your insurance (or in particular, Medicare?) ... I know I tend to come here asking about issues that most of the constituency has never faced, so I guess I'm asking the guys who have more advanced conditions. Thanks.",

      "Content": "As I understand, it is not necessary, but probably depends on the stage of prostate cancer. Those who are G9/10 or already stage 4 are generally started on a couple weeks of Casodex to prevent the surge of testosterone known as \"Lupron flare\" when Lupron is first administered. I was not given Casodex beforehand and was climbing the walls for about ten days following my first Lupron shot. I think the surge would likely be detrimental to patients who already have metastatic PCa. Those who are stage 3 like me probably not so much. At least that's my guess as why some guys get it and some don't.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by SubDenis I have cancer in my body and my job is to keep it out of my spirit! The shock of cancer can only be understood by those who have it ... The first impact of cancer was a profound loneliness and a gut level of fear that I have never experienced ... Cancer is a lonely disease. Support groups, forums and the like take the edge off and there are just times that the Dis-Ease sets in in your heart and drags you down. The other force which makes it so difficult is the slowness of treatment decisions and how the medical system moves. Denis, even though it has only been a few months since you first posted, I can see that you obviously 'get it'. What you wrote is all very well said and exhibits great insight to what all of us are going thru. Soon after my wife was discharged from the hospital, we were talking about our cancers and she said \"it's the loneliest place you'll ever know\". You mentioned that several times, so you obviously understand. Just last night, I was troubled by memories of her calling me in the middle of the night saying \"I am so scared!\" ... I often worry that I was not supportive enough for her during that time. There was a LOT going on then. It was a very uncomfortable time. This being October marks five years since that visit to a Urologist that started everything for me. What followed was three and a half years of being mishandled by the medical system, confounded by my own ignorance of the situation and perhaps reluctance to even consider the possibility of cancer. (Despite numerous prior surgeries, this was my very first cancer). Unfortunately I apparently let it get to me. I recognize that it has affected my spirit and my attitude about just about everything. Once you have cancer, everything else becomes much less important. When you and your life mate both have cancer, everything changes. You have the benefit of an early diagnosis and it sounds like you have a good medical team working for you. Hopefully you will be able to enjoy 'smooth sailing' throughout your journey. And keep your head above water.",

      "Content": "Red, good luck with the radiation. Do you know what your total dosage will be? I just completed adjuvant RT two weeks ago, and diarrhea started midway thru the second week. I've always had a somewhat sensitive digestive system, but this persisted all the way thru my eight weeks... not always diarrhea, but frequent urgency and still now two weeks later will sometimes have two or three very normal looking bowel movements throughout the day. One very important thing to remember is never trust a fart! ... It was very inconvenient to have to find a toilet whenever I felt the urge to expel (and it seemed to be much more often than previously or since) but keeping that rule probably saved me a few embarrassing situations. The gas was a puzzle. The RO had me on a reduced diet already... no beans, cruciferous veggies or peanut products, no carbonated drinks and no spicy food (easy for me!) and yet had frequent explosive gas. The doctor simply said that 'some bowel disruption is to be expected' but no one even mentioned that this might happen. I ended up severely limiting fruits and veggies... a banana was okay, but no more bowls of blueberries or squash. Around week six I was suddenly hit with tremendous fatigue. It lasted for anther week after Tx ended, but just now getting back to normal. I've been told everything should be back to normal in a few weeks and that the radiation will continue to kill cancer cells for another 8-9 months.",

After about six months in the British Isles, I spent the remaining three years living in a bomb shelter on the Czech border in Bavaria.

So there is likely some cancerous tissue remaining local to your prostate bed. My non-professional recommendation would be to treat it NOW before it leaves the pelvic area and moves on to other parts of your body. At that point it would become incurable, and you would be destined for lifelong HT, or a slow painful death. You are much too young for that. Hit this thing with everything available NOW to knock it out before it takes over. Good luck!",

      "Content": "Following RP two years ago I went thru the usual stages of recovery, starting with dry nights at around one month. I could even walk to the bathroom in the mornings without leaking. But by midday I had very little control and would dribble all day until bedtime, when I would again be dry all thru the night. I was told right after surgery that I would need radiation at around six months, but my continence never improved. I went thru PT with a Kegel coach and the anal probe but my daytime leaking wasn't improving fast enough. After seven months I decided to get the AMS800 implant so that radiation could get underway. There were some problems with the implant but it was good enough to start RT at around the one year mark. But one of the after effects of the radiation is that I am no longer dry at night. I have to sleep with a dry washcloth tucked in between my legs. Even just turning over in bed I always drip a little onto the sheets or on my thigh... a sensation that causes one to wake up immediately. I think it's a reflex... memories of early childhood there. I suspect that the radiation damages the nerves and muscles involved in the bladder and sphincter and seems to take a long time to heal... years perhaps, or eventually, I'm hoping. But it is real. I've read other guys report their continence worsening after post-op radiation. As MM said, you are not alone. And MM... good luck with your AUS surgery.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by SubDenis I have cancer in my body and my job is to keep it out of my spirit! The shock of cancer can only be understood by those who have it ... The first impact of cancer was a profound loneliness and a gut level of fear that I have never experienced ... Cancer is a lonely disease. Support groups, forums and the like take the edge off and there are just times that the Dis-Ease sets in in your heart and drags you down. The other force which makes it so difficult is the slowness of treatment decisions and how the medical system moves. Denis, even though it has only been a few months since you first posted, I can see that you obviously 'get it'. What you wrote is all very well said and exhibits great insight to what all of us are going thru. Soon after my wife was discharged from the hospital, we were talking about our cancers and she said \"it's the loneliest place you'll ever know\". You mentioned that several times, so you obviously understand. Just last night, I was troubled by memories of her calling me in the middle of the night saying \"I am so scared!\" ... I often worry that I was not supportive enough for her during that time. There was a LOT going on then. It was a very uncomfortable time. This being October marks five years since that visit to a Urologist that started everything for me. What followed was three and a half years of being mishandled by the medical system, confounded by my own ignorance of the situation and perhaps reluctance to even consider the possibility of cancer. (Despite numerous prior surgeries, this was my very first cancer). Unfortunately I apparently let it get to me. I recognize that it has affected my spirit and my attitude about just about everything. Once you have cancer, everything else becomes much less important. When you and your life mate both have cancer, everything changes. You have the benefit of an early diagnosis and it sounds like you have a good medical team working for you. Hopefully you will be able to enjoy 'smooth sailing' throughout your journey. And keep your head above water.",

      "Content": "Very well laid out and informative reply ASA! ... I have have held back so far on posting in this thread as I tend to be the \"poster boy\" for incontinence (see other recent incontinence thread: Looking for Information) ... Regarding RP, the statistic I see most often is that 5% or one in twenty RP patients will have not regained full continence within 18 months. For most it occurs between 3-6 months and generally 90% of healing is completed by 9 months. Therefore adjuvant radiation, if needed, is typically scheduled for 6-8 months after RP... though most likely not applicable to the OP's situation. Even after the first two years some are left with an occasional infrequent \"accident\" during exertion (SUI). Originally Posted by ASAdvocate Radiation advocates will claim that \"incontinence is almost non-existent\" following RT. They are only partially correct, as that may mostly be true for avoiding full loss of control following primary RT, but there are still urinary issues for some men. Rarely mentioned, especially by the advocates of RT over RP. Often omitted is the fact that many victims of PCa have already had years of urinary issues and likely other treatments and/or medications for urinary frequency, urgency, difficulty starting/stopping flow, incomplete voiding and urethral burning sensations. So the fact that they may be left with WORSE urinary symptoms after RT doesn't make headlines. Being left incontinent by a surgeon's scalpel definitely does. And it sells books! Originally Posted by ASAdvocate So, take your time and investigate your options. One piece of advice would be not to take the opinions of a specialist in one area about other treatments, as they often don't know much about the other, and tend to promote their own. True words of wisdom. This tends to be the little secret within the medical community... favoring their own specialty over any others... presenting \"best case\" outcomes and rarely making mention of adverse effects (not unlike the drug commercials on TV, where the SE's like \"may cause death\" are rushed thru near the end of the ad).",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by DavefromMD Mainly I was wondering from those who have gone through external beam radiation, whether you were advised to go on some modified diet or whether you maintained your current diet and modified as necessary to limit bowel side effects. I was given a list by my RO of foods to avoid, and I ended up even having to add to it. I had to give up granola for breakfast. I also stopped most supplements and took only a bare minimum daily multivitamin (generic Centrum). And in addition to eliminating all the rich and spicy foods on the list, I had to severely restrict fresh fruits (berries) and vegetables (salads). I tried to eat fairly \"normally\" but had tremendous gas and diarrhea if I ate fruits and veggies as I used to. My RO recommended that I continue that diet for several weeks after the end of RT and now a year later I still have bowel issues from radiation colitis. But I have not had any weight gain issues other than from some meds I had to take for other medical problems... which I was later able to lose again. You might want to read the last few pages of the \"EBRT\" stickie on the main page. I remember that I posted there several times during RT, as did a few other guys going thru around the same time. Good luck to you! They say it is a marathon, not a sprint, especially with HT added.",

      "Content": "Unfortunately I don't believe there is any magic sauce. Fatigue will most likely creep up on you later on during radiation, around six weeks in. Good news is that the time you most want to take a nap is just after each treatment, so if you get zapped on your way home from work, you'll likely go right to bed. Bad news is the HT will probably keep you from resting well due to night sweats. Some guys claim they never got the RT fatigue, but most do. And it lingers for a few weeks after your 40 has ended. Last Nov we had the grandkids down for a week at Universal Studios just a month after completing RT. My energy held up surprisingly well. But I'm not sure how well maintaining contractor's hours will work out. Good luck to you!",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by RTS Curious if anyone has an opinion on leftover prostate tissue after surgery causing a psa rise? I just can\u2019t see how with my pathology report that cancer could have gotten out of my prostate. Your post sugery psa of .11 july 2017, two and a half years after RP, qualifies as persistent PSA. I didn't see any other PSA's listed during that time period. Presumably you were indeed tested and just left it out or I just missed it. At .25 this month you are now in the territory of BCR and should be considering salvage radiation. There is a slight possibility that it is from benign prostate tissue left behind, but I would say that is most likely wishful thinking. You should also seriously consider adjuvant hormone therapy. How it escaped is at this point not the real question, but what you will be doing about it, and when. Good luck to you!",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by KarlEmagne So I'm very likely a candidate for RP at age 53 and am wondering what others on this forum having undergone the procedure, especially with less than ideal outcomes, experienced afterwards in terms of mood swings. Has RP been triggering severely depressive episodes for anyone? I've already had several despite good physical health and am worried I'll be plunging into the next hole soon. I have unfortunately been unable to get help with this in our public health care system despite repeated attempts. The attitude seems to be one of total indifference towards male individuals over 50 who are working and paying taxes. To complicate matters, I had very adverse side effects from an SSRI anti-depressant which I tried decades ago. Advice? Coping strategies? Medications taken? My cancer experience sent me to very dark and unfamiliar place. I'd had no experience whatsoever with emotional or mental health issues in my past, but unfortunately my misdiagnosis occurred at a time in my life already filled with stress and anxiety, including retirement and relocation and following the deaths of several close friends and family members, all within a period of just a few years. I found myself crying all the time and prone to emotional outbursts. My family doctor was no help whatsoever, and my urologist's unwillingness to provide me with any information was most frustrating. Eventually I changed doctors and got the news that my \"prostatitis\" was actually cancer and it was far worse than had been suspected. And within two months of my prostatectomy we sold our home of 33 years and moved to Florida, where my wife was immediately diagnosed with advanced non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, again within just two months. On top of all that, I never regained urinary continence, was started on Lupron injections (which is another emotional roller coaster in itself) and had to postpone adjuvant radiation while I drove my wife to her chemotherapy treatments. I felt that I had no one in my corner... no one to help me or guide me. Some of the others here on this board may recall what an emotional mess I had become. Fortunately a few encouraged me to \"get some help\" (if only it were that easy). The radiation oncologist who ordered the Lupron was no help whatsoever... even dismissive of what I was going thru. Eventually thru my own research I learned about venlafaxine or Effexor, an SNRI, and outright asked my GP for a prescription. Suddenly things started to improve. I have now been on it for nearly two years, have had to go up and down in dosage a few times but am fairly certain that I will be taking it for the rest of my life. The emotional stability it has brought far outweighs the side effects. I should also mention the effects of general anesthesia. It sticks with you for a few weeks and can be very depressing... not to mention the stress of surgery and the emotions that go along with it. I am a veteran of over a dozen surgeries and have experienced this every time. Here again the Effexor has kept me from going off the rails when dark thoughts try to re-emerge. There's not a whole lot of joy to be experienced anymore. The SNRI just keeps me from swaying too far from the even keel so to speak. But just knowing this stability plus the positive outcomes of both my cancer and my wife's has brought some peace into my chaotic life. Coping strategies? I have none. I try to just go with the flow. I've had two other \"close calls\" with cancer since all of this happened. Long stories there. It can be scary, but I seem to be able to handle it all. I can't really help you much but maybe my story will help you feel not so alone in your struggle.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by mostth Extraprostatic extension: The lesions more so on the left have broad based areas of capsular contact with extracapsular extension difficult to exclude towards and into left seminal vesicle. As I recall my MRI said something similar, giving the impression that my cancer was \"close\" but still contained within the prostate. Apparently a biopsy generally is not able confirm that. As it turned out following RP, the cancer had in fact exited the prostate in three areas and had invaded the seminal vesicles, which meant that I had to have Lupron and radiation soon after the prostatectomy. While I hate to say it, just be prepared for your case to possibly turn out to be worse than expected. It happens in about 30% of prostatectomies. There's nothing quite like waking up from surgery and hearing \"we got MOST of the cancer\".",

Rarely mentioned, especially by the advocates of RT over RP. Often omitted is the fact that many victims of PCa have already had years of urinary issues and likely other treatments and/or medications for urinary frequency, urgency, difficulty starting/stopping flow, incomplete voiding and urethral burning sensations. So the fact that they may be left with WORSE urinary symptoms after RT doesn't make headlines. Being left incontinent by a surgeon's scalpel definitely does. And it sells books!

This tends to be the little secret within the medical community... favoring their own specialty over any others... presenting \"best case\" outcomes and rarely making mention of adverse effects (not unlike the drug commercials on TV, where the SE's like \"may cause death\" are rushed thru near the end of the ad).",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by mikesimm My Radiologist doc says she won't start adjunctive radiation after surgery until my pee skills \"max out\". She says once radiation is started, the pee skills are \"fixed\" at that point, so she wants me to be at my max. Anyone with experience on this? I think she won't go any longer than 2-3 months, regardless. Hoping I can get my skills honed by then. Yes, too much experience LOL! Just after surgery I was told I would need ART at around six months. At four months I was still largely incontinent so my Urologist put me into PT with a Kegel coach, which really didn't help much. At six months I could hold it as long as necessary as long as I was focused on it... totally dry nights, getting up from sitting, etc but walking around and DOING STUFF as soon as I lost focus on holding it I'd leak copiously. I was still unable to start RT for several reasons, one being the incontinence (the other being my wife's chemo schedule). At that point I had to decide whether or not to have an artificial sphincter implanted, which also carried with it a six week healing requirement plus a 1 in 4 chance of requiring revision surgery. Yes, you WILL be required to hold a full bladder for RT. I don't think I've heard anybody say they were spared that requirement. And yes, RT will 'freeze' the healing of everything in your pelvis and lower abdomen. Routine medical procedures such as colonoscopies must be worked around a three month window on either side of the two month RT. Personally I used an Excel spreadsheet to keep track of our schedules for both my wife and I... odd for a retired couple. But it really has been that complicated. Forgive me if I'm repeating myself. I don't know of anyone else on this board who has faced this decision. However several other guys who said they went into RT with good continence lost some of that by the time RT ended. So in other words, my continence would get no better and quite likely would become worse. Fast forward to today, with just ten more doses of RT left (two more weeks). The AUS is uncomfortable, sometimes painful... long story there. But it does its job. Additionally my natural sphincter still has decent control, so I need to release both my bladder sphincter plus squeeze the implant in order to pee. I do feel that my natural sphincter has continued to improve (heal) over the past six months, and perhaps the AUS might not have been an absolute necessity. But I did not know that six months ago. Much crystal ball gazing was required to get all these pieces to come together. Again, good luck Mike.",

      "Content": "Unfortunately I don't believe there is any magic sauce. Fatigue will most likely creep up on you later on during radiation, around six weeks in. Good news is that the time you most want to take a nap is just after each treatment, so if you get zapped on your way home from work, you'll likely go right to bed. Bad news is the HT will probably keep you from resting well due to night sweats. Some guys claim they never got the RT fatigue, but most do. And it lingers for a few weeks after your 40 has ended. Last Nov we had the grandkids down for a week at Universal Studios just a month after completing RT. My energy held up surprisingly well. But I'm not sure how well maintaining contractor's hours will work out. Good luck to you!",

      "Content": "I'll try to answer you here rather than on that other message board, where so far your thread has zero replies. I know that in the past we have joked about spending too much time in cancer forums. Well, just last night I discovered yet another one (that makes four for me, not counting several I checked out but where I never bothered to register). And I can only speak for my own case, but yours is not so dissimilar. You fear that it may be unhealthy, but for me it is a necessity. We both have a spouse who has also been thru cancer, and in some ways are still going thru it. In my case, it dropped in my lap right in the midst of my own cancer struggle. You have the additional burden of your CAD and I consider myself fortunate to be without additional co-morbidities. But at this time my struggle with PCa is ongoing and is starting to look like I'm still stuck at first base. But I learn new things every day. Yes, I do grow weary of reading about cancer and people who have cancer and am prone to just shut sown my laptop because I always find myself gravitating back to this forum and a couple others or father Google with some new search idea. BTW I used to watch news all the time, now I rarely ever do. The TV stays off most of the time. I have the complete Seinfeld DVD set, still in shrinkwrap. But then I'm on Lupron, so I spend a lot of time just doing nothing. Part of my research was into anti-depressants, as you probably know, and that has been a big help for me emotionally... considering all that's gone south recently on this end, and I'm not talking about Florida. You have hobbies and see friends. I don't do much of either. We do go out to dinner with others we meet here in our community. Seems everyone here has cancer or has had cancer. But for me I never stop learning about it. And I have to. This coming week marks the one year anniversary of my fusion biopsy. That and the DaVinci a couple months later are I feel the only times that I've been treated properly. We are traveling back to Ohio for the fourth and I made an appointment to see the surgeon who did my RP, and I intend to tell him how I feel. I also hope to get his opinion on the disaster that has been my AUS implant. My introduction to Florida medical care has led me to believe that the patient must be the one with all the medical knowledge because the doctors here don't do anything unless you ask them about it. So I would recommend that you continue to learn as much as you can. I know that you worry about your PSA and given what we have seen here with guys who have a fairly decent profile but end up in BCR anyway, it may only be a matter of time before you find yourself in those shoes... not to be a pessimist, but I've always believed it's better to be prepared rather than being left with your pants down.",

So the fact that they may be left with WORSE urinary symptoms after RT doesn't make headlines. Being left incontinent by a surgeon's scalpel definitely does. And it sells books!

This tends to be the little secret within the medical community... favoring their own specialty over any others... presenting \"best case\" outcomes and rarely making mention of adverse effects (not unlike the drug commercials on TV, where the SE's like \"may cause death\" are rushed thru near the end of the ad).",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by Tybeeman It has been 10 months since my robotic radical prostatectomy. I have had my consistency back since the 3rd month, with just a little leakage, mainly when I drink. Now no problem at all. Have not had an erection yet but I am taking Cialis daily and triple dose twice a week. Last night I woke up with a nocturnal erection. Was wondering if anyone else has experience this and could this be a sign that I will be getting my erections back. It is a long process and I am sure most of you know I am very anxious. Five months ago today for me, and have not had an erection of any kind since before the surgery. At my age I don't worry about it. I am able to work myself to a pelvic orgasm with much effort, but since the Lupron kicked in don't have much urge to do so. My greatest concern is that my RO said he has never seen any improvement in urinary continence after ten months, and I am halfway there now. I am dry all night, but have to get up once or twice to pee, and also do well when siting down. But when standing or walking I leak like a garden hose, going thru 8-12 pads a day pretty consistently. I've weighed them at around a half pound each. I am not even aware that I am leaking, just that the pads get heavy and very wet. My penis sometimes develop a rash from the moisture. My uro has had me in therapy for a couple months now. The therapist wants me to hold the Kegels for fifteen seconds and it just wears me out. Very hard to maintain. I guess the \"good\" news is I still have another five months before the RO has to proceed with SRT and hopefully I won't be leaking so much by then because it will stop any further improvement in continence.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by steve135 Thanks for the info. I just had a second PSA score of .006 on my three month testing. I am now one year on HT I'm guessing Triptorelin is a lot like Lupron and the HT is effectively keeping your PSA down. From NCBI \"Triptorelin reduced testosterone concentrations less rapidly, but maintained castration as effectively as leuprolide.\" I've been on Lupron only, no Casodex for the past year and have never had a PSA test that goes out to three digits. But I do know that my PSA was around 0.03 last year before going thru RT and afterwards it was 0.00 What I don't know is whether or not that .03 was actually .035 and the 0.00 was actually 0.005 ... My Uro said my PSA \"may\" go up to .01, so if mine were the same as your .006, then it would have been rounded up to .01 My worry now is that from zero there's only one direction for the PSA to go... UP... So a year from now after the Lupron has worn off is when the real story will be told. Everyone says the PSA level post-RT is not as important as the direction. Same goes for your Triptorelin. As long as it's in your system, the actual PSA value will be unreliable. And as long as it is steady there isn't much to worry about, at this time anyway. Also your doc has probably told you the same thing mine did, that it will take a year or so before testosterone recovers, and after that length of time on HT it will probably never reach its pre-HT level.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by KarlEmagne So I'm very likely a candidate for RP at age 53 and am wondering what others on this forum having undergone the procedure, especially with less than ideal outcomes, experienced afterwards in terms of mood swings. Has RP been triggering severely depressive episodes for anyone? I've already had several despite good physical health and am worried I'll be plunging into the next hole soon. I have unfortunately been unable to get help with this in our public health care system despite repeated attempts. The attitude seems to be one of total indifference towards male individuals over 50 who are working and paying taxes. To complicate matters, I had very adverse side effects from an SSRI anti-depressant which I tried decades ago. Advice? Coping strategies? Medications taken? My cancer experience sent me to very dark and unfamiliar place. I'd had no experience whatsoever with emotional or mental health issues in my past, but unfortunately my misdiagnosis occurred at a time in my life already filled with stress and anxiety, including retirement and relocation and following the deaths of several close friends and family members, all within a period of just a few years. I found myself crying all the time and prone to emotional outbursts. My family doctor was no help whatsoever, and my urologist's unwillingness to provide me with any information was most frustrating. Eventually I changed doctors and got the news that my \"prostatitis\" was actually cancer and it was far worse than had been suspected. And within two months of my prostatectomy we sold our home of 33 years and moved to Florida, where my wife was immediately diagnosed with advanced non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, again within just two months. On top of all that, I never regained urinary continence, was started on Lupron injections (which is another emotional roller coaster in itself) and had to postpone adjuvant radiation while I drove my wife to her chemotherapy treatments. I felt that I had no one in my corner... no one to help me or guide me. Some of the others here on this board may recall what an emotional mess I had become. Fortunately a few encouraged me to \"get some help\" (if only it were that easy). The radiation oncologist who ordered the Lupron was no help whatsoever... even dismissive of what I was going thru. Eventually thru my own research I learned about venlafaxine or Effexor, an SNRI, and outright asked my GP for a prescription. Suddenly things started to improve. I have now been on it for nearly two years, have had to go up and down in dosage a few times but am fairly certain that I will be taking it for the rest of my life. The emotional stability it has brought far outweighs the side effects. I should also mention the effects of general anesthesia. It sticks with you for a few weeks and can be very depressing... not to mention the stress of surgery and the emotions that go along with it. I am a veteran of over a dozen surgeries and have experienced this every time. Here again the Effexor has kept me from going off the rails when dark thoughts try to re-emerge. There's not a whole lot of joy to be experienced anymore. The SNRI just keeps me from swaying too far from the even keel so to speak. But just knowing this stability plus the positive outcomes of both my cancer and my wife's has brought some peace into my chaotic life. Coping strategies? I have none. I try to just go with the flow. I've had two other \"close calls\" with cancer since all of this happened. Long stories there. It can be scary, but I seem to be able to handle it all. I can't really help you much but maybe my story will help you feel not so alone in your struggle.",

Your Uro's stumbling over terminology is inexcusable. Quite possibly this guy's head is so clouded with higher level minutia that he can't be bothered with mundane stuff like scores and staging. Giving him the benefit of the doubt, he may actually be an excellent surgeon but with a frightening, off-putting demeanor. I have encountered this fairly often professionally... engineers with excellent analytical skills who present complex data so concisely that \"mere mortals\" (or Muggles) seem barely able to comprehend what is before them... and the job ends up going to a blowhard who sounds sweet but has little knowledge of actually getting things done.",

Locally advanced is stage 3 and means the cancer has escaped the prostate and invaded local tissues, such as seminal vesicles and abdominal wall.

      "Content": "Originally Posted by RTS Curious if anyone has an opinion on leftover prostate tissue after surgery causing a psa rise? I just can\u2019t see how with my pathology report that cancer could have gotten out of my prostate. Your post sugery psa of .11 july 2017, two and a half years after RP, qualifies as persistent PSA. I didn't see any other PSA's listed during that time period. Presumably you were indeed tested and just left it out or I just missed it. At .25 this month you are now in the territory of BCR and should be considering salvage radiation. There is a slight possibility that it is from benign prostate tissue left behind, but I would say that is most likely wishful thinking. You should also seriously consider adjuvant hormone therapy. How it escaped is at this point not the real question, but what you will be doing about it, and when. Good luck to you!",

      "Content": "Red, good luck with the radiation. Do you know what your total dosage will be? I just completed adjuvant RT two weeks ago, and diarrhea started midway thru the second week. I've always had a somewhat sensitive digestive system, but this persisted all the way thru my eight weeks... not always diarrhea, but frequent urgency and still now two weeks later will sometimes have two or three very normal looking bowel movements throughout the day. One very important thing to remember is never trust a fart! ... It was very inconvenient to have to find a toilet whenever I felt the urge to expel (and it seemed to be much more often than previously or since) but keeping that rule probably saved me a few embarrassing situations. The gas was a puzzle. The RO had me on a reduced diet already... no beans, cruciferous veggies or peanut products, no carbonated drinks and no spicy food (easy for me!) and yet had frequent explosive gas. The doctor simply said that 'some bowel disruption is to be expected' but no one even mentioned that this might happen. I ended up severely limiting fruits and veggies... a banana was okay, but no more bowls of blueberries or squash. Around week six I was suddenly hit with tremendous fatigue. It lasted for anther week after Tx ended, but just now getting back to normal. I've been told everything should be back to normal in a few weeks and that the radiation will continue to kill cancer cells for another 8-9 months.",

      "Content": "My cancer was a bit more aggressive and my PSA higher. The surgeon asked me beforehand about nerve sparing and I told him that getting all the cancer was more important, but if it were possible without compromising the mission, then by all means do so. My wife was with me and we had to admit that we had not had successful coitus for some time. I lost had a testicle ten years earlier (still looking for where I put that darn thing ). Post op I took longer to regain continence and went ahead with an AUS implant in order to proceed with ART. Also ED has been more or less permanent so far, but I'm sure a big part of that is due to the Lupron. Still not sure what the future will hold, but my surgeon did reaffirm using a 'broad cut' and removed a lot of nerve tissue, but the payoff was negative margins as well as negative nodes. Nerve sparing may be very important for some, but I say keep priorities straight. Dead men have no erections.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by cindy_hart He began EBRT treatments at the end of January and completed his daily therapy on April 2, 2018. As reported by others on this site he was required to follow a no-gas diet, taking Gas-X multiple times per day and taking a laxative daily. He also had to have a full bladder for the treatment. The daily laxative treatments kept him close to home with frequent and loose bowel movements. Except for the daily treatments, he rarely went out. Having to give up spicy foods, beer and all alcohol were his worst complaints until about week five when he began experiencing the fatigue. He is just now (two weeks post his last treatment) beginning to see an improvement in the fatigue but frequent and loose bowels (with very little warning) continue even without the daily laxative. He is now almost two weeks post treatment and is wondering how long this will last or if it will ever go away. I'm trying to get some anecdotal information for him. While I realize post side effects will vary from person to person, it might help him to know that it won't last forever. Is anyone willing to share if they had this post treatment side effect and how long it lasted? Any responses will be greatly appreciated. Thank you! Yes, I experienced considerable bowel disruption during IMRT/EBRT which still persists to some extend today, six months after the end of treatment. I was not required to take a laxative and when I asked my RO about Gas-X he said that simethicone would be ineffective and Beano would be preferred (I ended up using neither one). Starting midway thru the second week I began to experience frequent urgency and occasional diarrhea, the latter at least 2-3 days a week and the urgency most days, including explosive gas. I wrote about this in the EBRT sticky on the main page of this forum. I think it was around page 10, but could be wrong. It should be easy to find. Most guys say they had no side effects from radiation Tx but it certainly walloped me. I was due for a colonoscopy last year before starting radiation, but because I had so much else going on it was cancelled and rescheduled several times, but eventually postponed until after radiation. Friday I finally get that colonoscopy (start the prep tomorrow), and I am somewhat apprehensive about what the gastroenterologist might find in there as far as radiation damage. I have never had any sort of bowel problems and am typically quite regular... two cups of coffee and five minutes on the throne and I'm done for the day. But ever since the pelvic radiation I often have 2-3 BM's per day, and many mornings a foot long (sorry for the details). The colonoscopy would have required three months of healing before starting RT and after RT I had to wait six months before getting the colo, so it will be good to finally have this out of the way. Whether or not my doctor may find something that might explain the continued SE's and whether or not this condition will continue or may improve with time is something I really don't know. Everything I did for the first year following my surgery was in preparation for starting adjuvant radiation, and it seemed like everything was getting in my way. Good luck to your husband for continued improvement. Hopefully I have not discouraged either of you.",

      "Content": "I had a MRI of the head and neck about a year ago and they put me in this headgear to keep my head motionless and had an angled mirror something like a periscope in front of my eyes so that I was looking down at my feet and out into the room. Also took an Ativan beforehand. I think that was my fourth MRI, but have had many CT's which of course go much faster fortunately. Three just this year, including a brain scan, plus an \"octreoscan\" radio isotope scan that took 90 minutes in the machine with my arms over my head... twice!

Your indecision is understandable. I've edited your PSA's to make them tabular for perspective. Also the G7(4+3) is the one you need to be concerned about. Since your biopsy was only last month, you would need to wait until next month (August) at the earliest if you were to elect surgery... which at your age, I would recommend assuming you enjoy overall good health other then the PCa. You can expect to live into your 80's and you don't want a half-baked prostate remaining in there (okay, I know I'll hear form others on that one!) Your PSA is rising, but that can be arrested and even reduced by going on ADT, which might even be necessitated if any of that grade 4 tumor has escaped the prostate. You will need the entire pathology report and even then there could still be surprises waiting for you once they remove your prostate. It happens fairly often. So basically you're looking at a potential delay from August til October in order to have complete freedom to have whatever you want, wherever you want fully paid by Medicare plus your choice of supplemental insurance (unless you get locked into an \"advantage\" plan, which after being with Kaiser, you are probably wise enough to avoid). Bottom line, wait for 65, ask about whether or not ADT might be a good idea, then go for the surgery. Often in cases where the Gleason is higher than (3+4) radiation + ADT becomes necessary after surgery anyway. Some may say that is a reason for just going with primary RT in the first place, to which I can only say be sure to evaluate all of your alternatives.",

      "Content": "My cancer was a bit more aggressive and my PSA higher. The surgeon asked me beforehand about nerve sparing and I told him that getting all the cancer was more important, but if it were possible without compromising the mission, then by all means do so. My wife was with me and we had to admit that we had not had successful coitus for some time. I lost had a testicle ten years earlier (still looking for where I put that darn thing ). Post op I took longer to regain continence and went ahead with an AUS implant in order to proceed with ART. Also ED has been more or less permanent so far, but I'm sure a big part of that is due to the Lupron. Still not sure what the future will hold, but my surgeon did reaffirm using a 'broad cut' and removed a lot of nerve tissue, but the payoff was negative margins as well as negative nodes. Nerve sparing may be very important for some, but I say keep priorities straight. Dead men have no erections.",

      "Content": "The first Sunday in June is National Cancer Survivor's Day. Anyone who has or has had cancer and is still living is a survivor. If you go to the NCSD Facebook page it becomes apparent that only women get cancer, or at least only women survive cancer... or so that is the impression one would get from their FB page. Every photo is of women. One photo shows half of one man's face (fortunately he is NOT wearing pink, for Pete's sake). In a recent thread on that other forum site a number of guys vented on the discrepancies in how men and women with cancer are treated. I have posted about it here on CFN and ended up deleting the post. I know everyone loves boobs and make jokes about prostates (or refer to them as 'prostrates') but come on there is more than one type of cancer. Even my wife gets fed up with how many people assume that she had breast cancer. Isn't it time for the world to come to the realization that both genders can be cancer victims - and survivors?",

      "Content": "Much of your decision making will depend on your father's general health. At 69 he is right on the cusp of the surgery/no surgery dividing line. If he is expected to live more than 20 years (if his family has a history of living into their nineties) then you should perhaps be concerned about the long term effects of radiation. Of course, those who chose rad recently will say they have not concerns (they are still fairly young). Surgery of course has consequences. He's probably not concerned about ED, but incontinence can be a definite life changer. The doctors and facilities you have chosen are all excellent. With a dominant grade 4 his cancer is aggressive, but the HT will keep it in check for a while. I do not know which order you plan to see the RO's and the Moffitt team, nor do I know which order I would recommend. Depends on which tests he has already had and when they were, and whether any retests would reflect progression or regression. Focus your questions on optimum and worst case timelines, possible outcomes of treatments and likelihood of success, and if not, overall survivability and quality of life.",

Off hand I would say his outlook should be good... but sometimes the Gleason may later be elevated if the prostate is removed and evaluated in dissection. His PSA is startlingly high, but could be caused by other factors. I'd guess if there is any metastasis that it would be from another source. Typically bone scans and possibly an MRI will be conducted.

It just means that as the tumor grew within the prostate it also grew into the nerve tissue that is in there. Almost everyone has PNI.

What's more, your only grade 4 component was secondary and probably small in volume. Grade 4 is the kind of cancer that can escape the prostate and spread.

Furthermore your tumors were in the lateral lobes, not near the base which might involve the bladder, and not near the apex, where positive margins are more likely to occur. Also your lymph nodes were all negative, which is no guarantee, but is definitely to your benefit. All in all I would say, DON'T WORRY. Most likely this was nipped in the bud.

      "Content": "Surgery is often chosen by those who are on the younger side and in generally good health, with less aggressive PCa (lower Gleason scores), where radiation tends to be chosen by older men who may have a problem with surgery, such as other health problems. Each case is different and there are ARDENT supporters and haters of both surgery and radiation. If you were twenty years older then either radiation or simply doing nothing would be an obvious choice. Side effects from surgery generally are experienced right away and improve over time. SE's from radiation often do not appear until years later. The main advantage of surgery is that the doctor actually examines the prostate and surrounding tissues. Radiation is administered based on external scans, which I call \"shooting in the dark\". I had a more aggressive prostate cancer, had surgery followed by radiation a year later. I have suffered what are probably the worst side effects of both, but if I could go back I would not change my choice. I'm assuming you had R-CHOP for your NHL. Be aware that in the case of PCa, chemo is generally reserved for advanced metastatic PCa and is in effect one of the \"last resort\" treatments. Good luck in what comes. Be sure that you speak with or correspond with several older men who had radiation ten years or so ago before choosing. Opponents of surgery usually speak of the \"advances\" in radiation over the past decade, but still there are NO men who survived twenty or more years after having had radiation within the past ten years. That's just my way of saying there is little to go by in the way of a track record.",

You all know my story, much like Prato's (well stated), and yes, were it not for cumbersome insurance restrictions coinciding with the problematic USPSTF recommendations promulgated by the prior administrations, I probably would not even be a participant on this forum. My cancer would have been discovered early on by an MRI, would have been treated rather inexpensively, and I would have moved on with my life. Thank you D'Artagnan for presenting the facts that it would have been good to have known back when all this began. (Trying not to be too bitter about this)... signed, Aramis",

      "Content": "Gleason score of 6 is moderate... some may say he is a candidate for non-surgical treatment. Also he is relatively young, unless there are other medical conditions (diabetes etc). Off hand I would say his outlook should be good... but sometimes the Gleason may later be elevated if the prostate is removed and evaluated in dissection. His PSA is startlingly high, but could be caused by other factors. I'd guess if there is any metastasis that it would be from another source. Typically bone scans and possibly an MRI will be conducted. (My wife just went thru a spinal tumor, which was originally believed to be a back strain so I'm a little scared when people mention metastasis... I am not a medical pro so take what I say here with a small grain of salt). Good luck to you and your father!",

It would likely do nothing for your retention problem. It sounds like something else, perhaps nerve damage from the surgery. I too started having a problem with incomplete voiding starting just this past summer, mentioned it to my uro who pretty much dismissed it and I didn't pursue it due to having more pressing matters... But I will certainly bring it up again at my next checkup. As far as \"how soon\" you can have a cath, I had a Foley for several weeks in 2017, a year after RP, and for a couple of days just last week for another surgery.

I don't know if your case would be eligible for outside treatment. I too was 4+4 and understood that I had to wait eight weeks after the biopsy before having the surgery. It turned out that the cancer had progressed beyond what the MRI had shown, which led to additional treatments that lasted basically for two years. I will never know how much it had progressed during those two months, but chances are it was already outside of the prostate and well on its way. But at present it appears that I beat the cancer by throwing everything available at it. Congratulations on defeating your CLL.

      "Content": "Presumably the 'laser' is HIFU or something like it, which is focused on individual tumors. The problem with PCa is it's like cockroaches... if you see one, you probably have many. You should probably avoid focused ablation and limit your treatment to surgery or 'some form' of radiation. Since you have a grade 4 component in your biopsy you should act within a matter of months. This would put you out of eligibility for active surveillance. Surgery has a long track record of success and has the advantage of removing the gland entirely, where it can be analyzed in a pathology lab. In many cases a 3+4 is upstaged to 4+3 or even worse. There is a strong possibility of genitourinary side effects. Six months or so of incontinence is typical but usually heals entirely within a year with few complications. ED is more common. For men in their sixties, that's usually not a big deal. For radiation, eight weeks of intensity modulated external beam radiation is the traditional standard treatment. There are possible late term side effects which may appear years later due to radiation toxicity. IMRT is administered based on external scans. There are some strong vocal advocates of RT over surgery. Newer forms of radiation seek to reduce the length of time and number of treatments required. HDRBT is one that looks promising but as with many of the newer forms of treatment, there is not a very long track record to go by. Your choice depends on your willingness to accept risks. Many on this message board chose surgery in order to \"be done with it.\" In some of those cases, adjuvant or salvage radiation plus possible hormone therapy following surgery may be necessary, typically those with Gleason 8 or those who were upstaged from G7 based on the pathology results discovered during surgery. Welcome to the board, and sorry you have to be here, but the people here know a lot because we've been thru it ourselves. Good luck going forward!",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by Nhlsir54 Yes I did R-CHOP... I thought having been through this that I would be prepared for the psychological part, but that has not been the case. I do know I had several people tell me not to do chemo. That it would kill me, not the cancer. I am trying to do as much research as possible but then it gets to be too much and I get discouraged. I also know from previous cancer how important a positive outlook is, and I believe you can make yourself sicker by your thoughts. I have learned a lot from time spent on this forum. I guess we are all scared of the unknown. Hi Jeff, I'm sorry that you have to go thru this again, but you have your head on straight and your wife is on board with you, so you are already way ahead of most others going into this. A good sense of humor, a good support network, and the self confidence of having previously survived another cancer will all make your journey thru prostate cancer much easier. As others have noted, yours is currently a rather innocuous form of PCa, and you certainly do have time to wait and see if it progresses any further. I know that once you've had cancer, anything that hurts sends your mind into the \"is it coming back\" tailspin. So the best I can say at this point is, don't worry too much about it. But beware of taking it too lightly. My Urologist kept me in the dark for several years, during which time my cancer progressed to the point where it became \"very high risk\" and required multiple follow up procedures over the past eighteen months. In a significant number of cases, once the prostate has been removed and examined in the pathology lab, additional tumors are found, and in some cases worse or much worse. Fortunately your PSA is relatively low, though a bit on the high side given your age. BTW my wife was diagnosed with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma one year ago just before Christmas. It was a crazy time for us both, and very stressful for me as this happened right in the midst of my own cancer treatment. Additionally I became very concerned while she underwent R-CHOP as she started watching toxic online videos about how (as you mentioned) chemo would kill her rather than the cancer. We are both still bombarded by anecdotal tales of miracle cures and how we not only caused our own cancers by eating wrong, but can cured be by eating differently. In the end, she also required only six of eight infusions, plus - as she had spinal tumors, also had a radiation boost and needed spinal injections following each infusion. If you have the time you may want to read our blog linked at the bottom of my sig, or at least the first and last chapters. Yes, you can drive yourself nuts doing TOO much online research. Both my wife and I have really had to dial it back lately. If anything, our cancers have brought my wife and I even closer than ever. You are very fortunate to have a head start on your PCa and a very understanding wife.

      "Content": "Keith - I agree that you should TRY to get your surgery moved up a few weeks. It COULD make a difference. Chuck mentioned the veteran's choice program. I don't know if your case would be eligible for outside treatment. I too was 4+4 and understood that I had to wait eight weeks after the biopsy before having the surgery. It turned out that the cancer had progressed beyond what the MRI had shown, which led to additional treatments that lasted basically for two years. I will never know how much it had progressed during those two months, but chances are it was already outside of the prostate and well on its way. But at present it appears that I beat the cancer by throwing everything available at it. Congratulations on defeating your CLL. I lost my brother eight years ago to complications from treatment for CLL.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by redbelly7 I've just about had enough of the emotions. I'm sure it's the Lupron... I think I'm ready for something to help and would like suggestions from you guys. Xanax? I'm not much on these types of Rx's, but need relief. My emotional rollercoaster started after the first negative biopsy. I suspect the cancer itself was affecting my hormones, but my emotions were definitely a mess. The Lupron only exacerbated conditions. In addition to the hot flashes and night sweats I was extremely volatile... not violent, but explosive and fits of anxiety followed by brooding and extended crying spells. I read in this and other forums that some guys were taking Venlafaxine for the hot flashes and it also helped with the moodiness. I hinted to my RO about the problem but he was no help. Finally I asked my GP for Venlafaxine, which is the generic name for the antidepressant Effexor. I have never taken anything like this before... no Valium or Prozac, nothing. I started the Effexor a little over a year ago and it has made a tremendous difference. I've had to make some adjustments but now I couldn't imagine life without it. Xanax probably wouldn't do much for you, though it might help to settle down some of the hyperness caused by your prednisone. I do also have some Ativan (wiich is similar) for the tight chest, can't breathe, Alien chest burster feeling I still get sometimes when I get worked up, usually when talking about how screwed up my PCa treatment had been, but TBH what the Ativan does is make me very sleepy much earlier than usual and I sleep thru movies or miss our favorite TV shows. Xanax and Ativan can be habit forming so I use that only very rarely, but the Effexor must be taken every day. Once I was sick for a day and couldn't take it and started having withdrawal symptoms, so once you start taking it you're stuck with it for a while and it must eventually be tapered off. But it really has helped. It took a while to start working as it should, but has made me a much more pleasant person to be around.",

      "Content": "Good news is yours are all 3+4, which is better than 4+3. (3+3 is often a case of \"maybe\" treat, maybe not... though at your age, probably treat). Bad news is you have a lot of positive cores, but all on the left side, so I'm guessing the right side was negative. Looks like the higher concentrations are lateral and less medial. I'm not sure what that means. Also I don't know how to interpret the Partin tables. BTW the difference between 3+4 and 4+3 is the first number is the \"dominant\" pathology or most pervasive, the second number is the grade found to be less common.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by Nhlsir54 Yes I did R-CHOP... I thought having been through this that I would be prepared for the psychological part, but that has not been the case. I do know I had several people tell me not to do chemo. That it would kill me, not the cancer. I am trying to do as much research as possible but then it gets to be too much and I get discouraged. I also know from previous cancer how important a positive outlook is, and I believe you can make yourself sicker by your thoughts. I have learned a lot from time spent on this forum. I guess we are all scared of the unknown. Hi Jeff, I'm sorry that you have to go thru this again, but you have your head on straight and your wife is on board with you, so you are already way ahead of most others going into this. A good sense of humor, a good support network, and the self confidence of having previously survived another cancer will all make your journey thru prostate cancer much easier. As others have noted, yours is currently a rather innocuous form of PCa, and you certainly do have time to wait and see if it progresses any further. I know that once you've had cancer, anything that hurts sends your mind into the \"is it coming back\" tailspin. So the best I can say at this point is, don't worry too much about it. But beware of taking it too lightly. My Urologist kept me in the dark for several years, during which time my cancer progressed to the point where it became \"very high risk\" and required multiple follow up procedures over the past eighteen months. In a significant number of cases, once the prostate has been removed and examined in the pathology lab, additional tumors are found, and in some cases worse or much worse. Fortunately your PSA is relatively low, though a bit on the high side given your age. BTW my wife was diagnosed with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma one year ago just before Christmas. It was a crazy time for us both, and very stressful for me as this happened right in the midst of my own cancer treatment. Additionally I became very concerned while she underwent R-CHOP as she started watching toxic online videos about how (as you mentioned) chemo would kill her rather than the cancer. We are both still bombarded by anecdotal tales of miracle cures and how we not only caused our own cancers by eating wrong, but can cured be by eating differently. In the end, she also required only six of eight infusions, plus - as she had spinal tumors, also had a radiation boost and needed spinal injections following each infusion. If you have the time you may want to read our blog linked at the bottom of my sig, or at least the first and last chapters. Yes, you can drive yourself nuts doing TOO much online research. Both my wife and I have really had to dial it back lately. If anything, our cancers have brought my wife and I even closer than ever. You are very fortunate to have a head start on your PCa and a very understanding wife. You are a champ for what you have been thru already and I'm sure you will breeze thru this one with flying colors. Good luck!",

      "Content": "Do not despair. I was G8 also, but with six positive cores - two of them 100%, and my PSA was 25, five months before surgery. Currently there is no evidence of disease, though I cannot be sure until after the HT has worn off in a couple of years. It has been a struggle, but it can be beaten. The scans will not eliminate the possibility of spread, as they are not that sensitive. But they will pick up if your case is seriously advanced. But I believe you are probably safe. Good luck with your path results.",

      "Content": "Keto, you are now right on the precipice of metastasis. The next step after stage 3B is stage 4, distant metastasis. As you know, stage 3B means that the cancer has spread outside the prostate and their first stop is the seminal vesicles. This is referred to as \"locally advanced\". From the SV's, the cancer cells typically travel into the lymphatic system and spread to distant areas of the body, or they grow into the nearby pelvic bones, spine and thigh bones. At that point there is basically no treatment to halt the cancer's progress into vital organs and eventual death. Hormone therapy (ADT) does not kill cancer cells. It deprives the cancer of the testosterone that it feeds on and slows it's growth. Additionally it weakens the cancer and makes it more susceptible to cell death by radiation. Radiation kills cancer cells. HT does not. It just keeps it from growing. Once cancer has left the prostate bed and begun to spread into other areas of the body, the only treatment is cytoxic chemotherapy. As I understand it, it's the worst. And again, it does not stop the cancer, but just slows it down. Basically, if you are stage T3B and do not proceed with salvage or adjuvant radiation, your cancer will likely continue to grow. It is not a certainty, but is highly likely. I just recently finished radiation, had prostatectomy sixteen months ago and have been on HT for a year. I was one of the lucky ones. My latest PSA came back at 0.00, primarily due to my two months of daily radiation. Radiation is the only treatment that actually kills prostate cancer cells, as far as I know. The prospect of eventually developing bone metastasis really, really scared me. I think that you should throw every treatment possible at your cancer. Beat it while it's down, and knock it out for good.",

Now that I go back and read what I just posted, I probably did overdo the whole \"innocent\" thing. Overly dramatic. Damn... wish I wasn't such a gurl. And I really wasn't thinking \"non-aggressive\" as a type of cancer, just early stage. I'm not very good with terminology. Originally Posted by MichiganMan16 when did your cancer become metastatic? In all your previous posts, u list yourself as pT3b NO? True, a G8 is aggressive... And it looks like I did the same thing with metastatic. I mean it has spread. I thought that's what it meant. Again, my bad. Foot in mouth. Guess I should keep a medical dictionary at hand when I post. Or just become a lurker. Or stick to talking about incontinence... that's something I'm getting to know very well. Again, sorry, no ill will intended. I really do appreciate the interaction with everyone here, but the last few days it seems there must be a disturbance in the force or something. I will try to avoid throwing around words I don't really know the exact meaning of (of which I do not know the exact meaning?)",

      "Content": "Surgery is often chosen by those who are on the younger side and in generally good health, with less aggressive PCa (lower Gleason scores), where radiation tends to be chosen by older men who may have a problem with surgery, such as other health problems. Each case is different and there are ARDENT supporters and haters of both surgery and radiation. If you were twenty years older then either radiation or simply doing nothing would be an obvious choice. Side effects from surgery generally are experienced right away and improve over time. SE's from radiation often do not appear until years later. The main advantage of surgery is that the doctor actually examines the prostate and surrounding tissues. Radiation is administered based on external scans, which I call \"shooting in the dark\". I had a more aggressive prostate cancer, had surgery followed by radiation a year later. I have suffered what are probably the worst side effects of both, but if I could go back I would not change my choice. I'm assuming you had R-CHOP for your NHL. Be aware that in the case of PCa, chemo is generally reserved for advanced metastatic PCa and is in effect one of the \"last resort\" treatments. Good luck in what comes. Be sure that you speak with or correspond with several older men who had radiation ten years or so ago before choosing. Opponents of surgery usually speak of the \"advances\" in radiation over the past decade, but still there are NO men who survived twenty or more years after having had radiation within the past ten years.

      "Content": "Recently I made a simple remark regarding HT in another thread. Then another user asked that I cite \"specific research\" to support my statement. But since my remark was based only on personal experience, I have no such research. And since I do not wish to further hijack the original thread I will continue the story here in a new thread. It is a long story which I still do not fully understand. Several years ago it was discovered that my PSA had jumped from 4 to 9. DRE's were negative as was the first biopsy, but the PSA continued to rise. When I asked the doctor what was next he said another biopsy. I asked \"and if that is also negative then what\" and he said medicine. I asked what kind of medicine and he said a series of injections to lower my PSA. Although there was no mention of hormones in general or ADT in particular, in retrospect it now sounds to me a lot like HT. From that experience I was under the impression that HT could possibly be used as a first line of defense. Jump to the present. The second biopsy revealed what was characterized as aggressive prostate cancer, and the choices I was given were surgery or radiation and possibly both. Last Friday night, a newbie posted a couple questions as he was facing his first biopsy. I replied with a paragraph about my biopsy and added a couple lines that he may face surgery or radiation, and that some cancers can be treated with hormone injections. Again, all based solely on assumptions from my own personal experiences. So the next morning, this other user states that he has consulted with top experts and had never heard of such a thing. He seemed to be demanding that I cite references to back up my claim. I felt like a school kid being told to \"show your work\". Now please realize that I am a simple man who has been thrown into this whole PCa thing seemingly over night. I reacted emotionally. I certainly have no research behind my innocent comment, only supposition. But what he then said seemed to contradict my only experience. He said that HT is used only to treat advanced cancer that is beyond surgery or radiation... if I am recalling this correctly, that it is essentially the last line of defense. But I had been told by my Uro that my early cancer could have been treated with a series of injections before it was discovered to be both aggressive and metastatic, but now it can only be treated with a combination of both surgery and radiation. I have since apologized to the other poster by PM. I have also read thru the HT sticky and found that many there have had HT following surgery and/or radiation to lower their PSA. I am aware of the drastic side effects of HT and do not intend to diminish that. I also realize that since my post op PSA so far is undetectable, HT would not be of any benefit at this stage. As much as I just want to put this whole thing behind me, I am curious and need to ask those in the know... is HT only for end stage PC which cannot be treated by surgery or radiation, or can it also be used in the early stages of cancer prior to surgery or RT? Or is it something else? Thanks for any input. My story is even longer but I've tried to keep it relatively short here. Please forgive my naivety if I may have unwittingly stepped on any toes.",

      "Content": "I noticed the common Tewari link as well. As mentioned in other threads, it's usually the top surgeons who get the most difficult cases. Not that these cases appeared to be all that complicated at the outset... But I have noticed, reading various forums, that it seems to be the guys who had a good prognosis going in who seem to be more likely to develop BR some years later. And as I've mentioned elsewhere, I (and guys like me) had the advantage going into treatment that I was high risk with known adverse pathology and would require further treatment. I didn't know what all would be involved, but all the docs agreed that surgery would most likely be the beginning rather than the end of my treatments. Originally Posted by Another I picked surgery so I have the opportunity of treating recurrence with radiation. Yuppers. The fact that surgery left me impotent and incontinent are but minor casualties in the battle against a potentially devastating disease. On that other forum, guys are often asked \"why surgery? why not just go straight with primary radiation? Go Brachy! Go HDR! Rah rah proton and SBRT!\" Why, is because I plan to live another ten or twenty years, and already have enough bowel and bladder problems. I have a friend fifteen years my senior who had RP+RT when he was my age and his PSA is zero. He hit it with everything possible, and I am doing the same. If doc tells me someday that I need chemo, then I'm doing chemo. No hesitation.",

      "Content": "Okay, I just googled cancer stages and found the TMB scale, and I see that stage 4 is called distant metastasis (thank goodness for spell check... I misspell it every time). Stage 3 is \"spread to local tissues\". That's what I have, and I did not intend to make it anything more than that. Not to throw out the newbie thing again, but I have pretty much had to figure this stuff out myself. I had the original pathology report from the biopsy that had the percents and cores, but after that I've been on my own to find out what I can. It has been just five months since my first diagnosis. Then just before we moved (the last time I saw my Urologist) he mentioned that I will need radiation in six months because the cancer had spread into both seminal vesicles and I am T3B. I added the N0 myself after reading up on SVI. That's when I learned that means I have an 80% chance of surviving ten years. I try to not let that get me down... that's a one in five chance of never seeing 75. Okay, I'm getting dramatic again. Anyway, the whole HT thing came about because all the time that my previous Urologist was watchfully waiting or whatever, the cancer was growing inside me, and I am more than just a little pissed about that. Hopefully I haven't said \"too much\" once again... like Trump's midnight tweets.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by ASAdvocate Your original (well-intended, innocent) statement did state \"non-aggressive\". That's where the challenge came from. Now that I go back and read what I just posted, I probably did overdo the whole \"innocent\" thing. Overly dramatic. Damn... wish I wasn't such a gurl. And I really wasn't thinking \"non-aggressive\" as a type of cancer, just early stage. I'm not very good with terminology. Originally Posted by MichiganMan16 when did your cancer become metastatic? In all your previous posts, u list yourself as pT3b NO? True, a G8 is aggressive... And it looks like I did the same thing with metastatic. I mean it has spread. I thought that's what it meant. Again, my bad. Foot in mouth. Guess I should keep a medical dictionary at hand when I post. Or just become a lurker. Or stick to talking about incontinence... that's something I'm getting to know very well. Again, sorry, no ill will intended. I really do appreciate the interaction with everyone here, but the last few days it seems there must be a disturbance in the force or something. I will try to avoid throwing around words I don't really know the exact meaning of (of which I do not know the exact meaning?)",

Currently there is no evidence of disease, though I cannot be sure until after the HT has worn off in a couple of years. It has been a struggle, but it can be beaten. The scans will not eliminate the possibility of spread, as they are not that sensitive. But they will pick up if your case is seriously advanced. But I believe you are probably safe.

      "Content": "Do not despair. I was G8 also, but with six positive cores - two of them 100%, and my PSA was 25, five months before surgery. Currently there is no evidence of disease, though I cannot be sure until after the HT has worn off in a couple of years. It has been a struggle, but it can be beaten. The scans will not eliminate the possibility of spread, as they are not that sensitive. But they will pick up if your case is seriously advanced. But I believe you are probably safe. Good luck with your path results.",

I fully understand many of the questions you are now asking yourself about what you perhaps could or should have done differently. That is part of grieving. Do not allow yourself to feel guilty about anything. You did the best you could at each stage, making decisions that you felt were in his best interest, hoping that perhaps you could keep him with you for a little longer. I went thru the same thing with my mother five years ago. Should we have subjected her to so many treatments, and did that just increase her suffering? In the end, it came down to the fact that we were not aware just how fast she was going. Had we known it was only a matter of months, we probably would have spared her the pain of trying to keep her alive. No one knows. But we cannot go back and change any of it. And I am certain that she knew we were in a difficult situation also. Thirty years ago, it was my father. I did not realize until much later that he had been trying to say goodbye to me. I totally missed it. Two weeks later, he was gone. And your dad also likely knew that you were trying to spare yourself the agony of losing him. It's only natural. Hopefully in his final moments he could feel all the love you had given him.",

      "Content": "Just when I thought I was beginning to understand the answers, they change the questions. Following RP my Urologist informed me that I was T3b because the cancer had invaded both seminal vesicles. Examining the path report myself I noticed mention of 6mm extraprostatic extension (about 1/4 inch). I was researching the difference (if any) between extraprostatic and extracapsular extension, when I stumbled upon the following listed for stage 3 PCa: T3a: The tumor has extended outside of the prostate on one side. T3b: The tumor has extended outside of the prostate on both sides. T3c: The tumor has invaded one or both of the seminal vesicles, which are small bag-like organs near the bladder. Now, I had never heard of T3c before. The website seems targeted more for patients and less for MD's or pathologists (which I would trust more but understand less) so I'm guessing it's just inaccurate. The link is here: cancerconnect.com/stage-iii-c-prostate-cancer ... or is this something new? BTW and FWIW I think I suffered my first restless sleep/night sweats/hot flashes last night since the six month Lupron injection exactly three weeks ago. I was up every hour to pee (nighttime is the only break I get from constantly wearing either padding or plumbing) so that too was unusual. Most nights I only get up once, if at all, to void. Very unusual. I'm hoping it had more to do with yesterday's Chinese dinner rather than the Lupron. Hang in there everyone. Remember, I'm pulling for you. We're all in this together!",

      "Content": "Thanks Jamie. Just today I was trying to remember when my last PSA blood draw was, which seemed like it was just a few weeks ago. Then I realized that the entire month of December was missing from my total recall. It's no wonder. From my wife's first order for an MRI on the 2nd to her emergency eye surgery on the 28th, I spent most of the month of December driving her back and forth to various medical facilities. I barely had time to post in this forum, other than an occasional mention of the latest news on her status. We did nothing for New Years, just split some champagne. Our older son just returned from Iraq and is spending a few days with us. This morning I actually had time to leave notes in a couple threads here, then today we finally saw Rogue One together... I instinctively ordered 3D tickets then realized that my wife would be unable to see half of what was going on (still enjoyed it in 2D). Monday I see the R/O about my SRT and Tuesday my wife has her second round of chemo. We've already been shopping for caps and wigs. Wednesday back to the eye Dr... then maybe a chance to catch my breath!",

      "Content": "Recently I made a simple remark regarding HT in another thread. Then another user asked that I cite \"specific research\" to support my statement. But since my remark was based only on personal experience, I have no such research. And since I do not wish to further hijack the original thread I will continue the story here in a new thread. It is a long story which I still do not fully understand. Several years ago it was discovered that my PSA had jumped from 4 to 9. DRE's were negative as was the first biopsy, but the PSA continued to rise. When I asked the doctor what was next he said another biopsy. I asked \"and if that is also negative then what\" and he said medicine. I asked what kind of medicine and he said a series of injections to lower my PSA. Although there was no mention of hormones in general or ADT in particular, in retrospect it now sounds to me a lot like HT. From that experience I was under the impression that HT could possibly be used as a first line of defense. Jump to the present. The second biopsy revealed what was characterized as aggressive prostate cancer, and the choices I was given were surgery or radiation and possibly both. Last Friday night, a newbie posted a couple questions as he was facing his first biopsy. I replied with a paragraph about my biopsy and added a couple lines that he may face surgery or radiation, and that some cancers can be treated with hormone injections. Again, all based solely on assumptions from my own personal experiences. So the next morning, this other user states that he has consulted with top experts and had never heard of such a thing. He seemed to be demanding that I cite references to back up my claim. I felt like a school kid being told to \"show your work\". Now please realize that I am a simple man who has been thrown into this whole PCa thing seemingly over night. I reacted emotionally. I certainly have no research behind my innocent comment, only supposition. But what he then said seemed to contradict my only experience. He said that HT is used only to treat advanced cancer that is beyond surgery or radiation... if I am recalling this correctly, that it is essentially the last line of defense. But I had been told by my Uro that my early cancer could have been treated with a series of injections before it was discovered to be both aggressive and metastatic, but now it can only be treated with a combination of both surgery and radiation. I have since apologized to the other poster by PM. I have also read thru the HT sticky and found that many there have had HT following surgery and/or radiation to lower their PSA. I am aware of the drastic side effects of HT and do not intend to diminish that. I also realize that since my post op PSA so far is undetectable, HT would not be of any benefit at this stage. As much as I just want to put this whole thing behind me, I am curious and need to ask those in the know... is HT only for end stage PC which cannot be treated by surgery or radiation, or can it also be used in the early stages of cancer prior to surgery or RT? Or is it something else? Thanks for any input. My story is even longer but I've tried to keep it relatively short here. Please forgive my naivety if I may have unwittingly stepped on any toes.",

      "Content": "Okay, I just googled cancer stages and found the TMB scale, and I see that stage 4 is called distant metastasis (thank goodness for spell check... I misspell it every time). Stage 3 is \"spread to local tissues\". That's what I have, and I did not intend to make it anything more than that. Not to throw out the newbie thing again, but I have pretty much had to figure this stuff out myself. I had the original pathology report from the biopsy that had the percents and cores, but after that I've been on my own to find out what I can. It has been just five months since my first diagnosis. Then just before we moved (the last time I saw my Urologist) he mentioned that I will need radiation in six months because the cancer had spread into both seminal vesicles and I am T3B. I added the N0 myself after reading up on SVI. That's when I learned that means I have an 80% chance of surviving ten years. I try to not let that get me down... that's a one in five chance of never seeing 75. Okay, I'm getting dramatic again. Anyway, the whole HT thing came about because all the time that my previous Urologist was watchfully waiting or whatever, the cancer was growing inside me, and I am more than just a little pissed about that. Hopefully I haven't said \"too much\" once again... like Trump's midnight tweets.",

Most interesting is the one 3\" horizontal scar from my RP just above my naval which is now crossed by a 7\" vertical scar from a recent bowel resection, so there is now a giant cross on my belly... and I'm not even catholic!

      "Content": "Originally Posted by MrEd I am married, grown kids and just retired on Monday, Been planned for 6 months. Welcome Ed to the club that no one wants to be a member of. The advantages of surgery are that the entire prostate can be dissected and analyzed after removal, and if extraprostatic extension is identified you have the backup option of radiation. My PCa hit me also just as my wife and I were in the midst of fulfilling our retirement plans. In fact, one of the big reasons for going with surgery rather than radiation (in addition to those above) is that I did not have two months to undergo daily radiation. Yes, it could have been worked in, but was not practical. In fact, my RALP was right after we had driven a large Uhaul to Florida, unpacked and flew back to Ohio the very weekend before surgery. Less than two months later, it was no longer our home and we were back in Florida. Like yours, when my PSA hit 12 was when I became very concerned. Plus I had a couple of (4+3) cores that were later elevated to G8 post-op. I'm telling you this because it is not uncommon for the grade of cancer in the prostate to be higher than was indicated in the biopsy, so don't be surprised. There are a few of us here with a similar experience. Good luck in your treatment and recovery!",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by Kim McComas Dr said my husbands PSA levels was 95.3 and that's sky high... He has a lot of test coming up. I'm worried I was reading with levels that high it possibly spread. Yes, that is sky high, probably too high to be caused by an infection or anything other than cancer. You have every reason to be worried... However, it is most likely still treatable. The tests will include a bone scan to determine if it has spread to his bones (worst case) and an MRI to identify the size and location of his tumor, which will most likely lead to a biopsy. Most if not all of us here (those of us who are cancer patients, not relatives of a patient such as yourself) started with out with the biopsy. Then the urologist will offer recommendations depending on the extent of your husband's disease, his age and his general health... surgery, radiation, chemo. Some PSA's have been measured in the hundreds... guys who are alive and posting here regularly, so do not be alarmed. The road ahead will be rough on both of you, but in all likelihood there is a favorable outcome in the end. Good luck, and keep us posted.

I fully understand many of the questions you are now asking yourself about what you perhaps could or should have done differently. That is part of grieving. Do not allow yourself to feel guilty about anything. You did the best you could at each stage, making decisions that you felt were in his best interest, hoping that perhaps you could keep him with you for a little longer. I went thru the same thing with my mother five years ago. Should we have subjected her to so many treatments, and did that just increase her suffering? In the end, it came down to the fact that we were not aware just how fast she was going. Had we known it was only a matter of months, we probably would have spared her the pain of trying to keep her alive. No one knows. But we cannot go back and change any of it. And I am certain that she knew we were in a difficult situation also. Thirty years ago, it was my father. I did not realize until much later that he had been trying to say goodbye to me. I totally missed it. Two weeks later, he was gone. And your dad also likely knew that you were trying to spare yourself the agony of losing him. It's only natural.

      "Content": "Originally Posted by Kim McComas Dr said my husbands PSA levels was 95.3 and that's sky high... He has a lot of test coming up. I'm worried I was reading with levels that high it possibly spread. Yes, that is sky high, probably too high to be caused by an infection or anything other than cancer. You have every reason to be worried... However, it is most likely still treatable. The tests will include a bone scan to determine if it has spread to his bones (worst case) and an MRI to identify the size and location of his tumor, which will most likely lead to a biopsy. Most if not all of us here (those of us who are cancer patients, not relatives of a patient such as yourself) started with out with the biopsy. Then the urologist will offer recommendations depending on the extent of your husband's disease, his age and his general health... surgery, radiation, chemo. Some PSA's have been measured in the hundreds... guys who are alive and posting here regularly, so do not be alarmed. The road ahead will be rough on both of you, but in all likelihood there is a favorable outcome in the end. Good luck, and keep us posted. The more information you can provide, the better support we - those of us here, will be able to provide.",

Fourth of July - had the MRI and biopsy in June and got the bad new on July 5th. August - okay, no holiday, but my wife and I drove a Uhaul full of stuff back to Florida. Labor Day - flew back to Ohio three days before the RALP surgery Halloween - two months post op, the house is sold and we drive back to Florida, and by the way, I'll need SRT Thanksgiving - wife's back pain getting much worse. Got an MRI the following week. December - all hell breaks lose. Tumor on her spine. Admitted to hospital. Final Dx lymphoma (DLCBL) Christmas - radiation and first chemo done, back home late night before Xmas eve, slept like a log! Day after Christmas - she noticed visual changes, rush to ophthalmologist, emergency eye surgery on Wed New Year Eve - what a month.

      "Content": "Originally Posted by Ready2Fight My prayers for the best possible health for both you and your wife in 2017! Thank you for helping others by contributing so much to this forum even while dealing with these serious health issues. Hang in there, you're truly an inspiration! Thank you so much for your kind words. Some people always know just the right thing to say, though I am not so fortunate. But one thing I learned about ten years ago after a serious leg injury is that visiting forums such as this and reading about other peoples' problems make one realize that our own problems are relatively small. What I mean is no matter how bad our situation is, there are always others who have it much worse. So therefore I generally feel that, if you have to have something wrong, may it be something that is commonly known and readily treatable. Sometimes stuff happens to us that is just nature's way of letting us know it's time to slow down or just to remind us that we are not invulnerable. Reading about others who have SERIOUS health issues can make us realize just how fortunate we are.",

I can hold it until I can get to the bathroom, and then have a good stream. Sounds good right? Well, during the day time when I'm standing or sometimes if I stand up from sitting, the pee just runs out of me and soaks whatever pad I am wearing. I don't even feel it until several seconds into the stream. When I'm sitting I feel like I have to pee, so I go into the bathroom but can't go. So as soon as I pull up my underpants, I squirt. It drives me nuts. But I have read some others have similar sensations so I don't worry. My Uro said it's typically 6-12 months to regain control. I just remember how far I've gone since the weeks immediately following surgery.",

      "Content": "The USPSTF recommendations published in 2012 apparently led to many men developing advanced prostate cancer which could have been successfully treated early on, because they exhibited steadily rising PSA's but showed no other symptoms... myself being one of them. Oddly enough, had my tumor been located a bit lower in the prostate it might have presented to a DRE and all would have been good. However, because only about one third of the prostate can be approached by DRE or by TRUS biopsy, a significant number of cancers went undetected over the past five years. This was recently discussed here in another thread... https://www.cancerforums.net/threads/54538-PSA-testing-change-2017. Bottom line, when doctors stop testing for a certain disease, then the number of reported cases will decline. And that's exactly what happened, thereby legitimizing that panel's recommendations. The blowback is that there are now even more men with advanced and in some cases untreatable cancer. It's a good thing you got that \"accidental\" PSA test, which probably saved your life. This eats away at me every time I think about it, and it has been difficult to accept what happened. It still burns me up when I read about the alleged \"overtreatment\" of prostate cancer. Personally I would rather be free of cancer rather than being told that it was better to just live with it. Apparently there was a very vocal group who felt they had been somehow wronged by doctors who they believed had performed unnecessary surgery. At some point I gotta stop posting in threads like this. It ain't helping. Maybe a Xanax will.",

I just learned about this myself recently, and as I still have only partial bladder control and have had zero erections since surgery ten weeks ago, I definitely hope to postpone RT until those issues have improved, at least the incontinence. Try to find a RO who has access to a newer LINAC, the machine that will be used to deliver the radiation..The newer equipment has made big advances over the older machines and they do a much better job especially when it comes to avoiding damage to healthy tissue...I would insist on a Varian Rapid-Arc or newer....it costs no more... Thanks for the info on this. I have my first consult with a RO coming soon and will try to remember to inquire about the equipment he has in his arsenal.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by mikesimm I had surgery Oct. 23... with a tumor located extensively in the apex and base. Invasion of both seminal vesicals, perivesicular soft tissue, and microscopic bladder neck invasion. Clear margins. No lymph node or other involvement. Staged at pT3b. Considering the extent of all that, I was fully expecting to go in and learn about my future treatment plan (radiation, hormone therapy, etc.). Turns out, my PSA on that same day was \"undetectable\". So the news was... \"come back in six months\". I was kinda shocked, but thrilled, of course. I asked him about the ultra-sensitive PSA testing - he's not a fan, saying it just causes unnecessary worry... Congrats on getting thru the surgery and your first follow up, and though your abdominal pain is unfortunate, it sounds like that is clearing up with time. So set your mind at ease for now and relax during your recovery and focus on regaining your continence. But I must say (doing my best Ed Grimley impersonation) that your initial expectations are probably accurate, given that SVI and your T3B staging always qualify as 'adverse pathology' and automatically justify adjuvant radiation and probably also hormone deprivation therapy within your first year post-op and preferably as soon as you have regained continence. My surgeon was also \"not a fan\" of ultra sensitive PSA and informed me on my first post-op that my PSA was \"undetectable\", but he also informed me immediately after surgery of the implications of SVI and the need for RT in about six months post-op. I suspect that your surgeon will likely be more forthcoming with this information at your next follow up in six months. Given your relatively low pre-op PSA there is probably little reason to be concerned at this point, and likely no cause to jump into early RT. But your Uro would be wise to proceed with ART before your PSA begins to rise, as opposed to waiting for some threshold to trigger salvage radiation. SVI is serious business and T3B is considered \"very high risk\" and is the final stage before bone metastasis, at which point PCa evolves into an entirely different disease. Again, good luck in your continued recovery, but don't let the wild horses get away from you. Just sayin'.",

      "Content": "Ken, sorry to hear the news, but then again it wasn't totally unexpected. This is the moment you've been anticipating for about as long as I've known you on this forum. Whatever the rate of rise might be, it's definitely rising, and there's no two ways about that. At this low level it's probably better that you forego ADT anyway for the sake of your own comfort as well as not introducing yet another delay into your SRT schedule, as they generally like two months of HT before starting RT. Also this way you'll be saving HT as an extra round in the clip to pull out if you need more heavy armaments later on. Remember that the RT will continue killing cancer cells for eight months or so after treatment ends, so it will be a while before you'll get an accurate PSA again. And good for you for rejecting getting involved in any trendy RT delivery techniques. Stick with what works. And good luck!",

      "Content": "Last week had my third uPSA since completing ART and was thrilled (no, shocked) that all three came back as 0.0 ... Per another thread that was Quest so I wonder if that was actually \"<0.02\"?? ... But I won't be looking this gift horse in the mouth! So now we move to six month testing, but since my testosterone is only nine (yes, that's 009) my Uro said that it's unlikely much will have changed by then. And with this being my 999th post on this forum, what could be more fitting than rolling the odometer over to three zeroes in a row? Hopefully as the Lupron wears off I may regain some semblance of brain power once again. But I'm pretty sure that my little head (you know, the second head that controls us guys) is probably down for the count. But where one door closes, another opens. Last October after completing RT I had an MRI that was inconclusive after an ENT had found a mass in my throat. One thing led to another and I had nasopharyngeal surgery in April, after which he said he \"couldn't get to it\" (this just keeps getting better). So as mentioned in another forum I started prednisone yesterday and am having a CT tomorrow. Not sure where this may lead but it's fairly safe to assume it's NOT cancer. I do appreciate the well wishes I've had from everyone. At least I won't be worrying about PCa for a long while.",

      "Content": "Welcome to the club BH. Your PSA of 9 is high, and 14 is very high, especially for a man your age. Had you had any previous PSA tests? I know they usually don't bother until around age 50. Note the PSA measures prostate inflammation, and is not a cancer test. It is possible, though unlikely, that your PSA is elevated due to an infection or perhaps sexual activity or strenuous exercise. But it is good that you are getting the biopsy. But there's one thing you need to be aware of, and depending on your doctor, your urologist may never tell you this (mine didn't). If your biopsy is 'negative', it does NOT mean that you do NOT have cancer. The biopsy is a flawed test where the urologist essentially closes his eyes and pokes needles into you, hoping to hit something if it's in there. So you will need to be your own advocate if your urologist seems to be unconcerned about your condition. Feel free to some back here and ask questions anytime. And good luck to you!",

      "Content": "Welcome to the club BH. Your PSA of 9 is high, and 14 is very high, especially for a man your age. Had you had any previous PSA tests? I know they usually don't bother until around age 50. Note the PSA measures prostate inflammation, and is not a cancer test. It is possible, though unlikely, that your PSA is elevated due to an infection or perhaps sexual activity or strenuous exercise. But it is good that you are getting the biopsy. But there's one thing you need to be aware of, and depending on your doctor, your urologist may never tell you this (mine didn't). If your biopsy is 'negative', it does NOT mean that you do NOT have cancer. The biopsy is a flawed test where the urologist essentially closes his eyes and pokes needles into you, hoping to hit something if it's in there. So you will need to be your own advocate if your urologist seems to be unconcerned about your condition. Feel free to some back here and ask questions anytime. And good luck to you!",

      "Content": "Last week had my third uPSA since completing ART and was thrilled (no, shocked) that all three came back as 0.0 ... Per another thread that was Quest so I wonder if that was actually \"<0.02\"?? ... But I won't be looking this gift horse in the mouth! So now we move to six month testing, but since my testosterone is only nine (yes, that's 009) my Uro said that it's unlikely much will have changed by then. And with this being my 999th post on this forum, what could be more fitting than rolling the odometer over to three zeroes in a row? Hopefully as the Lupron wears off I may regain some semblance of brain power once again. But I'm pretty sure that my little head (you know, the second head that controls us guys) is probably down for the count. But where one door closes, another opens. Last October after completing RT I had an MRI that was inconclusive after an ENT had found a mass in my throat. One thing led to another and I had nasopharyngeal surgery in April, after which he said he \"couldn't get to it\" (this just keeps getting better). So as mentioned in another forum I started prednisone yesterday and am having a CT tomorrow. Not sure where this may lead but it's fairly safe to assume it's NOT cancer. I do appreciate the well wishes I've had from everyone. At least I won't be worrying about PCa for a long while.",

Whatever the rate of rise might be, it's definitely rising, and there's no two ways about that. At this low level it's probably better that you forego ADT anyway for the sake of your own comfort as well as not introducing yet another delay into your SRT schedule, as they generally like two months of HT before starting RT. Also this way you'll be saving HT as an extra round in the clip to pull out if you need more heavy armaments later on. Remember that the RT will continue killing cancer cells for eight months or so after treatment ends, so it will be a while before you'll get an accurate PSA again. And good for you for rejecting getting involved in any trendy RT delivery techniques. Stick with what works. And good luck!",

I know they usually don't bother until around age 50. Note the PSA measures prostate inflammation, and is not a cancer test. It is possible, though unlikely, that your PSA is elevated due to an infection or perhaps sexual activity or strenuous exercise. But it is good that you are getting the biopsy. But there's one thing you need to be aware of, and depending on your doctor, your urologist may never tell you this (mine didn't). If your biopsy is 'negative', it does NOT mean that you do NOT have cancer. The biopsy is a flawed test where the urologist essentially closes his eyes and pokes needles into you, hoping to hit something if it's in there.

      "Content": "Originally Posted by HighlanderCFH The main thing to keep in mind is that the only current test that can officially diagnose prostate cancer is a biopsy. And, as you noted, even a biopsy can miss a tumor if the needle happens to shoot past it. This happens in over 20% of standard 12-core biopsies. That's what happened. My cancer probably could have been caught two years earlier. Originally Posted by IM Fletcher He wanted me to get a biopsy but I started asking more questions and he seemed concerned about possible infection due to my daily antibiotic, so he ordered an MRI (which was a fiasco due to insurance balking several times because, apparently, the \"protocol\" is to get one after a positive biopsy. Makes no sense to me ... First approach always seems to be infection. Apparently insurance will not pay for an MRI until after there has been a biopsy, even a negative one, I guess. In my wife's case, we paid CASH for the MRI that revealed her spinal tumor, bypassing the insurance, for expediency. Having that MRI in hand was indispensable when it came to getting treatment for her lymphoma. Originally Posted by IM Fletcher Bottom line, I'm learning, is that the prostate is one puzzling piece of work. There doesn't seem to be a definitive anything. Even a biopsy could miss cancer. Then, if you have cancer, there is no definitive on whether to treat or not. It's extremely frustrating. 'nuff said. Secondary question is about the three months. I know what I've read here and abound, but it goes against my rational thought to sit on things for three months. Why not check the PSA next week and see where it is? If (the big IF) I were to have it, couldn't it get worse or leave the prostate in three months time? At some point there has to be a line of demarcation in regards to metastasis, but there doesn't seem to be any sort of urgency when it comes to PC I think it's because any test is expensive, even a PSA test. Mine is checked every five weeks, but then I still have cancer. PCa does grow slowly. Some less common forms can progress rapidly, but for the more typical PCa, not much difference between a few weeks and a few months... imo, afaik. Unfortunate. Given how common PCa is, especially over age 60, you'd think there would be better screening.",
