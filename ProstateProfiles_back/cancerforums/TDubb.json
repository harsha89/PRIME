      "Content": "Hi All, I'm brand spankin' new here. Currently recovering from surgery (1 week), so haven't had a 3 mo PSA check yet. Got my post surgery pathology report today along with one catheter removal and approximately 20 - 25 staples. Moving slow, but on the mend. I am pleased with the outcome of my treatment decision to go with the Da Vinci Robotic Surgery. After research online and being fortunate to live in an area (Northern Virginia) with advanced medical technology, I found a great surgeon, Dr. Simon Chung, Urology. I'll be back checking in as my recovery continues. I've already found this site a wealth of information and appreciate living in a day and age where we have the world wide web. Best to All!",
