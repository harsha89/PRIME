The second and third week I was going through a bag of pads about every four days. Four to six weeks I was going through four pads a day. Two to three months I was down to one to two pads a day. I'm about one week from my four-month mark and have been pad free for about a week now. I know you're probably thinking that four months seems like a long time but it really does go by fast.

I've also read on here that some guys have had their prostates removed that were around the same size or bigger than mine. I feel like he is pushing me towards radiation but it will be my choice not his after I educate myself. Since he is just a urologist should I be seeking out an oncologist? I'm a little hesitant to start the HT but I'm guessing that I can stop it if it's not for me. I'm not really liking what I'm reading about it.

      "Content": "Hello all, I was told on Monday 6/02/14, that I have Prostate cancer. I stumbled onto this great forum just after I had my biopsy last week. I have learned so much from this forum. I want to thank all of you for that. Naturally I'm scared and lost right now. You all have helped me out more than you know. Then again we are all going through this, so I bet you all do know how much you help others. I thank God that He lead me to this forum. I have ordered Dr. Patrick Walsh's Guide to Surviving Prostate Cancer 3rd edition while I wait for the bones and pelvic scans that I had yesterday. My journey so far: I'm 46 years old, I am on hormone replacement therapy for low test, (testopil implants). I've also chewed tobacco for the last 30 years. I have never smoked. I don't drink alcohol, I was just never was in to drinking. Last year I had a PSA of 12.4 with discomfort in my lower abdomen / prostate area. My GP said it was prostatitis and gave me an antibiotic then sent me to a urologist. The urologist waited 4 months to check my PSA again stating that my PSA would still be elevated from the prostatitis. My PSA was at 11.6 after the 4 month wait. Then 4 months later it dropped again to 10.8. Then four months later it went back up to 11.2. I have had mild discomfort and pain in my lower abdomen on the left side off and on during this time. Since my PSA started going in the wrong direction, my urologist ordered a biopsy of the prostate and said my pain was from diverticulitis, so I had a CT scan of my lower abdominal area to make sure. They confirmed that I had diverticulitis. More antibiotics. It didn't really go away completely so the urologist sent me to a GI. GI ordered a colonoscopy. I'm waiting on the results from the colonoscopy on Thursday (6/12/14). The doctor called me this last Monday with the results of my biopsy. He told me that I had cancer and asked if I had any questions. I was stunned and shocked so I didn't at that time. Hind sight, I was a little mad that he didn't wait till my appointment later that day to tell me in person. I was knee deep with work at work when he called. He said that I would be getting a call back from his staff to schedule a bone and pelvic scan to see if the cancer has spread or if it is isolated to the prostate. After reading through this forum. I loaded myself up with questions and called the doctor back the next day for Induction, Gleason, Cores, prostate size etc..... I learned that the biopsy of the prostate showed 1 core of 12 that was taken to have cancer with a 35% induction. Gleason score 3+4=7. My prostate is 64.6cm. The doctor said that it should be 23cm for my age. At the time of the biopsy the doc said that the prostate felt good with no odd shapes, bumps, roughness nothing out of the ordinary. I also asked the doctor if he was going to take out my test implants or give me some kind of androgen blocker. I would have never have known to ask these questions if it wasn't for this forum. The doc said that he was going to start with the androgen blocker shots instead of taking out the implants. Implants last 4 months and I'm one month in on this set of implants. I also have started the process with quitting the tobacco. So now the waiting game again for all the tests to come back. I usually don't let things bother me but I know just enough that I am worrying about every little thing. For example, during the pelvic scan they took longer with the scan than I was told it would be. The operator of the scan said that they really focused on an area in question, my prostate. Is this what other here experienced? After the full body bone, scan they asked if I had played sports all my life and asked if I had arthritis. Also did anyone experience this? I feel stupid for asking but I had my biopsy 3 weeks ago and still have about 60% blood (brown) in my ejaculation. Can this spread cancer to my wife or other areas during sex? My biggest concern is that the cancer is not isolated to the prostate. I haven't been able to find much on here about prostate cancer that has spread to other areas and their success rates and treatments. A little feed back help that I can give others that have just found out that they have cancer ... Since I only got 30 minutes of sleep the first night after receiving the news, I asked my doctor for something to help me sleep through the night and they prescribed me Lorazepam 0.5mg. It has helped me to sleep the night through. Laying in bed with my mind racing was keeping me up. Sorry this is so long.",

      "Content": "Hello all, I was told on Monday 6/02/14, that I have Prostate cancer. I stumbled onto this great forum just after I had my biopsy last week. I have learned so much from this forum. I want to thank all of you for that. Naturally I'm scared and lost right now. You all have helped me out more than you know. Then again we are all going through this, so I bet you all do know how much you help others. I thank God that He lead me to this forum. I have ordered Dr. Patrick Walsh's Guide to Surviving Prostate Cancer 3rd edition while I wait for the bones and pelvic scans that I had yesterday. My journey so far: I'm 46 years old, I am on hormone replacement therapy for low test, (testopil implants). I've also chewed tobacco for the last 30 years. I have never smoked. I don't drink alcohol, I was just never was in to drinking. Last year I had a PSA of 12.4 with discomfort in my lower abdomen / prostate area. My GP said it was prostatitis and gave me an antibiotic then sent me to a urologist. The urologist waited 4 months to check my PSA again stating that my PSA would still be elevated from the prostatitis. My PSA was at 11.6 after the 4 month wait. Then 4 months later it dropped again to 10.8. Then four months later it went back up to 11.2. I have had mild discomfort and pain in my lower abdomen on the left side off and on during this time. Since my PSA started going in the wrong direction, my urologist ordered a biopsy of the prostate and said my pain was from diverticulitis, so I had a CT scan of my lower abdominal area to make sure. They confirmed that I had diverticulitis. More antibiotics. It didn't really go away completely so the urologist sent me to a GI. GI ordered a colonoscopy. I'm waiting on the results from the colonoscopy on Thursday (6/12/14). The doctor called me this last Monday with the results of my biopsy. He told me that I had cancer and asked if I had any questions. I was stunned and shocked so I didn't at that time. Hind sight, I was a little mad that he didn't wait till my appointment later that day to tell me in person. I was knee deep with work at work when he called. He said that I would be getting a call back from his staff to schedule a bone and pelvic scan to see if the cancer has spread or if it is isolated to the prostate. After reading through this forum. I loaded myself up with questions and called the doctor back the next day for Induction, Gleason, Cores, prostate size etc..... I learned that the biopsy of the prostate showed 1 core of 12 that was taken to have cancer with a 35% induction. Gleason score 3+4=7. My prostate is 64.6cm. The doctor said that it should be 23cm for my age. At the time of the biopsy the doc said that the prostate felt good with no odd shapes, bumps, roughness nothing out of the ordinary. I also asked the doctor if he was going to take out my test implants or give me some kind of androgen blocker. I would have never have known to ask these questions if it wasn't for this forum. The doc said that he was going to start with the androgen blocker shots instead of taking out the implants. Implants last 4 months and I'm one month in on this set of implants. I also have started the process with quitting the tobacco. So now the waiting game again for all the tests to come back. I usually don't let things bother me but I know just enough that I am worrying about every little thing. For example, during the pelvic scan they took longer with the scan than I was told it would be. The operator of the scan said that they really focused on an area in question, my prostate. Is this what other here experienced? After the full body bone, scan they asked if I had played sports all my life and asked if I had arthritis. Also did anyone experience this? I feel stupid for asking but I had my biopsy 3 weeks ago and still have about 60% blood (brown) in my ejaculation. Can this spread cancer to my wife or other areas during sex? My biggest concern is that the cancer is not isolated to the prostate. I haven't been able to find much on here about prostate cancer that has spread to other areas and their success rates and treatments. A little feed back help that I can give others that have just found out that they have cancer ... Since I only got 30 minutes of sleep the first night after receiving the news, I asked my doctor for something to help me sleep through the night and they prescribed me Lorazepam 0.5mg. It has helped me to sleep the night through. Laying in bed with my mind racing was keeping me up. Sorry this is so long.",
