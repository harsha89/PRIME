    "Content": "I have a friend, about 50, who had a prostate operation using the da vinci machine. He eventually developed a hernia in the abdomen wall. The operation to fix it failed in that he developed a second hernia next to the original. Now he says they put a large screen in to shore up the muscle wall. He also claims to know of somebody who has had prostate surgery and is having similar problems. What I am wondering about is, aside from the surgical incisions, is there anything about prostrate surgery that makes hernias in the abdomen more likely to occur or less likely to heal?",
