      "Content": "I was weighing in at around 215 for the past several years. That is the hazard of being retired, I weighed 180 when I retired in 1996. Since that time I had the Di Vinci prostate surgery in 2013 but did not loose any weight afterward. Since then my biggest complaint was how my penis seemed to have shrunk and was hiding back in the sheath. It was not that way prior to the above surgery. Now moving up to this year, in January I suddenly had a heart attack followed by a quadruple bypass surgery. I am on a \"no or low salt diet\" and have really been watching what I eat with the help of my wife. I am now at 185 pounds, walking several miles a day and/or riding a bicycle every day. The benefit is my penis is back to where it used to be in length at the time I retired. I no longer feel the urge to pull it out of the sheath, it is all ready out. Also, it seems that it is harder when erect. So the bottom line here is, get in shape and loose weight. At least it is working for me!",

The surgeon that performed mine is very well known, performed many robotic surgeries and is also an instructor on the DaVinci. I was very comfortable with him, his staff, and the hospital facilities. The big plus for us is that it all was only about 60 miles away from our home. By all means, do your research, ask questions, and then decide who is best for you. Good luck with your decision.

If I use 1/2 a 100mg tab the effects are not to bad, but the erection results aren't as good either. Useable but not as good. Also before trying CLA I would want to run it by the doctor. Hard to tell what that stuff may be doing to you. For info. I also have tried Cialis and the side effects from that are worse than the Viagra. Just hoping things start waking up on their own pretty soon, I'm coming up on 2 years this month. Maybe once a month I may wake up with an erection, but just haven't been able to have one yet without a little help from the little blue pill.",

Make sure you have a good urologist that will explain all your options to you. In the end it is your decision as to what to do. Personally I opted for the Di-Vinci and am awaiting a surgery date at this time. This is not the end of life but the beginning of a new chapter. Good luck in your process.",

      "Content": "After reading some of the posts where things were not going as expected, I thought I would throw in my two cents worth. First let me say that I had Da-Vinci surgery and have really had no problems. The surgery went extremely well, and recovery was really easy for me. My wife is a retired assistant hospital administrator, so I did have a lot of advice from my wife and her past colleges when it came time to make my choice of treatments and what hospitals were the best choice. First, do your research, listen to the doctor and then get second and or third opinions prior to making your decision on what treatment you feel will be best for you. Second, research the hospital and the doctors that you will be dealing with. There is a lot of information out there just on the internet. Read past reviews, and visit the hospital. Ask questions of the doctors, nurses, and some of the volunteers that work in the hospital. You may be surprised on what you hear. Remember a hospital is full of germs. You want your stay to be as short as possible. I wish you all luck on whatever your decision may be. To check out a hospital go to this web site: http://www.leapfroggroup.org/cp Not every hospital will belong to this site, it is volunteer, however the better hospitals will belong to it. It helps them with their accreditation and certification. Another site is: https://www.facs.org/education/patie...-accreditation The above two sites will get you information that you need to make a decision. If you should find a hospital that is not accredited, don't walk away, RUN!",

The Viagra played havoc with my sinus and the Cialis made me ache all over and neither one gave a real good erection. The pump is kinda sorta a last resort. Like you I had a couple of hernias, but the surgeon fixed them with the robot while he was in there. Also he cleaned up scar tissue from prior surgeries. With that said, in the past 2 to 3 months everything has started working and now I don't need any meds or the pump. I'm 3+ years past the surgery and just glad things have started working like they should. So don't give up, there are a lot worse things that can happen.",

Sure I was given the options of radiation, seeds, etc. After doing some research and considering my age I felt removal was the way to go. We surely were not going to have any more kids at our age. After the surgery recovery is quick. A great benefit is you will go pee like you are 16 again. Sex is just as good or better. I have no regrets! This is my opinion, do your research on all the alternatives and then decide. Good Luck",

      "Content": "In ref. to you going to see Dr. Patel. I had my surgery one year ago with him, and all is well. In the material he gives out they will suggest a hotel that is just across the street from Celebration Hospital. It is VERY expensive to say the least. We stayed at The Clarion Suites Maingate @ 7888 W Irlo Bronson Hwy , Kissimmee, FL 34747. If interested, their phone number is: 1-800-780-5727. We found the hotel to be very nice and they gave us a little off the regular rate because we had told them I was having surgery at Celebration Hospital. If you do go there make sure you ask for a room on the first floor since your husband will probably not feel like going up or down the stairs. The hotel was approx 4 to 5 miles away from the hospital and it was an easy commute. We would stay there again if we are going to be in the area. They also have a continental breakfast. The hospital is great, I have been in several different hospitals, and this one was the best by far. If it is available after recovery ask for the bariatric room they have. I had to stay a couple of extra days to get some meds regulated and that was the room I was in. It has a separate kitchen with a small microwave, refrigerator, coffee and tea machine, big screen TV and even an electric fireplace. Also you or your husband can use a computer that is provided right from the room through the TV. My wife stayed in the room with me while I was there and the nurses took very good care of her also getting her anything she wanted. Your husband will be encouraged to walk as much as possible. It takes 13 laps around the hallways to make a mile. I was doing that the same day after surgery and continued doing it for the 3 days I was there. We then went back to the Clarion and stayed until my catheter was removed. If you have any questions don't hesitate to ask.",

      "Content": "This is my opinion. I didn't even consider any option except Da-Vinci surgery to the have prostate removed. Sure I was given the options of radiation, seeds, etc. After doing some research and considering my age I felt removal was the way to go. We surely were not going to have any more kids at our age. After the surgery recovery is quick. A great benefit is you will go pee like you are 16 again. Sex is just as good or better. I have no regrets! This is my opinion, do your research on all the alternatives and then decide. Good Luck",

      "Content": "In ref. to you going to see Dr. Patel. I had my surgery one year ago with him, and all is well. In the material he gives out they will suggest a hotel that is just across the street from Celebration Hospital. It is VERY expensive to say the least. We stayed at The Clarion Suites Maingate @ 7888 W Irlo Bronson Hwy , Kissimmee, FL 34747. If interested, their phone number is: 1-800-780-5727. We found the hotel to be very nice and they gave us a little off the regular rate because we had told them I was having surgery at Celebration Hospital. If you do go there make sure you ask for a room on the first floor since your husband will probably not feel like going up or down the stairs. The hotel was approx 4 to 5 miles away from the hospital and it was an easy commute. We would stay there again if we are going to be in the area. They also have a continental breakfast. The hospital is great, I have been in several different hospitals, and this one was the best by far. If it is available after recovery ask for the bariatric room they have. I had to stay a couple of extra days to get some meds regulated and that was the room I was in. It has a separate kitchen with a small microwave, refrigerator, coffee and tea machine, big screen TV and even an electric fireplace. Also you or your husband can use a computer that is provided right from the room through the TV. My wife stayed in the room with me while I was there and the nurses took very good care of her also getting her anything she wanted. Your husband will be encouraged to walk as much as possible. It takes 13 laps around the hallways to make a mile. I was doing that the same day after surgery and continued doing it for the 3 days I was there. We then went back to the Clarion and stayed until my catheter was removed. If you have any questions don't hesitate to ask.",

      "Content": "Since your husband is going to OSU hospital, who is his surgeon? If it is Dr. Vipul Patel, who was mine, he is an excellent surgeon as far as I am concerned. His main office is here in Celebration, FL but he also is an instructor and surgeon at OSU. By the way he had just went over 6,000 surgery's just prior to mine. My experience was nearly the same as Janei1's husband. Surgery was at 6 AM & I was up walking by noon. No pain meds needed either. Catheter was out 4 days after the surgery and around 7 to 8 weeks after the surgery I no longer needed Depends or pads. I wish your husband all the luck in the world. OSU is an excellent hospital and I'm sure all will go well.",

His main office is here in Celebration, FL but he also is an instructor and surgeon at OSU. By the way he had just went over 6,000 surgery's just prior to mine. My experience was nearly the same as Janei1's husband. Surgery was at 6 AM & I was up walking by noon. No pain meds needed either. Catheter was out 4 days after the surgery and around 7 to 8 weeks after the surgery I no longer needed Depends or pads. I wish your husband all the luck in the world. OSU is an excellent hospital and I'm sure all will go well.",

Basically, I think I started using it approx 2 weeks after surgery, twice a day for the first 3 months and then once a day. Did it help? I really don't think it did all that much. The little guy still kind of shrivels up shorter than it was before surgery. I can get an erection now at times on my own and other times the little blue pill gives me the boost I need. Of course some of that may be my age, as we all change as we get older. If it doesn't cost you anything or very little to get one I would do it.",

      "Content": "In my opinion I believe that any vitamin or supplement should be tested and controlled to be sure what you are actually getting and what it can actually provide. A couple of years ago a local TV station purchased a bunch of different vitamin's and supplements, took them to a lab for testing and the results were quite amazing. None, had the amount of what was claimed on the label, some had less and some had more. So taking supplements of any kind can cause side effects or harm at some point down the road. That being said, I still take vitamin C, Omega 3, and a multi-vitamin. I just have to hope it helps I guess. I will probably never really know if it contributed to my PC, but it's out and overwith now.",

However, less than a month ago my wife began getting a little frisky in bed one night and I said I would have to get up and take a pill. She said don't worry about it and we will just fool around a little. Well, after some coaxing on her part I had a usable erection. I was totally amazed since I have not woke up with an erection since meeting Mr. DaVinci. And just this morning I woke up with an erection. Keep in mind it has been over 3 years and I am now just getting the feelings back. So the moral of my story is to \"Never Give Up\"!",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by Pratoman Its possible that your insurance company wont approve it because you havent had the surgery yet. They might require the surgery be done. If not, then your Dr can work with them on appeal. Thats what happened for me, and i got approval for a year. Congratulations on making the decision, welcome to the forum, and good luck in your journey Same here. Insurance denied at first until the doctor called them and said it was \"medically necessary\". After that I had a years worth.",

      "Content": "The previous poster gave some good ideas and I just wanted to add a couple of suggestions also. You might try and do a search for zytiga financial assistance on Google. I just looked and a few sites came up. Also check with the American Cancer Society. Your doctor may have an idea. You also could check for clinical trials, but the downside to that is you don't know if you are getting a placebo or the actual meds. I would have thought that Medicaid would help, check with the local hospitals finance (billing) dept. It's a lot of paperwork to fill out, but may be worth it. I hope this all works out for you and your husband, best of luck to both of you.",

However, less than a month ago my wife began getting a little frisky in bed one night and I said I would have to get up and take a pill. She said don't worry about it and we will just fool around a little. Well, after some coaxing on her part I had a usable erection. I was totally amazed since I have not woke up with an erection since meeting Mr. DaVinci. And just this morning I woke up with an erection. Keep in mind it has been over 3 years and I am now just getting the feelings back. So the moral of my story is to \"Never Give Up\"!",

No leakage at all at night, but I seem to wake up every 2 hours and have to head to the bathroom to go in a hurry. I've been walking and doing the Kegel's and I am sure it has helped as the leakage seems to be getting less every day. Sure will be glad to get out of these Depends though.

I do drink a couple of cups of coffee in the morning for breakfast, but that is it for the day. Another downfall is I usually have a mixed drink right before dinner. That probably doesn't help either. As far as walking goes, I have been pretty faithful in walking 2 to 3 times a day for around a 1/2 hour each time. Living in Florida makes it a lot easier getting out for the walk. I would not want to be in one of the northern cold states trying to walk several times a day.",

It is time to find a different urologist, one that projects confidence and one that you feel comfortable with. A biopsy for me was no big deal, I was put under so I had no idea what was going on. I had no after effects except when ejaculating you will pass some blood. As you can see by my signature I have had the DaVinci and I feel that I have survived very well. While full erections come and go, a little help from the blue pill works well. Good luck on what you decide to do.",

      "Content": "I may have been just been lucky or more likely I had a great surgeon, but I can say that I had no pain what-so-ever. I never took any pain meds after the surgery, in the hospital or at home. Yes, I did have a little discomfort, hard to describe the actual feeling, just some minor discomfort. I agree that a cough or a sneeze is a bit of a jolt, however, if you have a small pillow, when you feel a sneeze or cough coming just hold the pillow tightly across your abdomen and it will greatly lessen that jolt. It's a great feeling to have it all over-with.",

      "Content": "Just one step closer the the robotic surgery date. Went to have a consultation with the surgeon and was quite impressed. My wife, a retired hospital administrator, was also quite impressed with the surgeon and his demeanor. He went over everything and explained all the options other than surgery. He wanted to make sure that surgery is what we wanted to do. We met his staff and started the process to set a surgery date, probably sometime in late January or February. In the meantime I have to get a chest x-ray, an EKG, get a release from my primary doctor for surgery, and see a couple of other specialists due to prior surgeries for hernias and a lower bowel obstruction surgery. Also I am on warfarin due to having a tendency to get blood clots in my legs. The surgeon said due to those previous surgeries, and the blood clot issue, he wants to make sure all goes well with his surgery. Can't blame him at all for that, and we are really glad that he is making sure all will go well. One thing we did learn, is that they give you low dose Viagra after the catheter is removed to promote blood flow to the area. That kind of came as a surprise, but makes sense. I am really looking forward to having this done and over with so we can get on with our lives.",

Just a little swelling that is going down more every day and bruising that is clearing up somewhat slowly. The clearing of the bruising is slowed because I am back on coumadin, but will get there eventually. Had the catheter out exactly one week today. I've been doing the kegel exercise as instructed since the catheter was removed. And I also was doing them for 6 weeks prior to Mr. Da-Vinci. Now for what I am experiencing. When I relax from a kegel I dribble, is that normal? We went to Wal-Mart yesterday and by the time we got out of there my good ol' Depends was quite wet. At night I don't have to much of a problem except that I am waking up every 2 hours. I normally do not sleep on my back, but after the Da-Vinci there really is no other choice. When I wake up I head to the bathroom and then get back in bed. By morning the Depends is still dry. It seems my biggest problem now is during waking hours.

Some minor discomfort getting up and down from a chair but that is it. They had to go in first and using the Da-Vinci Robot they cleaned up adhesion's and mesh from past hernia surgeries (different surgeon). I was told afterwards that I had a lot of adhesion's and the one that gave them the most trouble is where they had to take the prostate out just above the belly button. Seems they were in the way of the probes for the robot. I got the catheter out yesterday and so far just a dribble now and then usually when getting up and down out of a chair. This is just my experience, there were 4 of us that had it done that day and all of us were doing well after the surgery. So far I have taken no pain medication, really haven't needed it. I had to stay in the hospital until Monday (1-14) because the surgeon that did the adhesion removal wanted to observe me a little longer to make sure no complications came up and same for a hematologist that is getting me regulated on coumadin again after being off of it for the surgery. I got the drain tube out on Monday and the catheter out on Tuesday. Sure makes one feel a lot better. And now for the best news. All cancer was confined within the capsule of the prostate, no cancer was found in the lymph nodes, and there was no evidence of any cancer in the area around the prostate. I can hardly wait for my next PSA test to see what the results are.",

      "Content": "While I am not sure if open or laparoscopic would be the better way to go I can tell you my experience. The first time I had my hernias repaired (5 at one time) it was done laparoscopic & mesh was put in. Due to the amount of hernias and they were located at the naval, one on each side of the stomach, and two down low. It took me a good 30 days or more to get back into the swing of things. Don't cough during that time if you can avoid it. Then 3 years later I had a lower bowel get caught on one of the adhesion's and I ended up in the hospital for about 1 to 2 weeks trying to get it straightened out. It didn't straighten out on its own and this time I had open surgery to straighten out the bowel and the surgeon also repaired 3 more hernias at the same time. Again at least 30 days to recover. Then about 2 more years I had 1 hernia repaired again near the naval. In and out in one day and recovery was a couple of weeks. Now moving up Jan. 2013 when I had Da-Vinci prostate surgery. A Bariatric surgeon came in first, using the Da-Vinci and cleaned up all the adhesion's from the previous surgeries and then the surgeon came in to remove my prostate. All done in a one shot deal. Recovery has been good, no complaints what so ever. So you should be good to go no matter what you chose.",

      "Content": "I had nearly the same problem as you. My insurance doesn't cover Viagra or any of the others for that matter. So, I filed an appeal with the insurance company and after about a month of them contacting the doctors office several times to find out why he was prescribing it finally agreed to cover it for one year. Apparently it has something to do with the doctor writing the prescription as being medically necessary. The insurance co. said the script would be subject to review after one year. On my last visit to the doctor he told me that if in the future I have a problem with the insurance company to contact him and he would hook me up with a trusted Canadian pharmacy. So try the appeal route and if that doesn't work, check with the doctor.",

      "Content": "As for surgery and being on blood thinners. I have been on blood thinners for several years due to DVT (blood clots in the legs). No rhyme or reason, they ran tests and think it may be hereditary. Anyway prior to my date with Mr. Da-Vinci on 1/11/13 I quit taking my Coumadin 10 days prior. Then after the surgery on the 14th I started on Lovanox injections for 14 days and then adding a Coumadin after the 7th Lovanox injection. I get my PT/INR checked this Friday for any adjustment that may be needed. So the bottom line is that you can be on blood thinners and still have surgery. You just have to be monitored along the way to make sure things are going right.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by Flkjr After the one year anniversary, Sarge, what is your ED situation? I am at 6 months and not getting anywhere even with the help of Viagra. Fran Right now sometimes I have a good erection and sometimes not so much. I switched from Viagra to Cialis and it is much better for me. I take it when the erection is just not quite up to par. Also I can take it with food without any problems. I don't get an upset stomach either, like the Viagra caused. And it works within about 15 minutes of taking it. For now I take 10mg and the doc. said to take it as needed. I would say it's about 50% of the time that I need the little boost. Doc said eventually I will probably not need it any more and to always try to get the erection without using it. So we do what we have to do.",

The pump works like new. I have thoroughly cleaned it with alcohol and would expect you to do the same when you receive it. I was lucky and my insurance covered it 100% ($549.00). I am not asking any money for it and will mail (anywhere in the United States) it to you (free). It includes all the instructions. Just send me a private e-mail with your address. I don't even need a name. First come first served. I mentioned it a couple of weeks ago and no one replied. If I still have not heard from anyone by the end of the month it is going in the trash. ++ IT'S GONE! I HOPE IT HELPS THE NEW OWNER!",

That is until towards the late afternoon / evening, and then is shrinks back and is completely covered by foreskin. Kind of disheartening to look down and only seeing about 3/4 of an inch there. Doctor says that it will take time and to not worry about it, and to keep using the pump at least once a day.",

      "Content": "Hard to believe it has been one year all ready. I just had my check-up yesterday and PSA is still undetectable. The surgeon has released me to see my urologist for the next 4 years to keep track of the PSA to make sure it doesn't rise. I get one more PSA in 6 months and then yearly after that unless something shows up. At one year out, I do get usable erections most of the time. Once in awhile though not so much. Doctor said it will get better as time goes on. Along the way I did learn a couple of things: One, how to do Kegels. I thought that was just for women. Now I know better. I learned that wearing \"Depends\" right after surgery was not that bad. I learned that when you switch to pads you will need to get some tight fitting underware to keep the pad in place. Lot different than wearing boxers. I learned to take better care of myself. I was never to bad, but now I work at it more than in the past. I learned to love my wife more than ever, as she has been like a rock next to me, supporting me the entire way. For the women out there, the surgeon said yesterday that men should have sexual intercourse at least twice a week to keep everything working like it should. I liked that! Something we are working on. I don't have to use the pump any more. Doctor said that after one year it has no further effect. Other than if you are unable to have an erection without it, then it is all right to use it on occasion. I learned that I will get a DRE once a year for at least the next 4 years. Over all it has been quite a journey. One that I would not wish on anyone. I hope that one day no one will have to go through all this. And for women, the breast cancer cure is long over due. I'm not leaving the forum and will be around to comment now and then. May every one have a good outcome! One thing I would like to add, and maybe help someone out there. I have the pump, it still works like new. I have thoroughly cleaned it with alcohol. I would gladly send it to someone whose insurance will not cover the cost of one. I was lucky and my insurance covered it ($549.00). I am not asking any money for it and will mail (anywhere in the United States) it to you (free). It includes all the instructions. Just send me a private e-mail with your address. I don't even need a name. First come first served.",

      "Content": "Well, this is it, only a couple of more days to go. I will definitely be glad to get this all over with! Yesterday, had to go to the hospital and have some pre-op stuff taken care of. First I had to see a bariatric surgeon because of past hernia surgeries (3) & a lower bowel obstruction surgery from about 10 years ago. He will do the initial surgery using Mr. Da-Vinci and will scrape all the adhesion's from the prior surgeries off, get all the mesh that was put in out of the way, and also while in there will fix any more hernia's that may be around. Don't think I have any, but he said he thought he felt a small one just starting to come through. Next I had to see a hematologist. I've been on warfarin for several years because I tend to get blood clots in my legs, especially after any surgery. So he is going to be on hand to make sure I clot like I am supposed to right after the prostatectomy surgery using Mr. Da-Vinci, but get me back on the warfarin as soon as possible. He said it is a fine line between clotting and bleeding. My surgery started out when first scheduled for 3 PM, then moved to 11 AM. Then after all the doctors got together last night, they moved me to 5:15 AM. The scheduler told me that after they went over my surgery that wanted me to be first so they can take care of any problems that may develop. So what started out to be a quick procedure and stay over one night in the hospital looks like I may be there for a few days. But since I am retired I guess I have to be someplace. Again, I am looking forward to getting this over with. I appreciate all the positive comments I have gotten during my short time on this forum, and I will let you all know how it goes. I'm sure there is someone else out there that will have the same problems that I have and if this information helps someone I am glad.",

      "Content": "lLance You are in the same position I was in last year when I joined this club. Along with my wife we did a lot of research and felt that since I was in good physical condition overall I would opt for robotic surgery. I had the surgery in Jan. of this year and to date I feel great. No regrets at all. I had an excellent urologist who explained all my options, but did not guide me in any particular direction. He gave me a lot of material to read over so I could make my own decision. My surgeon had just went over 6,000 surgeries just prior to doing mine. I was up and walking the same day as the surgery and have never really had any pain what so ever. Sure there was some discomfort, but no pain. And by the way, afterwards you will urinate like you were 17 again. Just remember it is your decision, just make a well informed one!",

      "Content": "In today's local new paper there is an article about finding doctors. It is by Jim Miller author of \"Savvy Senior\". I thought I would pass some of the information along since I have seen many questions about locating and checking on doctors. 1. certificationmatters.org This web site will check to see if a doctor is board certified 2. healthgrades.com 3. vitals.com 4. ratemds.com 5. data.cms.gov Click on \"Medicare Physician and Other Supplier Look-up Tool\" This will show you how many times a doctor did a particular service and what they charge for it. 6. medicare.gov/physiciancompare For hospitals go to healthgrades.com Or better yet just do a Google search for \"Hospital Ratings\" and you will get several sites to check on a hospital. I'm sure there are other sites and these are just a few of those available. An additional comment I would like to make, that is not in the above article. When you are leaving a comment about a certain doctor or facility and it may be a negative comment, start out with \"In my opinion\" and that should get your comments posted.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by edmartin54 Wow! I'll have to talk to my doctor about that - that would be awesome! I'm sorry I should have explained just a little bit further. Along with the prostate cancer I had several other problems going on at the same time. One was I had had several prior surgeries leaving a lot of scar tissue on my inside and also had to have a couple of regular hernias fixed at the same time. All of that had to be cleaned up and over with prior to the robotic surgery even starting. My wife said I was in surgery about 5 hours or more, but it all went well. I never had any sort of physical problem until after turning 50 and it seems like it has been down hill since at time. I have always exercised and for the most part tried to follow a healthy diet. But it is what it is and we just have to live with it, taking the good with the bad. Best of luck to you.",

While I was in the hospital they came around and went over diet changes and life style changes with my wife. As soon as I get through the 4 to 6 week recovery period my wife and I are going to the hospital and attend classes they hold specifically for heart attack patients. Classes include a physical check up, menu and food prep, physical exercise, and an ongoing follow up with each of us. The best part is that it is all free. My wife has all ready started changes in the menu, thru some stuff out that we should have never been eating and is now really checking the label on all foods. Amazing what is in some food, can't even pronounce it! I am going to look into the book by Dr Dean Ornish also. Thanks Again!",

      "Content": "On a similar note, several years ago I had a lower bowel obstruction and had a rather large incision, believe I had around 20 staples. I was in good shape. The doctor told me to walk and walk some more. However, to go just far enough so I could walk back. In other words don't try and over do it all at one time. Even after the staples were out I was still sore and achy for about another 2 weeks, 4 weeks total. And getting up out of a chair usually required help. The doctor would not let me return to work for 30 days and then 2 additional weeks after that was light duty. I had a desk job at the time. Also no stairs allowed for the first 30 days either. So yes you are probably getting a little impatient. But hang in there, every day gets better and with less pain.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by Fairwind Be advised that your ejaculate is likely to be urine, at least in the beginning..I would get an okay from your surgeon before you try it..... Ditto! But over time you will ejaculate less and less urine to the point of nothing coming out at all. Takes a little while and I think it has a lot to do with keeping up with the kegels on a regular basis. We waited until the 6 week check up and the surgeon said we should have tried it out after about a month. Actually we had not thought of asking that question before hand. Anyway at that meeting the surgeon said we should be having sexual intercourse at no less than twice a week. Now if you could have seen the look on my wife's face at that moment. Of course on the way home she said don't count on his advise happening anytime in the near future.",

      "Content": "So here I am 6 years after Da-Vinci Robotic surgery. After the surgery things went well for a couple of years. I was using low dose Cialis and wasn't having to much of a problem with it and suddenly I got the pains that seems to go with it. I switched from low dose and tried 20mg just one time and that was enough. The pain was worse and lasted about 5 days. So switched to Viagra 50mg and that went a little better until about a year ago and now it is no longer tolerable. I get severe indigestion that lasts for 2 or 3 days and the plugged up sinuses that goes with Viagra. Now for what it is worth I have an appointment with my urologist in early April and will see what my next course of action will be. I guess my question is: What are some of the other meds you may be using and what are their side effects. Looking on the internet there are some new meds out there and there are also injections and suppositories. Some of them list the side effects and some don't, I'm just trying to learn what to expect in the future.",

      "Content": "Been there and done it. Several years prior to Da-Vinci, I had a total of 13 hernias repaired at different times (some were multiple) and due to those I had a lower bowel obstruction because the bowel got hung up on a adhesion that was formed from one of the prior hernia surgeries. Mesh had been used on a prior hernia surgery. When I went for my surgery with Dr. Patel the first surgeon took care of cleaning up 3 more hernias, cleaning all the adhesion's that had formed using the Da-Vinci. Then Dr. Patel went in and did the prostate surgery. Everything went well and I have had no problems since. For what it is worth they believe hernias can be hereditary and no matter what I can get more. Good luck with your surgery!",

It was April, but the doctor is going on vacation. I've continued researching across the web and from what I can find there isn't anything out there that doesn't have some sort of side effects. Some of the side effects are just not worth it in my opinion. Has anyone tried the Muse? I see it can be a suppository or injected, but it also lists some very serious (in my opinion) side effects.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by Fairwind Be advised that your ejaculate is likely to be urine, at least in the beginning..I would get an okay from your surgeon before you try it..... Ditto! But over time you will ejaculate less and less urine to the point of nothing coming out at all. Takes a little while and I think it has a lot to do with keeping up with the kegels on a regular basis. We waited until the 6 week check up and the surgeon said we should have tried it out after about a month. Actually we had not thought of asking that question before hand. Anyway at that meeting the surgeon said we should be having sexual intercourse at no less than twice a week. Now if you could have seen the look on my wife's face at that moment. Of course on the way home she said don't count on his advise happening anytime in the near future.",

What your doctor told you about the radiation is true as that is what all of the ones we spoke to told us the same thing. Once you have radiation, it makes the surgery later very difficult at the best. I think that was the reason I chose the DaVinci. My surgery is the 11th of this month, and I am definitely looking forward to getting it done and over with. Sure I am somewhat worried about the sex and the possibility of any incontinence, but I have a good supportive wife and we will deal with what we have to.

      "Content": "This is something I have not seen mentioned on this site. So I go to a Chiropractor due to some lower back pain. Having never been to one before he takes x-rays to see what was going on. In those x-rays there appears to be small round o's and some other things that look like a coil or clip. Not just a couple here and there, but more like 50+ scattered all over in my abdomen. The chiropractor said maybe it was markers or something left behind after the prostate removal. So I call the surgeons and sure enough, they are markers and clamps (plastic) that is left behind to hold things in place after the surgery. Kind of a surprise that I wasn't told that stuff gets left in me, but they assured me they have never had a problem in all the surgeries they have done. By the way, the chiropractor did a great job, I just needed a minor alignment, and the pain is gone.",

      "Content": "Michael F Turns out the chiropractor can't fix the problem. After the x-ray he found everything was in line and not anything looking unusual anywhere. He advised me to see my regular doctor and suggested an MRI to see where the problem is. He believes it to be a pinched nerve. Off to the regular doctor and she agreed that is probably what it is. Since I just had quadruple bypass in Feb. I was told that an MRI should not be done for at least a year after the surgery. So the doctor gave me some drugs and a shot in the rear and the pain was gone overnight. Just hope it stays gone. Ref. waiting a year after open heart surgery for an MRI. I was told even though the wire that holds my rib cage back together is stainless steel it is best to wait a year for everything to really heal. It seems the MRI will cause the wire to vibrate and could cause damage in there. So we just hope the pain stays gone. For what it's worth, with the insurance we have it was cheaper to get the x-ray at the chiropractor than going through our doctor. Doesn't make sense to me, but it is just how the insurance works.",

      "Content": "Do your research and keep all your options open. When making my decision I spoke with 2 different urologists, a radiologist, and two different surgeons that specialize in the DaVinci Robotic surgery. For me it was DaVinci. If you go with the radiologist keep in mind that later you usually cannot go with surgery to have it removed. I have no regrets what so ever on my choice. Good luck with your decision.",

To be honest, I am freaking out a little bit because I heard to use the pump as soon as possible and now it'a been 15 days after the surgery and I still dont have it .... I dont want to lose it Am I little stupid to be scare like that ? is it not that emergency ? I did notice that my \"winner\" is little shorter than before The paper work that was given to me by my surgeon said to wait 4 weeks from the surgery date before starting the pump. He had me start on Viagra 50mg on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday, 3 days after the catheter was out. At the 4 week mark after surgery take a 100mg Viagra on Monday and start using the pump daily. Also continue the 50mg on Wed. and Fri.",

      "Content": "One comment to add about Dr. Vipul Patel, if you choose to see him. He only sees patients on Wednesdays. The waiting room will be packed full, so allow plenty of time. We had a 1PM appt. and didn't actually see him until a little after 3:30 PM. The waiting room does provide TV, and some bottled water, soda, and some snacks to pass the time. Also, if you decide on the surgery, there is a $500.00 deposit to assure you make your appt. for the surgery. The $500.00 is refundable or applied to what ever your insurance doesn't cover. Good luck with your decision, and take someone with you to take notes and also ask questions during any contact with a surgeon, urologist, etc. As they say, two head are better than one and it is best to have someone else making sure you both understand what the doctors are saying.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by Gyndavid 48 yo, just dx, 6/12 bx positive. Gleason , 3+3 for 2, 3+4 for 3, and 1 bx 4+3. Clinical stage t2b. Fortunately I can travel a short way to see Dr Vip Patel in Orlando, he has done almost 6000 robotic prostatectomies. Or, do I stay local and gets IRMT? I am really worried about incontinence and impotence from surgery. Anybody out there done proton therapy? Anyhow, considering options and woud appreciate input from fellows who have undergone these treatments. My urologist tells me that success is equal between surgery and radiation. I had surgery with Dr. Patel at Celebration Hosp. on 1/11/2013. Today I am 7 weeks our of surgery. I had to have another surgeon first (this was done just a few minutes before Dr. Patel did his thing) to take care of adhesion's from prior hernia surgeries and where the mesh had been put in during those surgeries. They went in and cleaned up the adhesion's and removed some of the mesh. Seems they would have been in the way of the prostatectomy. I am 65 years old and in pretty good health, other than I am on coumadin which kept me in the hospital for an extra 3 days until they got the blood level back where they wanted it. First about the surgery, I was off the coumadin for 10 days prior to the surgery. I was first one in the morning (about 5 AM). I was in recovery by 7:30 AM and in a room by 10 AM. Would have been in the room earlier, but they had to get it straightened up first. I can honestly say that I had no pain, some discomfort, but no pain, and never took any pain meds. I was up walking by 1 PM the same after noon. They said 13 laps equal a mile. I did that at least 2 and sometimes 4 times a day while I was there. My wife stayed with me and we had one of the best rooms they had. Small kitchen, extra room, big screen TV in both rooms, computer access, and even a electric fireplace. Here I am at 7 weeks since the surgery. At this time I have just a little incontinence, mostly in the late afternoon and evening. For the first 2 weeks after the catheter was removed I used Depends and now I am just using the Depends pads for men. I am only getting up once or twice during the night and have no leakage during the night. Erections are there but not enough for any penetration as yet, but it is coming back slowly. I am on Viagra and using a pump twice a day (both at Dr. Patel's orders). When all is said and done you will have 7 small incisions, the biggest just above the belly button, no stitches, they use super glue to seal you up. At this point I have no regrets in having the operation, and would do it again. Of course it is your decision on what to do, I am just relaying my experience. As a suggestion if you do choose to go with the surgery I would suggest starting Kegel exercises and do more than you think you need. Walk, walk, and walk some more. Also maybe do some abdominal crunches to strengthen the surgery area. Again, it is your decision, look at all the options and then make an informed decision. By the way, Dr. Patel went over 6000 just prior to my surgery.",

      "Content": "All is good, my PSA was <0.1 and my Testosterone was 510 and I was told that was right where they want it to be. At this point I have almost no leakage. Just an occasional one now and then and that is usually when I play golf and twist and turn when driving the ball. If I think about it before hand I don't have a problem at all. Just have to remember to think what I am doing. I still get a sense of a dribble now and then but nothing is there. It used to happen quite often, but now maybe just a couple of times a day or so. The doctor said that will eventually go away. Full erections have not returned as yet, but it does seem to be getting better. Time will tell. I feel good overall and it was a relief that my PSA is still less than 0.1. The scars from the surgery are just faint spots now and are not a problem at all. I'm just glad it is over.",

      "Content": "One comment to add about Dr. Vipul Patel, if you choose to see him. He only sees patients on Wednesdays. The waiting room will be packed full, so allow plenty of time. We had a 1PM appt. and didn't actually see him until a little after 3:30 PM. The waiting room does provide TV, and some bottled water, soda, and some snacks to pass the time. Also, if you decide on the surgery, there is a $500.00 deposit to assure you make your appt. for the surgery. The $500.00 is refundable or applied to what ever your insurance doesn't cover. Good luck with your decision, and take someone with you to take notes and also ask questions during any contact with a surgeon, urologist, etc. As they say, two head are better than one and it is best to have someone else making sure you both understand what the doctors are saying.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by Gyndavid 48 yo, just dx, 6/12 bx positive. Gleason , 3+3 for 2, 3+4 for 3, and 1 bx 4+3. Clinical stage t2b. Fortunately I can travel a short way to see Dr Vip Patel in Orlando, he has done almost 6000 robotic prostatectomies. Or, do I stay local and gets IRMT? I am really worried about incontinence and impotence from surgery. Anybody out there done proton therapy? Anyhow, considering options and woud appreciate input from fellows who have undergone these treatments. My urologist tells me that success is equal between surgery and radiation. I had surgery with Dr. Patel at Celebration Hosp. on 1/11/2013. Today I am 7 weeks our of surgery. I had to have another surgeon first (this was done just a few minutes before Dr. Patel did his thing) to take care of adhesion's from prior hernia surgeries and where the mesh had been put in during those surgeries. They went in and cleaned up the adhesion's and removed some of the mesh. Seems they would have been in the way of the prostatectomy. I am 65 years old and in pretty good health, other than I am on coumadin which kept me in the hospital for an extra 3 days until they got the blood level back where they wanted it. First about the surgery, I was off the coumadin for 10 days prior to the surgery. I was first one in the morning (about 5 AM). I was in recovery by 7:30 AM and in a room by 10 AM. Would have been in the room earlier, but they had to get it straightened up first. I can honestly say that I had no pain, some discomfort, but no pain, and never took any pain meds. I was up walking by 1 PM the same after noon. They said 13 laps equal a mile. I did that at least 2 and sometimes 4 times a day while I was there. My wife stayed with me and we had one of the best rooms they had. Small kitchen, extra room, big screen TV in both rooms, computer access, and even a electric fireplace. Here I am at 7 weeks since the surgery. At this time I have just a little incontinence, mostly in the late afternoon and evening. For the first 2 weeks after the catheter was removed I used Depends and now I am just using the Depends pads for men. I am only getting up once or twice during the night and have no leakage during the night. Erections are there but not enough for any penetration as yet, but it is coming back slowly. I am on Viagra and using a pump twice a day (both at Dr. Patel's orders). When all is said and done you will have 7 small incisions, the biggest just above the belly button, no stitches, they use super glue to seal you up. At this point I have no regrets in having the operation, and would do it again. Of course it is your decision on what to do, I am just relaying my experience. As a suggestion if you do choose to go with the surgery I would suggest starting Kegel exercises and do more than you think you need. Walk, walk, and walk some more. Also maybe do some abdominal crunches to strengthen the surgery area. Again, it is your decision, look at all the options and then make an informed decision. By the way, Dr. Patel went over 6000 just prior to my surgery.",

Yes, the cancer is gone, but then the rest of life sets in. My wife has been wonderfully understanding and helpful in helpping me develop patience (yep, it's only been 3 weeks.) There is some feeling and I help it along as I can. I also found that manually stimulating her is relaxing for me and creates some response for me. It keeps physical intimacy going, at least staying in the game, so to speak. I am 8 weeks out of Da-Vinci and erections are not really there yet, I would say I am about 1/2 way there. At this point I can say I experience more sensitivity and I am using Viagra and the pump. However, have not tried the rings as yet. For me, I would say the erections are getting better. I just had an appt. with the surgeon and we talked about it. He said that everyone is different and for some it will take longer than others and to not worry about it. To keep using the pump and taking the Viagra. He said for some it can take up to 9 months to a year to recover fully. We have to remember they removed and re-arranged things so it takes time to adjust. The doctor also said that worrying about it will not help, but to think positive and it will happen.",

Now what I don't understand is, they will cover the pump, but will not cover Viagra or any other med of that type. I finally got them to cover Viagra for one year, but not after that. The doctors office went around and around with the insurance company until it finally got covered.

Just a little swelling that is going down more every day and bruising that is clearing up somewhat slowly. The clearing of the bruising is slowed because I am back on coumadin, but will get there eventually. Had the catheter out exactly one week today. I've been doing the kegel exercise as instructed since the catheter was removed. And I also was doing them for 6 weeks prior to Mr. Da-Vinci. Now for what I am experiencing. When I relax from a kegel I dribble, is that normal? We went to Wal-Mart yesterday and by the time we got out of there my good ol' Depends was quite wet. At night I don't have to much of a problem except that I am waking up every 2 hours. I normally do not sleep on my back, but after the Da-Vinci there really is no other choice. When I wake up I head to the bathroom and then get back in bed. By morning the Depends is still dry. It seems my biggest problem now is during waking hours. Just hope it will get better soon or I will have stock in Depends.",

      "Content": "Depending on your insurance, and a prescription from the surgeon, it may be covered in part or in total by the insurance company. After surgery, I received a prescription and I called to see my insurance provider to see what my co-pay would be, they covered it 100%. Now what I don't understand is, they will cover the pump, but will not cover Viagra or any other med of that type. I finally got them to cover Viagra for one year, but not after that. The doctors office went around and around with the insurance company until it finally got covered. Had it not been covered the doctor told me that he would write a script so I could get generic Viagra out of Canada.",

The only thing I have to remember is to do a kegel right before driving off the tee, or I may leak a drop or two. I think it is because of the combination of the twisting and effort put forth in the drive. Just another learning process. Again, glad you are doing well.",

      "Content": "I'm sure everyone responds differently. As for my experience I went in at 5 AM and was up and waking the hallways of the hospital by noon the same day. I had no pain, no discomfort really, and was taking no pain meds. I was released after 3 days. I would have been released on the second day, but I am on blood thinner, so they kept me one more just to make sure I was doing all right. On the release day they took the drain tube out and that was a bit of a jolt, not really painful, just a weird feeling. I also had the catheter removed on the 3rd day, which was more of a relief than any pain involved. I walked approx. 3 to 5 miles a day prior to going in and was doing Kegals as instructed. For that matter I still do Kegals 3 times a week and walk or ride a bicycle everyday. They used super glue for all the holes left by the robot, so no stitches. I have no regret at all for having the prostate removed when I did. Had a great surgeon at an excellent hospital and no complications.",

However, the effects sure lasted a lot longer. The upset stomach lasted for 12 or more hours and that included heartburn. My sinus felt as if they were going to make my head explode and I had blurry vision that would last 4 to 6 hours after taking the Viagra. I was taking 50mg on Monday and Wednesday and 100mg on Friday. I tried taking it at night and it would keep me awake, and I also tried taking it during the day or in the morning and the effects were always the same. I have not tried Cialis and am not going to. So far after stopping the Viagra I have been able to get a satisfying erection without using any meds so the Viagra is not needed.",

      "Content": "After a suggestion by another forum member I thought it would be interesting to start a thread to see what makes you leak. It also may be helpful to others who are just starting this process so they know what to expect in their journey. Lets all be honest now, and also tell how long since your surgery. And if you are not leaking at all, how long did it take to get to that point. Of course I'll go first. I'm at 6 months since DaVinci Surgery. My biggest problem is when I play golf. I have to really concentrate on the Kegel or will leak a drop or two when I swing the club. Must be because of the effort and the twisting. So I wear a pad when I play golf. I've had a couple of other times of a little leak and that is when I have been lifting something. Again, without thinking what I am going first.",

I walked a lot around the hospital corridors right after I got back to my room. I was in the hospital 3 days and the only reason they kept me was to get my Coumiden level back to where it should be. I did have some swelling and was black and blue but that all went away in approx. 2 to 3 weeks. So not every one has your experience, but it is good to relate the experience to give a new comer some incite as to what they might expect. Hope you continue to do well.",

      "Content": "I used the pump for one year and followed the instructions as given by the doctor. Twice a day for the first 6 months and then once a day for the next six months, also was taking Viagra every other day during the first 6 months. I pretty much followed the directions and seldom missed a day during that year. According to the doctor the pump was for blood flow and to assist in keeping the penis from shrinking, for a lack of a better word. Well, I am over 2 years past surgery, and while before that I was circumcised, it now it appears that I am not. It really shrinks up! I still need Viagra or Cialis to obtain a usable erection. I can get somewhat of an erection without the pill, but not enough for penetration. So I am not sure the use of the pump is all that it is cracked up to be. My wife hated the use of the pump and the retainer rings, but tolerated it. Neither of us really like the use of the pills as it feels less spontaneous, but again we tolerate it. The side effects from either Viagra or Cialis really get to me, you name it I get it. My urologist just retired so I have an appointment with a new one coming up in a month or so. Don't know what to expect yet, or what he may suggest. It would be nice to get an erection without the use of pills, injections or whatever else. But as they say, \"it is what it is\". It's better than having the cancer!",

That being said, who knows where my cancer would be today without all the peppers I ate over the years and I certainly would not discourage anyone from including Capsaicin as a supplement with more traditional treatments I agree! I have ate hot peppers in one form or another almost every day for as long as I can remember. And now I am waiting on a surgery date to be set for my prostate to be removed. So did it do anything for me, probably not! But for you or someone else it may. What works for one may not for another. Also, I do not plan on quitting eating hot stuff either any time soon!",

Become dedicated to getting into better shape and taking better care of yourself with proper diet and exercise. I would suggest that you find a gym that has a certified trainer that works with it's members. He or she will review your past injuries and your present physical condition and get you on the right track to slowly improve yourself. My brother-in-law had similar conditions as you. Approx. a year ago he made the decision to get back on track and joined a gym with a trainer on staff. He has lost well over 100 pounds, is on a good diet and says he hasn't felt this good in years. He said he has more energy and now likes to get out and do things, where before it was sitting in front of the TV with a beer. I don't see him very often and almost didn't recognize him when I last saw him due to his weight loss. He said the trainer was very thorough and started him out slowly with the exercise that fitted his needs. He also was referred by his doctor to a dietitian who helped him with his diet. Good luck with your journey.",

Some minor discomfort getting up and down from a chair but that is it. They had to go in first and using the robot they cleaned up adhesion's and mesh from past hernia surgeries. Seems they were in the way. I got the catheter out yesterday and so far just a dribble now and then when getting up and down out of a chair. This is just my experience, there were 4 of us that had it done that day and all of us were doing well.",

I was conscious at the time and expected it to hurt or be rather painful. Much to my surprise it really wasn't bad at all. Maybe I have a high pain level tolerance, but I really didn't feel any pain at all.",

      "Content": "I'm sure everyone responds differently. As for my experience I went in at 5 AM and was up and waking the hallways of the hospital by noon the same day. I had no pain, no discomfort really, and was taking no pain meds. I was released after 3 days. I would have been released on the second day, but I am on blood thinner, so they kept me one more just to make sure I was doing all right. On the release day they took the drain tube out and that was a bit of a jolt, not really painful, just a weird feeling. I also had the catheter removed on the 3rd day, which was more of a relief than any pain involved. I walked approx. 3 to 5 miles a day prior to going in and was doing Kegals as instructed. For that matter I still do Kegals 3 times a week and walk or ride a bicycle everyday. They used super glue for all the holes left by the robot, so no stitches. I have no regret at all for having the prostate removed when I did. Had a great surgeon at an excellent hospital and no complications.",

However, the effects sure lasted a lot longer. The upset stomach lasted for 12 or more hours and that included heartburn. My sinus felt as if they were going to make my head explode and I had blurry vision that would last 4 to 6 hours after taking the Viagra. I was taking 50mg on Monday and Wednesday and 100mg on Friday. I tried taking it at night and it would keep me awake, and I also tried taking it during the day or in the morning and the effects were always the same. I have not tried Cialis and am not going to. So far after stopping the Viagra I have been able to get a satisfying erection without using any meds so the Viagra is not needed.",

Now that it's gone, no luck at all. I'm assuming it's not covered by medicare or supplemental insurance. Thanks, Fred For what it is worth, my supplemental insurance & medicare did not cover Viagra or any of the others. The doctor's office called the supplemental insurance company and advised them it was medically necessary and it went through with out to much of a problem. I now have a 90 day supply with 3 more renewals at a discount rate. ($30.00)",

I have been on Tamsulosin for several years and the congestion never goes away while you are on it. I quit taking mine about a week ago, pending surgery and what a difference, I can breath again! My wife said that I have stopped snoring at night too, a big benefit for her. I hope all gets better for you in the future.",

I pay the published copay and that's that..The downside is I must stay in my group which is basically the entire Denver area..If you like to travel, this type of insurance puts you at a disadvantage because it will not pay if you are outside your area...You can buy a plan that offers nationwide coverage but it's considerably more expensive.. Fairwind, We have Aetna Medicare Advantage plan provided by my employer retirement plan and we can go to anyone we want to. They do have a preferred list and we do try and stay within that list. But we can travel without a problem. We just enter a zip code for where we are and a list comes right up.",

I walked a lot around the hospital corridors right after I got back to my room. I was in the hospital 3 days and the only reason they kept me was to get my Coumiden level back to where it should be. I did have some swelling and was black and blue but that all went away in approx. 2 to 3 weeks. So not every one has your experience, but it is good to relate the experience to give a new comer some incite as to what they might expect. Hope you continue to do well.",

I am still walking 2 to 3 times a day at about a mile or better each time out. Also still doing the Kegels. Erection's are coming back and at this point I would say nearly back to normal. I would say the penis is more sensitive than before the surgery. Maybe that is just me, I am not sure. I am on Viagra 3 times a week, 100 mg on Monday and 50 mg on Wednesday and Friday, and I would say it helps in the erection department. Also still using the pump and not sure if that is doing any good or not.",

After all of that we opted for the surgery and the doctor we chose, which was lucky for us was just a couple of hours away. He has over 6,000 robotic surgeries to date, so we felt very comfortable with him and the hospital. I might add that the hospital was unlike any hospital I had ever seen. First class the entire way.

I pay the published copay and that's that..The downside is I must stay in my group which is basically the entire Denver area..If you like to travel, this type of insurance puts you at a disadvantage because it will not pay if you are outside your area...You can buy a plan that offers nationwide coverage but it's considerably more expensive.. Fairwind, We have Aetna Medicare Advantage plan provided by my employer retirement plan and we can go to anyone we want to. They do have a preferred list and we do try and stay within that list. But we can travel without a problem. We just enter a zip code for where we are and a list comes right up.",

      "Content": "I am 2 years past the DaVinci surgery with Dr. Patel. For me it was a good experience. In the past I had hernia surgery 4 different times and also I am on Coumadin for blood clots in my legs. Dr. Patel took every precaution in my opinion. I had to see 2 other surgeons prior to Dr. Patel doing his thing. The first was to check for scaring and adhesion's from the past hernia surgeries. Actually, that surgeon was the first to start with the robot to clean up all the adhesion's from those past hernia surgeries. He also fixed another hernia that hadn't popped up yet. Then the other doc was a specialist that monitored my Coumadin and made sure it would not be a problem prior, during, and after the DaVinci. With all bases covered I went in for surgery about 6AM and was up walking the hallways by noon. I had no pain and took no pain meds. I did have to stay in the hospital a couple of more days than usual until they got my blood level back to where they wanted it. As for the hospital, I have been in 4 different hospitals in my life, and Celebration Hospital was great. The nurses, the aides, everyone there treated us (my wife was with me) great. You can ask Dr. Patel or anyone on his staff anything. They don't hesitate to answer any question you have. If I had to do it over, I would not change a thing. Good luck on what ever you decide. Write down all your questions you have and go through them when you meet with Dr. Patel and his staff, if you decide to use him. Since I have been there, if you have any questions for me don't hesitate to ask.",

Mine told me that after surgery to wait at least 4 weeks, then it was up to me if I wanted to do that or not. He said it would not hurt a thing and does help with blood flow. My nerves were spared, so that may have made some difference in his reply. As far as meds go, I had to argue and fight with my prescription provider to get Viagra approved for one year and after that they will no longer cover. My surgeon told me if after a year I still need Viagra that they have a contact in Canada that has the generic Viagra at a very reasonable price. He said he would be happy to write the script if I needed it. Remember that time heals, so hang in there.",

This will be my 3rd one and of course I'm not really looking forward to it, but it is one of those things that needs to be done. Actually, it is the day before that is the worse part. This first 2 were by a surgeon, this one is going to be by a Gastroenterologist. He specializes in this sort of thing. According to his nurse it is a better choice than using a surgeon, she said he does over 400 a year, where a surgeon may only do 30 to 40 a year. So hopefully all turns out well.",
