      "Content": "Family history: Father was diagnosed with prostate cancer at age 57 and it was not caught early enough and he eventually succumbed at age 66. Uncle was diagnosed with prostate cancer at age 62 but it was caught early enough. I started getting PSA tests at age 37. My last three results: 39yr4mo 0.56 40yr1mo 0.72 40yr7mo 0.86 I know my PSA is still relatively low but I can see where the trend is headed and along with the family history, I'm wondering if it isn't too early to see an oncologist before my 41st birthday.",

      "Content": "My father was diagnosed at age 56 with prostate cancer. Even though his Gleason scale was 8, he managed to live almost 10 more years before succumbing. So now I'm 40 and I already started getting my PSA as part of my semi-annual bloodwork a couple years ago. My last three PSA counts have been 0.62, 0.56, and 0.72. I guess my biggest question is what do these numbers mean and what kind of increase do I need to see before I start getting concerned?",
