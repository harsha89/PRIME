      "Content": "Consult1 - I am sorry to hear you've had the pain! As far as giving it a go, that's kind of funny. I really didn't think much about until the catheter came out and I started my Cialis. I had sticker shock when I went to pick it up and 6 pills cost me $135. While I know that will last me a month I was still shocked. It was a Sunday that I started the Cialis, so my mindset was that if I was going to pay $135 for blood flow and erections, this better work! So I took my first pill and decided to give it a try. I know that's odd, but that was truly my mindset. The three times after that, I have actually had the urge to play and was feeling like myself. I hope that helps.",

      "Content": "Hello All, I just wanted to post how I am doing 3 weeks post op. After getting through the first few days at home, I have been feeling really really good. I had little to no pain following surgery and really only needed to use anything stronger then Tylenol twice. The first time I used it just because I was coming home that day and figured I should just in case. The second time I was having some lower right abdomen pain that was traveling down into my groin and into my buttocks. That pain lasted about two days and then was gone. Other then that, I have had very few issues. I'm not going to lie, the first week with the catheter was not fun, but was manageable and went by rather quick. Once the catheter was out, I was very worried about incontinence, but have found that to be quite manageable as well. I am fully dry at night, with the only issue being I get up 1-3 times per night, but mostly it is once in the middle of the night and then once when it is time to get up. That's not really an increase from where I was pre-surgery, so not bad. During the day I use 1 maybe two pads. I do notice later in the day 3-5pm that I become more leaky if standing and moving. I have to be honest, I have not been the best with walking and kegels either. So overall for doing very little, I am very happy with where I am at. I even have introduced my morning cup of coffee back in with no issues. I have also had a few beers (just this week) with no issues as well. I did enjoy my chocolate oatmeal stout with dinner on Saturday night! On the ED front, that has also gone much better then expected. I am taking 1/2 a Cialis 3x/week and I have been able to get aroused enough to make climax enjoyable. Only drawback with that has been climacturia, which I know is normal. I am finding it odd that even when I empty my bladder before masturbation that I still have that. It's not a real bother, but certainly odd. I think in total I have played 4x since starting Cialis and I've had increasing levels of erections. Started somewhere around 50% of normal and increased from there til the last time I tried and it was probably 80% of normal. The last time I did it, I would have been erect enough for intercourse which was very encouraging. I just can't wait until I get to 6 weeks so that I can golf again! I am hopeful to be able to get one last round of golf in before the end of the season. Feeling good is great, but I have to keep telling myself to slow down and that is probably the hardest part. I don't regret my decision so far at all and am just waiting for that first blood test. I appreciate all the support everyone here has given me and even though I did not have the best post op pathology I am taking your advice and living life and reacting when necessary and IF necessary.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by Groot I call BS on doc #1. OK, maybe that's a bit harsh. IMHO, continence does seem to be related to surgical technique, perhaps our senior members can weigh in here. With the volume of procedures you've mentioned, they certainly have experience. I was lucky in this department, very good control at 4 months so it is possible. Was surgeon #1 able to give you confidence based on YOUR situation which stat would be yours (97% vs the other 3%)? I.e. is he confirming your tumor location will allow both nerves to be spared? I thought you had concerns about this in a previous post, would be good news if this is no longer a concern. In my case, one of my nerves was involved so I'm still dealing with ED. Fully functional with Sildenafil, sometimes without but that took more than a year of healing. For what it's worth, my surgeon told me to expect this up front (due to nodule location during DRE). I appreciated he was talking about my situation, not \"general stats\" and one of the reasons I went with him. And just curious, do both surgeons plan up front on taking any lymph nodes? Bottom line, I'm aligned with previous member responses, doc#2 sounds more realistic. I felt like #1 was more talking about all his overall success, but not my case specifically. I did speak to both about the location and wanted to know if that would lead to more issues with incontinence and Ed. #1 said that the MRI I had on Friday would give us a better picture - #2 said that it could be an issue, but said he would not know until he got in there. #1said said he wanted the 3T-MRI which # didn't even suggest. Interestingly enough, #1 who seemed to give more stats about his overall success and not my individual case, actually spent more time asking how I was, letting me talk and seemed more invested, while #2 seemed to speak directly to my case, but didn't really seem to ask a lot about how I was doing and when i'd go to say something he seemed to just want to get on with his talking and get to the next patient. I\"m hung up on two things I heard last week - so please help - A radiation oncologist when asking who I was considering for surgery said \"You want a top Doctor from a top Cancer institution.\" The other thing is that I spoke to one of Doctor #2's patients and he RAVES about him and said \"I am living and loving life one year Post OP..YOu have to choose him.\" #2 is a top Doc, but not from a top Cancer Institute. He has however done nearly 4k of these procedures. I do also have a client of mine who told me about Doctor #1` as he has 3 different clients who all used Doc 1 and Raved about him ( I have not spoke to them directly). I'm not sure why I'm struggling with this decision so much, but I am torn 50/50.",

      "Content": "Ok Everyone, I have met with two of the three surgeons I'm considering. Some of the top in Boston and here's what I\"m being told. My situation is I\"m a 40 year old male that's a Gleason 7 3+4 6 of 12 cores positive. All of the positive cores on the left side. Doctor One - told me 97% of his patients were back to almost normal levels of incontinence and pre-surgery levels of erections within about 4 months post op. I'm a healthy guy but do need to shed some weight as it will help in my recovery. The first doctor said the only issue with my weight was the way the surgery is done, that would cause additional soreness from being almost up side down. He never mentioned my weight in terms of helping with incontinence. He even said the incontinence would be a slow drip and i'd need a pad and didn't mention full on depends at all. Doctor 2 - said I should lose as much weight as possible pre surgery and after as it will help with incontinence because the extra weight pushes on the bladder making it tougher to be continent. I completely agree with this, but he also went along to say that it's possible that i'd fully need diapers for a bit and painted a much worse picture then Doctor A. He also talked about erections and said it could take 18-24 months until I had success in that dept. My questions is do you with the guy who is more confident or what appears to me to be more realistic? They have both done several thousand procedures and both expected a good outcome for me for the long haul. Also, what was your experience more like - The one described by doctor 1 or 2?

Michael F - I am using Dr. Ingolf Tuerk at St. Elizabeth's Medical Center in Brighton. I spoke to around 10 of his patients (all of who I found through online forums or google searches). I figured if I asked for the office recommendations, of course I'm going to get the best outcomes. So I searched high and wide and reached out to each of them via Facebook or email if i could find it and to a person, they spoke very highly of him and their outcomes SE's etc! I am very eager to get it done so that I can start the road to recovery on the SE front and to just an overall better health. That's why I wanted to ask about walking. I want to walk early and often. Also, my son just started 7th grade and we just got his soccer schedule and I want to be able to get to his games. Nothing will help me with recovery more then watching my little man play sports!",

      "Content": "Thank you everyone for the responses. I have the recliner all set up and ready to go. I even picked out a few shows I may try and binge watch! Michael F - I am using Dr. Ingolf Tuerk at St. Elizabeth's Medical Center in Brighton. I spoke to around 10 of his patients (all of who I found through online forums or google searches). I figured if I asked for the office recommendations, of course I'm going to get the best outcomes. So I searched high and wide and reached out to each of them via Facebook or email if i could find it and to a person, they spoke very highly of him and their outcomes SE's etc! I am very eager to get it done so that I can start the road to recovery on the SE front and to just an overall better health. That's why I wanted to ask about walking. I want to walk early and often. Also, my son just started 7th grade and we just got his soccer schedule and I want to be able to get to his games. Nothing will help me with recovery more then watching my little man play sports!",

      "Content": "I just wanted to let you know not to panic and truly realize how powerful the mind can be. When I was going through all kinds of tests and all I could think of was worst case scenario, you would not believe how many new pains (back and hip and leg pain being a few of those) that I had. As I had more and more tests to rule things out, wouldn't you know it..all these \"pains\" seemed to go away. At one point I was literally on the table having a bone scan and my back was on fire. Every ache and pain you can imagine. I go the results the next day things were good....immediately the pain went away. It's easy when you are in the beginning to think the worst and let the power of your mind take over. Just breath, relax and as many here told me...Enjoy life.",

Then I had some blood in my urine. I went to my PC and he said lets see if this goes away. I had a second episode of blood in the urine which prompted the referral to my urologist. I saw him, he had me do a PSA which came back at 6.96. He then wanted to do a retest, which I did and had a 7.04. Also at that time I had a UTI, so he said, lets try an antibiotic and then we will retest. If the retest doesn't come back down, we will go ahead with the biopsy. I had my third test and the PSA rose to 7.5. Also while all that was going on I had a CT scan which came back fine. Had the biopsy last Wednesday and got the results today.
