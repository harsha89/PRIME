      "Content": "Finally after over 4 months of diagnosing i am having my prostate removed robotically. PSA has come down to 3.1, biopsy - gleason 3+3 both lobes, 2 xMRI's read by 5 different radiologists diagnosis has ranged from T2A to T3B, MRI reading doesn't seem to be an exact science. Hoping that such a low PSA coupled with low gleason would point to a less serious T2A or T2B. MRI is inconclusive as to seminal vesicle involvement, PET scan and bone scan negative. All of a sudden my hip has started aching of course i'm paranoid its connected to the prostate !!!",

Very impressed !!! Yes soooo looking forward to surgery, yes i know with the associated risks that maybe sounds strange. The weight of a growing cancer inside has dominated me and my girlfriend and my ma and my children completely. It has been quite a journey of reading and research and thats before i've even had anything done. I would very strongly recommend Dr Patrick Walsh guide to surviving prostate cancer to any newly diagnosed. Although in the uk we are generally a lot further on diagnosis wise due to no PSA screening over here. It definitely should be screened.",

      "Content": "Here I am 10 months post RALP. Most importantly for me it's still undetectable. Have to be honest i was very anxious this time for some reason but obviously I'm delighted. The last 10 months have been quite stressful for me particularly on the ED front. I'm a relatively young guy and had a very active sex life. Yes myself and my partner have been very active and imaginative but the non- erection takes its toll psychologically. For me my whole masculinity seems to stem from my penis and to have nothing at all has been devastating. Wives and girlfriends please do not underestimate the confidence knock this has on a man !!! Up to 5 months i had nothing at all, very cold as well. 6 months I've had some stirrings and a bit of wood nothing to write home about but nonetheless something happening. Slowly but surely things have been improving, injections are the key I think. Cialis doesn't seem to make any difference i take every night. I alternate between viagra and Levitra. Viagra seems to work better. Now at 10 months I'm probably at half mast if I have a viagra and a shower to warm myself up. Just recently managed penetration of sorts. I guess to round off I've still got a long way to go but I'm improving all the time and am confident i will get back to near where I was pre- op. Don't give up hope positivity is the key and of course an understanding partner. I have had the most incredibly supportive girlfriend Julie Nilsson and I could not have done this without her.",

Keep with the cialis and try a stronger dose every now and again, also try Viagra and levitra. They both work slightly differently. Surprised you've not already tried injections, as Brave says they work in 5 mins. Getting the correct dosage was tricky but have done at least 40 injections in last 6 months. Having said all that and done all that my erections have only just started naturally after @ 7 months. I'm now 9 months post RALPH. Probably at half mast and not enough for natural penetration.

      "Content": "Hi I have in the last 6 weeks had a radical prostatectomy at the Royal Marsden in London by a surgeon called Chris Ogden. I am from Lincolnshire and as Baz says referral to any hospital in the country is not straight forward by any means especially to a London hospital. There is a system called choose and book which allows a GP to refer out of area but in my case London was not on the list as it is \"too expensive and only really for rich foreigners\" as a Lincolnshire urology consultant informed me. Each authority have partner authorities which they would prefer you use. In my case I was diagnosed in Lincolnshire - PSA, biopsy, MRI and bone scan. I wasn't happy with advice or the fact that NICE guidelines were not being followed by consultants so I paid privately for a second opinion at the Royal Marsden. In the meantime my GP referred me to the Royal Marsden - it was turned down but I reapplied and it was granted. Hope this helps. By the way the I cannot recommend the Royal Marsden highly enough it is an absolutely fantastic hospital with equally fantastic staff. So very pleased with my results and am actually travelling down to London in the morning for my first post op PSA Test.",

I know its early days just started taking cialis 20mg and after 2 days have had severe back pain and leg cramps, really really painful. I had tried cialis and viagra prior to surgery just to see which one i preferred. I got back pain with cialis then as well. Some flushing and stuffy nose with viagra but no back trouble. I have been advised that cialis is more effective but its just not agreeing with me. Has anyone got any tips of best way to take viagra - daily or as and when required. Do many men out there have sexual function immediately after surgery. Thanks George",

      "Content": "Well 7 months now has gone since my DaVinci RP. PSA still undetectable so i'm really happy. Been pad free for around 4 months now but still have the odd dribble if i laugh too hard or sneeze. Kegels definately worked and i still do them most days. ED has been more challenging with my surgeon confirming he had to take 5-10% of my nerve bundles to give a wider negative margin. I must admit i expected it all to work quicker . Surgeon is still confident that it will return but more like 15-24 months. I have noticed changes- my penis feels warmer and i sometimes wake up with bit of a swelling - nothing more than that. I still visit site regularly and wish all out there the best of luck Merry xmas George",

      "Content": "Hi Mikla To be honest I have sort of made it up as I go along. There is no hard ( no pun intended ) and fast rule. I take 10mg cialis every night to aid blood flow when or if night time erections happen. I have tried Viagra and Levitra now and again but it has no effect. I use a pump 2 or 3 times a week just to aid blood flow. You can use pump and bands around base of penis for intercourse but I don't like the feeling so I just use it as an exercise device I suppose. I also use the injections probably twice a week. Now that has taken some getting used to !! Here in the UK we do not have trimix or bimix injections so it can be much more painful, but after much adjusting dosages it's now easy with minimal pain. I also use pump to get penis hard before injecting. So I am doing plenty to aid a recovery but the injections do prove there can be a healthy sex life even if ED becomes permanent. Most importantly an understanding partner is of course vital.",

      "Content": "So almost 2 years since RRP. Continence was back to normal very quickly apart from when drinking alcohol but that is ok too now. I had 5% of both nerve bundles removed by surgeon and he suggested that it will probably take 2 years for my erections to return but no guarantees. So I was prepared for the long haul from the off. Cialis, injections and Viagra have been used regularly to keep the blood flowing. Peyronies became an issue but regular use of vacuum pump seemed to keep the bending at bay and my cock seems to have straightened up. Blood flow is returning naturally and without getting too excited I have been able to have intercourse without injections a couple of times in the last month. I don't visit site much these days but it was fantastic for me in the early days when I was literally shitting bricks. Good luck everyone fighting and recovering especially partners and wives you are so so important and I thank my lucky stars for the support and confidence I've received.",

      "Content": "Hi York Judging by your low PSA it is extremely unlikely that your prostate and back/bone pains are connected. Although I can definitely understand how your brain goes into overdrive and imagines all the worst possible scenarios. I can also appreciate your frustration with the NHS. My advice is to ring constantly, sorry to say this but I learnt that waiting and being patient and relying on other people to be professional often means that your put to the bottom of the pile. There is no panic in your situation but the waiting can be tough I know. Good luck make sure you write all questions down before any consultation and of course you are allowed to record the conversation on your phone.",

      "Content": "Hi All, Well here I am first post newly diagnosed. Fantastic site, loads of info, love the differences of opinion and amazed at how encouraging and positive you all are despite difficult times and decisions. To start, how do I put info of my condition at bottom of page. I am 47, firefighter from the uk. PSA score 17.4. Gleason score 6, right lobe 1 core 2% positive out of 12, left lobe 4 out of 12, 8%. No sign of spread on MRI but slight swelling of Lymph nodes. Waiting for bone scan results and third psa. Urine infection triggered investigation, never had psa reading prior to this and had second psa after infection clear 17.2. Active surveillance recommended but I'm not wired to wait. Why such a low gleason and such a high psa ??? Biopsy showed prostatis and chronic inflammation, no PNI. Had second opinion said I should have surgery when PSA reaches 20. why wait until 20 !!! ??? whats magic about 20 !!! if it was 14 would he have said 17. What are your thoughts readers please. Having third opinion I suppose until I get the answer I want -SURGERY and all the implications that surgery entails. What is a dry orgasm like, sorry to be blunt but I am only 47 I like to see and feel the white stuff shooting. Do you still feel the orgasm at all. obviously I appreciate there is a good chance there may be no erection at all but i can hope, I thought I would be really strong and tough but I have cried many times and i get so anxious waiting for all results even a psa. Sure it gets easier with time but seriously can anyone tell me surgery is not the right option just on my age alone ? Regards and a merry xmas to you all George",

Bit of background to diagnosis. urine infection, antibiotics for 5 days 3 urine retests 1 lost , 1 kept in surgery too long so no infection found, 1 found infection still present. I knew it was still there. 7 days antibiotics infection clear, PSA test 4 days later 17.4. 3 dre's by different consultants/doctors only 1 found abnormality (the one that found lump was far more rigorous with his finger ). I have found that I have had to chase every result every step of the way. Sooo frustrating I don't trust anyone to do anything quickly without my harassing them. Encouraged that my age is on my side on the sexual front. learnt a lot just from replies today. I am in process of arranging a third consultation with a top surgeon in London. yes I have realised that skill and experience is vitally important when selecting a surgeon. have to admit radiation scares me to death but I will be well read on that option too but just can't imagine I will select that option. My girlfriend has been fantastic and we are in this together for the duration and no doubt she will be pumping for information too. thanks guys I feel much more optimistic tonight. Cheers George",

Fantastic site, loads of info, love the differences of opinion and amazed at how encouraging and positive you all are despite difficult times and decisions. To start, how do I put info of my condition at bottom of page. I am 47, firefighter from the uk. PSA score 17.4. Gleason score 6, right lobe 1 core 2% positive out of 12, left lobe 4 out of 12, 8%. No sign of spread on MRI but slight swelling of Lymph nodes. Waiting for bone scan results and third psa. Urine infection triggered investigation, never had psa reading prior to this and had second psa after infection clear 17.2. Active surveillance recommended but I'm not wired to wait. Why such a low gleason and such a high psa ??? Biopsy showed prostatis and chronic inflammation, no PNI. Had second opinion said I should have surgery when PSA reaches 20. why wait until 20 !!! ??? whats magic about 20 !!! if it was 14 would he have said 17. What are your thoughts readers please. Having third opinion I suppose until I get the answer I want -SURGERY and all the implications that surgery entails. What is a dry orgasm like, sorry to be blunt but I am only 47 I like to see and feel the white stuff shooting. Do you still feel the orgasm at all. obviously I appreciate there is a good chance there may be no erection at all but i can hope, I thought I would be really strong and tough but I have cried many times and i get so anxious waiting for all results even a psa. Sure it gets easier with time but seriously can anyone tell me surgery is not the right option just on my age alone ? Regards and a merry xmas to you all George",

Fantastic site, loads of info, love the differences of opinion and amazed at how encouraging and positive you all are despite difficult times and decisions. To start, how do I put info of my condition at bottom of page. I am 47, firefighter from the uk. PSA score 17.4. Gleason score 6, right lobe 1 core 2% positive out of 12, left lobe 4 out of 12, 8%. No sign of spread on MRI but slight swelling of Lymph nodes. Waiting for bone scan results and third psa. Urine infection triggered investigation, never had psa reading prior to this and had second psa after infection clear 17.2. Active surveillance recommended but I'm not wired to wait. Why such a low gleason and such a high psa ??? Biopsy showed prostatis and chronic inflammation, no PNI. Had second opinion said I should have surgery when PSA reaches 20. why wait until 20 !!! ??? whats magic about 20 !!! if it was 14 would he have said 17. What are your thoughts readers please. Having third opinion I suppose until I get the answer I want -SURGERY and all the implications that surgery entails. What is a dry orgasm like, sorry to be blunt but I am only 47 I like to see and feel the white stuff shooting. Do you still feel the orgasm at all. obviously I appreciate there is a good chance there may be no erection at all but i can hope, I thought I would be really strong and tough but I have cried many times and i get so anxious waiting for all results even a psa. Sure it gets easier with time but seriously can anyone tell me surgery is not the right option just on my age alone ? Regards and a merry xmas to you all George",

      "Content": "Hi all Just wanted to post a quick update. Now nearly 18 months post op. All clear. Still have the odd drip now and again and it's a reminder to keep up with the kegels !!! Erection issues still but there is still improvement but it's slow. Have been using caverject injections ( easy once you get the hang of them) for over a year and starting to get concerns with scar tissue if I carry on using them. Just trialling the erection cream which is a fairly new addition. Will post any findings, tried last night without much success. Lastly good luck to all out there affected by prostate cancer. Keep the faith, do your research and stay positive. Especially wives and partners, so much easier with loving support xx",

      "Content": "Hi I'm a firefighter serving in the UK. In my local area 5 firefighters including myself have been living with cancer. All have had different types of cancer and as I send this message 3 have died, one has had a stroke and is very poorly and me. I thank my lucky stars every day of my life that I caught my cancer (by accident) early. My friend Oxo died after a 6 year fight against myeloma this week. The strongest, most positive, warrior I have ever met- gutted. All the positivity and fighting in the world couldn't halt the disease. Funeral on the 15th Jan. RIP Pete Oxley 39 years old. Xx Keep strong and keep fighting if you were to put your hand in an unlucky bag to pick a cancer, prostate cancer would be a decent choice if caught early and treat quickly. My thoughts go out to all you out there dealing with cancer xx",
