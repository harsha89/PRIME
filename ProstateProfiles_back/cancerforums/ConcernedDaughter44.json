    "Content": "Hello, I'm happy I found this place and maybe you can give me some answers. My father who is 68 (worried about age factor too) was diagnosed with prostate cancer. All 10 biopsies came back positive but after the pet-ct scan said they don't believe it's left the area. It was recommended by one doc to do hormone blockers and radiation for 6 weeks. I guess what I wasn't to know is this really horrible news ? I'm really concerned. The doc said all 10 coming back as positive is not a good thing but the positive is it hasn't spread. I read about grade and stage and still don't understand it. Would radiation for 8 weeks even be enough? Is there so etching I'm missing here I should be asking?? Thank you for your time soo much and I hope all of you and your loved ones are doing well in your and thirt prognosis as well",
