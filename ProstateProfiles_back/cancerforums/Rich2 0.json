      "Content": "Hi Wallart, I'm sorry to hear about your husbands symptoms. I'm also sorry to know you are suffering along with him. I can only imagine how worried you must be. I think there are some good things that can be applied from alternative / natural medicine -especially with respect to prevention of disease. A healthy diet is a great thing but with PSA numbers like that I would be having a biopsy, bone scan, MRI or whatever other test my urologist ordered without delay. I'm not trying to scare you but you need to know what your dealing with before you can really address it. If he was taking part in a physician supervised active surveillance program and he wanted to focus on healthy eating and such I say great. However, based on your post I hope you can encourage him to move forward with more conventional treatment. This forum has many more senior members that will be responding with more information but please consider seeing a urologist for further testing. I had a biopsy a few months ago and it was pretty much painless. I know others have had different experiences but the pain he's dealing with now is probably worse than any test they can throw at him.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by Ready2Fight Rich2.0, My husband also had 3+3 along with 5% Gleason 4. His pathology still states 3+4 Gleason 7. You however are a 3+3, is this just at the discretion of the pathologist? Hi R2F, That is a good question. I'm not really sure, but the interpretation of the slides themselves is definitely subjective. My initial biopsy slides were sent for a second opinion and the second pathologist downgraded the Gleason score on the same slides. This is the same pathologist who did my final post op pathology report. Maybe he's just a 'glass half full' kind of guy. Technically, if there is any G4 I guess that probably makes me a G7 but once it was out I was more concerned with margins and lymph node dissection so I didn't really question it. If there is only 5% G4, I'm hoping that if any cells escaped during removal that they are most likely to be benign or G6.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by Ron_G Thanks, Chuck. Yeah, I believe I've read of guys on this board that didn't have lymph node dissection--though it seems to be rare.

Maybe a month or so??? I honestly don't think it lasted much longer than that. I actually forgot all about it until I read your post. I think you'll be surprised how fast things heal. It's pretty major surgery so I think it's normal but I'll be interested to see if other guys experienced the same.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by Ready2Fight Rich2.0, My husband also had 3+3 along with 5% Gleason 4. His pathology still states 3+4 Gleason 7. You however are a 3+3, is this just at the discretion of the pathologist? Hi R2F, That is a good question. I'm not really sure, but the interpretation of the slides themselves is definitely subjective. My initial biopsy slides were sent for a second opinion and the second pathologist downgraded the Gleason score on the same slides. This is the same pathologist who did my final post op pathology report. Maybe he's just a 'glass half full' kind of guy. Technically, if there is any G4 I guess that probably makes me a G7 but once it was out I was more concerned with margins and lymph node dissection so I didn't really question it. If there is only 5% G4, I'm hoping that if any cells escaped during removal that they are most likely to be benign or G6.",

      "Content": "Hi Jack, You're smart to go for the biopsy. It's the only way to really know for sure what your dealing with. Mine really wasn't that painful. Inserting the probe was the worst part. The first needle on each side was Novocain or something to ease the pain. The rest of the needles were pretty much painless. I felt them (and heard the gun) but they weren't painful. I can only describe it as a dull hit. Enough to know it happened but not enough to cause any real pain. That gun sounded like a stapler. The doctor fired it before the procedure so I wouldn't be alarmed the first time I heard it. I went home after the biopsy and rested for a couple of hours and then went to my daughters graduation. We waited for two hours and then sat in metal chairs for another two. Good times!",

This really is a great resource and I'm sure you will get a number of helpful responses. In my personal story, I met with two surgeons and each had their own pathology doc's so having the second opinion was part of the process in finding the right surgeon. If I already knew what surgeon I was going with I probably still would have sent my slides out for a second opinion. Otago is a regular here and he linked to an article in this thread that I think you would be interested in.",

      "Content": "Hi Steve, Allow me to borrow the most apropos welcome message from our moderator, Chuck. \"I'm sorry you're here but I'm glad you found us\". This really is a great resource and I'm sure you will get a number of helpful responses. In my personal story, I met with two surgeons and each had their own pathology doc's so having the second opinion was part of the process in finding the right surgeon. If I already knew what surgeon I was going with I probably still would have sent my slides out for a second opinion. Otago is a regular here and he linked to an article in this thread that I think you would be interested in.",

      "Content": "If you look at the stat's in my signature, you'll find some similarities with your situation (age and PSA for starters). I think age might be a positive factor with respect to faster recovery and less side-effects. My initial biopsy showed one side positive but in the end, both lobes were affected. Things can definitely change in the final pathology report. I don't know what my future holds as far as BR. That could happen years down the road, or I could be diagnosed with some other cancer... Who knows what the future will hold. I can honestly say that my outcome so far has been much better than I ever dreamed possible. Also, I think the weight of my prostate was 33 grams. Maybe 20 isn't that bad or 33 is really bad. I don't know, but maybe that will give you something to help ease your mind. Every man is different and there are no guarantees but I wanted to draw your attention to my stat's and let you know that a favorable outcome is quite possible. I don't think my results are the norm but they are real. You have to choose your course of treatment and be willing to accept whatever hand is dealt. It's really going to be a leap of faith. This is where the advice given above about finding the right medical team comes into play. Knowing that you are making the best possible decision for your particular case and that you have selected the best possible medical team is key. Once you settle on a course of action that you feel good about, never look back! You are definitely doing your research and I applaud you for it. Keep digging in and learn as much as you can but try not to let it get you down. I think you have a very good chance for a cure and hopefully with little or no lasting side-effects. Really, the only thing I noticed different in my life now are 5 small scars on my belly and a slightly different sensation when my bladder is full. I'm back to living a full life and enjoying the same things I used to enjoy before my treatment. Hang in there!",

      "Content": "Hi Everyone, This forum is a wealth of information. Thank you all for your contributions. I already purchased the recommended reading and have been learning a lot. It's like taking a drink from a fire hose but I'm making progress. I had a biopsy on June 16th and the pathology report indicated 4 cores positive out of 12. Here are the results from the initial report: Right Apex A, Gleason 3+4=7, involving < 5% Right Lateral Apex B, Gleason 3+3=6, involving < 5% Right Mid C, Gleason 3+4=7, involving < 20% Right Lateral mid D, Variable degrees of prostatic stromal and glandular hypertrophy; negative for malignancy Right Base E, Gleason 3+3=6, involving < 5% F-L Variable degrees of prostatic stromal and glandular hypertrophy; negative for malignancy My urologist sent my slides out for a second opinion (different hospital) and there is quite a bit of variation in the % on core E and the Gleason score dropped on A and C. Here are the results from the second opinion: Right Apex A, Atypical / Suspicious Right Lateral ApexB, Gleason 3+3=6, involving 6% Right Mid C, Gleason 3+3=6, involving 25% Right Base E, Gleason 3+3=6, involving 70% Left Mid I, Atypical glands (suspicious for prostatic carcinoma) I wasn't really sure if the 5% jumping to 70% even mattered, but the delta is not insignificant so I've got a call in to my urologists office to discuss. A drop in Gleason is certainly better than an increase. Of course, if I would have received these reports in the opposite order that would have been exactly the case. I'm only 47 years old so I've got an appointment to meet Mr. DaVinci on 8/26. I guess the final pathology will tell the full story but I'm interested to compare notes with others who have seen some variation from one pathology report to another. I read the part in the book that talked about these biopsies very subjective so I'm not totally freaked out --but I am curious. It looks like both reports indicate no perineural invasion so I'm hopeful for a cure. Thanks for reading!",

      "Content": "Thanks for the replies guys. There is so much to think about with a new diagnosis. My father and grandfather both died in their 60's from cancer. My dad had brachytherapy and was about to start chemotherapy but sadly he declined so rapidly he never even got to start chemo. He passed in 2004. I was very young when my grandfather passed but neither he nor my dad took advantage of any type of early screening. My grandfather never even knew he was full of cancer until he was already in the hospital paralyzed on one side of his body after a stroke. I consider myself lucky to have caught things before they get out of hand and I hope to be around long enough to remind my son and others about the importance of early detection. My PSA was 3.6 back on 7/9/2015 when I was referred to a urologist. We did another test for comparison and it was still high. We talked about doing a biopsy at that point but I was given the option to wait and follow-up with another PSA test in 6 months -which I did. The number continued to rise to over 4 (I can't remember the exact numbers). I am going to get copies of all of my records next week so I can post the numbers over the past year. With a family history and a rising PSA, both doctors believe that, given my age, surgery or radiation would offer a cure. From what I understand, radiation first, makes surgery a bit harder but doing surgery first still leaves radiation as an option in the future if necessary. I guess my thought process is that I'm going to have to deal with this one way or another within the next several years or history is bound to repeat itself. The choice of surgery over radiation is more of a matter of leaving my options open for radiation treatment in the future (hopefully not needed).",

      "Content": "Hi Jim, I had my catheter removed last Wednesday and I experienced a weak and often split steam with a lot of stop and go mixed in for good measure over the first few days. After passing two (painless) clots the stream improved. I was nervous at first and asked the nurse if it was normal and she said it was pretty common. As long as i was emptying all the way she said not to worry. If I felt that I wasn't able to empty completely she said they could do a scan of the bladder. The conversation really didn't go any further since i did feel that it was emptying (eventually). Long story short, it improved over a few days. Hang in there!",

With the ultra-sensitive tests a 0.01 difference is totally insignificant. A reading of 0.1 or greater is where the doctors start to recommend additional treatment such as salvage radiation. Your husband is in the happy zone and you should both be celebrating!!! Judging by your signature, your husband has Gleason 6 which is not the more aggressive type of cancer. I have read that Gleason 6 cells have a hard time surviving outside of the prostate. It is more than likely that he is completely cured already!!",

      "Content": "Hello Gunz, Welcome to the forum. Your PSA appears to be within normal range for your age and it does fluctuate. Especially having sex, a DRE (digital rectal exam), or strenuous exercise within 48 hours of your blood draw. Most guys try to refrain from these things for 72 hours prior. There are other factors that can explain a rise in PSA but your numbers don't appear to be a cause for concern. There are many people on this forum who know a lot more than I do, but I think they will concur. You really don't have anything to stress about at this time. Feel free to take a deep breath, exhale and relax. I'm sure the others will chime in soon, but in the mean time, I hope my response brings you some comfort.",

      "Content": "Great idea for a forum topic. I know we're already maxed out on stickies but this should be easy enough to find using the search feature. We might even want to link to it from one of the existing stickies if appropriate. I'm sure as soon as I hit submit, more will come to me but here are some helpful suggestions -most of which I've found right here on this awesome forum: This takes time - progress is typically measured in weeks or months not days. Some people regain continence quicker than others but don't get frustrated if someone else is progressing a little quicker or if you have a setback. It happens and remember that every case is unique. Kegels are important follow doctors orders but don't overdo it. For some people less is more (see Mayo Clinic protocol in the sticky section) -talk to your doctor if you don't see improvement. Stopping your stream a couple of times while voiding your bladder is a good way to get a feel for the kegel exercise. Try not to 'go' too often. Give your bladder a fighting chance to return to it's normal size over time. It tends to shrink during the post-surgery catheterization period. Try to walk every day if that is medically safe for you. Work your way up to an hour of brisk walking and it will really help with your recovery. Most people get tired and leak more by the end of the day so plan accordingly. I like doing my walking earlier in the day so I don't have to worry about leaks. If you have 'stress incontinence' You may want to 'tighten' before getting up or sitting down. Stay hydrated and allow your body to flush things out. I had some small clots and/or stitches that passed (painlessly). The only time I limit my water intake is after 8:00pm so I can sleep through the night without getting up. Eventually, I'll bump this to 8:30, 9:00... etc. until I find the optimum time. Don't despair if you have a weak or split stream at first. This happened to me (and others) and it worked itself out over about a week or so. Plan to avoid alcohol and caffeine for awhile if you can. Taking certain medications can affect continence. Keep some pads on-hand for future use in case you need them. Even after guys are completely dry and think they are fully recovered, they've found that taking cough syrup or other medication can cause them to spring a leak. If you are not able to empty completely contact your doctor. If you can't go at all call your doctor or emergency number immediately. There are treatments that can help but most doctors won't even consider doing any invasive procedure until you have worked on this for a year. There are collagen injections that can help beef up the urinary sphincter. A bladder sling or even a valve can be an option in really tough cases but most people regain their continence naturally over time. Oh yea, and there is a phenomena some guys experience known as phantom or ghost squirts (use the search tool). You think you leaked but you check the pad and there's nothing there. Disclaimer - follow your doctors instructions and use common sense with respect to exercise.",

We might even want to link to it from one of the existing stickies if appropriate. I'm sure as soon as I hit submit, more will come to me but here are some helpful suggestions -most of which I've found right here on this awesome forum: This takes time - progress is typically measured in weeks or months not days. Some people regain continence quicker than others but don't get frustrated if someone else is progressing a little quicker or if you have a setback. It happens and remember that every case is unique. Kegels are important follow doctors orders but don't overdo it. For some people less is more (see Mayo Clinic protocol in the sticky section) -talk to your doctor if you don't see improvement. Stopping your stream a couple of times while voiding your bladder is a good way to get a feel for the kegel exercise. Try not to 'go' too often. Give your bladder a fighting chance to return to it's normal size over time. It tends to shrink during the post-surgery catheterization period. Try to walk every day if that is medically safe for you. Work your way up to an hour of brisk walking and it will really help with your recovery. Most people get tired and leak more by the end of the day so plan accordingly. I like doing my walking earlier in the day so I don't have to worry about leaks. If you have 'stress incontinence' You may want to 'tighten' before getting up or sitting down. Stay hydrated and allow your body to flush things out. I had some small clots and/or stitches that passed (painlessly). The only time I limit my water intake is after 8:00pm so I can sleep through the night without getting up. Eventually, I'll bump this to 8:30, 9:00... etc. until I find the optimum time. Don't despair if you have a weak or split stream at first. This happened to me (and others) and it worked itself out over about a week or so. Plan to avoid alcohol and caffeine for awhile if you can. Taking certain medications can affect continence. Keep some pads on-hand for future use in case you need them. Even after guys are completely dry and think they are fully recovered, they've found that taking cough syrup or other medication can cause them to spring a leak. If you are not able to empty completely contact your doctor. If you can't go at all call your doctor or emergency number immediately. There are treatments that can help but most doctors won't even consider doing any invasive procedure until you have worked on this for a year. There are collagen injections that can help beef up the urinary sphincter. A bladder sling or even a valve can be an option in really tough cases but most people regain their continence naturally over time. Oh yea, and there is a phenomena some guys experience known as phantom or ghost squirts (use the search tool). You think you leaked but you check the pad and there's nothing there.

      "Content": "Great idea for a forum topic. I know we're already maxed out on stickies but this should be easy enough to find using the search feature. We might even want to link to it from one of the existing stickies if appropriate. I'm sure as soon as I hit submit, more will come to me but here are some helpful suggestions -most of which I've found right here on this awesome forum: This takes time - progress is typically measured in weeks or months not days. Some people regain continence quicker than others but don't get frustrated if someone else is progressing a little quicker or if you have a setback. It happens and remember that every case is unique. Kegels are important follow doctors orders but don't overdo it. For some people less is more (see Mayo Clinic protocol in the sticky section) -talk to your doctor if you don't see improvement. Stopping your stream a couple of times while voiding your bladder is a good way to get a feel for the kegel exercise. Try not to 'go' too often. Give your bladder a fighting chance to return to it's normal size over time. It tends to shrink during the post-surgery catheterization period. Try to walk every day if that is medically safe for you. Work your way up to an hour of brisk walking and it will really help with your recovery. Most people get tired and leak more by the end of the day so plan accordingly. I like doing my walking earlier in the day so I don't have to worry about leaks. If you have 'stress incontinence' You may want to 'tighten' before getting up or sitting down. Stay hydrated and allow your body to flush things out. I had some small clots and/or stitches that passed (painlessly). The only time I limit my water intake is after 8:00pm so I can sleep through the night without getting up. Eventually, I'll bump this to 8:30, 9:00... etc. until I find the optimum time. Don't despair if you have a weak or split stream at first. This happened to me (and others) and it worked itself out over about a week or so. Plan to avoid alcohol and caffeine for awhile if you can. Taking certain medications can affect continence. Keep some pads on-hand for future use in case you need them. Even after guys are completely dry and think they are fully recovered, they've found that taking cough syrup or other medication can cause them to spring a leak. If you are not able to empty completely contact your doctor. If you can't go at all call your doctor or emergency number immediately. There are treatments that can help but most doctors won't even consider doing any invasive procedure until you have worked on this for a year. There are collagen injections that can help beef up the urinary sphincter. A bladder sling or even a valve can be an option in really tough cases but most people regain their continence naturally over time. Oh yea, and there is a phenomena some guys experience known as phantom or ghost squirts (use the search tool). You think you leaked but you check the pad and there's nothing there. Disclaimer - follow your doctors instructions and use common sense with respect to exercise.",

Try to walk every day if that is medically safe for you. Work your way up to an hour of brisk walking and it will really help with your recovery. Most people get tired and leak more by the end of the day so plan accordingly. I like doing my walking earlier in the day so I don't have to worry about leaks. If you have 'stress incontinence' You may want to 'tighten' before getting up or sitting down. Stay hydrated and allow your body to flush things out. I had some small clots and/or stitches that passed (painlessly). The only time I limit my water intake is after 8:00pm so I can sleep through the night without getting up. Eventually, I'll bump this to 8:30, 9:00... etc. until I find the optimum time. Don't despair if you have a weak or split stream at first. This happened to me (and others) and it worked itself out over about a week or so. Plan to avoid alcohol and caffeine for awhile if you can. Taking certain medications can affect continence. Keep some pads on-hand for future use in case you need them. Even after guys are completely dry and think they are fully recovered, they've found that taking cough syrup or other medication can cause them to spring a leak. If you are not able to empty completely contact your doctor. If you can't go at all call your doctor or emergency number immediately. There are treatments that can help but most doctors won't even consider doing any invasive procedure until you have worked on this for a year. There are collagen injections that can help beef up the urinary sphincter. A bladder sling or even a valve can be an option in really tough cases but most people regain their continence naturally over time. Oh yea, and there is a phenomena some guys experience known as phantom or ghost squirts (use the search tool). You think you leaked but you check the pad and there's nothing there. Disclaimer - follow your doctors instructions and use common sense with respect to exercise.",

Definitely continue to do your research. Even if you do end up requiring treatment, your age may actually be a positive factor with respect to recovery. I am also 48 and I'm going to be eight months post surgery next week. I'm doing great with no major side-effects. You may even be a candidate for active surveillance so hang in there and stay positive. You may want to let your wife know about this forum. She might also benefit from the information and support.

      "Content": "I had robotic surgery on Friday afternoon and the doctor said things looked good. He wants to wait for the final pathology report before saying too much -which I totally understand. The released me Saturday night and I've been making good progress. I had spent too much time on our reclining sofa so I broke down and tried the bed at about 3:00am last night. I'm so glad I did. My bleeding was much less this morning and I feel more rested. I still have a low grade fever and I'm very achy but I only took Tylenol twice yesterday and so far nothing yet today. I'm still wearing the bags over the two incisions where the JP drains were but I may be able to remove them soon. I didn't lose much blood in surgery but I kind of made up for it later with the drains. It kept soaking through the gauze and making a mess so they decided to use these adhesive bags. I'm so grateful having my wife here to help with things. She has been really awesome through this whole ordeal.",

      "Content": "Welcome fx! You came to the right place. We have many experts here and I'm sure you will get some very good feedback. I'm not an expert -just a member of 'the club' so please take my non-medical assessment with a grain of salt. The velocity and PSA value you posted does not seem way over the top to me especially for your age but to be honest there's really no way to know for sure if you have cancer without a biopsy. You can always get a second opinion, but if they can feel a nodule a biopsy is probably the next logical step. It won't help to worry yourself to death about it before you have definitive results. It sounds like you already have a biopsy scheduled for next month so that's good on your part. If it helps ease your mind, most of us who have had biopsies find them to be a little uncomfortable but not painful. I have seen a few guys experience pain but I think it's safe to say that most do not. Once you get your biopsy you will have enough information to determine the most appropriate path for you. I'm curious if have a family history of prostate cancer. My father had it at a young age and I consider myself pretty young. That combined with a few other factors pushed me in the direction to pursue treatment. I'm glad I did because mine was already in both lobes with perineural invasion. I fear that if I would have waited too much longer it would have spread outside the prostate. Hang in there and try not to worry too much. In my experience the anxiety leading up to the biopsy was worse than the actual procedure itself.",

Got back on them after about 8 months...don't feel like I ever had surgery muscle wise...but I still have not tried to really train my AB's. Going to this month though! One year should be healed enough. Thanks guys for the encouragement! Thanks for the reply and good luck with your training. Judging by your avatar you look like a pretty strong guy. I'm a bit of a late bloomer in the lifting arena but I was doing Mark Rippetoe's \"Starting Strength\" barbell training routine prior to biopsy. I actually laid off a bit before the biopsy and did nothing overly strenuous between biopsy and surgery. Now I'm starting to feel pretty good --but I don't want to have a setback. I'm most concerned about back squats and dead-lifts. My press and bench press were not very high anyway... Continence is good during the course of a normal day but I'm not so sure I wouldn't leak during a heavy squat. Time will tell... I'll probably start with an empty bar and add in 10lb increments to see how it goes. Good luck in the gym!",

      "Content": "Great idea for a forum topic. I know we're already maxed out on stickies but this should be easy enough to find using the search feature. We might even want to link to it from one of the existing stickies if appropriate. I'm sure as soon as I hit submit, more will come to me but here are some helpful suggestions -most of which I've found right here on this awesome forum: This takes time - progress is typically measured in weeks or months not days. Some people regain continence quicker than others but don't get frustrated if someone else is progressing a little quicker or if you have a setback. It happens and remember that every case is unique. Kegels are important follow doctors orders but don't overdo it. For some people less is more (see Mayo Clinic protocol in the sticky section) -talk to your doctor if you don't see improvement. Stopping your stream a couple of times while voiding your bladder is a good way to get a feel for the kegel exercise. Try not to 'go' too often. Give your bladder a fighting chance to return to it's normal size over time. It tends to shrink during the post-surgery catheterization period. Try to walk every day if that is medically safe for you. Work your way up to an hour of brisk walking and it will really help with your recovery. Most people get tired and leak more by the end of the day so plan accordingly. I like doing my walking earlier in the day so I don't have to worry about leaks. If you have 'stress incontinence' You may want to 'tighten' before getting up or sitting down. Stay hydrated and allow your body to flush things out. I had some small clots and/or stitches that passed (painlessly). The only time I limit my water intake is after 8:00pm so I can sleep through the night without getting up. Eventually, I'll bump this to 8:30, 9:00... etc. until I find the optimum time. Don't despair if you have a weak or split stream at first. This happened to me (and others) and it worked itself out over about a week or so. Plan to avoid alcohol and caffeine for awhile if you can. Taking certain medications can affect continence. Keep some pads on-hand for future use in case you need them. Even after guys are completely dry and think they are fully recovered, they've found that taking cough syrup or other medication can cause them to spring a leak. If you are not able to empty completely contact your doctor. If you can't go at all call your doctor or emergency number immediately. There are treatments that can help but most doctors won't even consider doing any invasive procedure until you have worked on this for a year. There are collagen injections that can help beef up the urinary sphincter. A bladder sling or even a valve can be an option in really tough cases but most people regain their continence naturally over time. Oh yea, and there is a phenomena some guys experience known as phantom or ghost squirts (use the search tool). You think you leaked but you check the pad and there's nothing there. Disclaimer - follow your doctors instructions and use common sense with respect to exercise.",

Eventually, I'll bump this to 8:30, 9:00... etc. until I find the optimum time. Don't despair if you have a weak or split stream at first. This happened to me (and others) and it worked itself out over about a week or so. Plan to avoid alcohol and caffeine for awhile if you can. Taking certain medications can affect continence. Keep some pads on-hand for future use in case you need them.

There are treatments that can help but most doctors won't even consider doing any invasive procedure until you have worked on this for a year. There are collagen injections that can help beef up the urinary sphincter. A bladder sling or even a valve can be an option in really tough cases but most people regain their continence naturally over time.

We might even want to link to it from one of the existing stickies if appropriate. I'm sure as soon as I hit submit, more will come to me but here are some helpful suggestions -most of which I've found right here on this awesome forum: This takes time - progress is typically measured in weeks or months not days. Some people regain continence quicker than others but don't get frustrated if someone else is progressing a little quicker or if you have a setback. It happens and remember that every case is unique. Kegels are important follow doctors orders but don't overdo it. For some people less is more (see Mayo Clinic protocol in the sticky section) -talk to your doctor if you don't see improvement. Stopping your stream a couple of times while voiding your bladder is a good way to get a feel for the kegel exercise. Try not to 'go' too often. Give your bladder a fighting chance to return to it's normal size over time. It tends to shrink during the post-surgery catheterization period. Try to walk every day if that is medically safe for you. Work your way up to an hour of brisk walking and it will really help with your recovery. Most people get tired and leak more by the end of the day so plan accordingly. I like doing my walking earlier in the day so I don't have to worry about leaks. If you have 'stress incontinence' You may want to 'tighten' before getting up or sitting down. Stay hydrated and allow your body to flush things out. I had some small clots and/or stitches that passed (painlessly). The only time I limit my water intake is after 8:00pm so I can sleep through the night without getting up. Eventually, I'll bump this to 8:30, 9:00... etc. until I find the optimum time. Don't despair if you have a weak or split stream at first. This happened to me (and others) and it worked itself out over about a week or so. Plan to avoid alcohol and caffeine for awhile if you can. Taking certain medications can affect continence. Keep some pads on-hand for future use in case you need them. Even after guys are completely dry and think they are fully recovered, they've found that taking cough syrup or other medication can cause them to spring a leak. If you are not able to empty completely contact your doctor. If you can't go at all call your doctor or emergency number immediately. There are treatments that can help but most doctors won't even consider doing any invasive procedure until you have worked on this for a year. There are collagen injections that can help beef up the urinary sphincter. A bladder sling or even a valve can be an option in really tough cases but most people regain their continence naturally over time. Oh yea, and there is a phenomena some guys experience known as phantom or ghost squirts (use the search tool). You think you leaked but you check the pad and there's nothing there.

      "Content": "Great idea for a forum topic. I know we're already maxed out on stickies but this should be easy enough to find using the search feature. We might even want to link to it from one of the existing stickies if appropriate. I'm sure as soon as I hit submit, more will come to me but here are some helpful suggestions -most of which I've found right here on this awesome forum: This takes time - progress is typically measured in weeks or months not days. Some people regain continence quicker than others but don't get frustrated if someone else is progressing a little quicker or if you have a setback. It happens and remember that every case is unique. Kegels are important follow doctors orders but don't overdo it. For some people less is more (see Mayo Clinic protocol in the sticky section) -talk to your doctor if you don't see improvement. Stopping your stream a couple of times while voiding your bladder is a good way to get a feel for the kegel exercise. Try not to 'go' too often. Give your bladder a fighting chance to return to it's normal size over time. It tends to shrink during the post-surgery catheterization period. Try to walk every day if that is medically safe for you. Work your way up to an hour of brisk walking and it will really help with your recovery. Most people get tired and leak more by the end of the day so plan accordingly. I like doing my walking earlier in the day so I don't have to worry about leaks. If you have 'stress incontinence' You may want to 'tighten' before getting up or sitting down. Stay hydrated and allow your body to flush things out. I had some small clots and/or stitches that passed (painlessly). The only time I limit my water intake is after 8:00pm so I can sleep through the night without getting up. Eventually, I'll bump this to 8:30, 9:00... etc. until I find the optimum time. Don't despair if you have a weak or split stream at first. This happened to me (and others) and it worked itself out over about a week or so. Plan to avoid alcohol and caffeine for awhile if you can. Taking certain medications can affect continence. Keep some pads on-hand for future use in case you need them. Even after guys are completely dry and think they are fully recovered, they've found that taking cough syrup or other medication can cause them to spring a leak. If you are not able to empty completely contact your doctor. If you can't go at all call your doctor or emergency number immediately. There are treatments that can help but most doctors won't even consider doing any invasive procedure until you have worked on this for a year. There are collagen injections that can help beef up the urinary sphincter. A bladder sling or even a valve can be an option in really tough cases but most people regain their continence naturally over time. Oh yea, and there is a phenomena some guys experience known as phantom or ghost squirts (use the search tool). You think you leaked but you check the pad and there's nothing there. Disclaimer - follow your doctors instructions and use common sense with respect to exercise.",

This group has helped me tremendously -truly a great group of people. With a G6 you have time to educate yourself and make the right decisions as to what comes next. Definitely continue to do your research. Even if you do end up requiring treatment, your age may actually be a positive factor with respect to recovery. I am also 48 and I'm going to be eight months post surgery next week. I'm doing great with no major side-effects. You may even be a candidate for active surveillance so hang in there and stay positive. You may want to let your wife know about this forum. She might also benefit from the information and support. There are other concerned spouses here like Ready2Fight who are very supportive and active members of the community.",

As you can see by my signature they were able to find G6 and G7 in multiple cores without the MRI but if I had it to do all over again I would do exactly what has been recommended. It wouldn't necessarily have changed the outcome for me, but if they had missed the mark with the initial 12 core biopsy I would have probably waited too long and may not have had clear margins etc. You're lucky to be tracking this early.

The released me Saturday night and I've been making good progress. I had spent too much time on our reclining sofa so I broke down and tried the bed at about 3:00am last night. I'm so glad I did. My bleeding was much less this morning and I feel more rested. I still have a low grade fever and I'm very achy but I only took Tylenol twice yesterday and so far nothing yet today. I'm still wearing the bags over the two incisions where the JP drains were but I may be able to remove them soon. I didn't lose much blood in surgery but I kind of made up for it later with the drains. It kept soaking through the gauze and making a mess so they decided to use these adhesive bags. I'm so grateful having my wife here to help with things. She has been really awesome through this whole ordeal.",
