      "Content": "A little hard to follow this thread since it has been sliced and diced many times. What I understand is that your husband was diagnosed with high risk PC metastatic to bone and seminal vesicles. He responded well to combination therapy and PSA had dropped. A least this one follow up bone scan was negative after that treatment. I suspect the bone scan was ordered since the initial scan was positive and provided a comparison study(cost and convenience may have played a role as well) Certainly PET/CT scans are more accurate but I am not clear about the value of serial bone scans vs. PET/CT scans in this situation. I am not even clear about the value of serial plain bone scans vs. serial PSAs unless there is consideration of local treatment of metastatic disease. In that case a PET/CT or even an MR scan would be preferable. I would concentrate on the good news of his dropping PSA, that is really remarkable and encouraging. My very sincere congratulations. I think that description of MDs ordering more tests for patients with good insurance is called economic credentialing. At least in my hospital that practice pretty much was stopped when cost controls were instituted 10-15 years ago by the insurance companies. Maybe some health care systems still do it? I have been lucky to be a patient in the Kaiser system which uses evidence based medicine rather than any profit motive. And speaking of wasting money, a bone scan is a definite waste of money for well differentiated PCs with PSA <10. (Some would say 20.) They are useful for stage T3, Gleason >7, or PSA >20 and in those circumstances a more accurate test would be preferable. I saw three urologists, two radiation oncologists for my Gleason 4+3, PSA 6.0 PC and each and everyone of them offered a bone scan but said they did not think it was necessary. I agreed. More men should get that kind of advice.",

If your uncle was a candidate for Active Surveillance, at the minimum he likely had a Gleason 6 score and a PSA less than 10. Depending on the protocol he would have had at least one follow up exam by now, either a MR scan or a repeat biopsy. That information would be useful. But given his situation now, the first step would be a T3 MR scan, or even a T2 with endorectal coil to visualize the extent of disease. The fact that the bone scan and CT scan were negative is good evidence that there is less likelihood of bone metastases or lymph node spread. So the next best step would be a referral back to the urologist and a MR scan. The current information you have should not exclude surgery for primary treatment.",

The addition of IMRT would be a consideration if you wanted to cover that possibility. HDR is adequate for Gleason 3+4, at least when I did my research last year. But since my biopsy showed G 4+3, the decision was pretty easy to include IMRT. There might be some value in a T3 parametric MRI to look for signs of more aggressive disease and if that were seen, then including IMRT would make a lot of sense. I would also discuss with the treating MD as to the value of a bone scan and CT scan as part of the initial evaluation.

First, even though a negative DRE is better news than a positive DRE, to say \"that it indicates that the cancer is contained in the prostate\" is overly optimistic. The only test that will definitively answer that question is the surgical pathology. Sometime in the near future MR imaging may provide that information as well. You can use various nomograms to estimate the risk of extracapsular extension, seminal vesicle involvement, and positive lymph nodes but those numbers have to be taken as statistics rather than prognoses. Secondly, the side effects of radiation occur much later than 1-2 years, at least the major side effects of incontinence and ED. You can evaluate that statement for yourself but I think the time range is much longer. And finally, even at your early age you should seriously consider brachytherapy (low or high dose) with IMRT performed by an experienced center such as Radiotherapy Clinics of Georgia.

And secondly he needs a post-op PSA to know how successful the RP was and to determine if he needs further treatment. Also that PSA level will serve as a baseline to judge success of treatment. Remember that even high risk prostate cancer is much better than other cancers and sometimes when we use the term high risk it just sounds bad, especially when people start using the term \"aggressive\". It just sounds bad. But if you use one risk assessment tool (there are many out there), the risk of recurrence at five years is about 30%, and the risk of death at five years is about 3%. And using that tool, the fact that he went from Gleason 5+3 to Gleason 4+5 does not change the risk assessment (at least using this particular tool).

PSAs over the last year have been 6.23. 6.38, 5.4, and 6.32. Repeat biopsy 8/3/2011 showed 3 of 14 cores positive: Gleason 4+3, 33%, Gleason 4+3 68%, Gleason 3+4 30%. The previous area of cancer this time showed atypia. Prostate size 30. DRE negative. All cancers on the left side of the prostate. I have read Walsh, Chodak, Scholz and other sources. I am not inclined for RP because of quality of life issues. I am leaning toward high dose brachy. Added to the mix is I changed insurance from Blue Cross to Kaiser Perm in the last six months, live in the Pacific Northwest where there is limited Kaiser Perm radiation treatment centers, at least I think that is right. Discussed briefly with my urologist who suggested RALP with nerve sparing on the right. My perspective is the nomograms are not encouraging for a surgical cure. Anyone go through a similar process, or start off with similar numbers as my last biopsy? I am very interested in what treatment was chosen and especially interested in experiences with high dose brachtherapy.",
