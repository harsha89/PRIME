      "Content": "I am now 68, married (2nd time) with combined 13 grandchildren. I had Da Vinci RP in Dec 2013. Actually had a bad time of it, but that is not relevant now. Pre-Op PSA 9.6 Gleason 9. Post-Op pathology Gleason 8, Positive margins, Extra capsular spread but no seminal vesical or lymph node involvement. Pathology staged at pT3a. Had External Beam salvage radiation ending May 2014. At recommendation of radiation oncologist I saw a medical oncologist in July 2014. We decided to take no action then. PSAs as follows including last pre-op: 8/8/2013 9.6 (pre-op) 2/18/2014 0.4 (post-op) 6/10/2014 0.1 (post salvage radiation) 9/4/2014 0.1 12/4/2014 0.3 1/2/2015 0.2 3/4/2015 0.2 6/3/2015 0.2 9/3/2015 0.4 hmmmm 12/3/2015 0.8 Yikes! Obviously I am concerned. I have a telephone consult with my urologist early next week. I also have an appointment with the medical oncologist later next week. What should I expect What questions should I be asking? All the best to everyone out there OldCH4",

      "Content": "To answer a couple questions, I have remained in touch with especially my urologist, Misop Han, at Brady Clinic, Johns Hopkins. His advice in Dec 14 when PSA went to 0.3 was to get another reading in a month. When that was 0.2 his advice was to keep watching and said that there can be variation in PSA. This view was coroberated by my radiation oncologist. Also, the medical oncologist had advised in July of 2014 to keep watching and decide when you want to start hormone therapy. He advised that the statistics indicate a perhaps 6 month addition to life expectancy, but that my LE given where I was following the Salvage Radiation was likely in the 10+ year range so waiting to start would not have serious effect. He suggested deciding at what level PSA I wanted to start hormones and suggest 1.0 would be reasonable. All of this advice seemed consistent with possible post radiation bounce in PSA. The following 6 months at 0.2 seemed to confirm. When PSA reached 0.4 in Sept, it was clear further follow up would be needed, but also clear that another PSA would be needed and to wait for a confirming reading. Unfortunately the confirming reading in double. I expect to have a phone call with Dr Han not later than 12/9/15 and have an office appointment with the medical oncologist on 12/10. I have seen some reports of research indicating that combining hormones with chemo can be effective for rapidly doubling PSA. Any thoughts? OldCH4",

He recommended a 3-arm Study of Abiraterone Acetate Alone, Abiraterone Acetate Plus Degarelix, a GnRH Antagonist, and Degarelix Alone for Patients With Prostate Cancer With a Rising PSA or a Rising PSA and Nodal Disease Following Definitive Radical Prostatectomy. I hope to start first treatment on 2/23/16. Do not know yet which arm I am in. Will let folks know. OldCH4",
