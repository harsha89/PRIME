      "Content": "Hey...I would never crack wise on you, Prato. Deja Vu...these two fine forums need to be combined I've already given you two good links. So for the benefit of those who don't go 'over there', I'll say again: Basically any machine that delivers IMRT/IGRT or SBRT are going to be equally safe. The Varian class machines use a method where they continuously deliver the radiation while the gantry is moving around the body. Other machines do a start and stop method. The Varian is not safer, per se, it is just faster. The actual zapping/IMRT from a Varian machine takes about six minutes. The only real advantage seems to be time, and the much reduced chance of you, and your organs moving around while being zapped. The advantage to the radiation center is that they can treat more people in the same amount of time and thus make more money. Technology development isn't just oriented for client effectiveness, it also generate additional revenue. As to choosing the center, they will all have to follow the same accepted protocols for safety. MSK is very well regarded and does a lot of PCa work. The convenience to you will be valuable. As already said, it's is the people, not the brand of machine that's the most important factor. Near the end of the treatment, they sometimes narrow the beam and zero in on likely troublesome areas. In my case, they referred to this as a 3.6 Gy \"boost\".. Picture this...The older LINACS, the x-ray machines that deliver the radiation, usually moved into position and stopped, became stationary, while the dose was administered. It would then move on to a new position and fire again..Typically, it would repeat this 7 times during a treatment session. This reduced the exposure to healthy tissue to one seventh of what the target received..With the newer LINACS, the gantry is in motion (Rapid-Arc/Edge) when the beam is activated so healthy tissue receives much less exposure..The RO, with help, writes a treatment plan, a dose volume histogram, so these moving arcs seldom if ever overlap as the gantry can accommodate a wide range of motion, but the target, the focal point, receives the full intended dose..Also, the new machines have a built-in CAT scanner that checks organ position just before the beam is activated...If anything has moved out of position for any reason the beam is aborted until the situation is corrected, and the control room that the techs are in while you're being zapped is most impressive, with an array of PC's and displays. The company that developed this new technology is Varian and the first generation of these LINACS were called Rapid-Arcs. They were introduced about ten years ago. It's the minimum you should be looking for. Today, the newest models are even more advanced....Most up to date treatment centers, especially ones like MSK, even satellites being phased out, use this new equipment. Just as important is the skill of the techs and RO's that operate it. Since you worry about everything....have you checked out the bathrooms yet, Prato? They come in very handy when relieving yourself of the preparation water. Just do it, already!",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by Michael F .....You previously mentioned a possible personality conflict with Dr S. If surgery is your choice, toss the personality conflict out the window!!! You will be asleep during surgery and not arguing with the surgeon!!! Your objective is 100% Cure! Very true...He has the rep of being an excellent surgeon. Most of them, even the average ones, have strong egos, but aren't know to have good bedside manners. Emory is as good as you'll find in the southeast. Stay calm, positive, research and take notes. Finally pick the procedure YOU are most comfortable with. Remembering there are no silver bullets, you'll do well.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by Michael F ...... Dr Partin is at one of the world's TOP PCa Centers (JH) and has performed over 5,500 RPs so I sense that he has seen every possible outcome. He turned down your follow up appointment request based on his sound judgement. Stay strong and optimistic. We are all in this war together! MF That may be the most important point of all. I visited JHMI three times and can attest to the quality of their physicians. Dr. Partain is one of the best, and as such, his time is limited, so I'm guessing he invests it where it can do the most good. He probably turned down your request because in his considered opinion, no action is needed. A very good sign! In any event, you have a most rational plan. Fingers crossed.",

      "Content": "Hey...I would never crack wise on you, Prato. Deja Vu...these two fine forums need to be combined I've already given you two good links. So for the benefit of those who don't go 'over there', I'll say again: Basically any machine that delivers IMRT/IGRT or SBRT are going to be equally safe. The Varian class machines use a method where they continuously deliver the radiation while the gantry is moving around the body. Other machines do a start and stop method. The Varian is not safer, per se, it is just faster. The actual zapping/IMRT from a Varian machine takes about six minutes. The only real advantage seems to be time, and the much reduced chance of you, and your organs moving around while being zapped. The advantage to the radiation center is that they can treat more people in the same amount of time and thus make more money. Technology development isn't just oriented for client effectiveness, it also generate additional revenue. As to choosing the center, they will all have to follow the same accepted protocols for safety. MSK is very well regarded and does a lot of PCa work. The convenience to you will be valuable. As already said, it's is the people, not the brand of machine that's the most important factor. Near the end of the treatment, they sometimes narrow the beam and zero in on likely troublesome areas. In my case, they referred to this as a 3.6 Gy \"boost\".. Picture this...The older LINACS, the x-ray machines that deliver the radiation, usually moved into position and stopped, became stationary, while the dose was administered. It would then move on to a new position and fire again..Typically, it would repeat this 7 times during a treatment session. This reduced the exposure to healthy tissue to one seventh of what the target received..With the newer LINACS, the gantry is in motion (Rapid-Arc/Edge) when the beam is activated so healthy tissue receives much less exposure..The RO, with help, writes a treatment plan, a dose volume histogram, so these moving arcs seldom if ever overlap as the gantry can accommodate a wide range of motion, but the target, the focal point, receives the full intended dose..Also, the new machines have a built-in CAT scanner that checks organ position just before the beam is activated...If anything has moved out of position for any reason the beam is aborted until the situation is corrected, and the control room that the techs are in while you're being zapped is most impressive, with an array of PC's and displays. The company that developed this new technology is Varian and the first generation of these LINACS were called Rapid-Arcs. They were introduced about ten years ago. It's the minimum you should be looking for. Today, the newest models are even more advanced....Most up to date treatment centers, especially ones like MSK, even satellites being phased out, use this new equipment. Just as important is the skill of the techs and RO's that operate it. Since you worry about everything....have you checked out the bathrooms yet, Prato? They come in very handy when relieving yourself of the preparation water. Just do it, already!",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by joseywales Hello, Last night I got a call from local survivor. He recommended I make the drive to MD Anderson and ask for a second opinion on treatment and inquire about Proton Therapy. I made a call today and they said that based on my stats I am a potential candidate for proton treatment, but the earliest appointment that have is April 1. I'm torn between my urologist's opinion that I need surgery soon and my desire to get another opinion at MDA and review all options??? Almost all of us have been where you find yourself today, Josey. Good advise both from your friend, and from brothers here. Keep bugging MDA, and you'll get a much quicker appointment. Calling a specific doctor there will help. Check out their website. https://www.mdanderson.org/research/...lty-staff.html You do not have garden variety PCa, and the true experts at MDA are as good as it gets. Get your butt there ASAP. Don't concern yourself with any particular therapy yet, you need to better understand your diagnosis. Your urologist and surgeon are throwing around numbers they know can't be very accurate. I'd be uncomfortable with that. Do get your biopsy sides sent to Epstein at JH for a second opinion, ASAP. Where are you located, and who is your urologist and surgeon??? Don't worry...you'll get through this, and we're here to help.",

      "Content": "Dr. Tewari does a frozen section during surgery for a quick pathology check. A worthwhile procedure IMHO, not often done. Takes more time and drives up the cost. You can thank Allen Edel for this list of questions: Questions to ask (and not ask) on a first urologist visit after a biopsy Am I a good candidate for surgery? What about anatomic abnormalities, previous hernia, effects of anesthesia, cardiovascular disease, diabetes or other comorbidities? I would like to get a second opinion on my biopsy slides from Epstein's lab at Johns Hopkins. What is my highest Gleason score? How many cores were positive? What was the highest percent of cancer in any core? What is my stage, and risk level? (You should know your PSA \u2013 if you don\u2019t, ask). How big is my prostate, and what is my prostate density? If stage is T3 or T4: How can surgery be a good option if only the prostate capsule is taken out, leaving the rest behind? Aren\u2019t the side effects of adjuvant radiation worse than if I had radiation at the start? (he may not know this.) Am I a candidate for active surveillance (why, why not), and if so, what are your Active Surveillance criteria and protocol? Why those and not something more or less stringent? Should I get a genetic test before deciding? Will that be covered by insurance? How many of the surgery technique you practice (whether robotic, laparoscopic or open) have you performed? (1000+ would be a good answer) Are you going to be doing all of the really important parts of my procedure yourself? (You need to be particularly careful about this at major training institutions where residents may be doing some parts of the surgery, or even the whole operation, while \u201cyour\u201d surgeon is overseeing it.) In the last year, what was your positive surgical margin rate? (Should be less than 10% among men with stage pT2) What is your \"trifecta\" rate? (tricky because you don't want cherry-picked patients) What is your estimate of my risk for lasting incontinence; i.e., a pad or more after a year? What about lasting stress incontinence? climacturia? penile shrinkage? inguinal hernia? Peyronie\u2019s? orgasmic pain or dysfunction? What kind of anastomosis technique do you use? (total - not just anterior) Will the bladder neck be spared? How will you maximize the urethral sparing? If you have positive biopsy cores near the apex: How will you ensure that all cancerous tissue is removed there? Will you take frozen sections and have a pathologist standing by to determine margins and how much of neurovascular bundles can be spared? What measures will you take to assure the integrity of the neurovascular bundles? What kind of penile rehab do you suggest? What kind of imaging (Bone scan, CT or MRI) is necessary for men at my risk level? Will you sample lymph nodes (PLND) or take extended lymph nodes (ePLND), or does it seem unnecessary for my risk level? If so, how will you find them (fluorescent dye)? How will you minimize risk of lymphocele and lymphedema? What kind of aftercare (including sexual rehab) will you provide, and how will we monitor side effects, and for how long? Will you regularly monitor my urinary and erectile recovery progress with validated questionnaires like EPIC and IPSS? How will I be monitored for recurrence? Will I get an ultrasensitive PSA test? How will you decide the point at which you would recommend I see a radiation oncologist? Do you use the Decipher test? Questions not to ask: Is my age a factor in whether active surveillance is right for me? (only you can decide whether you are willing to live more years with the side effects of treatment, or whether you prefer to be treated while younger when side effects are apt to be less - see this link) What treatments should I consider and which is the best for me? (this would be asking your doctor to be an expert in treatments outside of his specialty, and also to know which benefits and risks are most important to you \u2013 he doesn\u2019t have time or inclination to be expert in all therapies, and he\u2019s not a mind reader.) If I were your father, what would you recommend? (You don\u2019t know how he feels about his father (lol), and more importantly, what he would feel most comfortable with is not necessarily what you would feel most comfortable with. This is your decision to make and live with \u2013 don\u2019t give up your power!)",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by ASAdvocate I have read that the sections on radiation in the forthcoming edition have been written by someone else. That fact may blunt some of the criticisms from radiation advocates that the previous editions were biased in favor of surgery and outdated on other treatments. Sounds like a good reason for everyone to buy this next edition. The existing book is not to be dismissed. Those with a bias toward radiation are hard pressed to offer up any even handed, scholarly, well research text. The 'book' as as good as it gets, and many of us without axes to grind don't find it in anyway biased toward any treatment. That Dr. Walsh covers surgery more extensively is quite understandable....he is a surgeon after all. IMHO he has given radiation it's just due.

      "Content": "Dr. Tewari does a frozen section during surgery for a quick pathology check. A worthwhile procedure IMHO, not often done. Takes more time and drives up the cost. You can thank Allen Edel for this list of questions: Questions to ask (and not ask) on a first urologist visit after a biopsy Am I a good candidate for surgery? What about anatomic abnormalities, previous hernia, effects of anesthesia, cardiovascular disease, diabetes or other comorbidities? I would like to get a second opinion on my biopsy slides from Epstein's lab at Johns Hopkins. What is my highest Gleason score? How many cores were positive? What was the highest percent of cancer in any core? What is my stage, and risk level? (You should know your PSA \u2013 if you don\u2019t, ask). How big is my prostate, and what is my prostate density? If stage is T3 or T4: How can surgery be a good option if only the prostate capsule is taken out, leaving the rest behind? Aren\u2019t the side effects of adjuvant radiation worse than if I had radiation at the start? (he may not know this.) Am I a candidate for active surveillance (why, why not), and if so, what are your Active Surveillance criteria and protocol? Why those and not something more or less stringent? Should I get a genetic test before deciding? Will that be covered by insurance? How many of the surgery technique you practice (whether robotic, laparoscopic or open) have you performed? (1000+ would be a good answer) Are you going to be doing all of the really important parts of my procedure yourself? (You need to be particularly careful about this at major training institutions where residents may be doing some parts of the surgery, or even the whole operation, while \u201cyour\u201d surgeon is overseeing it.) In the last year, what was your positive surgical margin rate? (Should be less than 10% among men with stage pT2) What is your \"trifecta\" rate? (tricky because you don't want cherry-picked patients) What is your estimate of my risk for lasting incontinence; i.e., a pad or more after a year? What about lasting stress incontinence? climacturia? penile shrinkage? inguinal hernia? Peyronie\u2019s? orgasmic pain or dysfunction? What kind of anastomosis technique do you use? (total - not just anterior) Will the bladder neck be spared? How will you maximize the urethral sparing? If you have positive biopsy cores near the apex: How will you ensure that all cancerous tissue is removed there? Will you take frozen sections and have a pathologist standing by to determine margins and how much of neurovascular bundles can be spared? What measures will you take to assure the integrity of the neurovascular bundles? What kind of penile rehab do you suggest? What kind of imaging (Bone scan, CT or MRI) is necessary for men at my risk level? Will you sample lymph nodes (PLND) or take extended lymph nodes (ePLND), or does it seem unnecessary for my risk level? If so, how will you find them (fluorescent dye)? How will you minimize risk of lymphocele and lymphedema? What kind of aftercare (including sexual rehab) will you provide, and how will we monitor side effects, and for how long? Will you regularly monitor my urinary and erectile recovery progress with validated questionnaires like EPIC and IPSS? How will I be monitored for recurrence? Will I get an ultrasensitive PSA test? How will you decide the point at which you would recommend I see a radiation oncologist? Do you use the Decipher test? Questions not to ask: Is my age a factor in whether active surveillance is right for me? (only you can decide whether you are willing to live more years with the side effects of treatment, or whether you prefer to be treated while younger when side effects are apt to be less - see this link) What treatments should I consider and which is the best for me? (this would be asking your doctor to be an expert in treatments outside of his specialty, and also to know which benefits and risks are most important to you \u2013 he doesn\u2019t have time or inclination to be expert in all therapies, and he\u2019s not a mind reader.) If I were your father, what would you recommend? (You don\u2019t know how he feels about his father (lol), and more importantly, what he would feel most comfortable with is not necessarily what you would feel most comfortable with. This is your decision to make and live with \u2013 don\u2019t give up your power!)",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by joseywales Hello, Last night I got a call from local survivor. He recommended I make the drive to MD Anderson and ask for a second opinion on treatment and inquire about Proton Therapy. I made a call today and they said that based on my stats I am a potential candidate for proton treatment, but the earliest appointment that have is April 1. I'm torn between my urologist's opinion that I need surgery soon and my desire to get another opinion at MDA and review all options??? Almost all of us have been where you find yourself today, Josey. Good advise both from your friend, and from brothers here. Keep bugging MDA, and you'll get a much quicker appointment. Calling a specific doctor there will help. Check out their website. https://www.mdanderson.org/research/...lty-staff.html You do not have garden variety PCa, and the true experts at MDA are as good as it gets. Get your butt there ASAP. Don't concern yourself with any particular therapy yet, you need to better understand your diagnosis. Your urologist and surgeon are throwing around numbers they know can't be very accurate. I'd be uncomfortable with that. Do get your biopsy sides sent to Epstein at JH for a second opinion, ASAP. Where are you located, and who is your urologist and surgeon??? Don't worry...you'll get through this, and we're here to help.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by ASAdvocate I have read that the sections on radiation in the forthcoming edition have been written by someone else. That fact may blunt some of the criticisms from radiation advocates that the previous editions were biased in favor of surgery and outdated on other treatments. Sounds like a good reason for everyone to buy this next edition. The existing book is not to be dismissed. Those with a bias toward radiation are hard pressed to offer up any even handed, scholarly, well research text. The 'book' as as good as it gets, and many of us without axes to grind don't find it in anyway biased toward any treatment. That Dr. Walsh covers surgery more extensively is quite understandable....he is a surgeon after all. IMHO he has given radiation it's just due. Read it yourselves, my brothers, and make up your own minds.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by joseywales Hello, Last night I got a call from local survivor. He recommended I make the drive to MD Anderson and ask for a second opinion on treatment and inquire about Proton Therapy. I made a call today and they said that based on my stats I am a potential candidate for proton treatment, but the earliest appointment that have is April 1. I'm torn between my urologist's opinion that I need surgery soon and my desire to get another opinion at MDA and review all options??? Almost all of us have been where you find yourself today, Josey. Good advise both from your friend, and from brothers here. Keep bugging MDA, and you'll get a much quicker appointment. Calling a specific doctor there will help. Check out their website. https://www.mdanderson.org/research/...lty-staff.html You do not have garden variety PCa, and the true experts at MDA are as good as it gets. Get your butt there ASAP. Don't concern yourself with any particular therapy yet, you need to better understand your diagnosis. Your urologist and surgeon are throwing around numbers they know can't be very accurate. I'd be uncomfortable with that. Do get your biopsy sides sent to Epstein at JH for a second opinion, ASAP. Where are you located, and who is your urologist and surgeon??? Don't worry...you'll get through this, and we're here to help.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by DjinTonic .... When I asked when we could stop testing, he said Never, there are recurrences after 20 and 25 years. The only relief I might get is spacing the PSA testing out a bit more; in my case perhaps from 3 to 6 months (\"We'll see,\" was the best carrot my doc could dangle.) I would file this under Fridge Lightbulb Questions. In any case worrying is useless: you're fine (until you're not)! Or, as A.E. Newman said \"What, me worry?\" At a certain point, or age, or level of health, might not many say, \"screw it, I ain't worrying about it anymore.\"? That's my plan. Move over, Mr. Newman.",

      "Content": "Hi Kyle and welcome to the club none of us wanted to join. Given the numbers you\u0092ve posted, and hoping your husband is in otherwise good physical condition, his prognosis is excellent. That you\u0092re taking quick and decisive action is IMHO a big advantage. Some spend too much time becoming Google MDs. Researching PCa is important, but is can be overdone and result in indecisiveness. My cardiologist, at a renowned teaching hospital, told me that almost all physicians he knows, upon PCa diagnosis, immediately go for surgery. Some points in my surgery: 1. A recliner wasn\u0092t mandatory, just lots of pillows and roll out of bed carefully. 2. The medical team told me specifically NOT to use KY jelly on the catheter...you\u0092ll get some better stuff at the hospital. 3. A good stool softener is mandatory; that first bowel movement can take several days. 4. I found an Amazon $15 abdominal binder most helpful the first several weeks. 5. Lots of Kegals, but not when the catheter is in. 6. Walk, walk, walk, then walk some more. 7. Sorry, but no sex for at least a month Best of luck! Trust your surgeon has lots of experience.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by Michael F A neighbor/friend who is > 70 yo and a retired former high level hospital administrator at several top institutions across the U.S. did his research and opted for HDR. He went to a local top level academic teaching center and had 2 Treatments exactly 1 week apart. The \"tubes\" were inserted by a URO MD in a procedure suite in one building. Once in place, he was wheeled on the procedure platform to a completely different building for the radiation exposure. This was performed by a Nuclear Medicine MD in a special lead-lined suite. He is covered by Medicare. I'll ask him for an approximate breakdown of charges and distributions between URO and NM Depts. MF That is the exact procedure the HDR experts, like Dr. Demanes in CA explained to me. Medicine, being a business first, dosen\u2019t usually follow such a protocol. The Dr. Denis used does NOT partner with a URO surgeon. One of the reasons I didn\u2019t go that route. BTW, excellent evaluation Michael",

      "Content": "Welcome to the club we'd all rather not be in, BOB. As usual you've gotten fine advise above. Several observations: I did the trek up to Johns Hopkins three times from south FL, and finally decided not to have surgery there, so I understand your reluctance for travel and desire for convenience. However, you can/should avail yourself of the excellent phone & e-mail advice you can get from JH, as a prior patient. You do have time. Those 0.03 and the 0.08 readings are still very low. Several more PSA's will give you a better picture, and while SRT + ADT may very well be in your future, the more research you do, the better final choices you can make. Remember surgeons get payed to cut, and radiologists get payed to zap, so advice from both JH and WVa are in your favor and an important part of your discovery process. The GA-68 PSMA PET Scan has the highest probability of picking something up, IF it exists, but even that is at much higher readings than you have right now. Keep collecting facts, and best of luck. You have a very good chance of beating this devil.",

Several observations: I did the trek up to Johns Hopkins three times from south FL, and finally decided not to have surgery there, so I understand your reluctance for travel and desire for convenience. However, you can/should avail yourself of the excellent phone & e-mail advice you can get from JH, as a prior patient. You do have time. Those 0.03 and the 0.08 readings are still very low. Several more PSA's will give you a better picture, and while SRT + ADT may very well be in your future, the more research you do, the better final choices you can make. Remember surgeons get payed to cut, and radiologists get payed to zap, so advice from both JH and WVa are in your favor and an important part of your discovery process. The GA-68 PSMA PET Scan has the highest probability of picking something up, IF it exists, but even that is at much higher readings than you have right now. Keep collecting facts, and best of luck.

And I will continue to inquire and share what I find and I really appreciate all you do for these forums. Denis That's good, as long as it's not through rose colored glasses, Denis, as your title for this thread suggests. There are some reports that are not so glowing, that you may or may not have run across. I'm certain, that at this point, you HOPE HDR mono brachy is 'the right treatment' for you. I hope so, too. But just like RT, AS, or surgery, no intervention is perfect for ALL, and no intervention is without it's own challenges. Good luck to you.",

      "Content": "The full paper is a most interesting read. Good find, Djin! A clip from it that many should take note of is: <<<Oncotype Dx Prostate, Promark, and Decipher are multimarker tests that, similar to PTEN, are more specific to prostate cancer. Oncotype Dx Prostate and Promark are developed for the prediction of the presence of adverse pathology. Decipher appears to have utility in predicting metastasis and death following prostatectomy.>>> Basically Decipher should be used after surgery, and the other genome tests utilized before treatment, to help predict the possibility of poor pathology. It's amazing how few urologists know this. Mine didn't, until I pointed it out, as my signature below will attest to. I discovered this reading the 2015 Harvard Annual Report on Prostate Diseases. It is an excellent source of prostate science. As definitive and objective read as I have found: \"2017 Annual Report on Prostate Diseases\", 118 pages, Harvard Health Publications. Updated yearly. https://www.health.harvard.edu/",

      "Content": "Best wishes for an undetectable...Jared. So what did your Uro have to say? From what I read, a PSMA DCFPyL PET Scan, coupled with an erc3TMRI is about as good as can be done in the USA. There is a free clinical trial for the PET Scan at the NCI in Bethesda. I had it and they found a one inch tumor in my otherwise empty prostate cavity. Try as they could, no tiny mets were seen. Two months of 2ADT down, and SRT starts next week.",

I had it and they found a one inch tumor in my otherwise empty prostate cavity. Try as they could, no tiny mets were seen. Two months of 2ADT down, and SRT starts next week.",

Its biggest drawback is a shortage of practitioners, which I have heard is attributed to lower payments from insurance providers. Limited long term results is a concern, skilled and experienced physicians are tough to find, and as cynical as I\u2019ve become about some medical \u2018professionals\u2019 I still find it hard to accept that insurance remuneration is a major cause.

I just had one two DAYS post RT, from my GI doc who was having a bunch of blood draws done. Not surprisingly my PSA and my T are undetectable, but it\u0092s much too early for my hoped for entry to the Zero Club. You mention another Lupron shot. Are you staying on Casodex for the duration of your Lupron therapy? I ask because I\u0092m on the same 2ADT regime an am flummoxed about continuing the Casodex.

      "Content": "Crohn's, Ulcerative Colitis May Be Tied to Prostate Cancer FRIDAY, Dec. 14, 2018 (HealthDay News) -- Men with inflammatory bowel disease have a significantly greater risk of prostate cancer, a new study finds. about 1 million men in the United States have inflammatory bowel disease, which includes Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis. \"These patients may need to be screened more carefully than a man without inflammatory bowel disease,\" said study lead author Dr. Shilajit Kundu. Screening for prostate cancer begins with a blood test called a prostate-specific antigen (PSA) test. PSA is a substance made by the prostate gland. \"If a man with inflammatory bowel disease has an elevated PSA, it may be an indicator of prostate cancer,\" said Kundu, an associate professor of urology at Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine in Chicago. For the study, researchers looked at more than 1,000 men with inflammatory bowel disease and a \"control group\" of more than 9,300 men without the disease. The men were followed for 18 years. Men with inflammatory bowel disease had higher PSA levels, and were four to five times more likely to develop prostate cancer than those in the control group, the investigators found. The research doesn't show that IBD causes prostate cancer, however, only that the two are linked. Kundu noted that many men with inflamed digestive tracts have elevated PSA levels. He said their doctors shouldn't dismiss those numbers as simply the result of inflammation. \"Many doctors think their PSA is elevated just because they have an inflammatory condition,\" Kundu said in a university news release. For now, however, until more research is underway, \"there is no data to guide how we should treat these men,\" he added. The study was published Dec. 7, 2018 in the journal European Urology.",

      "Content": "Golf as a metaphor for PCa or life.....you'll do best when you don't overthink it. Carcinophobia or Fear of Getting Cancer You see it everywhere \u2013 articles and news reports that feature experts who talk about how they\u2019ve just discovered that a particular environmental factor causes cancer or that exposure to particular sweeteners or preservatives will give you cancer. Additionally, celebrities keep cancer in the public eye by candidly discussing their cancer diagnoses or treatments in magazines and newspapers across the country. Did you ever get the idea that it is almost impossible to walk out the door without coming in contact with something that\u2019s sure to cause a tumor? Even though it is said jokingly, people often remark that everything causes cancer nowadays. It\u2019s no wonder, then, that people are beginning to fear getting cancer before they even develop it. Carcinophobia, or the fear of getting cancer, typically affects those who have had the disease or have known people afflicted with it. Of course, it\u2019s normal to experience fear of any kind but people with carcinophobia often take their fear to the extreme and when that fear impacts their everyday life it becomes a source for concern. Of all the phobias that exist, the fear of getting cancer can be one of the most debilitating. Take a fear of heights in comparison: the person afflicted with this fear can avoid heights and continue about their day. But a person who suffers from carcinophobia carries their fear with them. For them, the slightest pain or the appearance of new mole or lump on the body is a guarantee of cancer. What follows is anxiety about everything associated with cancer: the possibility of painful treatments, loss of hair, spreading of the cancer, and death. They\u2019re also bound to worry about how it will impact their personal lives. Who will take care of them while they\u2019re sick? Who will take care of their family and children if they succumb to the disease? These concerns and many others often arise before they\u2019ve even visited a doctor. Eventually, the fear can become so overwhelming that the person may refuse to leave their safe environment and may shun people because they might be \u201ccarrying\u201d carcinogens. The good news is that this fear of getting cancer, like any other phobia, is treatable. Like most things, we often fear what we don\u2019t understand and it can be helpful for the person who is afraid of getting cancer to research the latest advancements in cancer treatment technologies. Cognitive behavioral therapy can help the person become aware of their unreasonable thoughts and fears so they can view the situation more realistically and react in a healthier way. If all else fails, psychological counseling combined with the use of anxiety disorders medications has shown great results in many people. If you or someone you know suffers from a fear of getting cancer, please seek professional help before it impacts your life. Left untreated, carcinophobia can become a debilitating condition that can affect every aspect of the sufferer\u2019s work, social, and home life. For more information on carcinophobia and treatment for the fear of getting cancer, contact Dr. Andrew Rosen and The Center for Treatment of Anxiety and Mood Disorders in Delray Beach, Florida. They can be reached by calling 561-496-1094 or by emailing Dr. Rosen and The Center today.",

Most of the physicians at NCI are primarily researchers rather than clinicians in my experience. Partin, Allaf, Carter, and Pavlovich at John Hopkins are all brilliant, and while they aren't the 'most' experienced surgeons you will find, you wont go wrong with any of them, and yes, I've met with three and spoken to all four.

For the first time we have a commercially-available scan that can detect the location of the cancer outside the prostate at a much earlier stage than what was possible with standard bone scans and CT scans. Axumin can detect the cancer\u2019s location while PSA is in the one to five range, rather than in the 10 to 30 range.>>> Clearly not where cog6 is at...thankfully.",

      "Content": "Good info above. Here is another informative and current article about BCR and Axumin scans. https://www.prostateoncology.com/201...e-with-axumin/ Interestingly it says: <<<The Axumin PET scan, which was approved by the FDA in 2017, is the newest and possibly biggest game-changer for men with PSA relapse since the approval of PSA screening itself. For the first time we have a commercially-available scan that can detect the location of the cancer outside the prostate at a much earlier stage than what was possible with standard bone scans and CT scans. Axumin can detect the cancer\u2019s location while PSA is in the one to five range, rather than in the 10 to 30 range.>>> Clearly not where cog6 is at...thankfully.",

      "Content": "Lots of good information in the stickies, above. Since originality is just undiscovered plagiarism, I'm including an extensive list from my friend, Nick. Only item I'd add is buy an abdominal binder on Amazon for about $15. It helps with post surgery discomfort: PRE-SURGERY: \u2022 One thing I forgot to do is make sure everyone touching me in the OR would be In Network with my insurance plan. I\u2019ve read a lot of articles about this problem and hopefully will not receive any surprise bills. \u2022 I suggest renting a recliner. Oh boy, do I wish I did that! I don\u2019t care how big and ugly it looks. I had made a wedge of pillows for my bed but it is not the same thing. With a cath the bed was hard and painful to get in and out of! I should have used a home healthcare company and got one with an electric lift mechanism. \u2022 I had only 12 days between my decision day and surgery, had I had more I would have worked on my core as has been suggested here. So start doing core strengthening to help with your recovery. \u2022 If you are single you should consider hiring a healthcare aide for five days. It\u2019s a lot of work to ask of a friend. My wife did a great job of caring for me, I can\u2019t imaging coming home to an empty place. \u2022 Buy a Grabber! As Seen On TV. You won\u2019t want to bend over much after surgery. \u2022 Lay out carpet runners and big old towels between your bed and the toilet. Lots of dripping for a few days. \u2022 It would not hurt if a couple of days prior you went on a very light, easy to digest, plant based diet. You will be looking forward to your first post op BM and it will be easier if it wasn\u2019t a steak dinner! \u2022 I had pre-positioned a folding table parallel to my bed so everything was within in reach, there\u2019s lots of meds to take and you need to keep a log of their schedule. Do as much of this as you can before you leave for surgery. \u2022 Buy a blindfold so you can nap with the sun coming into your room. \u2022 Have a good thermometer on hand. I had some fever for a few days. \u2022 Have all the chargers you need laid out with extension cords so your electronics are within reach of your bed or recliner. \u2022 Buy a case of bottled water. Strategically place them around your path. \u2022 Buy some Pressure Socks. I had a pair from my international travel days and the hospital didn\u2019t give out any, so if you have those you can sleep better at night not worrying about blood clots. \u2022 I took a 4\u2019x4\u2019 piece of painter\u2019s plastic drop cloth and laid it between the mattress and sheet, just in case the pad didn\u2019t get absorb any accidents. \u2022 Buy lots of continence supplies and keep your receipt to return what you don\u2019t use. I bought lots of Depend type products but those pads don\u2019t absorb much . I have been using small washcloths which are a lot more absorbent and washable. \u2022 At the medical supply store buy a spare cath tube anchor for your other leg, or ask the hospital for one upon discharge. If they give you only one it can lose its stickiness. \u2022 Buy a bottle of Milk of Magnesia just in case you need it when you get home. I did. The prescription stool softener wasn\u2019t powerful enough. \u2022 Have bathrobes on hand. A bathrobe will have a pocket for your phone. I went through several a day because of leakage. We did a lot of laundry. Those \u201cpads\u201d\u2026they aren\u2019t very absorbent, they\u2019re for drips. \u2022 If possible, I\u2019d have stayed two days. Sure, I was \u201cable\u201d to leave by noon the next day but I wasn\u2019t really prepared for the headache of a tube sticking out and yanking Mr. Midnight. Ugh. So arrange this possibility. \u2022 Bring earplugs! I was in a very new, high tech private hospital room and there were so many machines and gizmos, clicking, beeping, hissing, etc. I had to twist kleenex into ear plugs in order to sleep. \u2022 Have some double bagged paper grocery bags with handles ready, so you can walk with your cath. \u2022 I was zonked for a good 5 days after surgery, so don\u2019t assume you can do high cognitive functioning. Pay your bills, balance your checkbook, etc. Today is Post Op Day 7 and I started contacting clients just now. That\u2019s how difficult my recovery was. \u2022 Leave very early for your surgery day so you don\u2019t stress with the traffic and parking. It\u2019s traumatic enough. Surgery day is different than all your previous consult days. You\u2019re no longer dealing with the friendly folks in the Urology department, suddenly you\u2019re the patient of a very efficient, fast moving, no nonsense surgical department, which feels like the heart of the hospital, and they are a very serious bunch. So don\u2019t be late! \u2022 Naively, I had planned to do a lot of reading and Netflix watching in my recovery, but you can\u2019t sit still for very long, you need to walk a lot. My attention span was fuzzy and short. \u2022 If you don\u2019t already have one, buy a plastic stool for your shower. The highlight of your day will be two hot showers, and with a cath it\u2019s hard to stand. \u2022 If you have a pair of crutches, put one in the shower so you can get up from your stool, and the other for your bedside. With one hand you\u2019re holding the cath tube so you really have only one arm to get out of bed or up from your stool, the crutch will help. \u2022 Buy a lot of easy to digest food ahead of time. They\u2019ll tell you that you can eat what you want, but it will be less painful to have a BM if you ate a very light, plant based diet. \u2022 Place large plastic waste bins in your bedroom and bathroom. You\u2019ll be making a lot of wet diapers! POST SURGERY: \u2022 My operation went \u201cpicture perfect\u201d I was told. The problems occurred when I got home, mainly the cath bothered me and my balls swelled up into one painful cantaloupe! So I was not very mobile and had to rely on the pain killers more than I wanted to. \u2022 When they prep you for discharge they will give you lots of instructions and you won\u2019t be able to take notes fast enough. They\u2019ll say don\u2019t worry, they\u2019ll give you instructions. Forget that! Never enough. Record them on your cell phone so you can play back later. We played back their tutorials many times. \u2022 If you don\u2019t have a big recliner and will use a bed to sleep, make a large wedge of pillows so your butt is higher than the edge of the bed where the cath tube goes over to the bag, so gravity will work properly. Halfway through the night make sure the bag isn\u2019t too full! Use a plastic bucket for the bag. \u2022 What made my recovery so miserable, besides the cath, was my balls swelled up and I needed to ice them down with a bag. Quite common they said, so have an ice bag ready. Well, that's all I can remember for now. I watched on YouTube \"Mark's Prostate Cancer Experience\".",

Only item I'd add is buy an abdominal binder on Amazon for about $15. It helps with post surgery discomfort: PRE-SURGERY: \u2022 One thing I forgot to do is make sure everyone touching me in the OR would be In Network with my insurance plan. I\u2019ve read a lot of articles about this problem and hopefully will not receive any surprise bills. \u2022 I suggest renting a recliner. Oh boy, do I wish I did that! I don\u2019t care how big and ugly it looks. I had made a wedge of pillows for my bed but it is not the same thing. With a cath the bed was hard and painful to get in and out of! I should have used a home healthcare company and got one with an electric lift mechanism. \u2022 I had only 12 days between my decision day and surgery, had I had more I would have worked on my core as has been suggested here. So start doing core strengthening to help with your recovery. \u2022 If you are single you should consider hiring a healthcare aide for five days. It\u2019s a lot of work to ask of a friend. My wife did a great job of caring for me, I can\u2019t imaging coming home to an empty place. \u2022 Buy a Grabber! As Seen On TV. You won\u2019t want to bend over much after surgery. \u2022 Lay out carpet runners and big old towels between your bed and the toilet. Lots of dripping for a few days. \u2022 It would not hurt if a couple of days prior you went on a very light, easy to digest, plant based diet. You will be looking forward to your first post op BM and it will be easier if it wasn\u2019t a steak dinner! \u2022 I had pre-positioned a folding table parallel to my bed so everything was within in reach, there\u2019s lots of meds to take and you need to keep a log of their schedule. Do as much of this as you can before you leave for surgery. \u2022 Buy a blindfold so you can nap with the sun coming into your room. \u2022 Have a good thermometer on hand. I had some fever for a few days. \u2022 Have all the chargers you need laid out with extension cords so your electronics are within reach of your bed or recliner. \u2022 Buy a case of bottled water. Strategically place them around your path. \u2022 Buy some Pressure Socks. I had a pair from my international travel days and the hospital didn\u2019t give out any, so if you have those you can sleep better at night not worrying about blood clots. \u2022 I took a 4\u2019x4\u2019 piece of painter\u2019s plastic drop cloth and laid it between the mattress and sheet, just in case the pad didn\u2019t get absorb any accidents. \u2022 Buy lots of continence supplies and keep your receipt to return what you don\u2019t use. I bought lots of Depend type products but those pads don\u2019t absorb much . I have been using small washcloths which are a lot more absorbent and washable. \u2022 At the medical supply store buy a spare cath tube anchor for your other leg, or ask the hospital for one upon discharge. If they give you only one it can lose its stickiness. \u2022 Buy a bottle of Milk of Magnesia just in case you need it when you get home. I did. The prescription stool softener wasn\u2019t powerful enough. \u2022 Have bathrobes on hand. A bathrobe will have a pocket for your phone. I went through several a day because of leakage. We did a lot of laundry. Those \u201cpads\u201d\u2026they aren\u2019t very absorbent, they\u2019re for drips. \u2022 If possible, I\u2019d have stayed two days. Sure, I was \u201cable\u201d to leave by noon the next day but I wasn\u2019t really prepared for the headache of a tube sticking out and yanking Mr. Midnight. Ugh. So arrange this possibility. \u2022 Bring earplugs! I was in a very new, high tech private hospital room and there were so many machines and gizmos, clicking, beeping, hissing, etc. I had to twist kleenex into ear plugs in order to sleep. \u2022 Have some double bagged paper grocery bags with handles ready, so you can walk with your cath. \u2022 I was zonked for a good 5 days after surgery, so don\u2019t assume you can do high cognitive functioning. Pay your bills, balance your checkbook, etc. Today is Post Op Day 7 and I started contacting clients just now. That\u2019s how difficult my recovery was. \u2022 Leave very early for your surgery day so you don\u2019t stress with the traffic and parking. It\u2019s traumatic enough.

      "Content": "Lots of good information in the stickies, above. Since originality is just undiscovered plagiarism, I'm including an extensive list from my friend, Nick. Only item I'd add is buy an abdominal binder on Amazon for about $15. It helps with post surgery discomfort: PRE-SURGERY: \u2022 One thing I forgot to do is make sure everyone touching me in the OR would be In Network with my insurance plan. I\u2019ve read a lot of articles about this problem and hopefully will not receive any surprise bills. \u2022 I suggest renting a recliner. Oh boy, do I wish I did that! I don\u2019t care how big and ugly it looks. I had made a wedge of pillows for my bed but it is not the same thing. With a cath the bed was hard and painful to get in and out of! I should have used a home healthcare company and got one with an electric lift mechanism. \u2022 I had only 12 days between my decision day and surgery, had I had more I would have worked on my core as has been suggested here. So start doing core strengthening to help with your recovery. \u2022 If you are single you should consider hiring a healthcare aide for five days. It\u2019s a lot of work to ask of a friend. My wife did a great job of caring for me, I can\u2019t imaging coming home to an empty place. \u2022 Buy a Grabber! As Seen On TV. You won\u2019t want to bend over much after surgery. \u2022 Lay out carpet runners and big old towels between your bed and the toilet. Lots of dripping for a few days. \u2022 It would not hurt if a couple of days prior you went on a very light, easy to digest, plant based diet. You will be looking forward to your first post op BM and it will be easier if it wasn\u2019t a steak dinner! \u2022 I had pre-positioned a folding table parallel to my bed so everything was within in reach, there\u2019s lots of meds to take and you need to keep a log of their schedule. Do as much of this as you can before you leave for surgery. \u2022 Buy a blindfold so you can nap with the sun coming into your room. \u2022 Have a good thermometer on hand. I had some fever for a few days. \u2022 Have all the chargers you need laid out with extension cords so your electronics are within reach of your bed or recliner. \u2022 Buy a case of bottled water. Strategically place them around your path. \u2022 Buy some Pressure Socks. I had a pair from my international travel days and the hospital didn\u2019t give out any, so if you have those you can sleep better at night not worrying about blood clots. \u2022 I took a 4\u2019x4\u2019 piece of painter\u2019s plastic drop cloth and laid it between the mattress and sheet, just in case the pad didn\u2019t get absorb any accidents. \u2022 Buy lots of continence supplies and keep your receipt to return what you don\u2019t use. I bought lots of Depend type products but those pads don\u2019t absorb much . I have been using small washcloths which are a lot more absorbent and washable. \u2022 At the medical supply store buy a spare cath tube anchor for your other leg, or ask the hospital for one upon discharge. If they give you only one it can lose its stickiness. \u2022 Buy a bottle of Milk of Magnesia just in case you need it when you get home. I did. The prescription stool softener wasn\u2019t powerful enough. \u2022 Have bathrobes on hand. A bathrobe will have a pocket for your phone. I went through several a day because of leakage. We did a lot of laundry. Those \u201cpads\u201d\u2026they aren\u2019t very absorbent, they\u2019re for drips. \u2022 If possible, I\u2019d have stayed two days. Sure, I was \u201cable\u201d to leave by noon the next day but I wasn\u2019t really prepared for the headache of a tube sticking out and yanking Mr. Midnight. Ugh. So arrange this possibility. \u2022 Bring earplugs! I was in a very new, high tech private hospital room and there were so many machines and gizmos, clicking, beeping, hissing, etc. I had to twist kleenex into ear plugs in order to sleep. \u2022 Have some double bagged paper grocery bags with handles ready, so you can walk with your cath. \u2022 I was zonked for a good 5 days after surgery, so don\u2019t assume you can do high cognitive functioning. Pay your bills, balance your checkbook, etc. Today is Post Op Day 7 and I started contacting clients just now. That\u2019s how difficult my recovery was. \u2022 Leave very early for your surgery day so you don\u2019t stress with the traffic and parking. It\u2019s traumatic enough. Surgery day is different than all your previous consult days. You\u2019re no longer dealing with the friendly folks in the Urology department, suddenly you\u2019re the patient of a very efficient, fast moving, no nonsense surgical department, which feels like the heart of the hospital, and they are a very serious bunch. So don\u2019t be late! \u2022 Naively, I had planned to do a lot of reading and Netflix watching in my recovery, but you can\u2019t sit still for very long, you need to walk a lot. My attention span was fuzzy and short. \u2022 If you don\u2019t already have one, buy a plastic stool for your shower. The highlight of your day will be two hot showers, and with a cath it\u2019s hard to stand. \u2022 If you have a pair of crutches, put one in the shower so you can get up from your stool, and the other for your bedside. With one hand you\u2019re holding the cath tube so you really have only one arm to get out of bed or up from your stool, the crutch will help. \u2022 Buy a lot of easy to digest food ahead of time. They\u2019ll tell you that you can eat what you want, but it will be less painful to have a BM if you ate a very light, plant based diet. \u2022 Place large plastic waste bins in your bedroom and bathroom. You\u2019ll be making a lot of wet diapers! POST SURGERY: \u2022 My operation went \u201cpicture perfect\u201d I was told. The problems occurred when I got home, mainly the cath bothered me and my balls swelled up into one painful cantaloupe! So I was not very mobile and had to rely on the pain killers more than I wanted to. \u2022 When they prep you for discharge they will give you lots of instructions and you won\u2019t be able to take notes fast enough. They\u2019ll say don\u2019t worry, they\u2019ll give you instructions. Forget that! Never enough. Record them on your cell phone so you can play back later. We played back their tutorials many times. \u2022 If you don\u2019t have a big recliner and will use a bed to sleep, make a large wedge of pillows so your butt is higher than the edge of the bed where the cath tube goes over to the bag, so gravity will work properly. Halfway through the night make sure the bag isn\u2019t too full! Use a plastic bucket for the bag. \u2022 What made my recovery so miserable, besides the cath, was my balls swelled up and I needed to ice them down with a bag. Quite common they said, so have an ice bag ready. Well, that's all I can remember for now. I watched on YouTube \"Mark's Prostate Cancer Experience\".",

They\u2019ll say don\u2019t worry, they\u2019ll give you instructions. Forget that! Never enough. Record them on your cell phone so you can play back later. We played back their tutorials many times. \u2022 If you don\u2019t have a big recliner and will use a bed to sleep, make a large wedge of pillows so your butt is higher than the edge of the bed where the cath tube goes over to the bag, so gravity will work properly. Halfway through the night make sure the bag isn\u2019t too full! Use a plastic bucket for the bag. \u2022 What made my recovery so miserable, besides the cath, was my balls swelled up and I needed to ice them down with a bag. Quite common they said, so have an ice bag ready. Well, that's all I can remember for now. I watched on YouTube \"Mark's Prostate Cancer Experience\".",

      "Content": "Lots of good information in the stickies, above. Since originality is just undiscovered plagiarism, I'm including an extensive list from my friend, Nick. Only item I'd add is buy an abdominal binder on Amazon for about $15. It helps with post surgery discomfort: PRE-SURGERY: \u2022 One thing I forgot to do is make sure everyone touching me in the OR would be In Network with my insurance plan. I\u2019ve read a lot of articles about this problem and hopefully will not receive any surprise bills. \u2022 I suggest renting a recliner. Oh boy, do I wish I did that! I don\u2019t care how big and ugly it looks. I had made a wedge of pillows for my bed but it is not the same thing. With a cath the bed was hard and painful to get in and out of! I should have used a home healthcare company and got one with an electric lift mechanism. \u2022 I had only 12 days between my decision day and surgery, had I had more I would have worked on my core as has been suggested here. So start doing core strengthening to help with your recovery. \u2022 If you are single you should consider hiring a healthcare aide for five days. It\u2019s a lot of work to ask of a friend. My wife did a great job of caring for me, I can\u2019t imaging coming home to an empty place. \u2022 Buy a Grabber! As Seen On TV. You won\u2019t want to bend over much after surgery. \u2022 Lay out carpet runners and big old towels between your bed and the toilet. Lots of dripping for a few days. \u2022 It would not hurt if a couple of days prior you went on a very light, easy to digest, plant based diet. You will be looking forward to your first post op BM and it will be easier if it wasn\u2019t a steak dinner! \u2022 I had pre-positioned a folding table parallel to my bed so everything was within in reach, there\u2019s lots of meds to take and you need to keep a log of their schedule. Do as much of this as you can before you leave for surgery. \u2022 Buy a blindfold so you can nap with the sun coming into your room. \u2022 Have a good thermometer on hand. I had some fever for a few days. \u2022 Have all the chargers you need laid out with extension cords so your electronics are within reach of your bed or recliner. \u2022 Buy a case of bottled water. Strategically place them around your path. \u2022 Buy some Pressure Socks. I had a pair from my international travel days and the hospital didn\u2019t give out any, so if you have those you can sleep better at night not worrying about blood clots. \u2022 I took a 4\u2019x4\u2019 piece of painter\u2019s plastic drop cloth and laid it between the mattress and sheet, just in case the pad didn\u2019t get absorb any accidents. \u2022 Buy lots of continence supplies and keep your receipt to return what you don\u2019t use. I bought lots of Depend type products but those pads don\u2019t absorb much . I have been using small washcloths which are a lot more absorbent and washable. \u2022 At the medical supply store buy a spare cath tube anchor for your other leg, or ask the hospital for one upon discharge. If they give you only one it can lose its stickiness. \u2022 Buy a bottle of Milk of Magnesia just in case you need it when you get home. I did. The prescription stool softener wasn\u2019t powerful enough. \u2022 Have bathrobes on hand. A bathrobe will have a pocket for your phone. I went through several a day because of leakage. We did a lot of laundry. Those \u201cpads\u201d\u2026they aren\u2019t very absorbent, they\u2019re for drips. \u2022 If possible, I\u2019d have stayed two days. Sure, I was \u201cable\u201d to leave by noon the next day but I wasn\u2019t really prepared for the headache of a tube sticking out and yanking Mr. Midnight. Ugh. So arrange this possibility. \u2022 Bring earplugs! I was in a very new, high tech private hospital room and there were so many machines and gizmos, clicking, beeping, hissing, etc. I had to twist kleenex into ear plugs in order to sleep. \u2022 Have some double bagged paper grocery bags with handles ready, so you can walk with your cath. \u2022 I was zonked for a good 5 days after surgery, so don\u2019t assume you can do high cognitive functioning. Pay your bills, balance your checkbook, etc. Today is Post Op Day 7 and I started contacting clients just now. That\u2019s how difficult my recovery was. \u2022 Leave very early for your surgery day so you don\u2019t stress with the traffic and parking. It\u2019s traumatic enough. Surgery day is different than all your previous consult days. You\u2019re no longer dealing with the friendly folks in the Urology department, suddenly you\u2019re the patient of a very efficient, fast moving, no nonsense surgical department, which feels like the heart of the hospital, and they are a very serious bunch. So don\u2019t be late! \u2022 Naively, I had planned to do a lot of reading and Netflix watching in my recovery, but you can\u2019t sit still for very long, you need to walk a lot. My attention span was fuzzy and short. \u2022 If you don\u2019t already have one, buy a plastic stool for your shower. The highlight of your day will be two hot showers, and with a cath it\u2019s hard to stand. \u2022 If you have a pair of crutches, put one in the shower so you can get up from your stool, and the other for your bedside. With one hand you\u2019re holding the cath tube so you really have only one arm to get out of bed or up from your stool, the crutch will help. \u2022 Buy a lot of easy to digest food ahead of time. They\u2019ll tell you that you can eat what you want, but it will be less painful to have a BM if you ate a very light, plant based diet. \u2022 Place large plastic waste bins in your bedroom and bathroom. You\u2019ll be making a lot of wet diapers! POST SURGERY: \u2022 My operation went \u201cpicture perfect\u201d I was told. The problems occurred when I got home, mainly the cath bothered me and my balls swelled up into one painful cantaloupe!

They\u2019ll say don\u2019t worry, they\u2019ll give you instructions. Forget that! Never enough. Record them on your cell phone so you can play back later. We played back their tutorials many times. \u2022 If you don\u2019t have a big recliner and will use a bed to sleep, make a large wedge of pillows so your butt is higher than the edge of the bed where the cath tube goes over to the bag, so gravity will work properly. Halfway through the night make sure the bag isn\u2019t too full! Use a plastic bucket for the bag. \u2022 What made my recovery so miserable, besides the cath, was my balls swelled up and I needed to ice them down with a bag. Quite common they said, so have an ice bag ready. Well, that's all I can remember for now. I watched on YouTube \"Mark's Prostate Cancer Experience\".",

I\u2019ve read a lot of articles about this problem and hopefully will not receive any surprise bills. \u2022 I suggest renting a recliner. Oh boy, do I wish I did that! I don\u2019t care how big and ugly it looks. I had made a wedge of pillows for my bed but it is not the same thing. With a cath the bed was hard and painful to get in and out of! I should have used a home healthcare company and got one with an electric lift mechanism. \u2022 I had only 12 days between my decision day and surgery, had I had more I would have worked on my core as has been suggested here. So start doing core strengthening to help with your recovery. \u2022 If you are single you should consider hiring a healthcare aide for five days. It\u2019s a lot of work to ask of a friend. My wife did a great job of caring for me, I can\u2019t imaging coming home to an empty place. \u2022 Buy a Grabber! As Seen On TV. You won\u2019t want to bend over much after surgery. \u2022 Lay out carpet runners and big old towels between your bed and the toilet. Lots of dripping for a few days. \u2022 It would not hurt if a couple of days prior you went on a very light, easy to digest, plant based diet. You will be looking forward to your first post op BM and it will be easier if it wasn\u2019t a steak dinner! \u2022 I had pre-positioned a folding table parallel to my bed so everything was within in reach, there\u2019s lots of meds to take and you need to keep a log of their schedule. Do as much of this as you can before you leave for surgery. \u2022 Buy a blindfold so you can nap with the sun coming into your room. \u2022 Have a good thermometer on hand. I had some fever for a few days. \u2022 Have all the chargers you need laid out with extension cords so your electronics are within reach of your bed or recliner. \u2022 Buy a case of bottled water. Strategically place them around your path. \u2022 Buy some Pressure Socks. I had a pair from my international travel days and the hospital didn\u2019t give out any, so if you have those you can sleep better at night not worrying about blood clots. \u2022 I took a 4\u2019x4\u2019 piece of painter\u2019s plastic drop cloth and laid it between the mattress and sheet, just in case the pad didn\u2019t get absorb any accidents. \u2022 Buy lots of continence supplies and keep your receipt to return what you don\u2019t use. I bought lots of Depend type products but those pads don\u2019t absorb much . I have been using small washcloths which are a lot more absorbent and washable. \u2022 At the medical supply store buy a spare cath tube anchor for your other leg, or ask the hospital for one upon discharge. If they give you only one it can lose its stickiness. \u2022 Buy a bottle of Milk of Magnesia just in case you need it when you get home. I did. The prescription stool softener wasn\u2019t powerful enough. \u2022 Have bathrobes on hand. A bathrobe will have a pocket for your phone. I went through several a day because of leakage. We did a lot of laundry. Those \u201cpads\u201d\u2026they aren\u2019t very absorbent, they\u2019re for drips. \u2022 If possible, I\u2019d have stayed two days. Sure, I was \u201cable\u201d to leave by noon the next day but I wasn\u2019t really prepared for the headache of a tube sticking out and yanking Mr. Midnight. Ugh. So arrange this possibility. \u2022 Bring earplugs! I was in a very new, high tech private hospital room and there were so many machines and gizmos, clicking, beeping, hissing, etc. I had to twist kleenex into ear plugs in order to sleep. \u2022 Have some double bagged paper grocery bags with handles ready, so you can walk with your cath. \u2022 I was zonked for a good 5 days after surgery, so don\u2019t assume you can do high cognitive functioning. Pay your bills, balance your checkbook, etc. Today is Post Op Day 7 and I started contacting clients just now. That\u2019s how difficult my recovery was. \u2022 Leave very early for your surgery day so you don\u2019t stress with the traffic and parking. It\u2019s traumatic enough. Surgery day is different than all your previous consult days. You\u2019re no longer dealing with the friendly folks in the Urology department, suddenly you\u2019re the patient of a very efficient, fast moving, no nonsense surgical department, which feels like the heart of the hospital, and they are a very serious bunch. So don\u2019t be late! \u2022 Naively, I had planned to do a lot of reading and Netflix watching in my recovery, but you can\u2019t sit still for very long, you need to walk a lot. My attention span was fuzzy and short. \u2022 If you don\u2019t already have one, buy a plastic stool for your shower. The highlight of your day will be two hot showers, and with a cath it\u2019s hard to stand. \u2022 If you have a pair of crutches, put one in the shower so you can get up from your stool, and the other for your bedside. With one hand you\u2019re holding the cath tube so you really have only one arm to get out of bed or up from your stool, the crutch will help. \u2022 Buy a lot of easy to digest food ahead of time. They\u2019ll tell you that you can eat what you want, but it will be less painful to have a BM if you ate a very light, plant based diet. \u2022 Place large plastic waste bins in your bedroom and bathroom. You\u2019ll be making a lot of wet diapers! POST SURGERY: \u2022 My operation went \u201cpicture perfect\u201d I was told. The problems occurred when I got home, mainly the cath bothered me and my balls swelled up into one painful cantaloupe! So I was not very mobile and had to rely on the pain killers more than I wanted to. \u2022 When they prep you for discharge they will give you lots of instructions and you won\u2019t be able to take notes fast enough.

You will be looking forward to your first post op BM and it will be easier if it wasn\u2019t a steak dinner! \u2022 I had pre-positioned a folding table parallel to my bed so everything was within in reach, there\u2019s lots of meds to take and you need to keep a log of their schedule. Do as much of this as you can before you leave for surgery. \u2022 Buy a blindfold so you can nap with the sun coming into your room. \u2022 Have a good thermometer on hand. I had some fever for a few days. \u2022 Have all the chargers you need laid out with extension cords so your electronics are within reach of your bed or recliner. \u2022 Buy a case of bottled water. Strategically place them around your path. \u2022 Buy some Pressure Socks. I had a pair from my international travel days and the hospital didn\u2019t give out any, so if you have those you can sleep better at night not worrying about blood clots. \u2022 I took a 4\u2019x4\u2019 piece of painter\u2019s plastic drop cloth and laid it between the mattress and sheet, just in case the pad didn\u2019t get absorb any accidents. \u2022 Buy lots of continence supplies and keep your receipt to return what you don\u2019t use. I bought lots of Depend type products but those pads don\u2019t absorb much . I have been using small washcloths which are a lot more absorbent and washable. \u2022 At the medical supply store buy a spare cath tube anchor for your other leg, or ask the hospital for one upon discharge. If they give you only one it can lose its stickiness. \u2022 Buy a bottle of Milk of Magnesia just in case you need it when you get home. I did. The prescription stool softener wasn\u2019t powerful enough. \u2022 Have bathrobes on hand. A bathrobe will have a pocket for your phone. I went through several a day because of leakage. We did a lot of laundry. Those \u201cpads\u201d\u2026they aren\u2019t very absorbent, they\u2019re for drips. \u2022 If possible, I\u2019d have stayed two days. Sure, I was \u201cable\u201d to leave by noon the next day but I wasn\u2019t really prepared for the headache of a tube sticking out and yanking Mr. Midnight. Ugh. So arrange this possibility. \u2022 Bring earplugs! I was in a very new, high tech private hospital room and there were so many machines and gizmos, clicking, beeping, hissing, etc. I had to twist kleenex into ear plugs in order to sleep. \u2022 Have some double bagged paper grocery bags with handles ready, so you can walk with your cath. \u2022 I was zonked for a good 5 days after surgery, so don\u2019t assume you can do high cognitive functioning. Pay your bills, balance your checkbook, etc. Today is Post Op Day 7 and I started contacting clients just now. That\u2019s how difficult my recovery was. \u2022 Leave very early for your surgery day so you don\u2019t stress with the traffic and parking. It\u2019s traumatic enough. Surgery day is different than all your previous consult days. You\u2019re no longer dealing with the friendly folks in the Urology department, suddenly you\u2019re the patient of a very efficient, fast moving, no nonsense surgical department, which feels like the heart of the hospital, and they are a very serious bunch. So don\u2019t be late! \u2022 Naively, I had planned to do a lot of reading and Netflix watching in my recovery, but you can\u2019t sit still for very long, you need to walk a lot. My attention span was fuzzy and short. \u2022 If you don\u2019t already have one, buy a plastic stool for your shower. The highlight of your day will be two hot showers, and with a cath it\u2019s hard to stand. \u2022 If you have a pair of crutches, put one in the shower so you can get up from your stool, and the other for your bedside. With one hand you\u2019re holding the cath tube so you really have only one arm to get out of bed or up from your stool, the crutch will help. \u2022 Buy a lot of easy to digest food ahead of time. They\u2019ll tell you that you can eat what you want, but it will be less painful to have a BM if you ate a very light, plant based diet. \u2022 Place large plastic waste bins in your bedroom and bathroom. You\u2019ll be making a lot of wet diapers! POST SURGERY: \u2022 My operation went \u201cpicture perfect\u201d I was told. The problems occurred when I got home, mainly the cath bothered me and my balls swelled up into one painful cantaloupe! So I was not very mobile and had to rely on the pain killers more than I wanted to. \u2022 When they prep you for discharge they will give you lots of instructions and you won\u2019t be able to take notes fast enough. They\u2019ll say don\u2019t worry, they\u2019ll give you instructions. Forget that! Never enough. Record them on your cell phone so you can play back later. We played back their tutorials many times. \u2022 If you don\u2019t have a big recliner and will use a bed to sleep, make a large wedge of pillows so your butt is higher than the edge of the bed where the cath tube goes over to the bag, so gravity will work properly. Halfway through the night make sure the bag isn\u2019t too full! Use a plastic bucket for the bag. \u2022 What made my recovery so miserable, besides the cath, was my balls swelled up and I needed to ice them down with a bag. Quite common they said, so have an ice bag ready. Well, that's all I can remember for now. I watched on YouTube \"Mark's Prostate Cancer Experience\".",

Not just ask, but insist on them! Many surgeons, unfortunately, have glib answers to avoid giving us their specific results. You can be certain they have them. One simple question to ask is, \u201chow do YOU know you\u2019re a successful surgeon?\u201d Their answer should be telling; be ready for some clever BS double-talk.",

Given my low intermediate risk category, but rapidly escalating post surgery persistent PSA, both strongly had a recommendation for RT....one said ADT, the other said no ADT. I very reluctantly went with Casodex and Lupron. Time will tell. \u201cConversely, in men with less aggressive disease (ie, organ confined disease and pathologic grade groups 1\u20133), PSA level did not impact cancer-specific survival. In these cases, PSA persistence might be a proxy of benign prostatic tissue left behind during RP, and the impact of competing causes of death would thereby be more pronounced. Further, these patients did not demonstrate a benefit from postoperative RT.\u201d",

      "Content": "I have followed your journey for opinions and 'facts' on several forums also, Denis. You have been shaking the tree very hard, and at least to me, have been trying to prove to yourself that AS is a reasonable path. All well and good. I spent over a year doing much the same about AS, and that was without the benefit of being on any forums. If you can be painfully introspective, are you certain that your choice wasn't already made, and all your study hasn't done to just reinforce your initial desire to avoid active treatment? The credo ASA offers, that making choices has three steps, maybe (four): (Research), Decision, Resolution, and Closure, is spot on. My journey, after a year, and I had a little 3+4 also, ended when Dr. Bal Carter at JH, who knows more about AS than you or I ever will, told me I was kidding myself about staying on AS. He had a long list of reasons, but it all came down to I would need treatment in the foreseeable future, I was in very good shape now, and if I wanted another 15 or 20 worry free good years why prolong the commitment? Your five years younger that me, but the question is still valid. Do you want to hold off for ten years, when you'll be 75, and maybe in not such good shape? Yes, new discoveries are happening all the time, but they will probably not be proven out over that time period. If you want AS, go for it, find comfort in the decision, and relax.

      "Content": "Originally Posted by SubDenis I might be the person you referred to as deciding against AS using Decipher. I respectfully disagree with your assessment. That's not the point Denis, and it isn't MY assessment. The Decipher test, while top notch, isn't an ideal bio-marker for decision making before surgery. There are at least two other tests more specifically designed for that. While bio-markers are only a piece of the decision making process, it behooves our brothers to utilize the best tests and information available. Your anecdotal information, whatever it is, doesn't trump either Dr. Marc Garnick, Editor in Chief of the superb annual Harvard Prostate Disease Report, or this study, by another noted physician: http://ascopubs.org/doi/full/10.1200...source=TrendMD That being said, I'm sure intervention will work out for you, and you have finally come to a reasonable choice.

      "Content": "I have followed your journey for opinions and 'facts' on several forums also, Denis. You have been shaking the tree very hard, and at least to me, have been trying to prove to yourself that AS is a reasonable path. All well and good. I spent over a year doing much the same about AS, and that was without the benefit of being on any forums. If you can be painfully introspective, are you certain that your choice wasn't already made, and all your study hasn't done to just reinforce your initial desire to avoid active treatment? The credo ASA offers, that making choices has three steps, maybe (four): (Research), Decision, Resolution, and Closure, is spot on. My journey, after a year, and I had a little 3+4 also, ended when Dr. Bal Carter at JH, who knows more about AS than you or I ever will, told me I was kidding myself about staying on AS. He had a long list of reasons, but it all came down to I would need treatment in the foreseeable future, I was in very good shape now, and if I wanted another 15 or 20 worry free good years why prolong the commitment? Your five years younger that me, but the question is still valid. Do you want to hold off for ten years, when you'll be 75, and maybe in not such good shape? Yes, new discoveries are happening all the time, but they will probably not be proven out over that time period. If you want AS, go for it, find comfort in the decision, and relax. Just guard against confirmation bias, and best of luck on your journey",

Years ago, Johns Hopkins conducted a survey of 17,000 TRUE GLEASON 6 patients (meaning post-op pathology confirmed only G6). Out of all 17,000, the total number with metastasis was ZERO. To add to that, I met with noted RO, Dr. Anthony D'Amico at Dana-Farber Cancer Institute two days ago. He said the with a G3+4, metastases is all but unheard of. IMHO, what's even worse than having PCa, is all the uncertainty and unnecessary angst it causes for so many of us.",

That's not the point Denis, and it isn't MY assessment. The Decipher test, while top notch, isn't an ideal bio-marker for decision making before surgery. There are at least two other tests more specifically designed for that. While bio-markers are only a piece of the decision making process, it behooves our brothers to utilize the best tests and information available. Your anecdotal information, whatever it is, doesn't trump either Dr. Marc Garnick, Editor in Chief of the superb annual Harvard Prostate Disease Report, or this study, by another noted physician: http://ascopubs.org/doi/full/10.1200...source=TrendMD That being said, I'm sure intervention will work out for you, and you have finally come to a reasonable choice.

Getting your detailed pathology report and a second reading of it will be most valuable. You need to get ahead of whatever is driving that PSA. I\u0092ve been told that Australia has CT-PET-PSMA equipment that is much more sensitive that what we have available in the USA. Hopefully an experienced RO can hook you up with it. Based on my experience, speed is of the essence. Good luck",

As we all try to help each other, posting dark and morbid ruminations, is neither healthy for Dennis, nor does it send a positive message to new guys just showing up, IMO. Dennis is obviously a nice man, but his many posts over the last year worry me about his emotional health and don't add up, especially given that he professes the be living life to the fullest, being blessed with a life second to none, and having loving family, great friends, good health, fun travels, lots of toys and a keen awareness of the importance of living for today. At the same time, he talks about battling the loneliness of his having cancer, and as Semi pointed out, a very mild case of it at that, which has been very well treated. He has every reason to be rejoicing in his many blessings and singing for joy, each and every day. Instead we read nicely written dispirited meanderings. Of course he has every right to feel the way he does, but if that is obviously unhealthy, we do IMHO, have an obligation to point it out to a fellow brother, and that doesn't make us \"insensitive\", MM.

Is this being done at the main campus of MDA? That was a most comprehensive simulation, and in my experience was much better than what most of us get. The endorectal balloon you'll receive daily cuts down on the dangers of radiation damage to other organs. Most RT facilities don't use it, primarily I believe, because they don't know how! I sure wish I had the benefit of it, but when requested, all I got was the \"not our SOP\" excuse. You're in very good hands at MDA.",

The endorectal balloon you'll receive daily cuts down on the dangers of radiation damage to other organs. Most RT facilities don't use it, primarily I believe, because they don't know how! I sure wish I had the benefit of it, but when requested, all I got was the \"not our SOP\" excuse. You're in very good hands at MDA.",

It will help you understand the situation, and is MUCH more scientific than getting anecdotal stories from people you don't even know. Every journey is individually unique.

      "Content": "A life long, 68 year old friend, just spoke to me, really worried about his prostate condition. Why he thinks I'm a PCa expert is anybody's guess. From what I know, his PSA went from 3.3 in 11/2014, to 5.4 in June of this year. His urologist put him on a 7 week course of antibiotics; Cipro and Doxycycline. At the end of the 7 weeks his PSA is up to 7.9. Yes, he has frequent urination, nocturia, and burning. His initial urologist was nothing to brag about. He just had a 3T MRI, which was very difficult tolocate in San Antonio, probably due to him having 'just' Medicare Advantage. $1,300 out of pocket, that he can ill afford, but... Results, as best as I understand them, are Category 5 in the left anterior transition zone, and Category 4 in the peripheral zone from the apex to the mid gradient. No ECE evident. Looks like he has an aggressive cancer. Of course a biopsy is next, most likely followed by treatment. He says he prefers radiation. My guess is SBRT is probably best for him. So any suggestions for really good RO's in San Antonio??? On my quick review I can't find any. MD Anderson takes Medicare Advantage, if I can convince him to go there. Some places I've looked at for him: 1. START in SAT - ? 2. UT SAT - doesn't take Medicare Advantage Aetna 3. MD Anderson - Not convenience, but great and accepts his insurance 4. UT Southwestern - Dallas and Ft. Worth - to be determined. 5. ARA Diagnostic Imaging in Austin - ? 6. Lots of unimpressive SAT Google ads.... Any suggestions, advise and recommendations will be much appreciated, either public or PM. Thanks, in advance!",

      "Content": "A Brit realtor living in CA. Cool.... If it hasn't been mentioned, you may want to have your biopsy slides sent to Johns Hopkins, for a second opinion. Assuming your in good health otherwise, my choice would be surgery. If your surgeon has experience, confidence, integrity and communicates fairly well, you don't need to like him. Do research your radiation options as well. The side effects are about the same. With surgery they come earlier, you know with certainty what was in the tumor and better know what you're up against. With either treatment there is the possibility of cancer reoccurance, but with radiation there is also the increased uncertainty of future side effect complications. At least that was my logic. I'm sure some of my brothers will point out the holes in my thinking. Best of luck with whatever you decide.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by DjinTonic ...Talk with your docs about getting a genomics test. As my case shows, high-grade does not necessarily mean high risk of metastases. As long as it looks like the cancer was prostate-contained and there is no evidence of either persistent PSA (or an \"essentially-zero\" PSA that later begins to climb), there is no reason for RT. As always, very good advise! A Decipher genome test and a second pathology opinion, from Johns Hopkins, are both logical next steps. It should be noted that MF is a VERY old Parrothead",

      "Content": "A Brit realtor living in CA. Cool.... If it hasn't been mentioned, you may want to have your biopsy slides sent to Johns Hopkins, for a second opinion. Assuming your in good health otherwise, my choice would be surgery. If your surgeon has experience, confidence, integrity and communicates fairly well, you don't need to like him. Do research your radiation options as well. The side effects are about the same. With surgery they come earlier, you know with certainty what was in the tumor and better know what you're up against. With either treatment there is the possibility of cancer reoccurance, but with radiation there is also the increased uncertainty of future side effect complications. At least that was my logic. I'm sure some of my brothers will point out the holes in my thinking. Best of luck with whatever you decide.",

      "Content": "Less than ten weeks after surgery, it appears to have failed, even after all looked so well. I have very little leakage, ED symptoms are minimal, G 3+4=7 Grade Group 2, G pattern 4 = 10%, pT2c pN0 pMn/a, carcinoma organ confined in about 15% of the gland, EPE SV LN negative, PNI present, pathology verified by Dr. Epstein at JHMI. I did have one small positive anterior margin 0.1 mm long and limited < 3mm. Only symptoms I've had are increased urination to 8 times a day/night, with some urgency. So two PSA's in the last two weeks, from different labs, both exactly the same. O.32 ng/Ml This isn't biological recurrance...it never un-occured. I've never even heard of a case with such a high PSA two months after what seemed to be successful surgery. Kind of funny, since I've always had low PSA, never going much highter than 3.0...ever. What happened and why?...I don't have a clue. Where do I go from here?...just starting to sort that out. Is it even called ART or SBT? My main concern is that I've had ulcerative colitis for 45 years, and have had Lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS), a group of clinical symptoms involving my bladder, urethra, urinary sphincter and prostate for about 7 years. I had a TURP for it one and a half years ago that didn't alleviate the problems at all. This is why over a dozen nationally renowned RO's advised against radiation and for surgery. My two most urgent questions are: one, does anyone know of such an immediate surgery failure, and two, what are my best alternative follow up treatment options?? I'd sure appreciate the forums collective wisdom before I meet with my Urosurgeon in two weeks. Thanks, in advance.",

Read he is incredibly compassionate and patient and speaks in a way in which you can understand. Also hunting down other doctors who may give phone consultations. Which, again IMO, is the most rational path of action for your father. It's no surprise you're emotionally exhausted, given the many opinions you have asked for on this and several other forums, not to mention the many doctors you have spoken with, long distance, all the while attempting to come up an impossibly steep learning curve, and find a non exsistant perfect treatment and physician. And from what you say, you're still doing the same thing. I note you've had a lot more than 4 opinions! My tough love for you, and my concern for your dad, is that while seeking out information, at some point......enough is enough. Pick a course of action and go with it. I believe what's best for your dad, are the multiple services and expertise at Moffitt, and the sooner the better! As has already been told to you, and in my experiences, many of the best physicians are not particularly good communicators, and can get testy with extended requests for detailed explanations from patients relatives. You should realize by now that there are NO certainties with PCa. \"\u201cLearn from history or you're doomed to repeat it.\u201d At long last it's time to help your dad pick an option, and stop all the confusion.

Then fly back to SoFL on Saturday, the 17th, with Foley bag in tow. Wheelchair to plane, bulkhead seating, and hopefully an empty seat between me and my wife. Feet up as much as possible, a cushion for my jewel area, loose fitting slacks or maybe shorts, and a nondescript carrying bag for my bag. Friend with a BIG SUV meeting us at the airport. Any tips, cautions or advise from those of you who have been through it, or just considered it? Thanks, in advance.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by DjinTonic ...Talk with your docs about getting a genomics test. As my case shows, high-grade does not necessarily mean high risk of metastases. As long as it looks like the cancer was prostate-contained and there is no evidence of either persistent PSA (or an \"essentially-zero\" PSA that later begins to climb), there is no reason for RT. As always, very good advise! A Decipher genome test and a second pathology opinion, from Johns Hopkins, are both logical next steps. It should be noted that MF is a VERY old Parrothead",

Not only are they covering to cost of the imaging, they also picked up the cost of the airline flight....economy, of course. Rest easy, I'm not expecting even a single scoop of ice cream.....",

      "Content": "So, a search didn't turn up much. I'm flying from SoFL to Baltimore on Sunday, June 11 for RALP on the morning of Tuesday, June 13. Figure a day in Johns Hopkins, and three nights in a local hotel, with two full beds, lots of pillows, a low couch, and a kitchenette. Then fly back to SoFL on Saturday, the 17th, with Foley bag in tow. Wheelchair to plane, bulkhead seating, and hopefully an empty seat between me and my wife. Feet up as much as possible, a cushion for my jewel area, loose fitting slacks or maybe shorts, and a nondescript carrying bag for my bag. Friend with a BIG SUV meeting us at the airport. Any tips, cautions or advise from those of you who have been through it, or just considered it? Thanks, in advance.",

If your doc isn\u2019t a radiation oncologist you should find a good one who specializes in prostate cancer ASAP. A first class teaching Hospital close to you perhaps. We are about the same age and I\u2019ve had ulcerative colitis most of my life. Radiation is not to be taken lightly, nor is two years of ADT. IMO, your caution is well placed. Get that second pathology opinion, AND a more specialized radiation opinion quickly. Good luck and keep us posted.",

Your next step is a PHI blood test which will give you doc your PSA, and more. Lots of the shade tree physicians know little about the PHI, and nothing about how to interpret it. Then, if you still have concerns, demand a 3T mpMRI, and as MF says, get it done at a state-of-the-art medical facility. Only after both steps, do you start to consider a biopsy. You may also want to search out a first class, experienced, up-to-date urologist. Stay on the beam, captain.",

It's a valiant step they are taking. There is so much more that can be done now with true transparency of research, accurate reporting of statistics and findings, better training and ongoing education of physicians.

Amen to that, Rob, and with the best moderator! Cancer can be cruel and it helps to have a thick hide getting through it. Coming here for information and advise is what we\u2019re all about, usually with empathetic straight talk when someone is just feeling sorry for their situation. I was the target of the only personal attack post on the locked thread and not wanting to start a war of words, I didn\u2019t reply.

      "Content": "Self-pity is rooted in people taking themselves too seriously. ~ Tom Robbins Of all human emotions, perhaps the most useless and destructive is self-pity, and prostate cancer seems to fuel this emotion in some. It's very hard to realize that one is an ongoing self-pitying person in regards to prostate cancer problems. But the realization, although serving as a bitter slap in the face, can help one to embrace the joy of life with a more open-minded, all-accepting attitude. Find it hard to accept a circumstance, like living with prostate cancer in your life? Mull and muse over your problems often? Feel gloomy and depressed sometimes because of what life has dealt you? Feel like a victim? Have an inexplicable craving for the sympathy and condolences of others? Chances are that you\u0092re a self-pitying person. What is self-pity? It is an exaggerated sense of pity over one\u0092s own life, position or circumstance. Most of us experience self-pity after a diagnosis of prostate cancer, no matter how mild or aggressive it is, and although the self-pity can serve to be a soothing mechanism , many times it can morph into a toxic habit, and sharing the dark thoughts with others can exacerbate the self-pity. When self-pity is made a habit of, it not only impedes the progress we make with slow moving prostate cancer, but it creates self-destructive cycles of self-sabotage. 11 Signs That You're Chronically Self-Pity Self-pity is our worst enemy and if we yield to it, we can never do anything wise in this world. ~ Helen Keller How much of a self-pitying person are you? Well: #1 You find it hard to laugh at life and at yourself. Taking yourself too seriously, and finding it difficult to laugh at your predicament and condition is a tell-tale sign of self-pity. #2 You tend to crave drama. In truth, you might be a Drama King and tend to have a melodramatic streak to you. Usually this stems from extremist types of thinking (e.g. black-and-white, the world is against me, all-or-nothing mindsets). #3 You tend to crave sympathy. Self-pity is so addictive because it gives one the momentary pleasure of being supported, cared for and emotionally pampered. This is a dangerous, highly manipulative way of developing emotional bonds and connections with other people. We've seen it played out here many times. #4 You tend to be an individualist. Self-pity is one of the most effective ways of keeping yourself separate and independent from friends, family and people around you. Not so much from short-term anonymous internet acquaintances. #5 You tend to be a past-orientated person. Some people live in the present, others in the future, and still others in the past. Self-pity is inextricably linked to past-focused mindsets that dwell on past events. Why did this happen to me? #6 You have low self-esteem. People with low self-esteem tend to crave the acceptance and affection of other people as a way of feeling better about themselves. The tragic-life-story that self-pitying creates is an excellent way of collecting flocks of supporters. #7 You have a melancholic temperament. Melancholic, sanguine, choleric and phlegmatic temperaments are given to bouts of brooding and deep introspection, which can serve as a perfect breeding ground for self-pity. #8 Deep down, you don\u0092t believe you\u0092re worthy of love. This stems from low self-esteem and creates a cycle of self-destructive behavior. Self-pity is one of the greatest tools for the self-destructive person. It creates self-fulfilling prophecies and alienates the people you love and admire from you. So only sharing the feelings with anonymous web acquaintances seems safe, but is less than courageous, and can fuel insecurities for others. #9 You have an unhealthy habit of being self-absorbed. Quite simply, the more self-absorbed you are, the more likely you are to fall into the trap of self-pity. #10 You have a strong fighting instinct. This can be a good thing or a bad thing, depending on what you choose to use it for. When used in a negative sense, the fighting instinct is used to battle against life, to fight against the tide, and to fight against accepting reality. #11 You subconsciously feel guilty. Often times self-pity is an unconscious way of avoiding taking responsibility for personal actions or decisions made in the past. When we find it too difficult to accept the wrong that we\u0092ve committed, sometimes we tend to hide from it by making ourselves the victims, rather than other people. In this case, self-pity is the perfect cowardly self-defense mechanism. So..... Laugh at yourself and at life. Not in the spirit of derision or whining self-pity, but as a remedy, a miracle drug. ~ Og Mandino Feeling sorry for yourself is normal, and in some instance can motivate you to face the realities of the seriousness of your disease. However, some make a habit out of self-pity, either to avoid taking personal responsibility, to avoid taking action, or simply to gain sickly and unhealthy forms of affection and attention from others. Something not to be applauded. If you\u0092ve discovered that you struggle with this issue, be kind to yourself. Understand that self-pity is an unhealthy coping mechanism, but one that you can remove from your life with time, persistence, and patience. As Nancy, of Peanuts fame, tries to charge.....five cents please.",

Then, if you still have concerns, demand a 3T mpMRI, and as MF says, get it done at a state-of-the-art medical facility. Only after both steps, do you start to consider a biopsy.

The statistics and numbers must be recorded, but they are certainly held close to the vest, with most physicians and hospitals less than forthcoming unless their numbers are excellent. Not really surprising that they tend to be self promoting. Who wants to go to a doctor or hospital below the mean or average? As concerns prostate cancer, most of us are at an age that qualifies for Medicare, and they do keep detailed records and make them public for some procedures. https://projects.propublica.org/surgeons/ A telling question to ask your doctor is, \" How do you know you're a successful physician, and what metrics do you measure yourself by? Try not to laugh at the squirming and double talk. Caveat Emptor!",

At this time Uro and I have agreed to another check in 6 weeks followed by another shortly before next appointment in mid December. At that time will have additional information for next step, adjuvant alone or adjuvant with HT. Overall, I believe finally some good news. God bless. Why are you considering adjuvant, with or without HT, given your excellent .010ng/mL PSA??? I don't get it. Hope you keep doing well. My 8 week post PSA just came back. It's .32ng/mL.

My surgeon gave me a sheet of information that said the leakage would be at its worst during the first 2-3 weeks after surgery, which I can deal with. However, in paying close attention, I don't even seem to have the slightest bit of improvement yet. I'm not worried yet..... Obviously I have no choice right now but to be patient,.....But this is the one area (incontinence) that has me a little unnerved, simply because I am active in a lot of ways. I've more or less confined myself to my home for now because of potentially embarrassing situations.>>> Prostate cancer is inconvenient to ALL of us. I'd suggest relaxing and being patient for a while. You had surgery two weeks ago, your catheter came out one week ago, and your pathology looks very good. Your physician is on top of this. Oh, and internal worry can cause inflammation which in turn doesn't help continence. Count your blessings and give it a little time. It will get better!",

Denis Standard genome testing does NOT include BRAC2, and while Decipher is good for initial PCa treatment choice, the Oncotype Dx is a much better choice, because that is what is was designed for. Not surprising your admittedly relatively inexperienced URO didn't know this, Dennis. My URO at the time, didn't either. It\u2019s important to talk to your doctor to find out if you are a candidate for genomic testing. There are a variety of tests with different strengths and weaknesses, and it's a still an evolving science: Oncotype Dx: This test looks at the activity of certain genes in the prostate tumor and assigns a personalized result, called the Genomic Prostate Score, to each case. This number predicts the chance that the disease will be more aggressive and spread to other parts of the body if left untreated. This is used after a confirmed prostate cancer diagnosis of low risk disease and uses biopsy tissue to predict likelihood of future growth and spread. It is helpful for those considering active surveillance...and would have been the best choice for Denis, but it worked out anyway. ProstaVysion: This test looks at a sequence of certain genes and provides a personalized genetic panel to determine aggressiveness. This is used after a confirmed prostate cancer diagnosis and uses biopsy tissue to predict likelihood of future growth and spread. It is helpful for those considering active surveillance. Prolaris Test: The Prolaris test measures how fast your cancer cells are dividing to predict aggressiveness. This is used after a confirmed prostate cancer diagnosis of low risk disease and can use both biopsy tissue and tissue from a radical prostatectomy to predict likelihood of metastasis, biochemical recurrence, and death from prostate cancer. It is helpful for men deciding on a treatment option or trying to decide on additional treatment after surgery. Decipher: Decipher Biopsy is available for patients diagnosed with localized prostate cancer at time of biopsy. Decipher Biopsy can help men and their doctors determine if it may be safe to consider active surveillance, treatment, or a combination of therapies. No additional procedure for the patient is needed to run this test. Decipher Post-Op predicts the likelihood of prostate cancer metastasis for men with adverse pathology after radical prostatectomy. The test can help patients and their doctors decide if additional treatment is needed after surgery. Decipher Post-Op uses a tissue sample that was removed during surgery, so no additional procedure for the patient is needed.",

I also have dormant ulcerative colitis, and was told by a handful of RO's that surgery was my best option. I came very close to having it done at Johns Hopkins, but the logistics were too unwieldy. You won't go wrong listening to, and having treatment by Dr. Pavlovich. IMHO, no need to second guess him. Good luck and keep us posted.",

As I've stated before, you have a very wise physician. My heart goes out the all our brothers anguish worrying about BCR, when the evidence of when it really occurs, and what the impact means, is so weak. Lots of business for radiation oncologists, however, along with years of follow up appointments for continued ADT, with similar weak evidence that the ADT really helps. Stay strong, you guys!",

While a prostate biopsy is not without risk, apparently not explained to you, the reactions you're suffering are extremely unusual. Your reaction, given the suffering you are enduring, is understandable. However, a prostate biopsy, done by a competent urologist, is a most valuable procedure for a cancer diagnosis. IMHO it's way to early to throw in the towel, but probably the right time to find better medical advise and treatment. Where are you located? The people on this Forum know, and are willing to share, so much. Please, if you will, share the history of your medical condition with us. There is hope, and you'll get experienced, and well reasoned advise here. Hoping and praying the worst is behind you, Steve.",

      "Content": "Life can be full of stressful situations. It's little wonder that some struggle with things like anxiety, fear, and worry. This turmoil in their thinking, illogical though it may be, keeps them in a painful state of uneasiness\u2014and limits them from truly experiencing the incredible joy that their otherwise blessed lives should allow. It is so important to rule one's emotions, fears and worry instead of having them rule you, even if it's only occasionally. Baseless and irrational fear most certainly does suck energy out of some, and insidiously, their loved ones, too. We can control ourselves, and stop these self destructive thoughts, for they do no good. The fear being discussed is nothing but self pity, IMHO. It is the enemy of healing. Neither dwell nor reflect on it. Taking control of one's emotions is as important as is getting good medical treatment. My prayer this Holiday season is for all to find the courage and power to eliminate these negative thoughts. Thankfully many have already. Bless you all.",

You're still at a level where hormones (ADT) isn't mandatory, but please move quickly. 33 sessions of 2 Gys per session, yields you 66 Gy. Recent Standard Of Care practice, and four separate RO's, recommended no less than 70 Gy for me, so you may be looking at 2 more sessions. Work is important; life more so.

You're still at a level where hormones (ADT) isn't mandatory, but please move quickly. 33 sessions of 2 Gys per session, yields you 66 Gy. Recent Standard Of Care practice, and four separate RO's, recommended no less than 70 Gy for me, so you may be looking at 2 more sessions. Work is important; life more so.

Exactly! You can probably set up his consultations for the same day at Moffitt, two days at most, see a surgeon, an RO and a MO, if you wish. If at all possible, hop a cheap flight to Tampa, and apply all you've learned for your dad. It's more speed of action at this juncture, than it is about long distance doctor shopping, IMHO. Time is of the essence! Best of luck to both of you.",

As for the sweep of appointment with a myriad of MD's, I'd like to know how Tinkerbell, or others, get them covered by insurance. To receive better responses, give us an idea of your physician criterion Tinkerbell. A list of MD's you've already visited would also save time and keystrokes.",

I'm surprised he doesn't want a 3T MRI to see what he's up against. At your age, you should do well with surgery. Press Patel for specific answers to all your questions. His PA's are very knowledgeable. He runs two surgeries simultaneously, or back to back, and does 6 or 8 a day. Always in a hurry, which has positives and negatives. Caveat Emptor & good luck!",

I don't believe that's what he was doing. My read is he was stating an opinion, too strongly for many, but still with some validity. You have done the same, ASA, and so have I.

      "Content": "As an update, I met with my RO this week and developed a plan regarding my Persistent PSA. Some others here have it and maybe this will help. By way of review I've have little leakage over the last three months, my ED symptoms are minimal, G 3+4=7 Grade Group 2, G pattern 4 = 10%, pT2c pN0 pMn/a, carcinoma organ confined in about 15% of the gland, EPE SV LN negative, PNI present, pathology verified by Dr. Epstein at JHMI. I did have one small positive anterior margin 0.1 mm long and limited < .3mm. My main concern is I've had ulcerative colitis for 45 years, and have had lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS), a group of clinical symptoms involving my bladder, urethra, urinary sphincter and prostate for about 7 years. I had a TURP for it one and a half years ago that didn't alleviate the problems at all. So after two PSA's, both at .32 ng/mL, the alarms went off. I'll have another PSA tomorrow and yet another in 4 weeks. I will also get another Decipher Test; my first one was 15 months ago, and most importantly, I'll get an Axumin PET Scan, also know as a Fluciclovine (18F), or a anti-1-amino-3-18F-fluorocyclobutane-1-carboxylic acid(FACBC). It's specifically for those of us with suspected PCa recurrence based on elevated PSA levels. Then in four weeks, I'll meet with both my RO and my surgeon, so determine our next course of action. This also gives my system about four months to recover from surgery. My RO thinks I will need SRT and possible ADT. I'm going to investigate SBRT clinical trials for persistent PSA, and what I'd really like is some sort of active surveillance. Those RT side effects may be very daunting. Some articles I found that talk about Persistent PSA include: http://ascopubs.org/doi/full/10.1200/JCO.2005.08.904 http://ascopubs.org/doi/abs/10.1200/....32.4_suppl.32 http://ascopubs.org/doi/abs/10.1200/...5_suppl.e15041 http://ascopubs.org/doi/full/10.1200/JCO.2011.38.2788 http://ascopubs.org/doi/full/10.1200/JCO.2016.67.9647 I hope the above helps those in the same boat.",

As DjinTonic so artistically points out, it's true for ALL of us, either forever or until we forget about it. Worrying about it will drive you crazy, so try to 'paddle on' and enjoy the holidays!",

My surgeon gave me a sheet of information that said the leakage would be at its worst during the first 2-3 weeks after surgery, which I can deal with. However, in paying close attention, I don't even seem to have the slightest bit of improvement yet. I'm not worried yet..... Obviously I have no choice right now but to be patient,.....But this is the one area (incontinence) that has me a little unnerved, simply because I am active in a lot of ways. I've more or less confined myself to my home for now because of potentially embarrassing situations.>>> Prostate cancer is inconvenient to ALL of us. I'd suggest relaxing and being patient for a while. You had surgery two weeks ago, your catheter came out one week ago, and your pathology looks very good. Your physician is on top of this. Oh, and internal worry can cause inflammation which in turn doesn't help continence. Count your blessings and give it a little time. It will get better!",

As I've stated before, you have a very wise physician. My heart goes out the all our brothers anguish worrying about BCR, when the evidence of when it really occurs, and what the impact means, is so weak. Lots of business for radiation oncologists, however, along with years of follow up appointments for continued ADT, with similar weak evidence that the ADT really helps. Stay strong, you guys!",

The pathology residents in training are just showing off. Christian Pavlovich, at Johns Hopkins is a superb surgeon, with some special talents. I also have dormant ulcerative colitis, and was told by a handful of RO's that surgery was my best option. I came very close to having it done at Johns Hopkins, but the logistics were too unwieldy. You won't go wrong listening to, and having treatment by Dr. Pavlovich. IMHO, no need to second guess him. Good luck and keep us posted.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by Michael F TY Dj! The authors have published a summary overview of 3 Trials. They do NOT identify the PSA level at which SRT should commence; although it is after BR is reached. Guessing we can assume a PSA level of at least 0.2 ng/ml. The question to which we seek correct answers is: For those who opt for early SRT at very low clinically undetectable uPSA levels, how many might never have progressed to significant recurrent disease? Very difficult to speculate! But likely for some SRT was unnecessary. MF They don't know, Michael, and maybe never will. A lot of surgeries, RT and SRT are surely unnecessary. So many with so called BCR, at very low PSA, get scared into premature treatment, IMHO. Expecting medical researchers to be excited about possibly putting many of their fellow physicians out of much of their lifetime studied work, has to be tough. Yes, I'm cynical. It sucks!",

It isn't the best one for predicting subsequent PCa progression. I did a great deal of research on the topic last year, and spoke to the chief scientist at Desopher. The BEST genome test for your purpose is the OncotypeDx test. Demanding this test and getting a Hopkins second pathology opinion are both good investments.",

I don't believe that's what he was doing. My read is he was stating an opinion, too strongly for many, but still with some validity. You have done the same, ASA, and so have I.

As for the sweep of appointment with a myriad of MD's, I'd like to know how Tinkerbell, or others, get them covered by insurance. To receive better responses, give us an idea of your physician criterion Tinkerbell. A list of MD's you've already visited would also save time and keystrokes.",

If at all possible, hop a cheap flight to Tampa, and apply all you've learned for your dad. It's more speed of action at this juncture, than it is about long distance doctor shopping, IMHO.

It isn't the best one for predicting subsequent PCa progression. I did a great deal of research on the topic last year, and spoke to the chief scientist at Desopher. The BEST genome test for your purpose is the OncotypeDx test. Demanding this test and getting a Hopkins second pathology opinion are both good investments.",

      "Content": "Sledgehammer CIPRO is too often casually prescribed by physicians, I guess because it's very strong and they, are ignorant, about it's dangers. URO's like to use it during biopsy. It has been linked to causing C-Diff, a serious - gastrointestinal infection.\u200e Now the FDA has added concerns, and a warning: <<<Certain antibiotics can cause painful and sometimes fatal damage to the body's main artery, the Food and Drug Administration said Thursday, 12/27/2018. Fluoroquinolone antibiotics might raise the risk of an aortic dissection, and people who are already at risk should be cautious about taking those antibiotics, the FDA said. YES, CIPRO is a most popular fluoroquinolone. \"A U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) review found that fluoroquinolone antibiotics can increase the occurrence of rare but serious events of ruptures or tears in the main artery of the body, called the aorta. These tears, called aortic dissections, or ruptures of an aortic aneurysm can lead to dangerous bleeding or even death,\" the FDA said in a statement. \"Fluoroquinolones should not be used in patients at increased risk unless there are no other treatment options available. People at increased risk include those with a history of blockages or aneurysms (abnormal bulges) of the aorta or other blood vessels, high blood pressure, certain genetic disorders that involve blood vessel changes, and the elderly.\" The FDA said the new risk guidance will be added to the labels and prescribing information of fluoroquinolone drugs. The agency has already warned that the powerful drugs should only be used when necessary because they can cause other side effects involving tendons, muscles, joints, nerves and the central nervous system. \"Health care professionals should avoid prescribing fluoroquinolone antibiotics to patients who have an aortic aneurysm or are at risk for an aortic aneurysm, such as patients with peripheral atherosclerotic vascular diseases, hypertension, certain genetic conditions such as Marfan syndrome and Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, and elderly patients. Prescribe fluoroquinolones to these patients only when no other treatment options are available,\" the FDA said. Patients should call 911 or get to an emergency room if they feel symptoms of an aortic dissection, which include sudden, severe, and constant pain in the stomach, chest or back, the FDA said.>>>",

RT will 'freeze' the healing of everything in your pelvis and lower abdomen. .....several other guys who said they went into RT with good continence lost some of that by the time RT ended. So in other words, my continence would get no better and quite likely would become worse.

You could go for yet another opinion sw1218, which would probably yield nothing. Surgery should clear it up, depending on where you'll have it done, and how good their path department is.

      "Content": "Most informative and well researched report. I enjoyed re-reading it. The message I take away is that the more that's discovered about PCa and it's many complex forms, the more medical science realizes they don't know. There are a myriad of personal history factors that influence when the mysterious BCR level truly becomes serious. The bottom line is they don't know, and neither do we. The choice of when to treat, and how, seems to be much more of an emotional one, than one of scientific precision. Note: BRFS is shorthand for biochemical relapse free survival, which means that after undergoing a prostate cancer treatment the patient\u2019s PSA level does not rise for 2 to 3 consecutive. Biochemical relapse free survival should not be confused with overall survival. Overall survival when used in a clinical sense refers only to those who did not die as a result of their prostate cancer at the time of follow-up. Many doctors believe that there is comparative difference in the overall prostate cancer survival rates, possibly due to the unusually slow growth rate common in most types of prostate cancers. Biochemical relapse free survival is a more specific term. The word biochemical refers to the use of the prostate-specific antigen as a tumor marker. If the patient relapses biochemically, his PSA level has risen significantly. Generally, patients who undergo a prostate cancer treatment should have nearly undetectable PSA levels, somewhere around or under 1.0 ng/mL. Those with a high PSA velocity after treatment have experienced biochemical relapse, but they have not died. Biochemical relapse, however, is a reasonable indicator of who will develop recurrent prostate cancer. .......what a frustrating disease.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by DjinTonic That would be an interesting discussion......Even before my doc said he preferred an open for my case I had decided against RALP. But I digress. We don't have to debate what is an established trend/fact. For the record, I'm convinced that 'open' surgery is superior to robotic, in the hands of a truly experienced surgeon. Trouble is they are both very rare, and getting to retirement age, in many instances. Di Vinci has helped many average surgeons become robotically assisted very good ones, so the work, study and skill required for open surgery is just not happening. A shame.",

Nothing Epstein could do about that during a second opinion review, but I was disappointed when I spoke to him, that he wasn't more forthcoming about the poor handling. You could go for yet another opinion sw1218, which would probably yield nothing. Surgery should clear it up, depending on where you'll have it done, and how good their path department is. Of course, by then, the horse is out of the barn, so to speak. No need to bold so much to get our attention, BTW Good luck to you!",

      "Content": "Most informative and well researched report. I enjoyed re-reading it. The message I take away is that the more that's discovered about PCa and it's many complex forms, the more medical science realizes they don't know. There are a myriad of personal history factors that influence when the mysterious BCR level truly becomes serious. The bottom line is they don't know, and neither do we. The choice of when to treat, and how, seems to be much more of an emotional one, than one of scientific precision. Note: BRFS is shorthand for biochemical relapse free survival, which means that after undergoing a prostate cancer treatment the patient\u2019s PSA level does not rise for 2 to 3 consecutive. Biochemical relapse free survival should not be confused with overall survival. Overall survival when used in a clinical sense refers only to those who did not die as a result of their prostate cancer at the time of follow-up. Many doctors believe that there is comparative difference in the overall prostate cancer survival rates, possibly due to the unusually slow growth rate common in most types of prostate cancers. Biochemical relapse free survival is a more specific term. The word biochemical refers to the use of the prostate-specific antigen as a tumor marker. If the patient relapses biochemically, his PSA level has risen significantly. Generally, patients who undergo a prostate cancer treatment should have nearly undetectable PSA levels, somewhere around or under 1.0 ng/mL. Those with a high PSA velocity after treatment have experienced biochemical relapse, but they have not died. Biochemical relapse, however, is a reasonable indicator of who will develop recurrent prostate cancer. .......what a frustrating disease.",

Nothing Epstein could do about that during a second opinion review, but I was disappointed when I spoke to him, that he wasn't more forthcoming about the poor handling. You could go for yet another opinion sw1218, which would probably yield nothing. Surgery should clear it up, depending on where you'll have it done, and how good their path department is. Of course, by then, the horse is out of the barn, so to speak. No need to bold so much to get our attention, BTW Good luck to you!",

There are no free and easy treatments. As I understand it, with HDR Brachy you get a sedative to make you drowsy and numbing medicine on your perineum, the area between the anus and scrotum, where the needle like applicators are inserted. If you get spinal anesthesia, you will be drowsy but awake, and numb below the waist. With general anesthesia, you will be asleep and pain free. Basically the physician places an ultrasound probe into your rectum to view the area, and a catheter is placed in your bladder to drain urine. The doctor uses ultrasound or a CT scan to plan and place the seeds that deliver radiation into your prostate. The seeds are placed with needles or special applicators through your perineum. Make no mistake about it, this is surgery. Discomfort for a few days is to be expected. Good results should also be anticipated.",

      "Content": "Excellent advise above. It\u2019s good to be cautious and well informed beforehand. The practice of urology has made me cynical about the speciality. That said, the large practice I first went to allowed for one physician to specialize in biopsies. After a 3T MP MRI, my biopsy was a breeze. Dealing with PCa you\u2019ll need one sooner or later. Sooner is much better for you to make informed choices. Good luck and tell us your location.",

      "Content": "Hope this both updates the forum, and maybe solicits some better informed observations than I have. Although an ever-increasing number of treatment options exist, an estimated 26,100 men will still die of the disease in the US in 2016, generally after primary local and systemic treatments for prostate cancer have failed. We don't talk much about that here. One factor contributing to this statistic is the frequent inability of current diagnostic methods to reliably detect the exact location(s) of disease relapse at a time when curative treatment is still possible. The dilemma of biochemical recurrence (BCR): Up to a third of men treated for PCa will experience recurrent disease, most often detected only by rising PSA levels. Conventional imaging tools such as computerized tomography [CT] and bone scintigraphy [BS] frequently fail to identify the site of recurrent disease, presenting a serious challenge to urologists and radiation oncologists charged with the selection of secondary treatment, and causing significant anxiety for us patients. While PCa recurrence may occur locally in the prostate gland or prostate bed, and/or in local lymph nodes in the pelvis, recognition of distant lymph node, bone or other tissue involvement requires different treatment choices. Potentially curative techniques such as salvage lymphadenectomy, radiotherapy or cryotherapy may be used for local recurrences, especially at lower PSA levels, whereas systemic approaches such as the use of anti-hormonal therapy and/or chemo or immunotherapy may be recommended in the presence of distal metastatic disease. Enter Axumin™: In May, 2016 the FDA approved Axumin [fluciclovine F 18 Injection; Blue Earth Diagnostics Ltd, Oxford UK] for PET imaging in men with suspected prostate cancer recurrence based on elevated PSA levels following prior treatment. The approval of Axumin ushered in a new era of F18 PET/CT for the detection of recurrent prostate cancer in the USA. Data submitted to FDA included results from prospective studies at Emory University and the University of Bologna and from clinical use at two sites in Norway; the pooled data for n= 595 subjects were retrospectively analyzed. Overall, fluciclovine F 18 PET/CT detected sites of recurrence in 68% (403/595) of patients. For patients with baseline PSA values in the lowest quartile (<0.79 ng/mL, n=12, 75 patients (59%) were negative with fluciclovine F 18 PET/CT, but 53 (41% of patients) had positive fluciclovine scans; 13 (10%) had prostate bed findings only, and 40 (31%) had extra-prostatic disease. As the location of disease recurrence affects appropriate therapy selection, this finding is highly relevant. My impression is that an Axumin scan is more valuable for Persistent PSA source detection. For more data, and the source of most of the above: https://www.urotoday.com/recent-abst...t-article.html Here is a 9/17 link comparing Axumin with Gallium 68: https://prostatecancerinfolink.net/2...state-cancers/ Now, as for Gallium 68 PET scans specifically, which appear to me to be more valuable with high risk PCa: https://radiology.ucsf.edu/patient-c...t-mri/research UCSF clinical research ~2014? https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5439210/ Clinical Utility of Gallium-68 PSMA PET/CT Scan for Prostate Cancer 6/17 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4898465/ Evaluation of 68Gallium-PSMA PET/CT in patients with prostate cancer 6/16 https://www.carcinoid.org/2017/04/06...ion-locations/ Gallium 68 PET scanning locations 6/17 Enjoy the above, but be warned...I don't take questions.",

      "Content": "I suggest you request/demand a Decipher test, especially if that wasn't what they did. Also request/demand a copy of both the test results and a GRID report. Radiation is most likely in the future. First share with us the next PSA and Decipher results. While quick action, given the pathology, is advisable, and HT should accompany it....how long to hormones is open to much medical debate. IMHO, less is better; one year max, but please research to topic thoroughly. RO's usually like to prescribe it with a heavy head. ED results vary dramatically, and recovery to some degree is not uncommon. Remember what you read is usually guys complaining, not us happy men. There are also many work arounds, but that's for another day. Dave's primary goal is to beat PCa and stay alive, not worry about erections. Best of luck, and keep us posted.",
