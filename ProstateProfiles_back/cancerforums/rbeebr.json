      "Content": "Thanks for the welcome and the responses. Fairwind: My dad's PSA rocketed up from about 3 or 4 in the fall to the 30's by January -- that's when a bone scan was performed and he was diagnosed with metastatic PC. Because he had been on Lupron and Casodex, he had to do a \"detox\" before starting the clinical trial (taking Xtandi + Zytiga + prednisone). His numbers doubled again in that month, and his last bone scan showed some spreading -- the good news, is that he has no direct pain in his lumbar, ribs or sternum. He tolerated the two drugs well for a couple of weeks, and then had an adverse reaction to the Zytiga, which caused a high fever (which led to other complications). Now he's struggling with the Xtandi -- it may have contributed to a dramatic increase in blood pressure (rare, but it's apparently a known side effect), and to the more well known side effects of fatigue and utter exhaustion. I realize that his age is not helping him; i am still hopeful that his body will somehow adjust to the HT because he tolerated Lupron and Casodex so well for many years. He's due for a bone scan in mid-May; at that point, I think his docs will need to make sort of a recommendation to us about this course of treatment. As for me, I benefited greatly by knowing my dad's history -- so when my PSA increased from 1.0 to 3.1 in January 2015, I immediately decided to see a urologist, and then opted to get a biopsy which revealed 3+4 cancer in three cores (and 3+3 in another). As my urologist was retiring (literally -- i was his last new patient), I opted to be treated at UCSF. They redid my pathology and reclassified me as 4+3; I also opted for genomic testing, which confirmed that my cancer was likely to be aggressive. So I opted for surgery, and was fortunate to receive a perfect post-surgery biopsy report (clean margins; no cancer within 2mm of the wall of the capsule). And my PSA has been undetectable in two post-surgery blood tests. By acting quickly, I feel that I improved my odds of long-term health; and judging by what happened to my dad, I'm even more confident that surgery was the right move. I was also fortunate to be able to talk to a number of other PC survivors in my area. Without their input and support, I would have felt very lost.",

      "Content": "My 85 year old father was recently diagnosed with metastatic prostate cancer that has appeared in his bones (sternum, ribs and back). He had successfully managed his recurrent cancer for seven years with hormone therapy (Lupron and Casodex) until 3 months ago when the cancer metastasized. He has been taking Xtandi (enzalutamide) for about one month, and is suffering from significant side effects -- fatigue, utter exhaustion, high blood pressure, weakness and mild nausea, among others. He was in a clinical trial that combined both Xtandi and Zytiga (abiraterone acetate), but discontinued the Zytiga after spiking fevers. He continued with Xtandi because at the time, he seemed to tolerate it (that was 2 weeks ago when he stopped the Zytiga) I'd like to understand a couple of basic questions: 1. What's the likelihood that his body will learn to tolerate Xtandi? is it possible for the side effects to diminish? Anybody out there know of men with similar experiences who improved? Or does he need to learn to \"live with it\" (or switch to another drug) 2. Are there other therapies / treatments that can help mitigate the side effects so that he can function better? I'm also a prostate cancer survivor -- prostatectomy in July 2015 (I was a 4 +3 ), and look forward to sharing my own experiences with other forum participants.",
