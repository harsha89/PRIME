      "Content": "Thanks mtsarpilot and Fairwind. Both of you have mentioned it is slow-growing which give some hope. The family is under the impression thinking he might have had this problem for quite a few years, and know things are manifested with more urine blockage until recently. Assuming if the original enlargement might have started several years back, unnoticed. Possible? One more day to go for the biopsy results. I will keep posted with the results and what the doctors say. I was under the impression that only benign tumor enlargement can be reduced with normal antibiotics. Can the antibiotics reduce the size of prostate which has malignant tumor?",

Since the PSA is still greater than 100, the doctor is thinking it might have spread all over the body. He is suggesting go for prostatectomy and orchiectomy. The family is fine with it. However, are there any side effects with these surgeries to remove prostate and the testicles? Will there be any post surgery complications?",

      "Content": "Hi, My uncle who is 68 years had difficulty urinating for the last few months. Other than this single issue, he is perfectly healthy, no pains, fevers, etc. There is no history of any type of cancer to anyone in his family (at least we haven't heard for the last few generations). Last week, when the urologist had asked the following tests, it came like this. The initial ultrasound scan revealed the size of prostate swollen as 75cc. When PSA was taken it was showing as > 100 ng/ml. There was little urinary infection as well. When the doctor gave the medication, on the 2nd scan, the swelling of the prostate came down showing 70cc from 75cc. However, the PSA is still showing as > 100 ng/ml. Now the doctor had asked for biopsy, which was taken and we are waiting for the result anxiously. The questions I have - 1. Since he is not complaining of any pains anywhere in the body, and perfectly active other than this urine blockage, other than prostate cancer, can BHP or urinary infection can cause such high elevated PSA levels taken in a gap of 1 week? 2. The medication (for infection) he is taking actually reducing the size of the enlarged prostate. Can this confirm whether only BHP will be reduce the swelling through medication, or can the malignant tumors also react and reduce in size to these medications? 3. The DRE (digital rectal examination) did not reveal any unusual bumps other than the prostate enlargement. Can this confirm whether it is BHP or malignant despite having elevated psa level? Can someone, please respond to my above queries? Thanks.",
