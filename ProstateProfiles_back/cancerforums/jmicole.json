    "Content": "I have been ordering from Alldaychemist.com for more than five years without incident. Their ED drugs are the least expensive I have found. However, they do not ship generic Cialis to the US. Their generic viagra and Levitra are excellent and cost around $1.00 per pill. They also offer a full line of other meds available by prescription only here in the US. If anyone has any questions, feel free to private message me. Mike",
