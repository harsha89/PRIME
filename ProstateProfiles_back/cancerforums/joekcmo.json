      "Content": "I am age 71. I have been on Finasteride for almost five years due to prostate symptoms (urinary, mainly). My GP has always listed my diagnosis as \"prostatitis\" and has found no issues in my annual physical and DRE. When I started Finasteride in January 2013 my PSA was 3.8 and in subsequent physicals while on Finasteride it dropped to ~1.2. Six months ago my urinary symptoms became worse and I stopped taking the Finasteride because I felt it wasn't helping anymore. Now this may be of interest. My identical twin, who has no symptoms at all was just diagnosed with 5/12 positive cores, Gleason 4+3 in one sample and 3+4 in the others, highest at 60%, none lower than 35%. His 4k score was 39. Because of this I went to my GP and asked for a PSA and it came back at 4.15. He dismissed this score as \"normal\" but agreed to refer me to a urologist, who I will see next week. I asked my GP how long it would take before my ending the Finasteride would yield a correct PSA score and he didn't know. Besides the urinary symptoms (can't empty bladder, sometimes dribble in shorts, etc.), I also have some pretty severe neuropathy in my thighs and near my groin. Sometimes the stabbing pain is almost unbearable. I've been treated for the neuropathy for years and it's classified as idiopathic. An MRI for spinal stenosis was negative. Until my brother was diagnosed and I started doing research, I had no idea Finasteride could mask a true PSA. I've looked at various multiplier formulas for for PSA while on Finasteride, but none yield anything close to 4.15. So does anyone know if six months off Finasteride is enough time to give an accurate PSA? Other thoughts? Anyone have neuropathy in the upper legs or groin?",

I'm not qualified to even \"guess\" the answer to the \"Finasteride Effect\" A couple of questions: - Have you been treated by a URO MD in the past? - Has anyone determined the size of your prostate gland? If you have major BPH, a PSA of 4.15 would be in the \"normal\" range. IMO, you are taking the right steps by getting to a URO MD. Hope the neuropathy cause is determined and addressed. Let us know what the URO MDs course(s) of action is(are). Also let us know how your brother fares. Hopefully, he will soon be on the way to being cured! Invite him to join you on The Forum!

      "Content": "Originally Posted by Another Here is a good article that concludes that if you are on the drug you should be getting biopsies if your PSA rises regardless of the multipling factor. Your PSA should not be rising on the drug. It may suppress low grade cancer as a form of weak hormone therapy, but it will not stop or slow more aggressive cancers. The risk is men on the drug will postpone biopsies missing the opportunity for early treatment in the presence of aggressive cancers. I suspect the impact of the drug lasts longer than 6 months in terms of restoring your PSA to a reliable indicator. It has been shrinking and supressing cell growth and low grade cancer with low hormone therapy for 5 years. If in addition, you have more aggressive cancer it has had no impact on it.
