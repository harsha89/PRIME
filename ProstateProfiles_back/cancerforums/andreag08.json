      "Content": "My brother has been diagnosed with prostate cancer two days ago after his biopsy results came back. Left Lateral Mid: Prostatic adenocarcinoma, gleason score 8 (4+4) involving approx. 20% of the 15 mm biopsy core Left Lateral Apex: Prostatic adenocarcinoma, Gleason score 6 ( 3+3), discontinuously involving approx. 70% of the 14 mm biopsy core. The little diagnosis summary picture with 12 areas shows LLB 9 (4+5) 60% below that is LLM at 8 ( 4+4) 20% the the bottom left LLA is 6 (3+3) at 70% The rest of the areas are 5 blanks and the last four show 6 and 7 in the range of 10-25%. I am trying to make some sense of these numbers. He will be seeing his doctor tomorrow to review the CT scan and MRI results and to get the treatment started. Gleason numbers of 7,8,and 9 scare me!!! I am sorry, I am not able to explain his results better at this time. I was told that his PSA is in the lower range. He is 59 and in overall good health. Thank you very much!",

I can definitely understand when you said that you worry more about her then your own situation This is all new to me, and I am so scared and frustrated since I have no idea what I am dealing with at this time. I can't even imagine what you are going thru with your current situation and your sister also having health issues ::: I am just trying to breathe as I am waiting for his 1:20pm appointment tomorrow when we will learn more about his situation and prognosis. Again, thank you so much for your reply. Wishing you and your sister all the best!",
