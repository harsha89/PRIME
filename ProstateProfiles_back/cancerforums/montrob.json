      "Content": "Really glad to hear about your progress. I was about the same age as you but mine was a little further progressed. I had the surgery a year and a half ago at a local hospital with a great rep. I was continent2 to 3 days after catheter removal. Unfortunately a year and a half has passed and I still cannot get an erection. I also developed leakage about a month ago that I had not had since I recovered from the surgery. I work out every day and am in pretty good shape. But now I would gladly trade 10 years of my life for the ability to function better. I am very frustrated and wishing I had chosen differently. But, nothing was promised, and you go with the odds. God bless you",

      "Content": "I am a 59 year old, had DaVinci surgery for prostate cancer a year and a half ago. Always in pretty good shape before, no problems with erections. Had my surgery and came out achieved continence within 2 to 3 weeks. Now a year and a half later I have begun to have leakage problems to the point where I am wearing pads to absorb the leakage. Never have recovered the ability to have an erection despite using the blue pill for over a year. Now I feel like I was lied to. Would have traded 10 years of life for the ability to have an erection and control my leakage. Any suggestions",
