    "Content": "I was abused as a child and I have a fractured L-3 with DVD in L-1-3. I too have noticed an increase in back pain since diagnosis. Although. Have a different cancer I can't help but think that the massive amount of work the cells are doing is adding a strain to my previous injury. Also as I have bladder cancer and cannot urinate on my own, I'm thinking that my bladder which is three times bigger than the norm is pushing on some of the muscles attached to y back. One thing for sure is that it's hard enough to be battling the cancer but back pain is no joke and I can relate. I've found naproxen to be especially good for my flare ups. Good luck and if you find out anything about cancer and back pain correlation please be sure to let me know!",
