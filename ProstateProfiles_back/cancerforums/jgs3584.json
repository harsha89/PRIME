      "Content": "Here is what I have gotten from my mother. - His last reading (the one that prompted the biopsy) showed a PSA level of 6.5 and a clinical stage of T1c - The final diagnosis (pre-radiation treatment) was as follows.

Prostate, Right Lateral Apex, Core Biopsy - Adenocarcinoma of the Prostate, Gleason Score 4+3=7, involving one of one core (90%, 12MM) - Intraductal Spread of Invasive Carcinoma B.

Prostate, Right Apex, Core Biopsy - Adenocarcinoma of the Prostate, Gleason Score 4+3=7, involving one of one core (100%, 14MM) - Intraductal Spread of Invasive Carcinoma The documents say that this is considered Grade Group 5 (Least favorable on Gleason score) After the biopsy they did a full body scan and a CT scan of pelvis and stomach prior to starting radiation. According to my mother, his last PSA reading (after hospitalization and all of the treatments) is .1 He is scheduled for another hormone shot in February 2018 (confirmed it's Luron) and one in June of 2018. He takes 72,000 units of Creon (2 pills) per each meal. That's 6 pills per day. He's still having issues with uncontrolled diarrhea. Happened again today.",

      "Content": "Hi all, This is my first post and I am seeking any insight that everyone can share regarding my Dad's prostate cancer. This is a bit of a long story, but I will try to make it as short as I can. My Dad is 81 years old. He and my mother have been religious about health screens and caring for themselves. Generally healthy and active. Over the past five years, however, Dad's PSA levels had gone up. Without going into the background too much, late in 2016 he went for a biopsy on his prostate. The results came back with an aggressive cancer (Gleason 9 on almost all results). There were a number of additional tests and scans done to confirm if the cancer had spread. Indications were it had not. The doctor advised that surgery was not an option. They did say that without treatment, he would not make it more than a year. Given the options, they opted for radiation therapy. He was booked in for a daily radiation treatment (IMRT) that began in late June 2017. He rapidly developed diarrhea. Working with the doctors, they advised my mother on dietary choices and taking Imodium to help control it. The situation deteriorated very quickly. They kept going to treatment, telling the doctors and nurses how bad it was getting, but they said it was normal. Nothing was normal about this. He was unable to control himself at all, no warning and explosive, liquid diarrhea almost immediately upon ingesting food. He was wearing adult diapers and soiling more than 10 a day. I could go on, but you get the picture. It finally ended about 30 days into treatment when he had dehydrated so badly that he was hospitalized for 3 days. At the time, they told him he was less than 24 hours from dying due to the dehydration. After a few days, they released him and sent him back to finish radiation therapy. He lasted less than 48 hours before being readmitted to the hospital. He was diagnosed with radiation colitis. They told my folks this was extraordinarily rare and that they had never seen someone so sensitive to the treatment. After another 6 days in the hospital, he was released. He had developed AFIB and was wearing a heart monitor. They stopped radiation as well even though the course of treatment had not been completed. Here is where it get's puzzling. He is home now and is essentially just existing. They have him taking Creon to control/stop the diarrhea. Apparently, his pancreas is not producing enzymes to help digest food. They have told him they will not treat him for cancer (saying what the did was enough). He had low-level diabetes for many years that was controlled through diet (no drugs at all). They have told him to eat what he wants, take his Creon as instructed and do what he wants. The weird part is they have told him that he \"has a lot of other problems that will kill him before the prostate cancer does\", even though that contradicts what he was originally told and why he decided on the treatment in the first place. Needless to say, we are all confused. Even though he's home and sustaining a daily life, he's very weak. Hasn't gained any weight and still has flares of diarrhea every day or so despite the Creon (which they have recently increased the dosage on). The doctors (Gastro, GP, Urologist and Cardiologist) have all said make an appointment in 2018 for a checkup and call us if anything changes. My folks live in Pittsburgh and are going to some of the best doctors. Despite all of our research and questions, we still believe there is something else missing from the equation. Sorry for the long background, but this has been a painful journey for my family. Here's my questions to this forum: - Does this story make sense? This seems unusual given the number of other prostate cancer survivors I know and the research I have done. - There is no end/tapering off of the Creon planned. This means to me that his pancreas is no longer working correctly or at all. Is this something that happens during prostate treatment? I cannot seem to find any other instances of this. - Could he have pancreatic cancer? My mom keeps asking that (as does my Dad). He wasn't tested for it and the doctors don't seem interested in any more tests. We have a lot more questions, but I was hoping for some insight from this forum. My family and I would appreciate any help/suggestions.",

There is no plan, at this time, other than what appears to be HT and the use of Creon, which I rate as only moderately successful. He is still having pains in his side and around his back. He's up most of the night urinating and has sudden explosive diarrhea episodes. I am going to talk to them about getting a trip planned to Mayo.

I could go on, but you get the picture. It finally ended about 30 days into treatment when he had dehydrated so badly that he was hospitalized for 3 days. At the time, they told him he was less than 24 hours from dying due to the dehydration. After a few days, they released him and sent him back to finish radiation therapy. He lasted less than 48 hours before being readmitted to the hospital. He was diagnosed with radiation colitis. They told my folks this was extraordinarily rare and that they had never seen someone so sensitive to the treatment. After another 6 days in the hospital, he was released. He had developed AFIB and was wearing a heart monitor. They stopped radiation as well even though the course of treatment had not been completed. Here is where it get's puzzling. He is home now and is essentially just existing. They have him taking Creon to control/stop the diarrhea. Apparently, his pancreas is not producing enzymes to help digest food. They have told him they will not treat him for cancer (saying what the did was enough). He had low-level diabetes for many years that was controlled through diet (no drugs at all). They have told him to eat what he wants, take his Creon as instructed and do what he wants. The weird part is they have told him that he \"has a lot of other problems that will kill him before the prostate cancer does\", even though that contradicts what he was originally told and why he decided on the treatment in the first place. Needless to say, we are all confused. Even though he's home and sustaining a daily life, he's very weak. Hasn't gained any weight and still has flares of diarrhea every day or so despite the Creon (which they have recently increased the dosage on). The doctors (Gastro, GP, Urologist and Cardiologist) have all said make an appointment in 2018 for a checkup and call us if anything changes. My folks live in Pittsburgh and are going to some of the best doctors. Despite all of our research and questions, we still believe there is something else missing from the equation. Sorry for the long background, but this has been a painful journey for my family. Here's my questions to this forum: - Does this story make sense? This seems unusual given the number of other prostate cancer survivors I know and the research I have done. - There is no end/tapering off of the Creon planned. This means to me that his pancreas is no longer working correctly or at all. Is this something that happens during prostate treatment? I cannot seem to find any other instances of this. - Could he have pancreatic cancer? My mom keeps asking that (as does my Dad). He wasn't tested for it and the doctors don't seem interested in any more tests. We have a lot more questions, but I was hoping for some insight from this forum. My family and I would appreciate any help/suggestions.",

      "Content": "Hello MichiganMan16, Thanks for getting back to me. I will get some additional statistics and share them as soon as I can. I am in Virginia and working through my oldest brother on lots of this stuff. I forgot to add that he did go through HT prior to radiation treatments (Luron but I will confirm). He had 3 shots prior to starting RT and then one during. Since the entire episode of hospitalization he has had only one other shot. I have been pressuring my folks to get some direct answers. I had prepped my mother with a series of direct questions about his status, what else could be wrong, etc. When they went (I was in Germany at the time), they said both doctors didn't answer their direct questions and were more interested in just letting them know that he wasn't going to need any more treatment. Same thing happened with the cardiologist. They made a big deal out of his AFIB and how urgent it was for him to go for treatment. After all of this, they don't have him on any treatment.",

      "Content": "Here is what I have gotten from my mother. - His last reading (the one that prompted the biopsy) showed a PSA level of 6.5 and a clinical stage of T1c - The final diagnosis (pre-radiation treatment) was as follows. This is taken directly from the diagnostic sheet. A. Prostate, Right Lateral Apex, Core Biopsy - Adenocarcinoma of the Prostate, Gleason Score 4+3=7, involving one of one core (90%, 12MM) - Intraductal Spread of Invasive Carcinoma B. Prostate, Right Lateral Mid, Core Biopsy - Adenocarcinoma of the Prostate, Gleason Score 4+5=9, involving one of one core (90%, 9MM) - Intraductal Spread of Invasive Carcinoma C. Prostate, Right Lateral Base, Core Biopsy - Adenocarcinoma of the Prostate, Gleason Score 4+5=9, involving one of one core (90%, 14MM) - Intraductal Spread of Invasive Carcinoma D. Prostate, Right Apex, Core Biopsy - Adenocarcinoma of the Prostate, Gleason Score 4+3=7, involving one of one core (100%, 14MM) - Intraductal Spread of Invasive Carcinoma The documents say that this is considered Grade Group 5 (Least favorable on Gleason score) After the biopsy they did a full body scan and a CT scan of pelvis and stomach prior to starting radiation. According to my mother, his last PSA reading (after hospitalization and all of the treatments) is .1 He is scheduled for another hormone shot in February 2018 (confirmed it's Luron) and one in June of 2018. He takes 72,000 units of Creon (2 pills) per each meal. That's 6 pills per day. He's still having issues with uncontrolled diarrhea. Happened again today.",

      "Content": "Hi all, This is my first post and I am seeking any insight that everyone can share regarding my Dad's prostate cancer. This is a bit of a long story, but I will try to make it as short as I can. My Dad is 81 years old. He and my mother have been religious about health screens and caring for themselves. Generally healthy and active. Over the past five years, however, Dad's PSA levels had gone up. Without going into the background too much, late in 2016 he went for a biopsy on his prostate. The results came back with an aggressive cancer (Gleason 9 on almost all results). There were a number of additional tests and scans done to confirm if the cancer had spread. Indications were it had not. The doctor advised that surgery was not an option. They did say that without treatment, he would not make it more than a year. Given the options, they opted for radiation therapy. He was booked in for a daily radiation treatment (IMRT) that began in late June 2017. He rapidly developed diarrhea. Working with the doctors, they advised my mother on dietary choices and taking Imodium to help control it. The situation deteriorated very quickly. They kept going to treatment, telling the doctors and nurses how bad it was getting, but they said it was normal. Nothing was normal about this. He was unable to control himself at all, no warning and explosive, liquid diarrhea almost immediately upon ingesting food. He was wearing adult diapers and soiling more than 10 a day.
