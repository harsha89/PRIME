      "Content": "Hello Again.. It's been awhile and I am sorry for that. I thought things were behind us... 2 years since surgery. My husband at 48 stage 2 PC prostate removed 2 years ago this past Nov Gleason 7 after surgery it showed more aggressive then first thought ( ready to enter into bladder wall) Before surgery it was thought to be stage one not two. First year all blood work has been negative now PSA starting to increase... first .09 2nd test .09 then .14 three weeks later .16. We are scheduled to have a cat scan and bone scan then due radiation. We have Dr apt on 12/ 18 for radiation DR. Cat scan and bone scan is schedule for next week 12/ 16. Does anyone have any thoughts.. my husband have return to normal energy level but recently fatigue has set back in. The way it was before diagnosis. Any advise would be helpful.. thank you Mary",

      "Content": "Hi Djin, Yes, the number was .07 think I added a 0 in my post sorry. Before radiation is was .16. I know the .07 is good, I love to see the number that we had in the first year. I worry. I thought anything over .04 when you don't have a prostate is concerning.",

      "Content": "Hello all.. have not been on here for awhile. Maybe someone can give some advise on this. My husband had his prostate removed two years ago he was 48. His original PSA number was 7.6 and 6 samples from biopsy were confirmed. 40% of the prostate was cancer stage II and Gleason score of 7. Doc said it was an aggressive cancer that had almost broken into the bladder . His first year out he was undetectable. 2nd year PSA number starts rising got up to .16 when he started 39 days of radiation. Done with his 39 days and just had his first blood test. We see on the hospital portal PSA number is .07 which is good that it is done but Doc said anything over .04 is a concern. Also, his testosterone went way down to 110 it was already low at 175. Will treatment lower testosterone? He doesn't see the Doc until Monday. Has anyone gone through this? I really expected a negative number. Mary",
