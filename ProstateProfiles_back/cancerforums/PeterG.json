      "Content": "Hello to all, I wish to say thank you for all the information, support and help many have you have offered thru my battle with PC. Many nervous and frightful nights I would come here to read, calm my nerves and return to bed. I assume there are many like me who never bothered to register and fight alone, but still come here for hope and assurance, and for that I am grateful. At age 47 I had blood in my urine. Next day received a DRE and a PSA test and was prescribed Cipro. 3 days later my PSA was a 10.0 3 months later my PSA was 10.2 and I was sent to Urology. 2 weeks later my Urologist did another DRE and thought he felt something and set appointment for a biopsy. The following week I had a biopsy, with 3 of 12 cores testing positive for PC at 3+3 Another PSA 10.2 I consulted with Urologist, Radiologist and Surgeon CT and bone scan negative, no cancer cold be seen. All agreed I could go on AS Received PSA every three months for 1 year 10.1 10.2 10.2 10.2 Urologist recommended another biopsy after one year, I declined and waited another 6 months. PSA's still being done every 3 months 10.2 10.2 At 18 months after 1st Biopsy, Surgeon called and said, I couldn't ignore this and to have another biopsy. Second biopsy tested 9 out of 12 cores positive 3+3 with 10-12 % cancer mass in biopsy. Urologist said AS was now over and I had to make a decision of treatment. Had meetings again with Surgeon and Radiologist. Decided to have the nerve sparing Davinci method by Dr S Conley. Surgery went excellent, she said she spared 95 % of my nerves but lost some as tumor was on the outside of my prostate on a 1 mm patch and required a 2 mm clear tissue. Yesterday I had my catheter taken out after 7 days. Was told my margins are negative, lymph nodes are clean and will have to take a PSA test once every 3 months the first year. The final pathology graded it at 3 + 4. I have almost no drip or leakage, but not much pressure urinating yet. I have not tried to achieve an erection and will start taking small doses of Viagra and doing my exercises. Don't know what the final out come will be, but that's all I have to share as its only been 36 hours after catheter removal. Once again, thanks to all of you for helping me get thru this. PeterG",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by wintertexan How is it possible to have negative margins if there was tumor outside your prostate? While in surgery the surgeon noticed a dark spot growing on the outside of my prostate and cut around it by a few mm. The pathology showed the cancer was not past the margin she cut, hence negative margin . That is my understanding. Peter G",

No full erections, however a few partials and I managed a dry orgasm , slowly and carefully. Taking Cialis 3 times a week and it sure has made me return to normal size even at a non erect stage. Still too tender to work, I have a physical job, stomache muscles still tender when I exert too much. Best Holiday Wishes to All PeterG",

      "Content": "Hey Bricks, The ED was mentally killing me too. Pills, didn't work, The VED hurt, the Trimix sucked, having to inject a needle. So finally I just resigned to masterbation with a floppy for at least dry orgasms. At a year out I was still dead in the water. My Dr kept telling me to calm down as I had lost one bundle but spared the other. All hope was lost. Then........some 13 months after surgery things started to tingle, I felt mild enlargment, then by month 15 post op it started happening again. ERECTIONS !! Now I can do what I did pre op, I still throw in a cialis at times to boost my confidence. I had given up hope just to have my body repair itself. Doc always told me, could take 3 years, but I wasn't a beleiver. Just hang in there, you will be fine. Nerve damage takes time, lots of it. It's a mental screwing when your dick is broken. Just hang in there, you will be fine. At 10 months I didn't feel anything down there. At 15 months I am back in the game. Good Luck and Hang In There. You're Right on Schedule for a Full Recovery !

      "Content": "Great, You sound like you re doing well. 3 weeks out you should start taking the Viagra or Cialis regularly to improve blood flow and prevent atrophy. I take 60 mg of Viagra 3 times a week. And 80 once a week. My understanding was this part of the recovery. I am at 6 weeks and am starting to get spontaneous erections. Well with the meds. You should call you're Dr. and get the prescription dosage and time confirmed. Best Wishes PeterG",

You will more than likely heal much faster than the norm. Getting PC young is double edged, bad that you got it at all, but recovery is easier at a young age. I don't know why you're doctor wants to wait. Perhaps he is just giving you time to come to grips with it. The fact that he is willing to wait is a good indication your life is not in danger. This page is a excellent resource , and once YOU decide the course you want to follow, you can decide. I did AS for 2 years. No regrets, but I had 6 blood tests, and two biopsys during this time. Also didn't have the fear of Cancer as Oncologist said I was safe but to be prepared when it's time as in her words \" you are playing this AS game \". I was the same age as you, with similar circumstances. At three weeks out I have very soft erections but am able to orgasm. No meds yet either ! 47 is a huge advantage, all the stats you read lump us all together. With a qualified team you will find you will exceed norms in both recovery, incontinence and ed.

You will more than likely heal much faster than the norm. Getting PC young is double edged, bad that you got it at all, but recovery is easier at a young age. I don't know why you're doctor wants to wait. Perhaps he is just giving you time to come to grips with it. The fact that he is willing to wait is a good indication your life is not in danger. This page is a excellent resource , and once YOU decide the course you want to follow, you can decide. I did AS for 2 years. No regrets, but I had 6 blood tests, and two biopsys during this time. Also didn't have the fear of Cancer as Oncologist said I was safe but to be prepared when it's time as in her words \" you are playing this AS game \". I was the same age as you, with similar circumstances. At three weeks out I have very soft erections but am able to orgasm. No meds yet either ! 47 is a huge advantage, all the stats you read lump us all together. With a qualified team you will find you will exceed norms in both recovery, incontinence and ed. Seems all you're questions were answered so best of luck in whatever path you chose. PeterG",

      "Content": "Hey Bob, I didn't have the same treatment as you but am suffering the same side effects. The Cialis and Viagra are not working well enough to be dependable or enjoyable. I am contacting my Dr today and ask about other options, perhaps you should do the same. Alcohol and some anti deppresants can effect erections as you know.But that all depends on how you were before the treatment and how much you consume. Best Regards Peter",
