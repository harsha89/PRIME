      "Content": "Thank you so much for your hep. In all honesty it is my boyfriend's uncle and so I'm not there at the hospital (we are close but I feel I shouldn't be there as his direct relatives have more of a right). All that anyone has been told is that his lower spine is crumbling. Anything else that has been discussed has been only with my boyfriend's uncle present and we believe his has asked the staff not to disclose any details yet and of course they must uphold confidentiality. He is 54, terminal (I'm not sure of his exact stage to be honest although his cancer progressed rather rapidly) and has had both chemotherapy and radiotherpay - he's had 2 or three cycles of chemotherapy. He is 54 and when he is not having chemotherapy he is rather healthy however, his chemotheray does send him rather ill. I think he's been more or lessbed bound a few times by it. But generally relatively healthy to be honest. Generally positive although just lately with the back pain he has become more agitated and down spirited. I'm sorry I couldn't be of more help but thank you so much for your reply!",

      "Content": "My relative was diagnosed with prostate cancer just over 18 months ago now. Since then he has been recieving chemotherpay although we found out that the cancer had spread to his bones around 6 months ago. Yesterday morning he had excruciating back pain and was taken into hospital where they told us that his lower spine had crumbled and that his nerve endings are wearing away which was causing him numbness. He was kept in overnight and is being kept in again tonight as another specialist is coming to see him. I just wondered if anyone knew what this meant in terms of how far along the cancer has come. Is this something that happens to a lot of cancer patients? More importantly does anyone know whether or not this will lead to paralysis? My relative is very upset. He is short and snappy (understandably so) and so we are trying not to pester him with questions. Also we are not sure what he has been told by doctors - whether or not he knows something we don't and as preciously mentioned we don't want to pester him at the minute. We're just really worried at the minute and can't find any information on crumbling of the spine in cancer patients. Any help will be greatly appreciated. Thank you so much.",
