      "Content": "Thanks to all the moderators and contributors on this site. It has been a hectic few days here regarding HIFU, so let me add a bit of my story. I am a fairly new to most of this and defer to most for my information. While first researching my options regarding my treatment for prostate cancer, I came across an article by Dr. Andrew Weil. He is the founder and Program Director of the Arizona Center for Integrative Medicine (formerly the Program in Integrative Medicine), which he started in 1994 at the University of Arizona. He has become one of the leading proponents of integrative medicine. He is a best selling author and a graduate of Harvard Medical School, and one of the most widely known and respected alternative medicine gurus. He mentioned HIFU as an alternative treatment option for PCa. I trusted him and felt I should have been told about this option and all other by my doctor...didn't happen. My urologist was not real interested in discussing options other than surgery or radiation. Others were too new or not proven. I then started my own research, which I think all guys diagnosed should do. My research also led me to Dr. Scionti that does HIFU in Mexico and Nassau. I tried to learn as much as possible about the treatment and was glad when I found any information regarding it. As I have previously posted, I consider any information beneficial to me so that I can process it and come to my own decision. I was able to talk to Dr. Scionti and I found him to be straight forward in our discussions regarding my treatment. I would have no hesitation with him doing the treatment and even considered it for a short time. I continued to research to FIND THE BEST OPTION FOR ME. I realize information is not knowledge, but I feel I can make a more logical decision with as much input as possible. Even from those that shout non stop about their choice of modality. I got to the point of not paying too much attention to those that are zealots...and they are in every forum with every treatment option. Granted, perhaps not quite as vocal as we experienced here, but they are still out there. I am on many forums to gather as much information as I can...and for those of you that are considering HIFU, I urge you to go to all the other forums and do a search on HIFU. Go to a research engine and type in HIFU and read everything. There is a specific yahoo group called HIFU survivors where you can read info there too. My point is there is a lot of stuff to read so that you can decide for yourself. For myself, I have decided on Proton Beam Therapy at Loma Linda because it is the BEST OPTION FOR ME! I start treatment next week and hope and pray to have a favorable outcome. I also pray that all that are diagnosed can find the right treatment. It might be HIFU, it might be something else. Once I had made the decision, a huge weight was lifted. Please send out positive thoughts to the Universe and pray to a higher being for me and all those that are in this battle. Thank you for this site and for your input and knowledge. You have helped more than you will ever know.",

Go to a research engine and type in HIFU and read everything. There is a specific yahoo group called HIFU survivors where you can read info there too. My point is there is a lot of stuff to read so that you can decide for yourself. For myself, I have decided on Proton Beam Therapy at Loma Linda because it is the BEST OPTION FOR ME! I start treatment next week and hope and pray to have a favorable outcome. I also pray that all that are diagnosed can find the right treatment. It might be HIFU, it might be something else. Once I had made the decision, a huge weight was lifted. Please send out positive thoughts to the Universe and pray to a higher being for me and all those that are in this battle. Thank you for this site and for your input and knowledge. You have helped more than you will ever know.",

      "Content": "Thanks to all the moderators and contributors on this site. It has been a hectic few days here regarding HIFU, so let me add a bit of my story. I am a fairly new to most of this and defer to most for my information. While first researching my options regarding my treatment for prostate cancer, I came across an article by Dr. Andrew Weil. He is the founder and Program Director of the Arizona Center for Integrative Medicine (formerly the Program in Integrative Medicine), which he started in 1994 at the University of Arizona. He has become one of the leading proponents of integrative medicine. He is a best selling author and a graduate of Harvard Medical School, and one of the most widely known and respected alternative medicine gurus. He mentioned HIFU as an alternative treatment option for PCa. I trusted him and felt I should have been told about this option and all other by my doctor...didn't happen. My urologist was not real interested in discussing options other than surgery or radiation. Others were too new or not proven. I then started my own research, which I think all guys diagnosed should do. My research also led me to Dr. Scionti that does HIFU in Mexico and Nassau. I tried to learn as much as possible about the treatment and was glad when I found any information regarding it. As I have previously posted, I consider any information beneficial to me so that I can process it and come to my own decision. I was able to talk to Dr. Scionti and I found him to be straight forward in our discussions regarding my treatment. I would have no hesitation with him doing the treatment and even considered it for a short time. I continued to research to FIND THE BEST OPTION FOR ME. I realize information is not knowledge, but I feel I can make a more logical decision with as much input as possible. Even from those that shout non stop about their choice of modality. I got to the point of not paying too much attention to those that are zealots...and they are in every forum with every treatment option.

I was able to talk to Dr. Scionti and I found him to be straight forward in our discussions regarding my treatment. I would have no hesitation with him doing the treatment and even considered it for a short time. I continued to research to FIND THE BEST OPTION FOR ME. I realize information is not knowledge, but I feel I can make a more logical decision with as much input as possible. Even from those that shout non stop about their choice of modality. I got to the point of not paying too much attention to those that are zealots...and they are in every forum with every treatment option. Granted, perhaps not quite as vocal as we experienced here, but they are still out there. I am on many forums to gather as much information as I can...and for those of you that are considering HIFU, I urge you to go to all the other forums and do a search on HIFU. Go to a research engine and type in HIFU and read everything. There is a specific yahoo group called HIFU survivors where you can read info there too. My point is there is a lot of stuff to read so that you can decide for yourself. For myself, I have decided on Proton Beam Therapy at Loma Linda because it is the BEST OPTION FOR ME! I start treatment next week and hope and pray to have a favorable outcome. I also pray that all that are diagnosed can find the right treatment. It might be HIFU, it might be something else. Once I had made the decision, a huge weight was lifted. Please send out positive thoughts to the Universe and pray to a higher being for me and all those that are in this battle. Thank you for this site and for your input and knowledge. You have helped more than you will ever know.",

      "Content": "Thanks to all the moderators and contributors on this site. It has been a hectic few days here regarding HIFU, so let me add a bit of my story. I am a fairly new to most of this and defer to most for my information. While first researching my options regarding my treatment for prostate cancer, I came across an article by Dr. Andrew Weil. He is the founder and Program Director of the Arizona Center for Integrative Medicine (formerly the Program in Integrative Medicine), which he started in 1994 at the University of Arizona. He has become one of the leading proponents of integrative medicine. He is a best selling author and a graduate of Harvard Medical School, and one of the most widely known and respected alternative medicine gurus. He mentioned HIFU as an alternative treatment option for PCa. I trusted him and felt I should have been told about this option and all other by my doctor...didn't happen. My urologist was not real interested in discussing options other than surgery or radiation. Others were too new or not proven. I then started my own research, which I think all guys diagnosed should do. My research also led me to Dr. Scionti that does HIFU in Mexico and Nassau.

He is a best selling author and a graduate of Harvard Medical School, and one of the most widely known and respected alternative medicine gurus. He mentioned HIFU as an alternative treatment option for PCa. I trusted him and felt I should have been told about this option and all other by my doctor...didn't happen. My urologist was not real interested in discussing options other than surgery or radiation. Others were too new or not proven. I then started my own research, which I think all guys diagnosed should do. My research also led me to Dr. Scionti that does HIFU in Mexico and Nassau. I tried to learn as much as possible about the treatment and was glad when I found any information regarding it. As I have previously posted, I consider any information beneficial to me so that I can process it and come to my own decision. I was able to talk to Dr. Scionti and I found him to be straight forward in our discussions regarding my treatment. I would have no hesitation with him doing the treatment and even considered it for a short time. I continued to research to FIND THE BEST OPTION FOR ME. I realize information is not knowledge, but I feel I can make a more logical decision with as much input as possible. Even from those that shout non stop about their choice of modality. I got to the point of not paying too much attention to those that are zealots...and they are in every forum with every treatment option. Granted, perhaps not quite as vocal as we experienced here, but they are still out there. I am on many forums to gather as much information as I can...and for those of you that are considering HIFU, I urge you to go to all the other forums and do a search on HIFU. Go to a research engine and type in HIFU and read everything. There is a specific yahoo group called HIFU survivors where you can read info there too. My point is there is a lot of stuff to read so that you can decide for yourself. For myself, I have decided on Proton Beam Therapy at Loma Linda because it is the BEST OPTION FOR ME! I start treatment next week and hope and pray to have a favorable outcome. I also pray that all that are diagnosed can find the right treatment. It might be HIFU, it might be something else. Once I had made the decision, a huge weight was lifted. Please send out positive thoughts to the Universe and pray to a higher being for me and all those that are in this battle. Thank you for this site and for your input and knowledge. You have helped more than you will ever know.",

      "Content": "Thanks to all the moderators and contributors on this site. It has been a hectic few days here regarding HIFU, so let me add a bit of my story. I am a fairly new to most of this and defer to most for my information. While first researching my options regarding my treatment for prostate cancer, I came across an article by Dr. Andrew Weil. He is the founder and Program Director of the Arizona Center for Integrative Medicine (formerly the Program in Integrative Medicine), which he started in 1994 at the University of Arizona. He has become one of the leading proponents of integrative medicine. He is a best selling author and a graduate of Harvard Medical School, and one of the most widely known and respected alternative medicine gurus. He mentioned HIFU as an alternative treatment option for PCa. I trusted him and felt I should have been told about this option and all other by my doctor...didn't happen. My urologist was not real interested in discussing options other than surgery or radiation. Others were too new or not proven. I then started my own research, which I think all guys diagnosed should do. My research also led me to Dr. Scionti that does HIFU in Mexico and Nassau. I tried to learn as much as possible about the treatment and was glad when I found any information regarding it. As I have previously posted, I consider any information beneficial to me so that I can process it and come to my own decision. I was able to talk to Dr. Scionti and I found him to be straight forward in our discussions regarding my treatment. I would have no hesitation with him doing the treatment and even considered it for a short time. I continued to research to FIND THE BEST OPTION FOR ME. I realize information is not knowledge, but I feel I can make a more logical decision with as much input as possible. Even from those that shout non stop about their choice of modality. I got to the point of not paying too much attention to those that are zealots...and they are in every forum with every treatment option. Granted, perhaps not quite as vocal as we experienced here, but they are still out there. I am on many forums to gather as much information as I can...and for those of you that are considering HIFU, I urge you to go to all the other forums and do a search on HIFU. Go to a research engine and type in HIFU and read everything. There is a specific yahoo group called HIFU survivors where you can read info there too. My point is there is a lot of stuff to read so that you can decide for yourself. For myself, I have decided on Proton Beam Therapy at Loma Linda because it is the BEST OPTION FOR ME! I start treatment next week and hope and pray to have a favorable outcome. I also pray that all that are diagnosed can find the right treatment. It might be HIFU, it might be something else. Once I had made the decision, a huge weight was lifted. Please send out positive thoughts to the Universe and pray to a higher being for me and all those that are in this battle. Thank you for this site and for your input and knowledge. You have helped more than you will ever know.",

      "Content": "Thanks to all the moderators and contributors on this site. It has been a hectic few days here regarding HIFU, so let me add a bit of my story. I am a fairly new to most of this and defer to most for my information. While first researching my options regarding my treatment for prostate cancer, I came across an article by Dr. Andrew Weil. He is the founder and Program Director of the Arizona Center for Integrative Medicine (formerly the Program in Integrative Medicine), which he started in 1994 at the University of Arizona. He has become one of the leading proponents of integrative medicine. He is a best selling author and a graduate of Harvard Medical School, and one of the most widely known and respected alternative medicine gurus. He mentioned HIFU as an alternative treatment option for PCa. I trusted him and felt I should have been told about this option and all other by my doctor...didn't happen. My urologist was not real interested in discussing options other than surgery or radiation. Others were too new or not proven. I then started my own research, which I think all guys diagnosed should do. My research also led me to Dr. Scionti that does HIFU in Mexico and Nassau. I tried to learn as much as possible about the treatment and was glad when I found any information regarding it. As I have previously posted, I consider any information beneficial to me so that I can process it and come to my own decision. I was able to talk to Dr. Scionti and I found him to be straight forward in our discussions regarding my treatment. I would have no hesitation with him doing the treatment and even considered it for a short time. I continued to research to FIND THE BEST OPTION FOR ME. I realize information is not knowledge, but I feel I can make a more logical decision with as much input as possible. Even from those that shout non stop about their choice of modality. I got to the point of not paying too much attention to those that are zealots...and they are in every forum with every treatment option. Granted, perhaps not quite as vocal as we experienced here, but they are still out there. I am on many forums to gather as much information as I can...and for those of you that are considering HIFU, I urge you to go to all the other forums and do a search on HIFU. Go to a research engine and type in HIFU and read everything. There is a specific yahoo group called HIFU survivors where you can read info there too. My point is there is a lot of stuff to read so that you can decide for yourself. For myself, I have decided on Proton Beam Therapy at Loma Linda because it is the BEST OPTION FOR ME! I start treatment next week and hope and pray to have a favorable outcome. I also pray that all that are diagnosed can find the right treatment. It might be HIFU, it might be something else. Once I had made the decision, a huge weight was lifted. Please send out positive thoughts to the Universe and pray to a higher being for me and all those that are in this battle.

I am on many forums to gather as much information as I can...and for those of you that are considering HIFU, I urge you to go to all the other forums and do a search on HIFU. Go to a research engine and type in HIFU and read everything. There is a specific yahoo group called HIFU survivors where you can read info there too. My point is there is a lot of stuff to read so that you can decide for yourself. For myself, I have decided on Proton Beam Therapy at Loma Linda because it is the BEST OPTION FOR ME! I start treatment next week and hope and pray to have a favorable outcome. I also pray that all that are diagnosed can find the right treatment. It might be HIFU, it might be something else. Once I had made the decision, a huge weight was lifted. Please send out positive thoughts to the Universe and pray to a higher being for me and all those that are in this battle. Thank you for this site and for your input and knowledge. You have helped more than you will ever know.",

      "Content": "Thanks to all the moderators and contributors on this site. It has been a hectic few days here regarding HIFU, so let me add a bit of my story. I am a fairly new to most of this and defer to most for my information. While first researching my options regarding my treatment for prostate cancer, I came across an article by Dr. Andrew Weil. He is the founder and Program Director of the Arizona Center for Integrative Medicine (formerly the Program in Integrative Medicine), which he started in 1994 at the University of Arizona. He has become one of the leading proponents of integrative medicine. He is a best selling author and a graduate of Harvard Medical School, and one of the most widely known and respected alternative medicine gurus. He mentioned HIFU as an alternative treatment option for PCa. I trusted him and felt I should have been told about this option and all other by my doctor...didn't happen. My urologist was not real interested in discussing options other than surgery or radiation. Others were too new or not proven. I then started my own research, which I think all guys diagnosed should do. My research also led me to Dr. Scionti that does HIFU in Mexico and Nassau. I tried to learn as much as possible about the treatment and was glad when I found any information regarding it. As I have previously posted, I consider any information beneficial to me so that I can process it and come to my own decision. I was able to talk to Dr. Scionti and I found him to be straight forward in our discussions regarding my treatment. I would have no hesitation with him doing the treatment and even considered it for a short time. I continued to research to FIND THE BEST OPTION FOR ME. I realize information is not knowledge, but I feel I can make a more logical decision with as much input as possible. Even from those that shout non stop about their choice of modality.
