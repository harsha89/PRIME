      "Content": "I had RALP on Oct 3 and I just got the catheter out and the pathology report (dated over a week ago) from my surgeon a couple of days ago Oct 18. The report says I'm stage pT3a with non-focal extraprostatic extension and margins cancer free. When I got home I found a letter from my local cancer treatment center (Canada) with an appointment for a PSA test in early December and an appointment with a radiation oncologist in mid December. I'm a little freaked out. I guess I should call and ask about the purpose of the appointment but I don't see why I would be given this appointment if I wasn't going to be offered radiation therapy. I can call the cancer clinic and ask questions but I don't even know what questions to ask. Suggestions are welcome. Thanks",
