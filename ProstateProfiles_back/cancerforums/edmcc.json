      "Content": "Visit to doctor today. My PSA was.5 and he was not very optimistic . He said to come back in six weeks for another PSA test. He told me that he would be able to tell by the \"slope\" of the next PSA if the cancer was still in the prostate bed or if it had spread to a distant site. His best case scenario was that if it was in the prostate bed I can have radiation to that area. Otherwise it has spread beyond that area and I would not be cureable. Very scary words. What options are there if this is the case?",

      "Content": "Thank you for the valued advice and I will definitely strive to do just as you suggested to stay positive and take things as they come. The incontinence is annoying but manageable and everyday seems to less of an issue. I was not really mentally prepared for this but it does seem to be the next phase of my life. I have been strengthened by the others I have seen post on this site by their ability to handle this and am very glad you guys are here. hopefully I can one day provide someone else with some type strength through my experience. The ED side is a reminder that things are different. Plenty desire but no ability. I was referred by my surgeon to a ED doctor and he prescribed 5mg Calias a pump and a product called Muse. None seem too effective yet but from what I have read that takes time to mend. But it does remind me that their are things in life that I have taken for granted for many years. I am starting to feel better and am not so obsessed by my health as I have been and starting to think about some of my hobbies that have been shelved for the last five months. zReady to learn to live with prostrate cancer instead of living for it.",

      "Content": "I am 53 years old and was completely blindsided when my yearly physical showed a 4.9 PSA. After being tested and biopsied it was found I had Gleason 7 cancer and had the DaVinci procedure on February 10, 2014. My prostrate was 80 percent cancer. The results post surgery showed no evidence of lymph node envolvement but the tissue around the prostrate did have microscopic traces of cancer. I go back to the doctor at the first of April for a PSA to see if there is any cancer remaining. Hopefully I can move forward with my life from here and deal with the issues I have now. I have been reading the posts from your members and have found them to be very informative and helpful. Even though I am no expert on this I have had a lot of guys that I am in contact daily at work asking questions and telling me thay are going to the doctor to be screened because they have never had a physical or PSA test. Maybe my problems will be able to save someone else.",

      "Content": "I had the surgery on Feb 10th this year and after two weeks returned to work for 3 to 4 hours a day for a week. It would have been very difficult for me to drive an hour work all day and drive an hour home after only two weeks. If his employer would work with you guys on a shortened work day it would certainly help in his recovery. The more rest he gets the faster he will get better. remind yourself that the main thing is take care of himself for the long run. His body will tell him what he can and cant do not an insurance company chart. I hope his recovery is speedy and before long he will be feeling human again.",
