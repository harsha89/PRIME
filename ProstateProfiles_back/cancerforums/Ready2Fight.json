      "Content": "Fixit, Welcome to our caring family. Although you don't have an official \"membership\" yet and I truly hope you never get one, all are welcomed here. It is normal to be scared, so much goes through your mind when you're suddenly thrust into this as you were. The same thing happened to us. You're still trying to digest the fact that this could be happening to you and that's very understandable. It is important, very important, that you make the right decisions along the way even while you're still trying to figure out how this is happening in your life. IMO..One of the first of many of those very important decisions you need to make is the biopsy...please get the biopsy. You may even need another biopsy after the first. This biopsy could save your life. If there is cancer there you need to find it. We found my husband's after a 2nd biopsy that was an MRI biopsy. That one told us there was probable Extracapsular extension. I can't tell you how many nights I cried wishing we would have found it sooner, BEFORE it escaped the capsule. That's what you need to do. Start now, get the necessary tests to find out if it is indeed PCa and do them as soon as it makes sense. Trust me if it is PCa you'll be happier if you're able to look back and say we found it earlier rather than later because you made a smart, medically based/recommended decision. In our case, somehow by the grace of God, we did not have extracapsular extension. Yes, take the time you need to learn and digest and use the support and knowledge of the brave men on this forum as much as you need to, in whatever fashion you need to, but while you're doing that...Get the biopsy. God bless and best wishes. Hoping you will share your results if you do get the biopsy because these guys will be here to support you if you need them or congratulate you if it turns out there's no need!",

It is normal to be scared, so much goes through your mind when you're suddenly thrust into this as you were. The same thing happened to us. You're still trying to digest the fact that this could be happening to you and that's very understandable. It is important, very important, that you make the right decisions along the way even while you're still trying to figure out how this is happening in your life. IMO..One of the first of many of those very important decisions you need to make is the biopsy...please get the biopsy. You may even need another biopsy after the first. This biopsy could save your life. If there is cancer there you need to find it. We found my husband's after a 2nd biopsy that was an MRI biopsy. That one told us there was probable Extracapsular extension. I can't tell you how many nights I cried wishing we would have found it sooner, BEFORE it escaped the capsule. That's what you need to do. Start now, get the necessary tests to find out if it is indeed PCa and do them as soon as it makes sense. Trust me if it is PCa you'll be happier if you're able to look back and say we found it earlier rather than later because you made a smart, medically based/recommended decision. In our case, somehow by the grace of God, we did not have extracapsular extension. Yes, take the time you need to learn and digest and use the support and knowledge of the brave men on this forum as much as you need to, in whatever fashion you need to, but while you're doing that...Get the biopsy. God bless and best wishes. Hoping you will share your results if you do get the biopsy because these guys will be here to support you if you need them or congratulate you if it turns out there's no need!",

It is normal to be scared, so much goes through your mind when you're suddenly thrust into this as you were. The same thing happened to us. You're still trying to digest the fact that this could be happening to you and that's very understandable. It is important, very important, that you make the right decisions along the way even while you're still trying to figure out how this is happening in your life. IMO..One of the first of many of those very important decisions you need to make is the biopsy...please get the biopsy. You may even need another biopsy after the first. This biopsy could save your life. If there is cancer there you need to find it. We found my husband's after a 2nd biopsy that was an MRI biopsy. That one told us there was probable Extracapsular extension. I can't tell you how many nights I cried wishing we would have found it sooner, BEFORE it escaped the capsule. That's what you need to do. Start now, get the necessary tests to find out if it is indeed PCa and do them as soon as it makes sense. Trust me if it is PCa you'll be happier if you're able to look back and say we found it earlier rather than later because you made a smart, medically based/recommended decision. In our case, somehow by the grace of God, we did not have extracapsular extension. Yes, take the time you need to learn and digest and use the support and knowledge of the brave men on this forum as much as you need to, in whatever fashion you need to, but while you're doing that...Get the biopsy.

      "Content": "dth, Boy I'm so sorry you're learning about PSA this way instead of easing into it by getting regular PSA tests with results within range as part of regular annual physical exams/aging. The same thing happened to us so I understand. When we got our first PSA test results we didn't even know what the prostate does. I know you feel panicked so although I don't feel qualified enough to give you advise, I do want to tell you that you're in the right place to get help, guidance, and support. I promise you that our forum experts will be along soon to answer your questions. Meanwhile, can you give us your age? Any family history of prostate cancer? I know there are other things that can cause an elevated PSA I just don't know how high they can raise it so I'll defer to our experts. Don't automatically think the worst. Hang in there, I'm sure you'll get some answers anytime now.",

      "Content": "Hello! We can get through this together! My husband does eat a banana every day for breakfast along with a chocolate chip cliff bar. He was never a coffee guy but does wash down his breakfast with a PepsiOne every morning, which is his source of caffeine. We really don't drink alcohol so he's not had any of that. I was told veggies should be very, very cooked. We've really limited them along with fruits to be safe. He had a bout with C-Diff about a year before the cancer that landed him in the hospital for a week so I'm being overly cautious. Ever since then he's been taking probiotics twice a day, RO said it was fine to keep taking those. I can't tell you how hard it is for me to shop and cook this way. I'm usually all about the healthy selections, but we were told...no whole grains, brown rice... it's almost like I sneak through the grocery store because I'm embarrassed of what is or isn't in my cart lol! It's all worth it in the end if he continues to have no big issues.",

      "Content": "I wanted to provide a quick update on how my husband is doing on his SRT. I titled it \"Quick Update\" because it will be quick due to the fact that there's not too much to tell. He has 11 more session to go so he's seeing the light at the end of the tunnel. As far as side effects I'd say the worst of it so far has been that he's tired. Not sure how much of that is from the treatment and how much is from racing around trying to do his job (pretty physical) and still make it to treatment, all while keeping up with the extra stuff life likes to throw your way. He said when he's done with treatment going back to his old life where he only has to work and not worry about making it to treatment on time will be like a vacation. That being said, as tough as it is he has never had a problem or missed a session. The nurses and techs are outstanding. If he gets there early and there's a way for them to fit him in they do it so he can be done and on his way home. I'm so thankful for the entire team we have there! He started on January 16th and is still doing great. Aside from being tired the only thing he has ever mentioned to the Dr. is a slight sense of urinary urgency that started right after the 1/2 way point. Nothing bad enough to do anything about, but the doctor said if it gets to the point that it really bothers him all he needs to do is take AZO twice a day. So far he hasn't needed to. After the first few treatments he said his skin felt a little like when you think you may have been in the sun too long (not like a sunburn, just tight) so he used the lotion they gave him twice a day, once in the AM and once in the PM. That feeling went away somewhere before the 1/2 way point and he stopped using it. We did make a big change to his diet before he started which took some getting use to for me. No whole grain anything, really pretty much white flour starchy items like rice, noodles, potatoes crackers and very limited veggies. No nuts or anything with a lot of fiber. Nothing that would stimulate his bowels incase the radiation was going to cause diarrhea or gastrointestinal issues. So far it has not. I think after treatment we'll introduce those foods back in but maybe slowly, as I know radiation is the gift that can keep on giving. It will be good to get back to a more healthy diet though. He also stopped taking all supplements/vitamins (except for the sleep aid I mentioned in another post). We didn't want anything with antioxidants interfering with letting the radiation do its job. All and all I think that's it. He's not getting ADT so we can't comment on that. The other day a reminder popped up on my calendar for his uPSA. It was an old reminder I had placed on my schedule. It would have been his 24 month from surgery uPSA (Surgery in Feb of 2017). We're obviously not doing it, but boy oh boy did those ANXIOUS thoughts and feelings run rampant through my mind and body as soon as it appeared! I'm so nervous for the first one we'll have to do after this SRT, what fun that will be, back on the PSA test train again, oh joy! I hope I didn't forget anything.

He was never a coffee guy but does wash down his breakfast with a PepsiOne every morning, which is his source of caffeine. We really don't drink alcohol so he's not had any of that. I was told veggies should be very, very cooked. We've really limited them along with fruits to be safe. He had a bout with C-Diff about a year before the cancer that landed him in the hospital for a week so I'm being overly cautious. Ever since then he's been taking probiotics twice a day, RO said it was fine to keep taking those. I can't tell you how hard it is for me to shop and cook this way. I'm usually all about the healthy selections, but we were told...no whole grains, brown rice... it's almost like I sneak through the grocery store because I'm embarrassed of what is or isn't in my cart lol! It's all worth it in the end if he continues to have no big issues.",

      "Content": "dth, Boy I'm so sorry you're learning about PSA this way instead of easing into it by getting regular PSA tests with results within range as part of regular annual physical exams/aging. The same thing happened to us so I understand. When we got our first PSA test results we didn't even know what the prostate does. I know you feel panicked so although I don't feel qualified enough to give you advise, I do want to tell you that you're in the right place to get help, guidance, and support. I promise you that our forum experts will be along soon to answer your questions. Meanwhile, can you give us your age? Any family history of prostate cancer? I know there are other things that can cause an elevated PSA I just don't know how high they can raise it so I'll defer to our experts. Don't automatically think the worst. Hang in there, I'm sure you'll get some answers anytime now.",

      "Content": "ASA, All it says is Technique: MRI Prostate; with and without intravenous administration of 20cc of MultiHance, prostate coil was used. I did notice it says \"Large ADC low\" so I wanted to try to see what the ADC was but it is not on here anywhere either. I just read something that said there's a correlation between the ADC and Gleason so I wanted to check out the ADC number. I am prepared to hear that PCa was found and I am praying for a low Gleason, but I will admit that the invasion into the urethra has set me back. It's even harder because no matter how much I look, I'm not finding anything where I can read about others that had that. Does a PIRAD 5 indicate aggressiveness or just the likeliness of PCa? Thank you for always responding when I have questions here ASA.",

      "Content": "My husband had an MRI this morning followed by his 2nd biopsy which was 16 needles. The doctor that did this biopsy was not our usual doctor. He did not want to see me to answer any of my questions and would not let me in the room to talk to him so I need to ask if anyone here can help me interrupt this findings. We should get the biopsy results next week. PROSTATE SIZE: 4.6 x 3.3 x 4.7 cm PERIPHERAL ZONE: Diffuse dark signal in the left peripheral zone, this may represent prostatitis. CENTRAL GLAND: ADC low (series 303 image 344) and T2 low (series 201 image 59) focus measuring 1.6 x 1.0 cm in the right transitional zone. There is mild early arterial enhancement with washout. There is invasion of the right prosthetic urethra by this lesion (series 201 image 56). SEMINAL VESICLES: No evidence of seminal vesicle invasion. EXTRACAPSULAR EXTENSION: There is probable anterior extracapsular extension series 201 image 58 BLADDER: No significant abnormality noted. LYMPH NODES: No significant abnormality noted. BONES, SOFT TISSUES: No significant abnormality noted. OTHER: No significant abnormality noted. IMPRESSION: 1. Large ADC low and T2 low focus in the right transitional zone with invasion of the right prostatic urethra and probable anterior extracapsular extension. PIRADS 5 (I do know what the PIRADS 5 means, highly likely that this is PCa). He did tell us that obviously this is not the location that want to see the cancer in. The part that confuses me is that he did answer one question for me at the doorway after handing me a paper copy of this report. He told me the good news is that it looks to be contained within the capsule. When he said that I told him I didn\u2019t understand because the report says probable extracapsular extension? He mumbled something about no, don\u2019t worry about that or something like so I asked him if that meant surgery was still on the table and he said yes and then pretty much walked away. I\u2019m not sure what to make of that, but what\u2019s got me really upset, even before knowing the Gleason results is the invasion into his urethra. I would really, really appreciated any help the group can give me on this until we talk to our doctor next week.",

      "Content": "Hi Tim. You should be seeing an RO now. Personally I wouldn't waste my time with a NP. Go right to the RO. Also want to add that just because you see the RO now that doesn't necessarily mean you'll immediately begin SRT. We were under the care of our RO only (no more URO at all) for a year before SRT was initiated. I think you need to find your RO and get in to see them to see how/if/when they would treat. I'm a big believer in having the right doctor for the job, with a rising PSA the next doctor you'll need is an RO. Go find them and get yourself under their care.",

      "Content": "Hi Tim. You should be seeing an RO now. Personally I wouldn't waste my time with a NP. Go right to the RO. Also want to add that just because you see the RO now that doesn't necessarily mean you'll immediately begin SRT. We were under the care of our RO only (no more URO at all) for a year before SRT was initiated. I think you need to find your RO and get in to see them to see how/if/when they would treat. I'm a big believer in having the right doctor for the job, with a rising PSA the next doctor you'll need is an RO. Go find them and get yourself under their care.",

      "Content": "Hello Brite! From one PCa wife to another...Welcome to this most helpful and supportive place. I wish there was never a reason for us to gain new members, but I am so thankful to this group. So just as I expected, I don't think there's much for me to add. I was wondering about the proper doctor for you to seek because I know for my husband, we're in sort of a holding zone. By holding zone I mean we're still seeing our URO/Surgeon but that's just because his PSA is undetectable right now. BTW, for anyone reading this...we do both love his surgeon, Dr. Zagaja at the University of Chicago and can't say enough good things about him! That being said, if my husband's PSA ever begins to rise (PRAYING THAT DOES NOT HAPPEN) I know it would be time to see an RO. When I first joined this forum I got SO MUCH advice and support, it's pretty amazing. You really grow to care so much about the people here. MM16 was the one that got us to Dr. Zagaja when I was in a place of not knowing what to do. I took full advantage even before surgery, to ask MM16 a lot of questions and decided back then that we'd go to Dr. McCall if we enter BCR. I understand that you'd rather have something closer and what luck you're in to be so close to University of Chicago and Northwestern. It really stinks to be treated that way by a doctor you've placed so much trust in. You're really putting your life in their hands and to see them treat you like that after the fact sends chills down my spine! I'm sorry that is happening to you guys. IMO it's an absolute disgrace to add stress to any family facing any kind of cancer. Do you have any other info on your husband's pathology? Did they tell you the size of his margin or the Gleason at the margin? Your doctor also decided against a six week PSA?",

      "Content": "** Wanted to clarify my \"something closer\" comment. My thoughts on that are that if it's something you can possibly swing to see the best possible doctor then that's what should be done. You want the best possible chance at a cure! That brings about two questions in my mind: 1. Logistically can the commute really be done? It's not that the person is saying they just don't want to drive that far, it's a question of is it truly possible? The bottom line is you'll have to do it daily during ART/SRT and from what I've read it's almost a science of getting there and having a full bladder and coordinating all of that. I think you really do have to make sure it's possible. Trust me, I'd drive to the end of the earth for a cure for my husband --- it's a matter of figuring out can this really work if the doctor is worth it. This is also something MM has been through as far as the full bladder and timing all of it. If your husband is retired that will help since you could be more flexible with time I suppose. 2. It's going to come down to who \"the best\" doctor is in your own opinion. You'll do the research and take in all of the advice from everyone on the PCa support forums and then all you can do is make the decision that you both feel most comfortable with. It may be an RO at Northwestern, Loyola, University of Chicago or somewhere else. I think right now MM is right to suggest a consult with Dr. McCall or Dr. Szmulewitz to get started and see what they say. God Bless and always reach out if there's anything at all I can do to help!",

      "Content": "** Wanted to clarify my \"something closer\" comment. My thoughts on that are that if it's something you can possibly swing to see the best possible doctor then that's what should be done. You want the best possible chance at a cure! That brings about two questions in my mind: 1. Logistically can the commute really be done? It's not that the person is saying they just don't want to drive that far, it's a question of is it truly possible? The bottom line is you'll have to do it daily during ART/SRT and from what I've read it's almost a science of getting there and having a full bladder and coordinating all of that. I think you really do have to make sure it's possible. Trust me, I'd drive to the end of the earth for a cure for my husband --- it's a matter of figuring out can this really work if the doctor is worth it. This is also something MM has been through as far as the full bladder and timing all of it. If your husband is retired that will help since you could be more flexible with time I suppose. 2. It's going to come down to who \"the best\" doctor is in your own opinion. You'll do the research and take in all of the advice from everyone on the PCa support forums and then all you can do is make the decision that you both feel most comfortable with. It may be an RO at Northwestern, Loyola, University of Chicago or somewhere else. I think right now MM is right to suggest a consult with Dr. McCall or Dr. Szmulewitz to get started and see what they say. God Bless and always reach out if there's anything at all I can do to help!",

      "Content": "Hello Brite! From one PCa wife to another...Welcome to this most helpful and supportive place. I wish there was never a reason for us to gain new members, but I am so thankful to this group. So just as I expected, I don't think there's much for me to add. I was wondering about the proper doctor for you to seek because I know for my husband, we're in sort of a holding zone. By holding zone I mean we're still seeing our URO/Surgeon but that's just because his PSA is undetectable right now. BTW, for anyone reading this...we do both love his surgeon, Dr. Zagaja at the University of Chicago and can't say enough good things about him! That being said, if my husband's PSA ever begins to rise (PRAYING THAT DOES NOT HAPPEN) I know it would be time to see an RO. When I first joined this forum I got SO MUCH advice and support, it's pretty amazing. You really grow to care so much about the people here. MM16 was the one that got us to Dr. Zagaja when I was in a place of not knowing what to do. I took full advantage even before surgery, to ask MM16 a lot of questions and decided back then that we'd go to Dr. McCall if we enter BCR. I understand that you'd rather have something closer and what luck you're in to be so close to University of Chicago and Northwestern. It really stinks to be treated that way by a doctor you've placed so much trust in. You're really putting your life in their hands and to see them treat you like that after the fact sends chills down my spine! I'm sorry that is happening to you guys. IMO it's an absolute disgrace to add stress to any family facing any kind of cancer. Do you have any other info on your husband's pathology? Did they tell you the size of his margin or the Gleason at the margin? Your doctor also decided against a six week PSA?",

I understand that you'd rather have something closer and what luck you're in to be so close to University of Chicago and Northwestern. It really stinks to be treated that way by a doctor you've placed so much trust in. You're really putting your life in their hands and to see them treat you like that after the fact sends chills down my spine! I'm sorry that is happening to you guys. IMO it's an absolute disgrace to add stress to any family facing any kind of cancer. Do you have any other info on your husband's pathology? Did they tell you the size of his margin or the Gleason at the margin? Your doctor also decided against a six week PSA?",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by DjinTonic I think it's too early to call BCR with just one increase. That third decimal can IMO vary both for testing reasons and physiological ones. I posted some links in another two threads about uPSA and BCR. See Michael F's comments. I assume you doc wants to repeat the uPSA sooner than another 3 months. If you measure it twice in the same day you could get a variance. You need at least a couple of increases to call BCR. Stay calm. Some folks increase a bit and then stabilize at a still low level. Yes there seems to be a lot of BCR talk on the forums lately and I've been reading all of them even before we got this result. So thank you for posting that. This is a test we got/get at Labcorp on our own. Our doctor moved him to testing every 6 months after the last undectable he got through their testing which is not uPSA. So he (the surgeon) does not even know about this. I set up a consult with the RO in 2 weeks. I'll see what she says. You're thinking maybe retest sooner? Like 2 months from now?",

I know we'll need several increases before any treatment will happen but that's what scares me at the same time. To go from <0.006 to 0.014 it has to be the PCa, what else could be generating that PSA?",

      "Content": "We just did the 9 month uPSA for my husband and I think I let myself relax a little to much because it did catch me off guard. It came back at 0.014. He does have a margin so I have sort of always kept it in my mind that there's a good chance he'd enter BCR at some point, but I was thinking it might take longer since pathology said the Gleason at his margin was a 3. I guess I was just thinking Gleason 3 is slow growing so it might take a while. This isnt really that long since surgery. I set up a consult with an RO so we're under that care/keen eye of the doctor that we'd be with should we need to move forward with SRT. Be honest with me....how bad do you think this news is? I am devastated.",

I posted some links in another two threads about uPSA and BCR. See Michael F's comments. I assume you doc wants to repeat the uPSA sooner than another 3 months. If you measure it twice in the same day you could get a variance. You need at least a couple of increases to call BCR. Stay calm. Some folks increase a bit and then stabilize at a still low level. Yes there seems to be a lot of BCR talk on the forums lately and I've been reading all of them even before we got this result. So thank you for posting that. This is a test we got/get at Labcorp on our own. Our doctor moved him to testing every 6 months after the last undectable he got through their testing which is not uPSA. So he (the surgeon) does not even know about this. I set up a consult with the RO in 2 weeks. I'll see what she says. You're thinking maybe retest sooner? Like 2 months from now?",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by st3v3 My family GP found a prostate nodule last summer. Blood test showed PSA at 5.4. Biopsy came back at Gleason 9. A bone scan in September did not show cancer. I was referred to radiation oncologist who planned treatment after MRI and CT. Markers were placed in my prostate. The MRI revealed metastatic cancer in lower spine so a second bone scan was performed and showed metastatic cancer throughout my skeleton. At this point I was referred to a medical oncologist. I suspect and hope the first bone scan was read wrong. Even if my cancer is aggressive and has spread that much in just two months maybe chemo will knock it back. st3v3, Thank you so much for sharing and I too wish you success with your treatment and recovery. I hope you don't mind me asking the group this, but I'm wondering what they can share about your PSA being below 10, and still having metastatic cancer throughout your skeleton. I guess I was just assuming that you'd have to have a PSA much higher than 5.4 to have it spread to your entire skeleton. I have learned that the Gleason will vary and I've seen men with PSAs under 10 with Gleason 8 or Gleason 9 and also seen men with higher PSAs get lower Gleason results and while I'm still trying to figure that out or wrap my mind around the fact that there's just no rule about how that works, this thread is something new to me. I have seen where the lower PSA (really lower) results in the more rare ductal cancer (which I think is more aggressive?) but I'm really thrown for a loop by the fact that you can have extensive metastatic cancer with a 5.4. Is this common? st3v3, I'll keep you and your wife in my prayers, stay strong, you are not alone!",

I guess I was just assuming that you'd have to have a PSA much higher than 5.4 to have it spread to your entire skeleton. I have learned that the Gleason will vary and I've seen men with PSAs under 10 with Gleason 8 or Gleason 9 and also seen men with higher PSAs get lower Gleason results and while I'm still trying to figure that out or wrap my mind around the fact that there's just no rule about how that works, this thread is something new to me. I have seen where the lower PSA (really lower) results in the more rare ductal cancer (which I think is more aggressive?) but I'm really thrown for a loop by the fact that you can have extensive metastatic cancer with a 5.4. Is this common? st3v3, I'll keep you and your wife in my prayers, stay strong, you are not alone!",

A bone scan in September did not show cancer. I was referred to radiation oncologist who planned treatment after MRI and CT. Markers were placed in my prostate. The MRI revealed metastatic cancer in lower spine so a second bone scan was performed and showed metastatic cancer throughout my skeleton. At this point I was referred to a medical oncologist. I suspect and hope the first bone scan was read wrong. Even if my cancer is aggressive and has spread that much in just two months maybe chemo will knock it back. st3v3, Thank you so much for sharing and I too wish you success with your treatment and recovery. I hope you don't mind me asking the group this, but I'm wondering what they can share about your PSA being below 10, and still having metastatic cancer throughout your skeleton.

      "Content": "Originally Posted by st3v3 My family GP found a prostate nodule last summer. Blood test showed PSA at 5.4. Biopsy came back at Gleason 9. A bone scan in September did not show cancer. I was referred to radiation oncologist who planned treatment after MRI and CT. Markers were placed in my prostate. The MRI revealed metastatic cancer in lower spine so a second bone scan was performed and showed metastatic cancer throughout my skeleton. At this point I was referred to a medical oncologist. I suspect and hope the first bone scan was read wrong. Even if my cancer is aggressive and has spread that much in just two months maybe chemo will knock it back. st3v3, Thank you so much for sharing and I too wish you success with your treatment and recovery. I hope you don't mind me asking the group this, but I'm wondering what they can share about your PSA being below 10, and still having metastatic cancer throughout your skeleton. I guess I was just assuming that you'd have to have a PSA much higher than 5.4 to have it spread to your entire skeleton. I have learned that the Gleason will vary and I've seen men with PSAs under 10 with Gleason 8 or Gleason 9 and also seen men with higher PSAs get lower Gleason results and while I'm still trying to figure that out or wrap my mind around the fact that there's just no rule about how that works, this thread is something new to me. I have seen where the lower PSA (really lower) results in the more rare ductal cancer (which I think is more aggressive?) but I'm really thrown for a loop by the fact that you can have extensive metastatic cancer with a 5.4. Is this common? st3v3, I'll keep you and your wife in my prayers, stay strong, you are not alone!",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by DjinTonic I think it's too early to call BCR with just one increase. That third decimal can IMO vary both for testing reasons and physiological ones. I posted some links in another two threads about uPSA and BCR. See Michael F's comments. I assume you doc wants to repeat the uPSA sooner than another 3 months. If you measure it twice in the same day you could get a variance. You need at least a couple of increases to call BCR. Stay calm. Some folks increase a bit and then stabilize at a still low level. Yes there seems to be a lot of BCR talk on the forums lately and I've been reading all of them even before we got this result. So thank you for posting that. This is a test we got/get at Labcorp on our own. Our doctor moved him to testing every 6 months after the last undectable he got through their testing which is not uPSA. So he (the surgeon) does not even know about this. I set up a consult with the RO in 2 weeks. I'll see what she says. You're thinking maybe retest sooner? Like 2 months from now?",

      "Content": "We just did the 9 month uPSA for my husband and I think I let myself relax a little to much because it did catch me off guard. It came back at 0.014. He does have a margin so I have sort of always kept it in my mind that there's a good chance he'd enter BCR at some point, but I was thinking it might take longer since pathology said the Gleason at his margin was a 3. I guess I was just thinking Gleason 3 is slow growing so it might take a while. This isnt really that long since surgery. I set up a consult with an RO so we're under that care/keen eye of the doctor that we'd be with should we need to move forward with SRT. Be honest with me....how bad do you think this news is?

      "Content": "We just did the 9 month uPSA for my husband and I think I let myself relax a little to much because it did catch me off guard. It came back at 0.014. He does have a margin so I have sort of always kept it in my mind that there's a good chance he'd enter BCR at some point, but I was thinking it might take longer since pathology said the Gleason at his margin was a 3. I guess I was just thinking Gleason 3 is slow growing so it might take a while. This isnt really that long since surgery. I set up a consult with an RO so we're under that care/keen eye of the doctor that we'd be with should we need to move forward with SRT. Be honest with me....how bad do you think this news is? I am devastated.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by DjinTonic I think it's too early to call BCR with just one increase. That third decimal can IMO vary both for testing reasons and physiological ones. I posted some links in another two threads about uPSA and BCR. See Michael F's comments. I assume you doc wants to repeat the uPSA sooner than another 3 months. If you measure it twice in the same day you could get a variance. You need at least a couple of increases to call BCR. Stay calm. Some folks increase a bit and then stabilize at a still low level. Yes there seems to be a lot of BCR talk on the forums lately and I've been reading all of them even before we got this result. So thank you for posting that. This is a test we got/get at Labcorp on our own. Our doctor moved him to testing every 6 months after the last undectable he got through their testing which is not uPSA. So he (the surgeon) does not even know about this. I set up a consult with the RO in 2 weeks. I'll see what she says. You're thinking maybe retest sooner? Like 2 months from now?",

Thanks Jack, You mentioned above that during your 2nd PSA test you were also going to get a Free PSA test. Just wondering if they did that and what the result was?",

      "Content": "A few weeks ago I got the best tip ever from Mikla. He told me where to order our own ultrasensitive PSA test online. I asked about it because we can't get the uPSA from our doctor and it was giving me A LOT of anxiety. So I used the site Mikla gave me and they use Labcorp so it was perfect! I did that and we got the results today, less than 24 hours after the blood draw. The process was incredibly simple start to finish. What did I love the most (aside from the great result)? The results came right to me as soon as they were ready! That was so awesome! No waiting for \"the call\". It was worth every last penny of the $109 cost, every last penny. Thank you Mikla!! The BEST part however is the result! <0.006! Phew, we're good for another 3 months. I'm going to enjoy the results today because I know the 90 countdown will begin for me the moment I open my eyes tomorrow. We'll see the doctor next week for his 3 month follow-up and my guess is that he'll still want to do his own PSA test as well. That test only goes as low as <0.05. Now for my question - I ordered the Labcorp test #140731 which is the uPSA w/o serial. Do I need to get the #140723 which is the uPSAwith serial? I can find the #140723 on the Labcorp site but not on the site I used to get this test without a doctor. Will the 140731 be ok to use going forward or do I need it with serial? This is a happy day for us and I'm very grateful to have everyone here supporting us - THANK YOU!",

      "Content": "So I have a question for you guys. With a 2mm Gleason 3 margin I thought we were more in the low risk category as well and now that we have the Decipher results we're in the high risk category. As much as I'd like to be back in the headspace I was in before having the Decipher results the truth is we're high risk now and I would not have known that without the Decipher test. Our URO Surgeon only tests to 0.05 which would not be good enough to warn us at 0.03 so I'm not understanding that at all. They also only wanted to test every 6 months even with a 75 Decipher. I guess that's really not a question exactly huh? My question is what do you put the most weight in: uPSA, Gleason, or Decipher? For us, we're on the same page as our RO which is different from the URO Surgeon, the trigger is 0.03. For DavefromMD, did he order the uPSA because your margin is 6mm?",

      "Content": "Hello LC. You remind me of my husband a bit in that he too has an elevated PSA but is not sure what to think, \"we don't know if I have cancer or not\" and he's right to say that because he has not yet been diagnosed. It's a confusing spot to be in. You're left wondering if the PCa is there and growing inside of you and are you making all the right moves to find it. One thing I have learned is that you have to be your own best advocate and if your gut is telling you something, go with it. You need to be able to have confidence in your doctor as you're putting these life saving decisions in his hands. Once you find the right doctor I feel like you know it because you're on the same page and that allows you to focus on the next steps. I'm not saying your current doctor is not the right doctor for you, just saying if you have doubts don't be shy about switching, you want the best warriors on your side if you are going to face this beast! We did find ourselves in this situation. Our first doctor was good with a good bedside manner and such but we just got the feeling we need someone better with much more experience. If other patients want to use him, fine by me, he was a great guy, but for my husband I had to be sure I did everything I could to connect with the best doctor and hospital that offers the best chance for a cure should he be diagnosed. Once we made that change I could physically feel a bit of relief that he was good hands (I mean that literally too since this will be his surgeon). As far as the stress of not knowing, it's so hard and each test with no diagnoses adds long stressful waiting periods. As great as it is to receive negative biopsy results, if the PSA remains elevated you're left wondering, do I have cancer, how bad is it, is it growing, should I be doing something different, something more? Did you have a free PSA test or any other types of tests like the PCA3 by chance? I wonder why you did not get the MRI with the 2nd biopsy? After my husband's negative 12 core (which I think is typically required by insurance first before you can get the MRI Fusion biopsy or any other better biopsy) we did change doctors and he said the next step would be an MRI and biopsy if he sees anything. The good thing is he does the MRI and biopsy the same day so no excruciating waiting between the MRI and biopsy. I really wish you luck, I know this is very tough. Please keep in mind that if you do have PCa it is treatable so keep doing what you're doing and make the best moves possible to find it as quickly as you can if it is there, that way you can focus on treatment and getting to the other side!",

We did find ourselves in this situation. Our first doctor was good with a good bedside manner and such but we just got the feeling we need someone better with much more experience. If other patients want to use him, fine by me, he was a great guy, but for my husband I had to be sure I did everything I could to connect with the best doctor and hospital that offers the best chance for a cure should he be diagnosed. Once we made that change I could physically feel a bit of relief that he was good hands (I mean that literally too since this will be his surgeon). As far as the stress of not knowing, it's so hard and each test with no diagnoses adds long stressful waiting periods. As great as it is to receive negative biopsy results, if the PSA remains elevated you're left wondering, do I have cancer, how bad is it, is it growing, should I be doing something different, something more? Did you have a free PSA test or any other types of tests like the PCA3 by chance? I wonder why you did not get the MRI with the 2nd biopsy? After my husband's negative 12 core (which I think is typically required by insurance first before you can get the MRI Fusion biopsy or any other better biopsy) we did change doctors and he said the next step would be an MRI and biopsy if he sees anything. The good thing is he does the MRI and biopsy the same day so no excruciating waiting between the MRI and biopsy. I really wish you luck, I know this is very tough. Please keep in mind that if you do have PCa it is treatable so keep doing what you're doing and make the best moves possible to find it as quickly as you can if it is there, that way you can focus on treatment and getting to the other side!",

      "Content": "So I have a question for you guys. With a 2mm Gleason 3 margin I thought we were more in the low risk category as well and now that we have the Decipher results we're in the high risk category. As much as I'd like to be back in the headspace I was in before having the Decipher results the truth is we're high risk now and I would not have known that without the Decipher test. Our URO Surgeon only tests to 0.05 which would not be good enough to warn us at 0.03 so I'm not understanding that at all. They also only wanted to test every 6 months even with a 75 Decipher. I guess that's really not a question exactly huh? My question is what do you put the most weight in: uPSA, Gleason, or Decipher? For us, we're on the same page as our RO which is different from the URO Surgeon, the trigger is 0.03. For DavefromMD, did he order the uPSA because your margin is 6mm?",

      "Content": "I'm posting here because I'm concerned over my husbands PSA results. He is 48 years old and just had his first PSA test in June (at my request). It came back at 6.48 and we were sent to a urologist. We saw him right away. He did a DRE and said the left side seemed slightly enlarged, otherwise it was good. He told us to wait 30 days and re-test. He ordered a Total and Free PSA test and explained how that would provide us with better insight. While we waited the long and painful 30 days, I began reading this forum day and night. I can't stress enough how very grateful I am to all of you who dedicate so much time and truly care about those that post here. Sharing your experience and knowledge is priceless and you don't find support like this anywhere else online. For this, my sincerest thank you. You have helped to get me to a more positive place. I understand why they ask you to wait 30 days before you re-test but part of me feels it may actually be to allow you time to digest and prepare. That's what I did with the help of all of you. When we stated down this road I was not able to say the \"C\" word but I'm getting there slowly as I want to be prepared and be strong for my husband. He's not quite there yet, he's still in shock over the results of his 2nd PSA test. He was expecting it to come back way lower because the urologist told us it could be just a spike in his PSA. Because he never had PSA tests before the urologist has no history to work with. Second PSA test just came back and now it's 7.22. To make things more difficult, for some unknown reason, the lab failed to do the free PSA portion so we don't have anything to go on there. Urologist said he didn't want to bother waiting to retry for the free PSA and now we're scheduled for a 12 core in his office this Thursday. I'm ready to face what we need to face but my biggest concern right now is the rapid increase in his PSA. That's a very big jump for only 4 weeks. If the biopsy comes back positive I'm concerned what will happen while we wait the 6-8 weeks we need to wait before having it removed. Because he's still under a 10 PSA I like to think that we're catching it early but after reading post after post, his always seems to be higher than others. I do realize he's not been diagnosed yet but with a 7.22 PSA it almost seems inevitable. If it is, I pray we caught it early enough that it's contained. I'd love to have opinions on this big PSA jump for those of you that have been through this.",

      "Content": "Thank you everyone for your advice and encouragement, it gives me strength to get through these upcoming days. I've read so many posts from many of you and learned so much. I have also ordered Patrick Walsh's Guide to Surviving Prostate Cancer. I would very much like to know what his free PSA was but since the lab didn't run the test and his PSA went up, I feel like it's a race against time. I know it's a \"slow growing\" cancer but during the 30 days we waited to get the FPSA it went up so much I almost wish we would have done the biopsy from day one. I'm afraid it's going to continue to rise rapidly especially during the wait for surgery (if necessary). I'll admit to being guilty as charged as far as focusing on the 30 day PSA increase but it was already so high for his age at 6.48. I was shocked when it went so much higher. I have a habit of thinking the worst so this is sending me over the top. Contributing to the problem is the fact that my husband was adopted so we know absolutely zero about his biological father. After reading everyone's stories and reading their signatures, it almost seems that once you're on this wheel it eventually gets you. It would be a blessing if his biopsy came back negative but to me, that would not mean we're in the clear. When I look at the history/signatures of the members here it looks like the biopsy results may come back negative and then many times 6 months or years later they come back positive. I also recall reading here that the 12 core can miss up to 20%? To your point Jim, you hit the nail on the head. If he has to have cancer, I'm very thankful it's a curable one. That is also how I explained it to our son. He's 27 so we filled him in on what's going on just so he's not blindsided and also so he's aware that we'll be keeping a keen eye on his prostate health as well going forward. I know all I can do right now is educate myself, try to be patient, and pray. Thanks so much, God bless.",

He pretty much just said you need to come in for a biopsy. They didn't even tell us that he'd have to do an enema before. That was something I read on this forum and told him to call and ask about only to find out yes, he does indeed need to do that. We'll ask and see what he says.",

      "Content": "Hello LC. You remind me of my husband a bit in that he too has an elevated PSA but is not sure what to think, \"we don't know if I have cancer or not\" and he's right to say that because he has not yet been diagnosed. It's a confusing spot to be in. You're left wondering if the PCa is there and growing inside of you and are you making all the right moves to find it. One thing I have learned is that you have to be your own best advocate and if your gut is telling you something, go with it. You need to be able to have confidence in your doctor as you're putting these life saving decisions in his hands. Once you find the right doctor I feel like you know it because you're on the same page and that allows you to focus on the next steps. I'm not saying your current doctor is not the right doctor for you, just saying if you have doubts don't be shy about switching, you want the best warriors on your side if you are going to face this beast! We did find ourselves in this situation. Our first doctor was good with a good bedside manner and such but we just got the feeling we need someone better with much more experience. If other patients want to use him, fine by me, he was a great guy, but for my husband I had to be sure I did everything I could to connect with the best doctor and hospital that offers the best chance for a cure should he be diagnosed. Once we made that change I could physically feel a bit of relief that he was good hands (I mean that literally too since this will be his surgeon). As far as the stress of not knowing, it's so hard and each test with no diagnoses adds long stressful waiting periods. As great as it is to receive negative biopsy results, if the PSA remains elevated you're left wondering, do I have cancer, how bad is it, is it growing, should I be doing something different, something more? Did you have a free PSA test or any other types of tests like the PCA3 by chance? I wonder why you did not get the MRI with the 2nd biopsy? After my husband's negative 12 core (which I think is typically required by insurance first before you can get the MRI Fusion biopsy or any other better biopsy) we did change doctors and he said the next step would be an MRI and biopsy if he sees anything. The good thing is he does the MRI and biopsy the same day so no excruciating waiting between the MRI and biopsy. I really wish you luck, I know this is very tough. Please keep in mind that if you do have PCa it is treatable so keep doing what you're doing and make the best moves possible to find it as quickly as you can if it is there, that way you can focus on treatment and getting to the other side!",

      "Content": "I'm posting here because I'm concerned over my husbands PSA results. He is 48 years old and just had his first PSA test in June (at my request). It came back at 6.48 and we were sent to a urologist. We saw him right away. He did a DRE and said the left side seemed slightly enlarged, otherwise it was good. He told us to wait 30 days and re-test. He ordered a Total and Free PSA test and explained how that would provide us with better insight. While we waited the long and painful 30 days, I began reading this forum day and night. I can't stress enough how very grateful I am to all of you who dedicate so much time and truly care about those that post here. Sharing your experience and knowledge is priceless and you don't find support like this anywhere else online. For this, my sincerest thank you. You have helped to get me to a more positive place. I understand why they ask you to wait 30 days before you re-test but part of me feels it may actually be to allow you time to digest and prepare. That's what I did with the help of all of you. When we stated down this road I was not able to say the \"C\" word but I'm getting there slowly as I want to be prepared and be strong for my husband. He's not quite there yet, he's still in shock over the results of his 2nd PSA test. He was expecting it to come back way lower because the urologist told us it could be just a spike in his PSA. Because he never had PSA tests before the urologist has no history to work with. Second PSA test just came back and now it's 7.22. To make things more difficult, for some unknown reason, the lab failed to do the free PSA portion so we don't have anything to go on there. Urologist said he didn't want to bother waiting to retry for the free PSA and now we're scheduled for a 12 core in his office this Thursday. I'm ready to face what we need to face but my biggest concern right now is the rapid increase in his PSA. That's a very big jump for only 4 weeks. If the biopsy comes back positive I'm concerned what will happen while we wait the 6-8 weeks we need to wait before having it removed. Because he's still under a 10 PSA I like to think that we're catching it early but after reading post after post, his always seems to be higher than others. I do realize he's not been diagnosed yet but with a 7.22 PSA it almost seems inevitable. If it is, I pray we caught it early enough that it's contained. I'd love to have opinions on this big PSA jump for those of you that have been through this.",

      "Content": "Thank you everyone for your advice and encouragement, it gives me strength to get through these upcoming days. I've read so many posts from many of you and learned so much. I have also ordered Patrick Walsh's Guide to Surviving Prostate Cancer. I would very much like to know what his free PSA was but since the lab didn't run the test and his PSA went up, I feel like it's a race against time. I know it's a \"slow growing\" cancer but during the 30 days we waited to get the FPSA it went up so much I almost wish we would have done the biopsy from day one. I'm afraid it's going to continue to rise rapidly especially during the wait for surgery (if necessary). I'll admit to being guilty as charged as far as focusing on the 30 day PSA increase but it was already so high for his age at 6.48. I was shocked when it went so much higher. I have a habit of thinking the worst so this is sending me over the top. Contributing to the problem is the fact that my husband was adopted so we know absolutely zero about his biological father. After reading everyone's stories and reading their signatures, it almost seems that once you're on this wheel it eventually gets you. It would be a blessing if his biopsy came back negative but to me, that would not mean we're in the clear. When I look at the history/signatures of the members here it looks like the biopsy results may come back negative and then many times 6 months or years later they come back positive. I also recall reading here that the 12 core can miss up to 20%? To your point Jim, you hit the nail on the head. If he has to have cancer, I'm very thankful it's a curable one. That is also how I explained it to our son. He's 27 so we filled him in on what's going on just so he's not blindsided and also so he's aware that we'll be keeping a keen eye on his prostate health as well going forward. I know all I can do right now is educate myself, try to be patient, and pray. Thanks so much, God bless.",

      "Content": "Thank you everyone for your advice and encouragement, it gives me strength to get through these upcoming days. I've read so many posts from many of you and learned so much. I have also ordered Patrick Walsh's Guide to Surviving Prostate Cancer. I would very much like to know what his free PSA was but since the lab didn't run the test and his PSA went up, I feel like it's a race against time. I know it's a \"slow growing\" cancer but during the 30 days we waited to get the FPSA it went up so much I almost wish we would have done the biopsy from day one. I'm afraid it's going to continue to rise rapidly especially during the wait for surgery (if necessary). I'll admit to being guilty as charged as far as focusing on the 30 day PSA increase but it was already so high for his age at 6.48. I was shocked when it went so much higher. I have a habit of thinking the worst so this is sending me over the top. Contributing to the problem is the fact that my husband was adopted so we know absolutely zero about his biological father. After reading everyone's stories and reading their signatures, it almost seems that once you're on this wheel it eventually gets you. It would be a blessing if his biopsy came back negative but to me, that would not mean we're in the clear. When I look at the history/signatures of the members here it looks like the biopsy results may come back negative and then many times 6 months or years later they come back positive. I also recall reading here that the 12 core can miss up to 20%? To your point Jim, you hit the nail on the head. If he has to have cancer, I'm very thankful it's a curable one. That is also how I explained it to our son. He's 27 so we filled him in on what's going on just so he's not blindsided and also so he's aware that we'll be keeping a keen eye on his prostate health as well going forward. I know all I can do right now is educate myself, try to be patient, and pray. Thanks so much, God bless.",

      "Content": "I'm posting here because I'm concerned over my husbands PSA results. He is 48 years old and just had his first PSA test in June (at my request). It came back at 6.48 and we were sent to a urologist. We saw him right away. He did a DRE and said the left side seemed slightly enlarged, otherwise it was good. He told us to wait 30 days and re-test. He ordered a Total and Free PSA test and explained how that would provide us with better insight. While we waited the long and painful 30 days, I began reading this forum day and night. I can't stress enough how very grateful I am to all of you who dedicate so much time and truly care about those that post here. Sharing your experience and knowledge is priceless and you don't find support like this anywhere else online. For this, my sincerest thank you. You have helped to get me to a more positive place. I understand why they ask you to wait 30 days before you re-test but part of me feels it may actually be to allow you time to digest and prepare. That's what I did with the help of all of you. When we stated down this road I was not able to say the \"C\" word but I'm getting there slowly as I want to be prepared and be strong for my husband. He's not quite there yet, he's still in shock over the results of his 2nd PSA test. He was expecting it to come back way lower because the urologist told us it could be just a spike in his PSA. Because he never had PSA tests before the urologist has no history to work with. Second PSA test just came back and now it's 7.22. To make things more difficult, for some unknown reason, the lab failed to do the free PSA portion so we don't have anything to go on there. Urologist said he didn't want to bother waiting to retry for the free PSA and now we're scheduled for a 12 core in his office this Thursday. I'm ready to face what we need to face but my biggest concern right now is the rapid increase in his PSA. That's a very big jump for only 4 weeks. If the biopsy comes back positive I'm concerned what will happen while we wait the 6-8 weeks we need to wait before having it removed. Because he's still under a 10 PSA I like to think that we're catching it early but after reading post after post, his always seems to be higher than others. I do realize he's not been diagnosed yet but with a 7.22 PSA it almost seems inevitable. If it is, I pray we caught it early enough that it's contained. I'd love to have opinions on this big PSA jump for those of you that have been through this.",

He pretty much just said you need to come in for a biopsy. They didn't even tell us that he'd have to do an enema before. That was something I read on this forum and told him to call and ask about only to find out yes, he does indeed need to do that. We'll ask and see what he says.",

      "Content": "I'm posting here because I'm concerned over my husbands PSA results. He is 48 years old and just had his first PSA test in June (at my request). It came back at 6.48 and we were sent to a urologist. We saw him right away. He did a DRE and said the left side seemed slightly enlarged, otherwise it was good. He told us to wait 30 days and re-test. He ordered a Total and Free PSA test and explained how that would provide us with better insight. While we waited the long and painful 30 days, I began reading this forum day and night. I can't stress enough how very grateful I am to all of you who dedicate so much time and truly care about those that post here. Sharing your experience and knowledge is priceless and you don't find support like this anywhere else online. For this, my sincerest thank you. You have helped to get me to a more positive place. I understand why they ask you to wait 30 days before you re-test but part of me feels it may actually be to allow you time to digest and prepare. That's what I did with the help of all of you. When we stated down this road I was not able to say the \"C\" word but I'm getting there slowly as I want to be prepared and be strong for my husband. He's not quite there yet, he's still in shock over the results of his 2nd PSA test. He was expecting it to come back way lower because the urologist told us it could be just a spike in his PSA. Because he never had PSA tests before the urologist has no history to work with. Second PSA test just came back and now it's 7.22. To make things more difficult, for some unknown reason, the lab failed to do the free PSA portion so we don't have anything to go on there. Urologist said he didn't want to bother waiting to retry for the free PSA and now we're scheduled for a 12 core in his office this Thursday. I'm ready to face what we need to face but my biggest concern right now is the rapid increase in his PSA. That's a very big jump for only 4 weeks. If the biopsy comes back positive I'm concerned what will happen while we wait the 6-8 weeks we need to wait before having it removed. Because he's still under a 10 PSA I like to think that we're catching it early but after reading post after post, his always seems to be higher than others. I do realize he's not been diagnosed yet but with a 7.22 PSA it almost seems inevitable. If it is, I pray we caught it early enough that it's contained. I'd love to have opinions on this big PSA jump for those of you that have been through this.",

      "Content": "Thank you everyone for your advice and encouragement, it gives me strength to get through these upcoming days. I've read so many posts from many of you and learned so much. I have also ordered Patrick Walsh's Guide to Surviving Prostate Cancer. I would very much like to know what his free PSA was but since the lab didn't run the test and his PSA went up, I feel like it's a race against time. I know it's a \"slow growing\" cancer but during the 30 days we waited to get the FPSA it went up so much I almost wish we would have done the biopsy from day one. I'm afraid it's going to continue to rise rapidly especially during the wait for surgery (if necessary). I'll admit to being guilty as charged as far as focusing on the 30 day PSA increase but it was already so high for his age at 6.48. I was shocked when it went so much higher. I have a habit of thinking the worst so this is sending me over the top. Contributing to the problem is the fact that my husband was adopted so we know absolutely zero about his biological father. After reading everyone's stories and reading their signatures, it almost seems that once you're on this wheel it eventually gets you. It would be a blessing if his biopsy came back negative but to me, that would not mean we're in the clear. When I look at the history/signatures of the members here it looks like the biopsy results may come back negative and then many times 6 months or years later they come back positive. I also recall reading here that the 12 core can miss up to 20%? To your point Jim, you hit the nail on the head. If he has to have cancer, I'm very thankful it's a curable one. That is also how I explained it to our son. He's 27 so we filled him in on what's going on just so he's not blindsided and also so he's aware that we'll be keeping a keen eye on his prostate health as well going forward. I know all I can do right now is educate myself, try to be patient, and pray. Thanks so much, God bless.",

      "Content": "Thank you everyone for your advice and encouragement, it gives me strength to get through these upcoming days. I've read so many posts from many of you and learned so much. I have also ordered Patrick Walsh's Guide to Surviving Prostate Cancer. I would very much like to know what his free PSA was but since the lab didn't run the test and his PSA went up, I feel like it's a race against time. I know it's a \"slow growing\" cancer but during the 30 days we waited to get the FPSA it went up so much I almost wish we would have done the biopsy from day one. I'm afraid it's going to continue to rise rapidly especially during the wait for surgery (if necessary). I'll admit to being guilty as charged as far as focusing on the 30 day PSA increase but it was already so high for his age at 6.48. I was shocked when it went so much higher. I have a habit of thinking the worst so this is sending me over the top. Contributing to the problem is the fact that my husband was adopted so we know absolutely zero about his biological father. After reading everyone's stories and reading their signatures, it almost seems that once you're on this wheel it eventually gets you. It would be a blessing if his biopsy came back negative but to me, that would not mean we're in the clear. When I look at the history/signatures of the members here it looks like the biopsy results may come back negative and then many times 6 months or years later they come back positive. I also recall reading here that the 12 core can miss up to 20%? To your point Jim, you hit the nail on the head. If he has to have cancer, I'm very thankful it's a curable one. That is also how I explained it to our son. He's 27 so we filled him in on what's going on just so he's not blindsided and also so he's aware that we'll be keeping a keen eye on his prostate health as well going forward. I know all I can do right now is educate myself, try to be patient, and pray. Thanks so much, God bless.",

      "Content": "I'm posting here because I'm concerned over my husbands PSA results. He is 48 years old and just had his first PSA test in June (at my request). It came back at 6.48 and we were sent to a urologist. We saw him right away. He did a DRE and said the left side seemed slightly enlarged, otherwise it was good. He told us to wait 30 days and re-test. He ordered a Total and Free PSA test and explained how that would provide us with better insight. While we waited the long and painful 30 days, I began reading this forum day and night. I can't stress enough how very grateful I am to all of you who dedicate so much time and truly care about those that post here. Sharing your experience and knowledge is priceless and you don't find support like this anywhere else online. For this, my sincerest thank you. You have helped to get me to a more positive place. I understand why they ask you to wait 30 days before you re-test but part of me feels it may actually be to allow you time to digest and prepare. That's what I did with the help of all of you. When we stated down this road I was not able to say the \"C\" word but I'm getting there slowly as I want to be prepared and be strong for my husband. He's not quite there yet, he's still in shock over the results of his 2nd PSA test. He was expecting it to come back way lower because the urologist told us it could be just a spike in his PSA. Because he never had PSA tests before the urologist has no history to work with. Second PSA test just came back and now it's 7.22. To make things more difficult, for some unknown reason, the lab failed to do the free PSA portion so we don't have anything to go on there. Urologist said he didn't want to bother waiting to retry for the free PSA and now we're scheduled for a 12 core in his office this Thursday. I'm ready to face what we need to face but my biggest concern right now is the rapid increase in his PSA. That's a very big jump for only 4 weeks. If the biopsy comes back positive I'm concerned what will happen while we wait the 6-8 weeks we need to wait before having it removed. Because he's still under a 10 PSA I like to think that we're catching it early but after reading post after post, his always seems to be higher than others. I do realize he's not been diagnosed yet but with a 7.22 PSA it almost seems inevitable. If it is, I pray we caught it early enough that it's contained. I'd love to have opinions on this big PSA jump for those of you that have been through this.",

      "Content": "Thank you everyone for your advice and encouragement, it gives me strength to get through these upcoming days. I've read so many posts from many of you and learned so much. I have also ordered Patrick Walsh's Guide to Surviving Prostate Cancer. I would very much like to know what his free PSA was but since the lab didn't run the test and his PSA went up, I feel like it's a race against time. I know it's a \"slow growing\" cancer but during the 30 days we waited to get the FPSA it went up so much I almost wish we would have done the biopsy from day one. I'm afraid it's going to continue to rise rapidly especially during the wait for surgery (if necessary). I'll admit to being guilty as charged as far as focusing on the 30 day PSA increase but it was already so high for his age at 6.48. I was shocked when it went so much higher. I have a habit of thinking the worst so this is sending me over the top. Contributing to the problem is the fact that my husband was adopted so we know absolutely zero about his biological father. After reading everyone's stories and reading their signatures, it almost seems that once you're on this wheel it eventually gets you. It would be a blessing if his biopsy came back negative but to me, that would not mean we're in the clear. When I look at the history/signatures of the members here it looks like the biopsy results may come back negative and then many times 6 months or years later they come back positive. I also recall reading here that the 12 core can miss up to 20%? To your point Jim, you hit the nail on the head. If he has to have cancer, I'm very thankful it's a curable one. That is also how I explained it to our son. He's 27 so we filled him in on what's going on just so he's not blindsided and also so he's aware that we'll be keeping a keen eye on his prostate health as well going forward. I know all I can do right now is educate myself, try to be patient, and pray. Thanks so much, God bless.",

      "Content": "I'm posting here because I'm concerned over my husbands PSA results. He is 48 years old and just had his first PSA test in June (at my request). It came back at 6.48 and we were sent to a urologist. We saw him right away. He did a DRE and said the left side seemed slightly enlarged, otherwise it was good. He told us to wait 30 days and re-test. He ordered a Total and Free PSA test and explained how that would provide us with better insight. While we waited the long and painful 30 days, I began reading this forum day and night. I can't stress enough how very grateful I am to all of you who dedicate so much time and truly care about those that post here. Sharing your experience and knowledge is priceless and you don't find support like this anywhere else online. For this, my sincerest thank you. You have helped to get me to a more positive place. I understand why they ask you to wait 30 days before you re-test but part of me feels it may actually be to allow you time to digest and prepare. That's what I did with the help of all of you. When we stated down this road I was not able to say the \"C\" word but I'm getting there slowly as I want to be prepared and be strong for my husband. He's not quite there yet, he's still in shock over the results of his 2nd PSA test. He was expecting it to come back way lower because the urologist told us it could be just a spike in his PSA. Because he never had PSA tests before the urologist has no history to work with. Second PSA test just came back and now it's 7.22. To make things more difficult, for some unknown reason, the lab failed to do the free PSA portion so we don't have anything to go on there. Urologist said he didn't want to bother waiting to retry for the free PSA and now we're scheduled for a 12 core in his office this Thursday. I'm ready to face what we need to face but my biggest concern right now is the rapid increase in his PSA. That's a very big jump for only 4 weeks. If the biopsy comes back positive I'm concerned what will happen while we wait the 6-8 weeks we need to wait before having it removed. Because he's still under a 10 PSA I like to think that we're catching it early but after reading post after post, his always seems to be higher than others. I do realize he's not been diagnosed yet but with a 7.22 PSA it almost seems inevitable. If it is, I pray we caught it early enough that it's contained. I'd love to have opinions on this big PSA jump for those of you that have been through this.",

I tried looking for further research or findings on that but didn't really find anything so I'm thankful to you for sharing his words. I'll take all the hope and positive thoughts I can get.",

My husband was 48 when this all started for us and turned 49 1 week prior to surgery. After a negative 12 core biopsy he was able to get an MRI fused biopsy just as Michael F. mentioned above and thank goodness it found the cancer. We had to get the standard 12 core first because insurance would not pay for the MRI biopsy if we did not go through that step first I think that kind of stinks but we had no choice I would rather have just gotten the MRI biopsy right from the get-go.

      "Content": "Welcome PCH and thank you for sharing your story, it's a real eye opener! So if it is indeed a reoccurrence what has it been surviving on for ten years? I thought I've read that a Gleason 6 can't live without a prostate? Or am I confused and that's only that it can't live \"outside\" of a prostate? Still there is no prostate so 10 years is a long time to just be hanging out unless there's some benign prostate tissue remaining? I'd love to hear what you guys think. Good luck to you PCH and if you need us, we're all here for you!",

You can come here with all of your questions and concerns without worrying what people will think because we all understand and care about each other here and now you're stuck with us So I openly admit to being an EMEXTRE worrior which means I understand when you say you are numb. Nothing is the same once you get the diagnoses, until...you've had time to let it sink in, been through all of the testing, took your time and developed a plan of attack and put it into action. Then or maybe even at some point along the way things do start to become clearer and somewhat the same again. I guess you'd call it the new normal where you still worry over the next step but in between them you see the beauty of what you have at that moment and truly treasure everything. For you and your husband right now, keep checking in here and sharing with these fine fellows. They know so much and the more information you can provide them with the more they can and will help you. Your husband's PSA is not super high (my husband's was higher) and even though he's a Gleason 8 that in no way means a cure is not possible. Dont try to tackle everything all at once. Take it in phases and study up on what ever stage you're in and then onto the next. Diagnosis, treatment, recovery, aftercare.. I know as the caregivers we try to think of everything top to bottom all at once and that does not help anyone so don't feel like you need to know it all right now. That would be too overwhelming for you. I did this in the beginning and it made it very difficult for me to learn everything I was trying to study and read and read and read about everything all at once and it was too much to comprehend. I had to slow down and take it in chunks and focus on what we were dealing with at the moment trying to learn about diagnosis, treatment and biochemical reoccurrence all at the same time was way too much for me and was burdening me and my ability to care for my husband. I think I've ranted on long enough now. I really just want to convey to you that from one wife to another I understand what's in your mind and I am definitely here for you along with the other forum family members!",

      "Content": "Hello Joe. That's a good question that I'm sure someone here will have an answer to. I'd be curious to know the answer as well so I'll keep an eye on this thread. From what I've read the 4 rating indicates that the likelihood of the presence of cancer in the prostate is \"high\" if your score was 5 it would have been a \"very high\" likelihood. I don't know how the PI Rad score relates to the level of \"aggressiveness\" as a gleason would provide from a biopsy. I don't know if it's all relative, meaning if they score you at a high likelihood that means there's more of it, therfore it's \"aggressive\"? I don't know but thank goodness Friday is not that far off now and you'll be able to get the answers from your doctor. The waiting and the not knowing what's going on is very difficult for sure. Let's wait and see if anyone here can tell us.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by DjinTonic If you need an expensive test and unsure whether it will be covered by your insurance, I suggest contacting the company and asking what your max out-of-pocket cost would be if your are denied coverage but want to consider paying for it yourself. In my case the fee I had to pay was very small. Get the price in writing--I did, and it turned out the sales rep who emailed me the cost was no longer working at the company by the time I was denied coverage. They had not run the test, at which point I had to authorize it myself. (GenomeDx honored the amount agreed after I forwarded the email. I paid and they then requested tissue from my RP. This delayed everything by a month, but I got the test done in the end.) Yep! I agree Gary! This was very helpful to me! In fact, I did exactly as DJ suggested above and the folks at GenomeDx were more than helpful. I now have a plan in place in case our insurance denies the test to make sure we still get it done. I would not have known any of this without your post so THANK YOU!",

      "Content": "Bad68, Welcome to the club and to this wonderful forum. Not so great to have the official club membership, I get that, but you'll quickly see how being here will help you and your wife. So my husband was 48 when diagnosed as well and he just had surgery in February. He is doing great! Please make sure to tell your wife this and I want to make sure you hear my message loud and clear as well because it's important that you know that you're doing the right thing and that neither of you should think of this as a death sentence. I feel silly saying that because I am admittedly still overly concerned to put it mildly (if that's really possible with cancer I'm not sure) but I have been told many many times that I need to relax so I can certainly most definitely relate to your wife that's why I feel it's a bit ironic for me to say this but I really do mean it...Your PSA is not super high and you're a Gleason 6. If you have to have PCa that's what you would want to be. How are you doing/feeling? Are you hanging in there ok? Just try to take this step by step it will maybe take a bit of time to absorb but you will be okay please know that. Keep checking back as more of our fine forum brothers will be responding to give you more insight from their point of view since I personally did not go through this I may not be able to share that but I definitely can relate to your wife so please update us on this site and tell your wife everything will be ok. If she ever needs anyone to talk to I am here for her. Sincerely wishing you the best, R2F Forgot to ask if you can tell us where you're located?",

      "Content": "Scott, have any of your PSA tests ever included a free PSA? Just curious because your case seems somewhat similar to my husband. He too felt that he was going to the washroom more often during the day and at times with an increased sense of urgency and uses the washroom once maybe twice during the night. Both of our urologists said that really wasn't that much over the average. They pretty much didn't pay that much attention to it at best they asked him how much water he drinks and I guess he was drinking a fair amount so that's what they attributed it to. But who knows it's so hard to tell what all of this means it's different for everybody and sometimes from one doctor to the next.",

      "Content": "Since the start of this process with my husband, I've been making my son promise to ask for a PSA test at his next regular visit to the doctor. My husband was adopted so we did not have the benefit of having knowledge of any family health history. I'm going to make sure PCa does not catch my son by surprise as it did us. It may or may not be in the cards for him, but we're going to stay on top of it so if it is, we'll catch it as early as possible. Our son is 28 years old. He just told his doctor about his dad and asked for a PSA test. His doctor told him that if our \"specialist\" (Dr. Zagaja at the University of Chicago) thinks my son is \"at risk\" he will go ahead and write a letter of opinion to try to get my son's insurance to approve a PSA test. My thoughts on this are: 1. The only way I can understand what my son's doctor is saying is because my husband has not yet been diagnosed (see my signature) but he didn't say that was the reason he needed to know what my husband's doctor thought. He said it's because my son is only 28. 2. Once a family history is established, i.e. my husband is diagnosed, then IMO, my son is at risk. 3. Despite the fact that he's only 28, I think he still needs to test his PSA so at the very least, he'll have a trend established. That was the first thing our doctors asked us. They wanted to know what my husband's PSA history was and we had no history. His first elevated PSA was the only PSA test he ever had. 4. We asked what the youngest patient our surgeon had ever operated on was and his answer was 32. I don't think 28 is too young to get a simple life saving blood test! 5. If insurance won't pay for it, we'll pay for it but at what point will insurance agree it's warranted? If his dad/my husband does indeed have PCa it will have to be approved at some point during his younger years. What's the age that insurance companies feel that our precious sons/grandsons can get this test? 6. Although it's not so common, I think men do get PCa in their 20's and I know they do in their 30's. Starting to test at the age of 28 even if it's just to establish a history, seems reasonable to me, especially if you don't know the history of your paternal grandfather and your father has PCa (once we have that confirmed). My son is going to discuss this with his doctor again face to face (initial conversation was on the phone via a nurse) so I told him to find out what exactly his doctor needs from our doctor and I will try to get it! I know I'm an overprotective wife and mother so...I'd like to know what you guys think. Am I overreacting by asking for a PSA test for our 28 year old son? All my best to all of you!",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by gronskis I have been researching the (non-cancerous) reasons for elevated PSA, but I cannot find anything that seems to apply to my situation. My concern is that adenocarcinoma may still be lurking within the prostate, and has not yet been discovered in the three biopsies. My question to the forum members is where do I go from here? What are the next logical steps, medical tests etc. that I should take to determine what is actually causing these precipitous increases in PSA levels. Since you found Gleason 6 in 2 cores in 2013, have a family history of PCa, and your PSA is rising do you have the option of treatment now if you want it or does your doctor want to do another biopsy or other tests like a PCA3 before recommending treatment? I ask because I don't know what the \"rules\" are. Is it once they find the PCa you have the option of treatment including RP or does he have to find a certain amount of PCa before he gives the go ahead? Really just wondering if the decision is ultimately yours to move forward with treatment at any point after it's initially discovered or how that works?",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by gronskis I have been researching the (non-cancerous) reasons for elevated PSA, but I cannot find anything that seems to apply to my situation. My concern is that adenocarcinoma may still be lurking within the prostate, and has not yet been discovered in the three biopsies. My question to the forum members is where do I go from here? What are the next logical steps, medical tests etc. that I should take to determine what is actually causing these precipitous increases in PSA levels. Since you found Gleason 6 in 2 cores in 2013, have a family history of PCa, and your PSA is rising do you have the option of treatment now if you want it or does your doctor want to do another biopsy or other tests like a PCA3 before recommending treatment? I ask because I don't know what the \"rules\" are. Is it once they find the PCa you have the option of treatment including RP or does he have to find a certain amount of PCa before he gives the go ahead? Really just wondering if the decision is ultimately yours to move forward with treatment at any point after it's initially discovered or how that works?",

      "Content": "Hello Gacabrini. I very much agree what those above are telling you. I also understand how difficult it can be to try to discuss this with someone that doesn't want to discuss it. Although my husband didn't want to talk about it, he was willing to move forward with tests and finding better/different doctors that were willing to do further tests. When I talk to people about what is happening to me now I ALWAYS tell them to test their PSA or the PSA of their loved ones. To my surprise many just say ok but it goes in one ear and out the other. I have learned over the past 6 months that we've been going through this why some do that. It's because they don't want to be in our shoes. It's the same reason why sometimes when people do get a negative basic 12 core biopsy they say oh thank goodness and they just move one while their PSA is still high. They think what they don't know can't hurt them, but if PCa is there and they ignore it, it can. They don't want to have to deal with it and they certainly don't want PCa to come true for them. Let's be honest, until it happens to you, you think that happens to other people, but not to me. Some people don't like to go to the doctor so if you do get lucky and get them to go, they just do what the doctor says and would never think to have an opinion of their own, let alone one that may go against what a doctor has told them. If I had a dime for every time I asked my husband to do something or consider this test, or this new doctor, or doing something else and he said to me \"you're not a doctor\", well, I'd have a lot of dimes but... I just let him say that because in the end he is willing to do it. If we were not married and he was on his own I can promise you he would not. Some people are just not like that. My dad said he'd be the same way, he'd just do strictly what his doctor told him. What the wonderful men on this forum are telling you is very important for both of you. You need to find a way to get him to let you in. He does need to become the patient and allow you to help. You'll need to do exactly what you're doing, research and try to find ways to allow you to help. His job will be to let the doctors do what they need to do because it could come down to saving his life and if it turns out to be an infection or BPH you'll just end up being very thankful and it will help you to realize how lucky you are to have each other. I think deep down inside my husband came to realize this was serious and he needed to do these things he never dreamed he'd have to (DREs and Biopsies). I also know a big part of his willingness to do them was to help me. I know that sounds crazy and wrong and it's something I feel bad about (the fact that I let my emotions show so much that it worried him), but at least it got him to move forward with the tests that found his PCa. Because he has the kindest heart ever and cares more for me more than himself, he was willing to because he saw how worried I was. The men here on this forum helped me to understand that it was not going to help him to see me like that so I am doing better with it. If your BF is not willing to do anything different for his own sake can you ask him to please do it for you? Your BF has a high PSA that needs to be better investigated soon rather than later. I think the guys here can make recommendations for excellent doctors and hospitals in your area if you ask. That's how I found out about where to take my husband. Wishing you strength while you stay on top of this and take care of your BF and yourself!",

      "Content": "Hello brake. Welcome to your safe landing place! You can come here with all of your questions and concerns without worrying what people will think because we all understand and care about each other here and now you're stuck with us So I openly admit to being an EMEXTRE worrior which means I understand when you say you are numb. Nothing is the same once you get the diagnoses, until...you've had time to let it sink in, been through all of the testing, took your time and developed a plan of attack and put it into action. Then or maybe even at some point along the way things do start to become clearer and somewhat the same again. I guess you'd call it the new normal where you still worry over the next step but in between them you see the beauty of what you have at that moment and truly treasure everything. For you and your husband right now, keep checking in here and sharing with these fine fellows. They know so much and the more information you can provide them with the more they can and will help you. Your husband's PSA is not super high (my husband's was higher) and even though he's a Gleason 8 that in no way means a cure is not possible. Dont try to tackle everything all at once. Take it in phases and study up on what ever stage you're in and then onto the next. Diagnosis, treatment, recovery, aftercare.. I know as the caregivers we try to think of everything top to bottom all at once and that does not help anyone so don't feel like you need to know it all right now. That would be too overwhelming for you. I did this in the beginning and it made it very difficult for me to learn everything I was trying to study and read and read and read about everything all at once and it was too much to comprehend. I had to slow down and take it in chunks and focus on what we were dealing with at the moment trying to learn about diagnosis, treatment and biochemical reoccurrence all at the same time was way too much for me and was burdening me and my ability to care for my husband. I think I've ranted on long enough now. I really just want to convey to you that from one wife to another I understand what's in your mind and I am definitely here for you along with the other forum family members!",

      "Content": "Hello brake. Welcome to your safe landing place! You can come here with all of your questions and concerns without worrying what people will think because we all understand and care about each other here and now you're stuck with us So I openly admit to being an EMEXTRE worrior which means I understand when you say you are numb. Nothing is the same once you get the diagnoses, until...you've had time to let it sink in, been through all of the testing, took your time and developed a plan of attack and put it into action. Then or maybe even at some point along the way things do start to become clearer and somewhat the same again. I guess you'd call it the new normal where you still worry over the next step but in between them you see the beauty of what you have at that moment and truly treasure everything. For you and your husband right now, keep checking in here and sharing with these fine fellows. They know so much and the more information you can provide them with the more they can and will help you. Your husband's PSA is not super high (my husband's was higher) and even though he's a Gleason 8 that in no way means a cure is not possible. Dont try to tackle everything all at once. Take it in phases and study up on what ever stage you're in and then onto the next. Diagnosis, treatment, recovery, aftercare.. I know as the caregivers we try to think of everything top to bottom all at once and that does not help anyone so don't feel like you need to know it all right now. That would be too overwhelming for you. I did this in the beginning and it made it very difficult for me to learn everything I was trying to study and read and read and read about everything all at once and it was too much to comprehend. I had to slow down and take it in chunks and focus on what we were dealing with at the moment trying to learn about diagnosis, treatment and biochemical reoccurrence all at the same time was way too much for me and was burdening me and my ability to care for my husband. I think I've ranted on long enough now. I really just want to convey to you that from one wife to another I understand what's in your mind and I am definitely here for you along with the other forum family members!",

      "Content": "Hello Gacabrini. I very much agree what those above are telling you. I also understand how difficult it can be to try to discuss this with someone that doesn't want to discuss it. Although my husband didn't want to talk about it, he was willing to move forward with tests and finding better/different doctors that were willing to do further tests. When I talk to people about what is happening to me now I ALWAYS tell them to test their PSA or the PSA of their loved ones. To my surprise many just say ok but it goes in one ear and out the other. I have learned over the past 6 months that we've been going through this why some do that. It's because they don't want to be in our shoes. It's the same reason why sometimes when people do get a negative basic 12 core biopsy they say oh thank goodness and they just move one while their PSA is still high. They think what they don't know can't hurt them, but if PCa is there and they ignore it, it can. They don't want to have to deal with it and they certainly don't want PCa to come true for them. Let's be honest, until it happens to you, you think that happens to other people, but not to me. Some people don't like to go to the doctor so if you do get lucky and get them to go, they just do what the doctor says and would never think to have an opinion of their own, let alone one that may go against what a doctor has told them. If I had a dime for every time I asked my husband to do something or consider this test, or this new doctor, or doing something else and he said to me \"you're not a doctor\", well, I'd have a lot of dimes but... I just let him say that because in the end he is willing to do it. If we were not married and he was on his own I can promise you he would not. Some people are just not like that. My dad said he'd be the same way, he'd just do strictly what his doctor told him. What the wonderful men on this forum are telling you is very important for both of you. You need to find a way to get him to let you in. He does need to become the patient and allow you to help. You'll need to do exactly what you're doing, research and try to find ways to allow you to help. His job will be to let the doctors do what they need to do because it could come down to saving his life and if it turns out to be an infection or BPH you'll just end up being very thankful and it will help you to realize how lucky you are to have each other. I think deep down inside my husband came to realize this was serious and he needed to do these things he never dreamed he'd have to (DREs and Biopsies). I also know a big part of his willingness to do them was to help me. I know that sounds crazy and wrong and it's something I feel bad about (the fact that I let my emotions show so much that it worried him), but at least it got him to move forward with the tests that found his PCa. Because he has the kindest heart ever and cares more for me more than himself, he was willing to because he saw how worried I was. The men here on this forum helped me to understand that it was not going to help him to see me like that so I am doing better with it. If your BF is not willing to do anything different for his own sake can you ask him to please do it for you? Your BF has a high PSA that needs to be better investigated soon rather than later. I think the guys here can make recommendations for excellent doctors and hospitals in your area if you ask. That's how I found out about where to take my husband. Wishing you strength while you stay on top of this and take care of your BF and yourself!",

      "Content": "Welcome PCH and thank you for sharing your story, it's a real eye opener! So if it is indeed a reoccurrence what has it been surviving on for ten years? I thought I've read that a Gleason 6 can't live without a prostate? Or am I confused and that's only that it can't live \"outside\" of a prostate? Still there is no prostate so 10 years is a long time to just be hanging out unless there's some benign prostate tissue remaining? I'd love to hear what you guys think. Good luck to you PCH and if you need us, we're all here for you!",

It was recommended to us by our RO and I guess the key is having the L-Theanine with the Melatonin. After trying lots of things this seems to really work. My husband has to get up very early every day and this really doesn't interfere with that, he's not groggy or anything. I got him the Puritans Pride brand and its not very expensive at all.

From what I've read the 4 rating indicates that the likelihood of the presence of cancer in the prostate is \"high\" if your score was 5 it would have been a \"very high\" likelihood. I don't know how the PI Rad score relates to the level of \"aggressiveness\" as a gleason would provide from a biopsy. I don't know if it's all relative, meaning if they score you at a high likelihood that means there's more of it, therfore it's \"aggressive\"? I don't know but thank goodness Friday is not that far off now and you'll be able to get the answers from your doctor. The waiting and the not knowing what's going on is very difficult for sure. Let's wait and see if anyone here can tell us.",

      "Content": "Bad68, Welcome to the club and to this wonderful forum. Not so great to have the official club membership, I get that, but you'll quickly see how being here will help you and your wife. So my husband was 48 when diagnosed as well and he just had surgery in February. He is doing great! Please make sure to tell your wife this and I want to make sure you hear my message loud and clear as well because it's important that you know that you're doing the right thing and that neither of you should think of this as a death sentence. I feel silly saying that because I am admittedly still overly concerned to put it mildly (if that's really possible with cancer I'm not sure) but I have been told many many times that I need to relax so I can certainly most definitely relate to your wife that's why I feel it's a bit ironic for me to say this but I really do mean it...Your PSA is not super high and you're a Gleason 6. If you have to have PCa that's what you would want to be. How are you doing/feeling? Are you hanging in there ok? Just try to take this step by step it will maybe take a bit of time to absorb but you will be okay please know that. Keep checking back as more of our fine forum brothers will be responding to give you more insight from their point of view since I personally did not go through this I may not be able to share that but I definitely can relate to your wife so please update us on this site and tell your wife everything will be ok. If she ever needs anyone to talk to I am here for her. Sincerely wishing you the best, R2F Forgot to ask if you can tell us where you're located?",

      "Content": "Scott, have any of your PSA tests ever included a free PSA? Just curious because your case seems somewhat similar to my husband. He too felt that he was going to the washroom more often during the day and at times with an increased sense of urgency and uses the washroom once maybe twice during the night. Both of our urologists said that really wasn't that much over the average. They pretty much didn't pay that much attention to it at best they asked him how much water he drinks and I guess he was drinking a fair amount so that's what they attributed it to. But who knows it's so hard to tell what all of this means it's different for everybody and sometimes from one doctor to the next.",

      "Content": "Thanks for your replies guys. That's amazing, I had no idea an immunization against prostate cancer was even on the horizon. I think part of the reason why I was so bothered by having to justify the PSA test for my son could be caused in part by the reaction I think we sometimes run into when anyone under the age of 50 wants a PSA test. Even our original family doctor kind of smiled and grinned like I was crazy when I asked for one for my 48 year old husband. I think the world should be just as aware of PSA/PCa for men as they are about breast cancer for us! Thanks so much I feel better knowing we can just go in and get the test without a doctor requesting it. Maybe I'll give it to him for Christmas kinda like I put a 6 week ACT preparation class under the tree for him while he was in high school lol! Trinity, thanks for sharing what your doctor said about testing your sons at age 35. That does help me to worry less.",

      "Content": "Since the start of this process with my husband, I've been making my son promise to ask for a PSA test at his next regular visit to the doctor. My husband was adopted so we did not have the benefit of having knowledge of any family health history. I'm going to make sure PCa does not catch my son by surprise as it did us. It may or may not be in the cards for him, but we're going to stay on top of it so if it is, we'll catch it as early as possible. Our son is 28 years old. He just told his doctor about his dad and asked for a PSA test. His doctor told him that if our \"specialist\" (Dr. Zagaja at the University of Chicago) thinks my son is \"at risk\" he will go ahead and write a letter of opinion to try to get my son's insurance to approve a PSA test. My thoughts on this are: 1. The only way I can understand what my son's doctor is saying is because my husband has not yet been diagnosed (see my signature) but he didn't say that was the reason he needed to know what my husband's doctor thought. He said it's because my son is only 28. 2. Once a family history is established, i.e. my husband is diagnosed, then IMO, my son is at risk. 3. Despite the fact that he's only 28, I think he still needs to test his PSA so at the very least, he'll have a trend established. That was the first thing our doctors asked us. They wanted to know what my husband's PSA history was and we had no history. His first elevated PSA was the only PSA test he ever had. 4. We asked what the youngest patient our surgeon had ever operated on was and his answer was 32. I don't think 28 is too young to get a simple life saving blood test! 5. If insurance won't pay for it, we'll pay for it but at what point will insurance agree it's warranted? If his dad/my husband does indeed have PCa it will have to be approved at some point during his younger years. What's the age that insurance companies feel that our precious sons/grandsons can get this test? 6. Although it's not so common, I think men do get PCa in their 20's and I know they do in their 30's. Starting to test at the age of 28 even if it's just to establish a history, seems reasonable to me, especially if you don't know the history of your paternal grandfather and your father has PCa (once we have that confirmed). My son is going to discuss this with his doctor again face to face (initial conversation was on the phone via a nurse) so I told him to find out what exactly his doctor needs from our doctor and I will try to get it! I know I'm an overprotective wife and mother so...I'd like to know what you guys think. Am I overreacting by asking for a PSA test for our 28 year old son? All my best to all of you!",

      "Content": "Thanks for your replies guys. That's amazing, I had no idea an immunization against prostate cancer was even on the horizon. I think part of the reason why I was so bothered by having to justify the PSA test for my son could be caused in part by the reaction I think we sometimes run into when anyone under the age of 50 wants a PSA test. Even our original family doctor kind of smiled and grinned like I was crazy when I asked for one for my 48 year old husband. I think the world should be just as aware of PSA/PCa for men as they are about breast cancer for us! Thanks so much I feel better knowing we can just go in and get the test without a doctor requesting it. Maybe I'll give it to him for Christmas kinda like I put a 6 week ACT preparation class under the tree for him while he was in high school lol! Trinity, thanks for sharing what your doctor said about testing your sons at age 35. That does help me to worry less.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by gronskis I have been researching the (non-cancerous) reasons for elevated PSA, but I cannot find anything that seems to apply to my situation. My concern is that adenocarcinoma may still be lurking within the prostate, and has not yet been discovered in the three biopsies. My question to the forum members is where do I go from here? What are the next logical steps, medical tests etc. that I should take to determine what is actually causing these precipitous increases in PSA levels. Since you found Gleason 6 in 2 cores in 2013, have a family history of PCa, and your PSA is rising do you have the option of treatment now if you want it or does your doctor want to do another biopsy or other tests like a PCA3 before recommending treatment? I ask because I don't know what the \"rules\" are. Is it once they find the PCa you have the option of treatment including RP or does he have to find a certain amount of PCa before he gives the go ahead? Really just wondering if the decision is ultimately yours to move forward with treatment at any point after it's initially discovered or how that works?",

      "Content": "Hello to all of my friends! Well I've been away for awhile but still reading everything here. I have also had the pleasure of keeping in touch with Michigan Man because he is so thoughtful of all of us here, he was checking in on me. I had many people in my life dx with cancer since I last posted and with the huge amount of worry over what my husband's final pathology was going to say I decided it might be a good idea for me to try to take a step back. I was very, very worried about the probable extracapsular extension noted in the MRI. I tried to stay quite until after the surgery when I knew what I was dealing with. Surgery was this past Wednesday and went very smooth. The only surprise was how swollen his face was when I saw him in recovery. It got better the next morning and luckily they warned me before he went to the OR that this could happen from the position he would be in during surgery. I received several updates as the surgery progressed and I cried happy tears when they called and gave me the update saying \"the prostate is out\". We met with the surgeon in the consult room after surgery. He told me he spared both nerve bundles and the surgery was pretty much text book. He said he did not think it escaped the capsule and there was less cancer than expected. He was honest and warned us that the devil is in the details and as all of us here know, we must wait for the final pathology. He shook the hands of all of my family that was in the room with us and I got to hug him in place of the handshake. It was important to me to hug the man that likely just saved my husband's life. He was the one that helped me find that cancer and the man that took it out. I needed to let him know how thankful my entire family is. I just cannot say enough about our Doctor, Dr. Zagaja. He has always taken the time to talk to us for as long as we need and ALWAYS makes you feel like he's just one person talking to another. He is kind and doesn't sugar coat anything. He talked with us the morning after the surgery and we were able to ask him everything and anything and never once felt rushed or that we were asking silly questions (and trust me I really do ask A LOT of questions!!). As soon as my husband got to his room out of recovery that night he ate a turkey sandwich and the night was uneventful. We had THE BEST NURSE EVER and I know that made a big difference for us throughout the night. He got up and started walking at about 2 am and by 9 am we were taking lots of trips up and down the hallway together. If our nurse, Stephanie happened to see us while we were on a walk she would dance and sing all the way down the hallway. He started passing gas right on schedule after that and we went home at about 11:00 am. The catheter was a total non-issue. Easy to keep clean and shower with and honestly was not a problem at all. He never had a single issue with it. NOTE ON THE RECLINER....that was one of the best tips I got here so THANK YOU! He would get up and take his walks around the house and was always happy to return to the recliner. We purchased one that is electric and reclines all the way back like a bed. It was very much like a hospital bed and he could keep it at whatever angle he wanted. I think he took one pain pill and then just used Advil and Tylenol. They gave us an RX for stool softener at the hospital (to save us some $$) and the doctor told him to take it 3 times a day. If he didn't have a BM by the end of the next day he said to take Maalox and the secret is to chase the Maalox with a cup of either something very hot or very cold. We did that and it worked like magic. BM was not painful and he's been going just as he usually does ever since. He is still taking 3 stool softeners a day. Today was the big day, the catheter removal! Another smooth event. Appointment was a 8:30 am and we were there early (of course!) they took us in, I asked A LOT of questions and they took out the catheter. I think we were back heading down Lake Shore Drive within an hour. When we were there the pathology was not ready yet but Matt, our wonderful PA promised to keep checking throughout the morning because by now he knows how much I worry. So far my husband has been able to urinate on his own. When he thinks he needs to go he gets up and seems to make it to the bathroom in time. It starts with a few dribbles and then he pretty much goes like he use to. We both comment each and every time that this does not mean he's not going to have a long road ahead of him. We say that because we honestly don't know what this means, we're braced for the worse case and are just happy that so far it's gone well (it meaning his ability to urinate). He said he tested and he is able to start and stop his stream by doing a Kegel. So now on to the pathology. We got a call with the results a few hours ago. Good news with the exception of the fact that we have a margin. I'm so happy that there was NOT any extracapsular extension but we do have a 2mm margin I think at the bladder? Is the bladder neck at the base? My question now is does anyone know if a 2mm margin is focal? And can I take any comfort in the fact that the Gleason at the margin is a Gleason 3? Here's a summary of the Pathology: Gleason score 7 (3+4) The Gleason grade 4 component is 5% of the entire tumor volume Prostate: 32.7 gm (without appendages)Tumor Volume Estimate: 35% No extraprostatic extension present and No lymphovascular invasion present Seminal vesicles and vasa deferentia, no tumor present High grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia (PIN) Thirteen lymph nodes, no tumor present (0/13) Perineural Invasion: Present The tumor involves proximal (basilar) margin for an added length of 2.0 mm tumor at the margin is Gleason 3 pT2cN0",

It was very much like a hospital bed and he could keep it at whatever angle he wanted. I think he took one pain pill and then just used Advil and Tylenol. They gave us an RX for stool softener at the hospital (to save us some $$) and the doctor told him to take it 3 times a day. If he didn't have a BM by the end of the next day he said to take Maalox and the secret is to chase the Maalox with a cup of either something very hot or very cold. We did that and it worked like magic. BM was not painful and he's been going just as he usually does ever since. He is still taking 3 stool softeners a day. Today was the big day, the catheter removal! Another smooth event. Appointment was a 8:30 am and we were there early (of course!) they took us in, I asked A LOT of questions and they took out the catheter. I think we were back heading down Lake Shore Drive within an hour. When we were there the pathology was not ready yet but Matt, our wonderful PA promised to keep checking throughout the morning because by now he knows how much I worry. So far my husband has been able to urinate on his own. When he thinks he needs to go he gets up and seems to make it to the bathroom in time. It starts with a few dribbles and then he pretty much goes like he use to. We both comment each and every time that this does not mean he's not going to have a long road ahead of him. We say that because we honestly don't know what this means, we're braced for the worse case and are just happy that so far it's gone well (it meaning his ability to urinate). He said he tested and he is able to start and stop his stream by doing a Kegel. So now on to the pathology. We got a call with the results a few hours ago. Good news with the exception of the fact that we have a margin. I'm so happy that there was NOT any extracapsular extension but we do have a 2mm margin I think at the bladder? Is the bladder neck at the base? My question now is does anyone know if a 2mm margin is focal? And can I take any comfort in the fact that the Gleason at the margin is a Gleason 3? Here's a summary of the Pathology: Gleason score 7 (3+4) The Gleason grade 4 component is 5% of the entire tumor volume Prostate: 32.7 gm (without appendages)Tumor Volume Estimate: 35% No extraprostatic extension present and No lymphovascular invasion present Seminal vesicles and vasa deferentia, no tumor present High grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia (PIN) Thirteen lymph nodes, no tumor present (0/13) Perineural Invasion: Present The tumor involves proximal (basilar) margin for an added length of 2.0 mm tumor at the margin is Gleason 3 pT2cN0",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by Pratoman Great report. While it would be better to hve negative margins, it is very good news tht the positive margin was a grade 3. Low likelihood of it developing into something. Good sign that he's able to stop and start urine stream. I was able to as well, and by week 5 , I was going without pads. Expect recovervto full continence to not be linear. It will be 2 good days, one pad day. I weighed my pads and kept a journal of how much I leaked each day. That lowed me to see the progress week to week. Good luck with the recovery Thank your for your reply! I don't think I'd be able to sleep tonight without receiving opinions for our experienced users here so I really appreciate it. That's a great idea to weigh the pads! I will purchase a scale this weekend.",

Try to think about the good times you had with your dad and what a blessing it was to have him while you did. Hopefully you'll keep the memories of the happy times, when he was strong and full of energy in your mind and also remember the strength he must have shown to fight this battle. Keep that memory, the memory of your Warrior dad in your heart and honor him by becoming strong again, whenever that time might be.

That's what a parent would want for their child. I never really had parents that were involved in my life. Try to think about the good times you had with your dad and what a blessing it was to have him while you did. Hopefully you'll keep the memories of the happy times, when he was strong and full of energy in your mind and also remember the strength he must have shown to fight this battle. Keep that memory, the memory of your Warrior dad in your heart and honor him by becoming strong again, whenever that time might be. Don't rush, give yourself time to grieve but please don't punish yourself. God bless you and your father.",

      "Content": "Me2, My husband's tumor was located within the TZ. His first biopsy came back completely negative because a typical 12 core doesn't reach into the TZ where his pretty sizable tumor was located. Thank goodness we didn't just take that negative biopsy and walk away. We were able to get an MRI which came back a PIRADS 5 and our URO/Surgeon has a partner that does all of the biopsies so he's very good at them. He was able to biopsy the TZ and the entire process took about 20 minutes from the time he left the waiting room to the time he was done (the biopsy, not the MRI). My husband said that this biopsy felt different from the first standard 12 core since the needles where reaching the TZ. He said he felt them more in his penis and that's because the tumor was seen at the urethra so that's where the doctor was able to stick the needles. He still said it wasn't that awful, did he enjoy it...NO, of course not, but still he said he's been through worse. For the benefit of others reading this that may be starting this process, I'd like to quickly add that at the UofC they made it as easy as they could for us by scheduling the MRI in the AM and getting the results to their urology department by early afternoon for the biopsy. We were able to get this done in one day. When I saw the biopsy results, I was panicked over the fact that the tumor had already gotten to his urethra. I didn't know what would happen because I really hadn't started to research that part yet. I was still focused on how to find out if he had PCa or not. In my mind I was thinking oh my gosh, are they going to have to give him some sort of new urethra, can they even do that?? I was going crazy and my mind was really working against me. When I talked to the PA about the biopsy results he told me that the part of the urethra that the PCa was in was a section of the urethra that they remove during surgery anyway. It went from the top of my worry list to the bottom. I do agree with the others that say you should try not to put the cart ahead of the horse (Yep, I know how hard that is to do,when people here said that to me it went in one ear and out the other, but if you can, PLEASE do try to take it one step at a time and wait to see exactly what you're dealing with). The reason I wrote everything above is not to bring your mind to a place that you don't need to be at yet. I wrote it because as we all know, lots of people read this forum so if it's something that may be helpful to someone that's at a point that my husband and I were at almost a year ago (MRI and TZ biopsy happened 3 days before Christmas), I want to share.",
