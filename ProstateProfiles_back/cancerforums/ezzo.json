      "Content": "Originally Posted by HighlanderCFH Howdy, Prostate cancer and an enlarged prostate (BPH -- which is NOT cancerous) can co-exist, but are not related to each other. Most likely you are experiencing the urination problems from the enlarged prostate -- the BPH. Your PSA, as others have noted, will probably come in higher than normal. But this, in itself, IS normal because PSA is created by prostate tissue. And the more prostate tissue there is (the enlarged prostate), the more PSA there is. When you take the PSA test, be sure to not do anything that stresses/excites the prostate for 72 hours before the blood draw. This means no sex, no bike riding, no DRE by the doctor. This is because anything that stresses the prostate can trigger a temporary spike in the PSA reading. When a prostate is hit with BPH, the growing actually takes place in the CENTER of the prostate. I forget if this is called the transition zone, or something else. But this center area of the prostate is where the urethra goes through the prostate. Hence, a prostate growing at its center (BPH) tends to put the squeeze on the urethra, which is what causes the slow stream, interrupted stream, etc. Once all the dust settles, the doctor might put you on Flomax to help relieve your urination problem. Let us know what the PSA comes in at and we can offer more comments at that time. If BPH turns out to be your final diagnosis, you might want to begin annual PSA testing now just to track how it is growing. It would go up relatively slowly as the prostate continues to enlarge. If you ever find a sudden rise in the PSA reading, from one year to the next, a red flag for prostate cancer is raised because of the sudden, non-linear increase in the PSA reading. Most likely it's just a combination of a prostate infection and BPH, so you probably do not have anything to worry about. Take care, Chuck This is an amazing forum which i will proudly recommend When i left hospital 2 days ago ( i am still on antibiotics and tamasolin) i was not given any final diagnosis. I has lots of blood tests, a DRE and ultrasound scans but no doctor really explained their finding and were 'quick to get to the next patient. This left me without answers and very anxiuos. I suffer from anxiety and so this whole episode has really shook me up because I dont know whats going on. Thats why these forums are a blessing Ive only been out of hospital for 2 days and am on antibiotics and tamosolin If i had not have got an infection then i would not have known that i had an enlarged prostrate. In general my urine flow is fine i guess, yes i do have to pee a lot including during the night but i can live with that. Could you shed any light on why I havent been given a final diagnosis? If i knew for sure that it was BPH then i would be happy to manage my lifestyle around it but all this talk of PSA cancer tests has really upset me and made the whole thing seem very serious, makes me cry with worry. If its just an enlarged prostrate due to ageing (im 43) then why test for cancer? Any input is welcomed Terry",

      "Content": "43 years old. I caught a water infection and had to go to hospital as i could not pass urine. i had a catheter fitted about was fine almost straight away. I stayed in hospital for 5 days until the catheter was removed. i took antibiotics and am now home feeling better. Whilst i was in hospital the doctor performed a digital rectal examination and found i have an enlarged prostate. He gave the reading as a '41' although im unsure what this means. Blood tests were also taken. Im worried that it might be cancer as im only 43. Is my enlarged prostate a sign of cancer or is it just an enlarged prostate due to aging? Are the 3 connected in any way? I have a PSA in 2 weeks but i understand that an enlarged prostate can give a high reading and so i dont see the advantage of the test Is it most likley that i simply have an enlarged prostate and am worrying un-needingly. Thank you everyone",
