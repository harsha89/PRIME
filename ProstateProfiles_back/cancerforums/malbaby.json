      "Content": "Hi wish full. The following is my own personal opinion. Your particular situation obviously depends on what stage your cancer is at. There are a lot more people on this forum with greater knowledge than me. Once I had decided on having treatment....the choice is between surgery and bracchytheraphy, I chose bracchy because it is less invasive and the risks of complications are less. Post bracchy I have experienced urgency, frequency, dysuria and poor stream. I currently take Flomax which helps with alleviating the problems. I often think, did I make the right decision in having treatment, but then I think that I could be much worse off if I ended up with cancer spreading to other areas of my body. The question to ask yourself and your doctor is....what are the consequences in not having any treatment versus lifestyle post treatment.",
