      "Content": "When I was 30 I think I started to notice a weird sensation in my prostate area when I laughed hard or moved my legs in weird ways, that is about the closest experience I can share with you. When I was 33 I complained of pain in similar region, they deemed it prostatitis and I did a high dosage of Advil for 3 weeks, like 3 pills 3 times per day. It seemed to work, but we never did more tests. From what you describe I wouldn't wait, see a doctor, an annual physical with complete blood work can be done and they can include a PSA test, your doctor can also give you a DRE. You are young, are you healthy, drink water, exercise? Any family history? Either way, you've got this and I'm here to help. here is my thread http://www.cancerforums.net/threads/...ge-41?p=177292",

      "Content": "January 7th I got the results from the biopsy 3 out of 12 cores with 5% or less with a GS of 6 and a PSA of 1.9 | Nearly 3 years ago I started to have a pelvic cramp (proctalgia fugax (PF)) occur every 2 months at night and the pain is moderate to severe and lasts for 30 minutes, so this past fall I did tests (colonoscopy, pelvic MRI) which resulted in seeing nodules on the prostate so I did the test above which is why I found out about the cancer. All the doctors feel the PF is not due to the PC and the PF will go away in a couple more years. So the question becomes... how to treat the PC given that if it wasn't for the PF I wouldn't know I had PC. Welcome to my world! All doctors (urologists, radiation oncologists, medical oncologists) do not support any form of radiation as my age is such that eventually I'll be in a worse position after radiation and then things will just go downhill. So that is off the table. Does everyone agree? All urologists suggests that because of my age, being very healthy, sexual function is great, the prostate is small (24.9mg), the pelvic MRI showed there is plenty of space to operate, that the best decision is surgery. (highly curable) One medical oncologists suggests to do deferment management (DM)such that in 5 years I would just move toward surgery so that the scenario described above still exists. Another thinks that the statistical construct of the situation is such that I should move on with my life, forget this even happened, and not worry about a thing until something doesn't feel right or I get another test in 5 years. So I explore the concept of DM and also AS and think about a program of doing a PSA every 3 months and biopsy every 6 months. Most feel this is too frequent, but there is no rule on frequency. I am convinced the biopsy is a great test but also very random in nature. In my case, the MRI clearly shows 2 small areas that are in seperate regions so the biopsy is not so random. I have a hard time living each day knowing I have cancer. I have friends who have died because they waited for treatment, I know people who have other cancers and they are in chemotherapy and hoping to live. But my closest family wants me to hold on to the chance of having a family (I am 41 and single and no kids) the normal way. I am not rushing into anything, running a half marathon in May, another biopsy in June (it will be 6 months) and then a full marathon in July. If the biopsy comes back with higher scores, I'm thinking surgery in August. Ok, so that is my deal. What makes sense of what I described, what doesn't? I appreciate all input. Thank you.",

      "Content": "January 7th I got the results from the biopsy 3 out of 12 cores with 5% or less with a GS of 6 and a PSA of 1.9 | Nearly 3 years ago I started to have a pelvic cramp (proctalgia fugax (PF)) occur every 2 months at night and the pain is moderate to severe and lasts for 30 minutes, so this past fall I did tests (colonoscopy, pelvic MRI) which resulted in seeing nodules on the prostate so I did the test above which is why I found out about the cancer. All the doctors feel the PF is not due to the PC and the PF will go away in a couple more years. So the question becomes... how to treat the PC given that if it wasn't for the PF I wouldn't know I had PC. Welcome to my world! All doctors (urologists, radiation oncologists, medical oncologists) do not support any form of radiation as my age is such that eventually I'll be in a worse position after radiation and then things will just go downhill. So that is off the table. Does everyone agree? All urologists suggests that because of my age, being very healthy, sexual function is great, the prostate is small (24.9mg), the pelvic MRI showed there is plenty of space to operate, that the best decision is surgery. (highly curable) One medical oncologists suggests to do deferment management (DM)such that in 5 years I would just move toward surgery so that the scenario described above still exists. Another thinks that the statistical construct of the situation is such that I should move on with my life, forget this even happened, and not worry about a thing until something doesn't feel right or I get another test in 5 years. So I explore the concept of DM and also AS and think about a program of doing a PSA every 3 months and biopsy every 6 months. Most feel this is too frequent, but there is no rule on frequency. I am convinced the biopsy is a great test but also very random in nature. In my case, the MRI clearly shows 2 small areas that are in seperate regions so the biopsy is not so random. I have a hard time living each day knowing I have cancer. I have friends who have died because they waited for treatment, I know people who have other cancers and they are in chemotherapy and hoping to live. But my closest family wants me to hold on to the chance of having a family (I am 41 and single and no kids) the normal way. I am not rushing into anything, running a half marathon in May, another biopsy in June (it will be 6 months) and then a full marathon in July. If the biopsy comes back with higher scores, I'm thinking surgery in August. Ok, so that is my deal. What makes sense of what I described, what doesn't? I appreciate all input. Thank you.",

I would suggest to consider \"your time\" is the time it takes to become educated and make the right decision, after the biopsy. It might take 1 hour or 6 months, but make sure you understand the decision you are making before signing up for treatment.",

      "Content": "I am 42 (just turned in May) and just went thru this experience and you can read about it at this thread http://www.cancerforums.net/threads/...ncer-at-age-41 I know all too well about the age range and how clueless our friends are about men's health, trust me, I'll help you in any way I can. Dial-in your health care plan and find out if you have a network that limits your options (for me I had a New England Plan so I couldn't go outside unless I waited until 2014 to switch plans). Try to get a consultation at a hospital from a team of doctors (urologist, oncologist, radiation oncologist) and get \"their\" collective input. I can not imagine anyone will suggest radiation, for 38 you are way too young to take an approach that could lead its own issues. Surgery will likely be the option you choose, but you need to advocate for your own health, don't rely on anyone to make that decision. You are lucky to have kids already, but I didn't and I went with surgery, went to the sperm-bank and 18 days later the impotence is a non-issue, my doctor saved both nerves and I'm almost ready for the major leagues! Start reading, think good thoughts, do not panic.",

I can share with you anything and everything I've learned. I have not heard of those doctors but they probably work at south county or within the same group as Renzulli.

I also liked the group at MGH in Boston. | What I learned thru all of it (besides what feels like everything) is that I can't live with cancer in my body, I have to get it out.
