    "Content": "Hi everyone, I'm new to these forums and I'm hoping someone can give me some piece of mind. My husband was diagnosed with prostate and bone cancer 2 years ago, and his initial PSA was somewhere in the high 20's, but he has been on Lupron as the treatment (he could not complete the chemo, but he did have radiation) and his PSA has always been .01. Now he is due for his next shot in 2 1/2 weeks, and his oncologist called and said his PSA is now .2. Is it starting to climb because the Lupron is almost due? Thank you for any help!",
