      "Content": "Originally Posted by njs Hi gsteve, What are those \"known reasons\" in your mind? The only clear advantage vs open is less blood loss and open has some advantages over robotic so it should come down to picking the surgeon who can offer you the best record of results and then leting him use whatever tools he uses. (I don't mean to sound like a broken record but I get the impression you missed what I said in the other thread and want to make sure you understand) I do agree with the others on the recovery process - with either open or robotic approach you'll probably feel great after 2 weeks, but you need to watch the lifting and other exertion or you risk a hernia. As far as the incision for open surgery, my doctor did everything through a only a single 3 inch incision that starts about 3 inches below my belly button and goes down from there. Because the muscle fibers run vertically they are not cut but just separated, which is by contrast to the circular trocars used for robotic (especially the one that needs to be enlarged to remove the intact specimen for pathology) that can cause more muscle trauma. So far just about every dr I've spoken with and most things I've found online say the da vinci gives you a better percentage at ed and incontinence issues. This only what i have found and I'm sure there is more stats I'm not seeing. My first dr i saw was a surgeon and maybe he was over stating to be sure i wasn't disappointed in the end but his percentages scared the crap outta me.",

I posted a bit of my latest info on another members thread but didnt want to hijack it any more than i did. I dont have all the lab results handy but will get them but here is what i remember. psa was 8.5 at time of surgery age 53 was a fair bit of cancer volume , over 50% i think biopsy said 3+3 lab post surgery said it was 3+4 lab said there was a positive margin at the bladder neck , surgeon felt it was minor and possibly even scar tissue. my recovery was \"gold star\" according to my surgeon, 90% dry in 6 weeks , id say 99% in 6 months. ED not a concern by about 6 month , overall i was and am very happy with how things turned out. So i chose to get psa tests every 3 months for the last 4 years they were always .01 , last one was .02. had it rechecked 2 weeks later .02 still. I met with my GP today , i have to say i think i know more than he does about most prostate cancer issues but what ever. He says the normal range for someone in my shoes is 00 -3.95. Ok thats all well and fine but here is my question for the experts here.... If i no longer have a prostate and a increase of psa means the cancer has reappeared why is any increase considered normal? Let alone a increase of 40x? Dont get me wrong , if thats normal im happy but if its really a positive sign of the cancer starting up im not going to wait around for it to really take off , ill seek radiation asap. Of course radiation is not without its downsides so i dont want to jump into that without good cause either. Thanks in advance for the help and thanks for maintaining this site the way you do.

      "Content": "A year and a few weeks actually. I thought Id give a quick write up as to how things have gone. - robotic surgery was recommended over seeds due to the size of the growths - it was done sept 20 and the lab report said there was 1.5mm protruding into the bladder - surgeon said well there is a 50/50 it could return but don't fret - I was 90% continent at the 4-5 week mark the only time I get a mini squirt is when I force a fart - ED was an issue for about 6 mons and then I started to get a bit of action - I take 5mg a cpl times a week and 50-100 of Viagra when I'm hoping for a bit of fun - with the Viagra things probably work better than before the surgery. With no V it's 50/50 if I'll get any reaction down under. - the V gives me a good headache so my pre fun routine is 100. Mg of V and tylonal -my psa tests have all been undetectable so far. - I get random pangs in the abdomen but nothing to worry about -I'm going to the mayo in nov for a complete check over Over all the surgery was no real big deal. At the time it sure was. It's seems like a bad dream now really. I credit 80% of the education I got and badly needed to this forum. You guys are great !!!!! Thank you!!!! Sj",

I try not to do that and hope my results encourage others. In my city ive helped as many guys as possible. We have no divinci here and the surgeons dont tell anyone about it. Im the one preaching to them to go out of province and get the robot. So far about half have listened , those who have are very happy. Thanks again for this place , i learned more here than anywhere. sj",

My surgeon from calgary told me there is many reasons for a positive margin and not all of them are cancer. A year after having the operation I went to the mayo for a executive physical and they told me as I said above. I called my surgeon and told him what the mayo said and he disagreed. I saw my local radiologist and told him what the mayo said. He also disagreed that I should have radiation without any rise in psa. He did say that if it were up to him I would have had radiation about six weeks after my surgery to make sure that positive margin was cleared off. He said that now that I had gone at that time 18 months my gamble had paid off and I didn't need it. The dr at the mayo said I should get it ASAP that the sooner they go after it the better.",
