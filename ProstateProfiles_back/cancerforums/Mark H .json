Last, Brach plus EBRT sounded most intriguing, taking only 3 weeks. In any event I decided Da Vinci worked best for me. It will leave me the option of radiation at a later date (if needed) and probably avoid the need for Lupron which might add to my already significant fatigue problems.

      "Content": "I can now understand why this process is one of learning by experience, unfortunately the lessons learned usually apply to the next person. In retrospect, had I carefully thought through the implications of the advice and literature provided, perhaps I might have chosen a better treatment choice. Anyway, let's start with the living in the present, and the great news today. First, I am recovering without complications and tomorrow will have my catheter removed. Recovery has not been fun, with much discomfort and initial movement impairment, but 8 days after surgery I finally feel like my old self in energy and mobility (except for the annoying urine bag and periodic catheter discomfort). And because I didn't need more than 4 or 5 oxycodone pills, I have some left for a future emergency. Second, my surgeon sent me my pathology report. She was very happy and says it was the best possible outcome. My Gleason 8 score DROPPED to G7, the margins were clear, there was no cancer found outside the small tumor which was wholly located within the prostate. The only expected (but disappointing) news is that the nerve, on one side, could not be spared. Here is a synopsis: C. PROSTATE, RADICAL RESECTION - PROSTATE AND SEMINAL VESICLES - PERMANENT: PROSTATE GLAND: Radical Prostatectomy [version 6/2017] -AJCC 8th Edition Staging TUMOR Histologic Type: Acinar adenocarcinoma Primary Gleason Pattern: Pattern 4 Secondary Gleason Pattern: Pattern 3 Total Gleason Score: 7 Grade Group 3: Gleason Score 4+3=7 Percentage of Pattern 4 (%): 90 Tumor size (dominant nodule, if present) Greatest Dimension in Millimeters (mm): 15 Extraprostatic Extension (EPE): Not identified Urinary Bladder Neck Invasion: Not identified Seminal Vesicle Invasion: Not identified Lymphovascular Invasion: Not Identified Perineural Invasion: Present MARGINS: Uninvolved by invasive carcinoma Benign prostate glands present at surgical margin LYMPH NODES Regional Lymph Nodes: Number of Lymph Nodes Involved: None identified. Number of Lymph Nodes Examined, Specify number: 24 PATHOLOGIC STAGE CLASSIFICATION (PTNM, AJCC 8TH EDITION) Primary Tumor (pT): pT2: Organ confined Regional Lymph Nodes (pN): pN0: No positive regional nodes ADDITIONAL FINDINGS Additional Pathologic Findings: High-grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia (PIN) Nodular prostatic hyperplasia Best TUMOR Block(s) If Further Studies Are Needed : C4 Three, while all of this is good news and may mean a cure upon more reflection I am wondering how I might have benefited if the biop G8 score had been G7. I had been desiring a Cyber-Knife treatment (although my Uro does not like them) and based my choice based on the fact that I had a G8 score. Then I remembered a thread on whether or not biop's are reliable Gleason score measurements? In fact, was all of this necessary and how could have known which treatment were both optimal and minimally disruptive to my life after treatment.? As it is incohentence will be an issue for many months (I assume) and erections are history. I am happy...yet...somewhere in this there seems to be some kind of regret to. Strange, no?",

      "Content": "I can now understand why this process is one of learning by experience, unfortunately the lessons learned usually apply to the next person. In retrospect, had I carefully thought through the implications of the advice and literature provided, perhaps I might have chosen a better treatment choice. Anyway, let's start with the living in the present, and the great news today. First, I am recovering without complications and tomorrow will have my catheter removed. Recovery has not been fun, with much discomfort and initial movement impairment, but 8 days after surgery I finally feel like my old self in energy and mobility (except for the annoying urine bag and periodic catheter discomfort). And because I didn't need more than 4 or 5 oxycodone pills, I have some left for a future emergency. Second, my surgeon sent me my pathology report. She was very happy and says it was the best possible outcome. My Gleason 8 score DROPPED to G7, the margins were clear, there was no cancer found outside the small tumor which was wholly located within the prostate. The only expected (but disappointing) news is that the nerve, on one side, could not be spared. Here is a synopsis: C. PROSTATE, RADICAL RESECTION - PROSTATE AND SEMINAL VESICLES - PERMANENT: PROSTATE GLAND: Radical Prostatectomy [version 6/2017] -AJCC 8th Edition Staging TUMOR Histologic Type: Acinar adenocarcinoma Primary Gleason Pattern: Pattern 4 Secondary Gleason Pattern: Pattern 3 Total Gleason Score: 7 Grade Group 3: Gleason Score 4+3=7 Percentage of Pattern 4 (%): 90 Tumor size (dominant nodule, if present) Greatest Dimension in Millimeters (mm): 15 Extraprostatic Extension (EPE): Not identified Urinary Bladder Neck Invasion: Not identified Seminal Vesicle Invasion: Not identified Lymphovascular Invasion: Not Identified Perineural Invasion: Present MARGINS: Uninvolved by invasive carcinoma Benign prostate glands present at surgical margin LYMPH NODES Regional Lymph Nodes: Number of Lymph Nodes Involved: None identified. Number of Lymph Nodes Examined, Specify number: 24 PATHOLOGIC STAGE CLASSIFICATION (PTNM, AJCC 8TH EDITION) Primary Tumor (pT): pT2: Organ confined Regional Lymph Nodes (pN): pN0: No positive regional nodes ADDITIONAL FINDINGS Additional Pathologic Findings: High-grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia (PIN) Nodular prostatic hyperplasia Best TUMOR Block(s) If Further Studies Are Needed : C4 Three, while all of this is good news and may mean a cure upon more reflection I am wondering how I might have benefited if the biop G8 score had been G7. I had been desiring a Cyber-Knife treatment (although my Uro does not like them) and based my choice based on the fact that I had a G8 score. Then I remembered a thread on whether or not biop's are reliable Gleason score measurements? In fact, was all of this necessary and how could have known which treatment were both optimal and minimally disruptive to my life after treatment.? As it is incohentence will be an issue for many months (I assume) and erections are history. I am happy...yet...somewhere in this there seems to be some kind of regret to. Strange, no?",

      "Content": "Hi, I am new here. Yesterday I received a lab test back that stunned me. For many years I have had been treated for adult onset diabetes and high blood pressure (along with meds for cholesterol and lipids). I was so focused on those problems and the related tests that for several years (or more) I went without a PSA test; so I really don't know what my original baseline was after 2011 or so (when it was normal). Today, at nearly 67 my PSA came back at 9.5 and will be seeing my GP in a few days for followup. I don't even know if it is possible to have a 9.5 without cancer, but I am a nervous wreck. It would seem that one should not delay action and while I think a PC3 test and imaging might be useful, would it not be safest to have an ASAP removal of my prostate and lymph nodes? I really don't care if I have ED, but I fear I have waited to long. Will the doctor insist on a full battery of tests before such a procedure? Also, Id appreciate any feed back on MRI vs. color Doppler and whether or not both would compliment each other?",

For many years I have had been treated for adult onset diabetes and high blood pressure (along with meds for cholesterol and lipids). I was so focused on those problems and the related tests that for several years (or more) I went without a PSA test; so I really don't know what my original baseline was after 2011 or so (when it was normal).

It would seem that one should not delay action and while I think a PC3 test and imaging might be useful, would it not be safest to have an ASAP removal of my prostate and lymph nodes? I really don't care if I have ED, but I fear I have waited to long. Will the doctor insist on a full battery of tests before such a procedure?

      "Content": "Originally Posted by HighlanderCFH Hi Mark, I moved your post (and the replies) to its own thread so you can get more attention. As the others noted, a PSA of 9.5 does not necessarily signify prostate cancer. And, even if you do have PC, this PSA number does NOT necessarily mean that it is beyond control. Just be sure to visit with a highly experienced urologist and also be prepared for a recommendation to have a biopsy. It is HIGHLY likely that you are either okay now -- or WILL be just fine after any treatment that might be required. Stick with us & we'll help you every step of the way. Chuck Thanks to everyone for their advice and kind thoughts (and moving my concern to a separate thread). My health problems for many years has focused on cardio and diabetes, a problem that runs in my family. However, no one has had a prostate problem that I know of - although my father passed from cancer of the esophagus (he was a mostly life long heavy drinker and smoker). Naturally I am berating myself for not having monitored my testing better, and in delaying an over-health checkup for several years. So I will relax a little and see what the followups show. However, I do want to move the testing along promptly and should their be even a modest chance, I will encourage my doctors to consider removal sooner rather than later. Finally, I'm a bit confused on the blood test markers. In addition to PSA I understand their is a PC3?",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by HighlanderCFH Just to be sure I said it correctly, it is possible to use radiation as a salvage treatment if recurrence takes place after surgery. But the reverse is not true -- it is SELDOM possible to use surgery for salvage treatment if radiation fails. The reason is that the external beam radiation treatments tend to build up scar tissue around the prostate bed -- which makes it extremely difficult for a surgeon to access the prostate through all that scar tissue. I also recall one of our members mentioning that his doctor told him that trying to do surgery on an irradiated prostate is like trying to work with a rotted peach. In any case, there are only a few surgeons who will attempt salvage surgery because of the complexity involved. But also remember that I am not a doctor (and don't even play on on TV), so these are questions to ask both a surgeon and a radiation oncologist. Now I understand. Thx",

Since then I have consulted my with GP and Urologist, had a 14 core BIOP (13 cores negative, one with 100 percent cancer), and today completed my bone scan. Both CT and Bone Scan are negative, and cancer, though a high risk type, seems highly localized. I am so relieved after getting negative CT and Bone Scan results, and wish to thank everyone for their encouraging words. Now I have to consult with doctor on Monday and choose a treatment plan. Looks like it will be surgery or external radiation (followed by 2 years of androgen deprivation therapy). I have no idea how I might choose, but choose I must. Of course, any advice on why you have (or might) choose one over the other is welcome.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by HighlanderCFH Just to be sure I said it correctly, it is possible to use radiation as a salvage treatment if recurrence takes place after surgery. But the reverse is not true -- it is SELDOM possible to use surgery for salvage treatment if radiation fails. The reason is that the external beam radiation treatments tend to build up scar tissue around the prostate bed -- which makes it extremely difficult for a surgeon to access the prostate through all that scar tissue. I also recall one of our members mentioning that his doctor told him that trying to do surgery on an irradiated prostate is like trying to work with a rotted peach. In any case, there are only a few surgeons who will attempt salvage surgery because of the complexity involved. But also remember that I am not a doctor (and don't even play on on TV), so these are questions to ask both a surgeon and a radiation oncologist. Now I understand. Thx",

      "Content": "One month ago today I was floored when my PSA came back 9.4. Since then I have consulted my with GP and Urologist, had a 14 core BIOP (13 cores negative, one with 100 percent cancer), and today completed my bone scan. Both CT and Bone Scan are negative, and cancer, though a high risk type, seems highly localized. I am so relieved after getting negative CT and Bone Scan results, and wish to thank everyone for their encouraging words. Now I have to consult with doctor on Monday and choose a treatment plan. Looks like it will be surgery or external radiation (followed by 2 years of androgen deprivation therapy). I have no idea how I might choose, but choose I must. Of course, any advice on why you have (or might) choose one over the other is welcome.",

I've seen studies that would indicate that for high-grade cancer accompanied by negative path findings at the time of RP, radiation had slightly better long-term results. However, the trick may be predicting whether or not the PCa is prostate-contained. I opted for surgery for two reasons (1) I felt given my 6-month checkup schedule and the recent negative imaging (CTs, bone scan & X-rays), my G10 was caught early and contained; (2) With colon cancer in the family (both sides), and for other reasons, I wanted to avoid both the short- and long-term adverse effects of RT as well as the chance of a second primary tumor of the bowel or bladder. In other words, I wanted to bet on the chance to get all the cancer out at the time of surgery (knowing ART or SRT could be in my future). So far it looks good (I have my 1 year check-up tomorrow), but you don't know what the future will bring. (My PCa was downgraded to a G9, the path report was very good, and the Decipher results were that my PCa is/was low risk for mets.) At the moment my only discussion over options with my uro was a quick email exchange of a couple of sentences - so I will have a clearer understanding tomorrow when we confer. But yes, in that dialog he did present it as surgery vs. radiation and ATD for two years. For me this won't be an easy choice because even if there are only slight differences in 10 yr survival rates, I am trying to envision the short and long term difficulties with pain, side effects, etc. Moreover, while I feel fit enough for surgery I am trying to envision the challenges to everyday living during recovery (eg. grocery shopping, paying bills, etc.). Radiation does not sound as difficult, but the thought of having to commute everyday for two months and spend a half day in an office is not my cup of tea. I guess I need to research what a year after surgery would be like, and the long term effects of radiation (future incontence?). ED is not an over-riding concern as my diabetes has already eliminated much of my sex drive and functionality.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by Roadranger82 I will be having RALP in 3 weeks, starting to roundup everything I need to have on hand. Which Depends products should I get for after cath removal? the flex fit or real fit? I will probably get some guards too, for when I progress to those. do I need some kind of donut to sit on? I see some of them are shaped, any recommendations on those? I already have some sweat pants that snap up the side for post op, thought those would work well with the cath. what else? I like all of the advice here. In my experience: 1) The trip home with a leg bag was uncomfortable, I didn't have a pad or donut. 2) I should have had a recliner setup, but opted to use the bed. However, other than the first night the bed was okay. 3) The bucket by the bed is a great idea - on the other hand I did fashion a long cord to loop around my shoulder in order to carry the bag just above the floor. Only problem was the cord slipping off my shoulder. 4) I didn't shower or move my leg attachment for nine days - I was always concerned about the cath moving \"in\" or \"out\" too far (an unnecessary worry in retrospect). 5) I stocked up on frozen and refrigerated foods. Forget cooking - use the microwave. Do ALL grocery shopping before the surgery and make sure to cleanout your fridge of old stuff that might spoil during recovery. 6) Make sure the antibiotic Vaseline like cream is handy - your penis will thank you. 7) Make sure you have refills for any other meds you take - running out of those meds in the middle of recovery is a vexation you don't need. Make sure you take your stool softener. I felt constipated all the time and at one point opted for a laxative - ask the doc what kind of laxative is okay. 9) The cath is always uncomfortable so finding the right position to sleep will require experimentation. 10) I used flex-fit depends and they worked okay for me. The day after cath removal I gushed like a firehouse. Make sure you have your depends (at least two) with you. Finally, I bought a couple of pair of quick dry hiking pants (nylon) that wick away moisture. I made sure they were baggy, and very light-weight. What a blessing - I am now wearing this kind of pant as a regular. Very comfortable. Best of luck.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by Roadranger82 I will be having RALP in 3 weeks, starting to roundup everything I need to have on hand. Which Depends products should I get for after cath removal? the flex fit or real fit? I will probably get some guards too, for when I progress to those. do I need some kind of donut to sit on? I see some of them are shaped, any recommendations on those? I already have some sweat pants that snap up the side for post op, thought those would work well with the cath. what else? I like all of the advice here. In my experience: 1) The trip home with a leg bag was uncomfortable, I didn't have a pad or donut. 2) I should have had a recliner setup, but opted to use the bed. However, other than the first night the bed was okay. 3) The bucket by the bed is a great idea - on the other hand I did fashion a long cord to loop around my shoulder in order to carry the bag just above the floor. Only problem was the cord slipping off my shoulder. 4) I didn't shower or move my leg attachment for nine days - I was always concerned about the cath moving \"in\" or \"out\" too far (an unnecessary worry in retrospect). 5) I stocked up on frozen and refrigerated foods. Forget cooking - use the microwave. Do ALL grocery shopping before the surgery and make sure to cleanout your fridge of old stuff that might spoil during recovery. 6) Make sure the antibiotic Vaseline like cream is handy - your penis will thank you. 7) Make sure you have refills for any other meds you take - running out of those meds in the middle of recovery is a vexation you don't need. Make sure you take your stool softener. I felt constipated all the time and at one point opted for a laxative - ask the doc what kind of laxative is okay. 9) The cath is always uncomfortable so finding the right position to sleep will require experimentation. 10) I used flex-fit depends and they worked okay for me. The day after cath removal I gushed like a firehouse. Make sure you have your depends (at least two) with you. Finally, I bought a couple of pair of quick dry hiking pants (nylon) that wick away moisture. I made sure they were baggy, and very light-weight. What a blessing - I am now wearing this kind of pant as a regular. Very comfortable. Best of luck.",

Now that I've had my catheter removed for a few days, I was hoping some of you could answer some questions I have. \u2026 Nothing your experiencing sounds unusual. I found/find my urine flow a bit unfocused and messy when standing. I also find extra contractions will empty the bladder. And I did urinate four or five times a night, although that has reduced to three or so. And until recently I also had an unbearable and sudden urgency but four weeks after cath removal that has lessened some (though not entirely). Things don't feel \"normal\", and there are odd feelings in my urinary track. Not pain, just a kind of \"hollowness\". Aside from incontinence, my biggest frustration is with simple urination which is often difficult to direct and tends to spray. Not sure if that is normal.",

The DRE characterized my prostate as \"small\" and the MRI and TRUS calculated it to be 18cc. The surgeon looked at the report for a couple minutes and said: \"well, looks like you might need radiation therapy but let's wait 6-weeks for a PSA test.\" Memorial Sloan Kettering nomogram gives me a 31% chance of BCR within 5-years, 48% chance of BCR within 10-years with NO radiation but a 98% cancer specific survival rate at 15-years with NO radiation. My whole attitude has changed dramatically since the RALP. The worry about side effects and the future no longer concern me. It is like \"I've been through the worst now, so a little radiation is no big deal and a 98% survival rate at age 86 is a big deal.\" A question on my mind, before seeing my uro, is whether or not surgery is necessary if I am going to need radiation anyway (which they probably wouldn't know till AFTER a surgery)? And I realize that anyone can beat themselves up for having not been more pro-active (I know I do) but it is what it is. Still 98 percent over 15 years is great odds, and who knows what new treatments and drugs will be added to the tool-kit over that time. Keep us posted on your recovery - it is likely I'll be in surgery by Oct 1 and doing the same followup.",

No perineural invasion or extraporstatic tumor Lesion #2 -- 15mm of 17mm, 88% involved, Gleason 7. Perineural invasion is not present. No definite extraprostatic tumor is seen, however there is a tumor adjacent to skeletal muscle and extremely close to adipose tissue. Right Anterior -- 2mm of 13mm, 15% involved, Gleason 6. Perineural invasion not present. No extraprostatic tumors. --- Obviously, I'm concerned most about the Lesion #2 and possible involvement outside of the prostate. What are the chances the tumor is cancerous? And am I looking at a minimum of surgery or radiation for Gleason 7? I got these results over MyChart and won't talk to my Uro until Thursday. I wasn't worried before these results, but now I'm pretty scared and can use some help interpreting these results. Need help until Thursday. Most others here know more than I, but it's not worth being scared. Your PSA was rather low (mine was 10.4) and Gleason 7 is at intermediate risk (mine was Gleason 8, high risk). And unlike me, your DRE was smooth. None the less someone here ran my numbers through a calculator and I had a 99 percent chance of survival in 5 years, and a 96 percent survival rate at 10 years. Your preliminary estimates have to have been better than mine. Most likely you will have a bone and body scan done, to confirm what is already almost certain (there is no spread) and then be given a choice on either surgery or radiation. I don't see a \"wait and see\" option to be realistic at this point, but with a PSA as low as yours I am uncertain. If not, you might be eligible for \"cyber-knife\" which is a highly focused and localized radiation treatment for intermediate and low risk cancer - the treatment is only 3 to 5 \"zaps\" and its over. Five year survival rates are identical to more extensive treatments. Honestly, the biggest hassle I have encountered is making choices and dealing with treatment side effects, not the cancer. So hang in there, the needless fear is the worst of it...not the cancer. PS - I ran your PSA, G7, and 3 of 18 cores as \"cancer\" through the calculator. You've got a 99 percent 15 year survival rate and chances are good for no follow-up treatment. You might want to plug-in your own numbers: https://www.mskcc.org/nomograms/prostate/pre_op",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by HighlanderCFH Hi Mark, Were you referring to the color of the urine in the catheter bag? If so, do not be worried about it being dark. Actually, it is SUPPOSED to be a dark color in the days right after the surgery. There is bleeding involved as the sutures heal around the newly reconnected urethra. The color will gradually become lighter as the week goes on. If it is sufficiently lighter, after the week has passed, they will know it has healed enought to remove the catheter (which is totally painless). Hang in there in the meantime. It's good to hear that she says everything went fine. This means she expects no surprises in the pathology report. You'll probably get all those details when you see her. Good luck!]Chuck Thanks. Ya I guess I thought the urine bag was looking lighter for awhile - it only been two days since the surgery (on Tuesday morning, I write this Thursday evening). I guess I will have to wait for more information. But I am glad its over (at least for now).",

Since then I have recovered ok, and thought my urine had cleared up from the blood. However, today it looked dark pinkish yellow again - when should I expect to see clear urine? Days? Weeks? Also, I am returning to her office in a week for catheter removal and, if the pathology report is done, discuss the results. If the path report is not done when I see her, what should I asked her after the surgery? I kinda felt like she was in a hurry during her hospital visit and I didn't take the opportunity to ask what \"just fine\" meant.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by yolli71 Hi All, Hope everyone had a great Thanksgiving! So I posted my experience the other day regarding my first week post-RALP. Now that I've had my catheter removed for a few days, I was hoping some of you could answer some questions I have. \u2026 Nothing your experiencing sounds unusual. I found/find my urine flow a bit unfocused and messy when standing. I also find extra contractions will empty the bladder. And I did urinate four or five times a night, although that has reduced to three or so. And until recently I also had an unbearable and sudden urgency but four weeks after cath removal that has lessened some (though not entirely). Things don't feel \"normal\", and there are odd feelings in my urinary track. Not pain, just a kind of \"hollowness\". Aside from incontinence, my biggest frustration is with simple urination which is often difficult to direct and tends to spray. Not sure if that is normal.",

This morning I noted that it is lighter than yesterday. So in spite of my prior reading of others experiences, I have been pained by bloating and seeming (probably illusionary) strong feelings of constipation. I was feeling great by the time I was released (comparatively speaking) so I was not prepared to feel worse when I came home. Oxycodone has been my pain killer of last resort and it has surprised me that I have needed it several times to deal with the belly and constipated discomfort. This morning I feel much better but I have not had a bowel movement in nearly two days (other than tiny releases of gas). I am wondering if a suppository laxative would be safe?",

My GP to Uro referral (Kaiser Permanente) was the next day because I told my doctor I'd take any uro who had an opening. At my Uro appointment he told be to sign up for a biop, which I discovered was backlogged for more than a month. I told them I'd take any uro doing a biopsy, and any cancellation. They had me come in the next day (a cancellation). A few weeks later (after the path report came back) I went for the usual scans (nothing found). I must have finished in record time, only to discover they like to wait 2 months after a biop before surgery. My GP tells me not to worry, even G8 gives me many months to decide my treatment plan. It took me several weeks to decide, and by then the uro who did robotic surgery was booked up for nearly two months. Once again, I got on a cancellation list and within ten days an opening was available at the last minute - I took it. I must have broke some kind of record within the system, from biop to surgery was two months and five days. Surgery went well, with best possible outcome. Margins, seminal invasion, lymphs, extensions, all good. They caught it early enough to be self-contained and wholly within the prostate, and in just one spot. The lesson is to get it done as soon as practical. It may not make a difference physically, but until you do it the mental stress of not knowing will take a toll. Additionally, I found that any lack of diligence on my part could have created serious delays (I let my surgeons calendar fill up while I was trying to decide which treatment to have). Anyway, it looks like you already have this rolling, so my advice is not really needed. But once you do it, you will be so glad its over with. That alone is worth prompt treatment.

      "Content": "Originally Posted by Michael F Hi Mark H.! Be happy with this result. It means your PSA is considered to be \"0!\" Congrats & Welcome to \"Club Zero! Simple arithmetic indicates the worst case scenario is: at least > 99% of the PSA generating cells have been removed. I don't see any valuable clinical information that can be derived from a 6 week post RP PSA using a standard PSA methodology. (except if the result is > 0.1) The \"benchmark\" post RP PSA typically is the 3 month value. Most URO Surgeons look for \"< 0.01ng/ml\" at 3 months. Of course, this requires an ultrasensitive PSA Methodology. Discuss with your URO Surgeon if you should test via uPSA at 3 months. Based on a 1/2 Life of approx 2.5 days, ALL 6 week post op uPSA levels should be < 0.01 at 6 weeks IFF 100% of PSA generating cells were removed. IMO, uPSA should be limited to those with elevated risk of recurrence who plan to commence Salvage Radiation (SR) as early as possible. uPSA can generate unnecessary \"Dreaded PSA Anxiety\" from clinically insignificant fluctuations in results. For now stay focused on achieving 100% recovery! Keep active, stay healthy & keep us updated along the way. MF Thanks, and I looked at your own experience as a guide. After 77 months post op you remain effectively zero. You are right, no reason to \"sweat it\" if and until there is something contrary to expectations.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by SubDenis Last night I had a long chat with a friend, whose dad has bad blood cancer. The topic of fear came up and we spent quite a bit of time discussing how fear can cloud reality. Some years ago, a friend shared with me about another disease I have a useful tool. Ask yourself two questions when you are fearful. What do I know and what do I think? Fear is often triggered by what we think not what we know. For many, it launches us into projecting the future and often it is dark future. However, we can focus on what we know which is more a cognitive process based on reality, which can lead to a more rational assessment of our current condition and the next steps we need to take, which can help us lead a more peaceful life today. Being in today is the goal, in my opinion. My experience with PC for the last almost 18 months were periods of shock, confusion, fear, understanding, decision making, treatment, and many more days of peace since treatment. I continue to find talking with other guys with PC very helpful. The gift of sharing your experience and letting newer guys know these phases are normal is a gift to self and to them! In the field of Alcoholism, there is a common belief that it is a three-fold disease of mind, body, and spirit and that a threefold recovery is needed. I suggest this is not too far off for us with PC. For most of us there are few body symptoms but once diagnosed many of us are challenged trying to understand, trying to make decisions, feeling alone at times, etc. I practice sharing, meditating, and trying to be there for other guys as part of my way of dealing with this disease and find it uplifting. I also continue to study this disease to be armed with facts. I have one friend with G9 who a great inspiration to me, as he goes through his road of treatments. I hope I give him some comfort in our sharing. I doubt that I will ever think getting PC was a good thing but clearly, there have been benefits of friends, of a self-awareness of how I need to show up to my family and friends, and a peacefulness most days because my clear goal is to live life today to the best of my ability. So today let\u2019s choose life and continue to support each other! I could not agree more. The day I was told (over the phone) by my uro that my biop came back G8 I was dazed...almost disbelieving - I was living in the future, as if I were to die shortly. Slowly I began to deal with it after folks on this board provided a light and instead of dyeing a thousand deaths, I decided to live in the present. As researched, and my uro became more encouraging, I felt much better - especially after treatment. I ran the calcs on survival rates and I realized that most likely I would be dyeing of some other cause - so its back to the mundane life of bills and future plans (I realized I couldn't spend all my savings in a year, given that I may have a long life). Today, after surgery I feel back to emotional normal. So live in the moment - not the regrets of the past or the imagined fears of the future.",

The results are in and my uro called to inform me the bad news, and (we shall hope) mitigating news. Of the fourteen cores examined, thirteen had zero cancer, no trace. However, the 14th core, taken from a small firmness found on the DRE showed it to be totally cancer. The Gleason index is 8, meaning its high risk. I'm devastated. The uro is guardedly hopeful and said \"if I had to bet on it\" because my PSA is only 10ish, and from the DRE and zero cancer in all the other cores, the tumor is highly localized and treatable. On the other hand, they are scheduling an MRI and CAT to make sure it has not spread elsewhere - if it has I feel I am on the clock. The uro did not want to offer any percentages on whether or not it has spread, but repeated that chances are it is a highly localized kind (so far) and that is has not spread elsewhere. I'm praying that my uro's informed guess is correct, but it will be several more weeks till I am tested and all the results in. I feel like I am waiting a death sentence. Right now I am staying a friends house to avoid being alone - the waiting is (as you all know) torturous. Mark H.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by ASAdvocate Mark, You do not have a death sentence. Either surgery or radiation can cure a Gleason(4+4) patient. Some recent studies are showing dramatic improvements in survival rates when both regular radiation and a brachytherapy boost are used. But, that is getting into treatment choices, and you need to have a couple more tests before you start consulting with the doctors who can treat you. A caution: there are three types of surgery and five types of radiation available to treat you. You may need to speak with practitioners of several to get comfortable with your future direction. It's confusing, but its better to have choices than not. Thanks so much...I am laying with the usual thoughts. It will take time to absorb and deal with it - again so many thanks.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by RobLee Do not despair. I was G8 also, but with six positive cores - two of them 100%, and my PSA was 25, five months before surgery. Currently there is no evidence of disease, though I cannot be sure until after the HT has worn off in a couple of years. It has been a struggle, but it can be beaten. The scans will not eliminate the possibility of spread, as they are not that sensitive. But they will pick up if your case is seriously advanced. But I believe you are probably safe. Good luck with your path results. Thank you so much for your words of encouragement - all are welcome but to hear from someone who had more 100 percent positive cores and a PSA of 25 is very encouraging. I think the shock of a Gleason 8 was what knocked me for a loop. I am crossing my fingers that the scans will be negative and that I can immediately pursue whatever course is best (frankly I'd like Da Vinci but the \"experts\" will likely give the best advice).

It does not bother me if it happens, EXCEPT the idea of Lupron is unwelcome. It's bad enough that erections are now very unlikely but to add in something that causes more fatigue (I am already a very low energy person) seems like a double whammy. So try to see the silver linings. If either of us half to do some radiation, so be it. Let's look forward to finishing it off and should, some five to ten years hence another kind of treatment is needed then (if anything) the options will have increased.

      "Content": "Frankly, at my G8 score and the surgeon's inability to spare the nerve on one side, I kinda expected some follow-up salvage radiation therapy for me (its not uncommon). It does not bother me if it happens, EXCEPT the idea of Lupron is unwelcome. It's bad enough that erections are now very unlikely but to add in something that causes more fatigue (I am already a very low energy person) seems like a double whammy. So try to see the silver linings. If either of us half to do some radiation, so be it. Let's look forward to finishing it off and should, some five to ten years hence another kind of treatment is needed then (if anything) the options will have increased. In the meantime I'm going enjoy my coffee, good cooking, and the view from an RV I purchased.",
