      "Content": "Hi guys thanks for your replies. I'll try to give what information I can but my brother being the way he is (quite bad cognitively due to dyslexia) and a private person, there's a lot we don't know. He was 39 when he had symptoms of not being able to hold himself for long and seemed to be weeing frequent. It took 2 years to diagnose due to his age and fact that no-one believed it would be prostrate cancer. When they did diagnose him he had stage 7 cancer ie, mostly 3's but some 4's in the petridishes. And so he had radical prostratectomy but then nothing but 4 monthly blood test monitoring since. I've no idea what his PSA levels have been since the operation as he simply says when we ask, yes everything's ok! The level is now rising but even more alarming was the hospital calling my parents trying to find him 2 days after they had written to him saying he was to have radiotherapy, to say he needed to go in today for a bone scan. He has a manual job but has complained since the time of the diagnosis of pain in his back/spine. I can but pray this is as a result of his job. Other than the above there's nothing I can say because I don't know anything else. Thanks for any support you can give. Fingers crossed for all you guys x",

      "Content": "I'm a sister of someone who had prostrate cancer and had Da Vinci surgery 2 1/2 years ago with no radiotherapy or hormone tablets afterwards. However, my brother has been monitored and last week he received what we never wanted to receive ever again; his PSA levels are on the rise. And so tomorrow a further bone scan and the week after the start of 7 weeks daily radiotherapy commences. As a family member I'm devastated. I love my brother and it destroys me to think of him going through this again. He is a single parent of a 10 year old who has no mum and so he is both parents to her. It's heart breaking. When I asked if he'd been told what his PSA level was he told me 0.8. That isn't bad is it? I think mum and I are worrying because of the 'C' word but am I wrong in thinking 0.8 isn't that high?",
