      "Content": "Agree with all above comments. In my research of the medical literature I found two other items. First, the uPSA can also react to antigens in the blood from exposure to household animals. These can be corrected for. A second frequent comment I found was that the uPSA was good for \"early warning\", but several writers recommended that decision making on treatment be based upon standard PSA testing. The recommendation for always using the same lab is also important.",

Genetic analysis of tumor -- pending Post surgical PSA -- awaiting results Follow-up with surgeon in 10 days In presurgery consult, surgeon stated he would recommend radiation after surgery for \"clean up\" of any loose cancer cells. At one week followup, he stated that this would be too risky because of my MS, fearful of permanent damage to bowel and bladder control, also walking. Consult with PCP who sent me to medical oncologist who recommended radiation. Saw radiation oncologist who was extremely hesitant for the same reasons, risk of permanent damage and lack of guidance from medical literature. He recommended consult with a major cancer center that may have actually treated MS patients. Still working on that. I have reviewed PubMed, there is a scattering of descriptive reports on radiation therapy on cancer patients with MS, almost all with negative outcomes about half the time -- particularly when brain is involved. Since this would be at the other end, I was looking for anyone who had been in a similar situation. Thank you for your interest and response. By the way, how do I get the \"stats\" on my cancer to appear each time, is there a \"signature\" function?",

      "Content": "I am new to forum, relatively new to prostate cancer. Recovering from DaVinci radical prostatectomy 9/14/17. Surgeon initially recommended radiation for \"clean-up\", now against it. Consulted with radiation oncologist who is also very hesitant. Their fear is increased risk of side effects due to my multiple sclerosis. There is minimal medical literature on radiation therapy for cancer on individuals with multiple sclerosis. Has anyone had any experience with this? Thanks.",

One of the delays was my lifelong desire to see a total solar eclipse. My urologist wanted to go even slower and not rush things, my PCP and I wanted to go faster. Even though my \"numbers\" reflected a more aggressive situation than your husband, it turns out that waiting a few months would not have made much difference for me. The financial burden of treatment is real, docs tend to order many routine screening tests because insurance will pay for it but they are not essential for treatment of the disease. Good luck.",
