    "Content": "Hello At the Johns Hopkins University's School of Medicine in Baltimore, USA, a study of Bipolar Androgen Therapy in patients with metastatic prostate cancer has been completed. The study showed surprisingly good results, cf. the reference below. In the study, patients were subjected to severe fluctuations in the testosterone level by injecting the patients with 400 mg testosterone every 28 days, while stopping the natural production of testosterone (LHRH agonist). Dr. Samuel Denmeade, who completed the experiment, has no biological explanation of the effect. Since I can find only few considerations about the role of estradiol in both the development of prostate cancer and as a factor in the effect of the BAT study, I would like address this issue in the debate. I became aware of estradiol reading that black men are more at risk developing prostata cancer. Apparently, estradiol level is higher in black men than in white men. See https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17456570 Knowing that estradiol stimulates cell division there might be a link. Similarly, there is a correlation between the age-related increase in estradiol among men and the number of prostate cancer cases. For testosterone, the correlation is reverse - the lower the testosterone the more prostate cancer cases. Looking forward to hearing your comments.
