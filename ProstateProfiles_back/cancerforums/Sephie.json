      "Content": "Senior, the one question I have for you is why have you asked your wife to not smoke around you? Is it because you had cancer and are concerned with the health risks associated with second-hand smoke? Is it because you're finding the smoke annoying or offensive? You have the right to pose your concerns to her, and she has the right to smoke in her own home. The core issue though is the give-and-take that's an important part of a marriage. Sit down and have an honest discussion with her and tell her what your concerns or reasons are for your request. There is no perfect solution to this type of situation but there is always a fair compromise.",

      "Content": "I just saw your post. My husband and I were just discussing switching to an ultra-sensitive PSA. Husband's surgery was March 2008 and his PSA results have been 0.0 since then. In August, his PSA reading was 0.1. Doctor wants to retest in 1 month (rather than 3 months). Doctor is not concerned but, obviously, we're going to keep a very close watch. Husband spoke with the doctor about using an ultrasensitive test going forward to monitor changes. Doctor said his experience is that they really don't tell \"us\" anything. The minute changes that this test reveals, in his opinion, has no valid diagnostic value and often causes undue anxiety. Deciding on adjuvant therapy (e.g., radiation) based on the minute fluctuations in an ultrasensitive test is not advisable - in our doctor's opinion. Husband also discussed ProctaScint to determine if there is a local recurrence. Again, the doctor said he has used it but very infrequently as there are still high percentages of false positive and false negative results.",
