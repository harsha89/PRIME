      "Content": "Hello, I'm new here and testing my signature. Any suggestions would be of help. I'm pondering of continuing my plant based diet for another 3 months and do another PSA test before doing any biopsies. What do you guys think? Should I just do a biopsy ASAP? I am a bit scared since I'm somewhat young so this cancer could be highly aggressive and I will be fighting this forever. Even though it's not yet \"100% official\", I'm convinced that I have PC. My diet was pretty poor before.",

      "Content": "Thanks all. My first PSA test was included with my general yearly check up. I guess my doctor decided to include it since I was 40. The first two PSA test was from the same lab but the second test was strictly PSA test only. Third PSA was a different lab from my Urologist clinic. My Urologist is recommending a biopsy. I guess there is really no point of waiting, plant based or not. No family history but I urinate very often. And no sign of infection. I'm so glad I found this site.",
