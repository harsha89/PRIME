      "Content": "Hi Everyone, First post, haven't got full details of my levels and such as yet. Diagnosed recently gleason 6, 56 years old. Looks like Active Surveillance is what I will be looking at for at least the next few months. Question: I get a cramping type sensation in my lower gut. I have been using Weber Naturals \"Super Prostate\" which seems to help with many of the symptoms (When I take about 6 per day) Does anyone use anything else to alleviate symptoms and pain? Thanks, have a great weekend Scott",
