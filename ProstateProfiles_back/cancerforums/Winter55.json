      "Content": "A strong marriage can survive your situation. Communicate with your husband. So long as he is willing to satisfy you in all other ways, hang in there. Stepping out rarly works out. It introduces insecurity, fear, jealousy and anger. Remember, he can't have sex either. Most likely feels less like a man. He needs you more then ever. Ask yourself, is a HOT session of intercourse really worth the price of your marriage? Your relationship with your husband? Cheating is cheating regardless of why you cheat. Someone always gets hurt. Try and put yourself in his shoes. You get a disability or suffer some form of cancer yourself. How would you feel if he said, hey, tired of waiting for you to walk again OR I need a woman who has bigger, real or fake, breasts.... Trust me, it is not a good side to be on. Anyone who tells you it is OK to step out is someone is selfish. Life is all about sacrifice. I can not think of a sacrifice I would not do for someone I love. Meaning, what would anyone not do for their kids...same kind of love right....what would anyone not do for their spouse..... Hang in there. Work with your husband on any and all other ways to satisfy you. Intercourse is not the only way for sexual pleasure and gratification. PS. Sounds like your husband is a wonderful forgiving man. Most men, when confronted with your honesty, would have had reacted much differently. Hopefully he continues to be a survivor",

Erection was somewhat painful/sore.... but good enough.... Was told first time would be mild pain due to scar tissue etc.... curious if anyone else has had experience and does it get better as more injections are used... Appreciate any feedback.....",

      "Content": "Hi, Appreciate your response. My issue (and it was my first injection) was with the erection. Seemed very tight..and somewhat sore. I am using Prostaglandin E1. dose is .5 Erection lasted about 1.15minutes... So my question really is, does the tightness go away? Doctor said it was due to a lack of erection for 4 years so scar tissue etc... Thoughts?",
