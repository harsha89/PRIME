      "Content": "Originally Posted by Jim215 Brett: Please don't apologize for providing \"too much detail\". On the contrary, it's the detail that helps guide others on this site who may still be in the decision stage as to how to move ahead in the treatment of prostate cancer. All information is valued and appreciated. I'm sorry you have had such a difficult family and personal history that included thyroid cancer. Under the category \"Misery loves company\", next month it looks like I'll be needing a biopsy of the thyroid too, to determine whether some suspicious growths are cancerous. I have come to view cancer overall as equivalent to the carnival game called \"Whack a Mole\". No sooner do you knock it down with a large mallet, the damn stuff pops up somewhere else. For the time being, at least, I am able to sign all of my e-mails with the post-script \"I'm still here\". Wishing you the best of luck, Jim Not to add fuel to your fire, but when they thought I had goiters on my thyroid they still wanted to do the biopsy. So they numbed my neck and tried to get the needle in the growth. The thing was so hard the doctor couldn't the needle into the growth. He tried and tried and it was just too hard. It was a bit painful as you might imagine; the numbing doesn't go very deep, and the man is leaning over you with this huge needle in your neck so you can't move at all. I pray to God yours isn't like that, it wasn't much fun. But then the idea was that if the biopsy was negative they wouldn't need to do surgery. Because even though they thought I had only a 5% chance of it being malignant we still needed to know for sure. Then when he got in there he found two massive tumors so it had to come out. The weird thing is that, like my prostate cancer, I had absolutely no symptoms before the diagnosis. It was actually just a weird set of circumstances that led to the discovery of the growths, definitely a God thing. If it weren't for that, I probably wouldn't be here right now since mine had been there long enough to spread out of the thyroid, which I'm told is extremely rare.",

      "Content": "I was diagnosed with prostate cancer back in February. Fortunately it was a very early detection; only 10% on one of the twelve cores of the biopsy. I was blessed to be able to receive cyberknife treatment in April and when I was tested in August, my PSA was down to 2.8 which is almost normal for me. Well, I was tested again a couple weeks ago and now my PSA is up to 4.6 which is higher than it's ever been. My oncologist is hopeful that it is only an infection and I have just completed a round of strong antibiotics and will be retested in a couple weeks. My question is... will sexual activity affect the PSA? I did ask the doctor if my wife could be intimate during this whole process and she said that was no problem. But I am wondering if that may be what's causing the high PSA reading. Because quite honestly, things have never felt quite... normal, during sex or otherwise, since the cyberknife treatment.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by Jim215 Hi Brett: Welcome aboard. As Allen mentioned, the rise in PSA may be attributable to a passing infection. We don't get very many Cyberknife prostate cancer patients on this site. Would you be willing to share with us the circumstances and research that led you to choose Cyberknife over the other options available? Many thanks. Jim Well, I get checked annually every year for any prostate issues. Eight years ago I had my thyroid removed because of cancer, my father died from complications of bladder cancer, one brother died from some kind of kidney cancer, another from prostate cancer, and I even had an aunt many years ago that died from ovarian cancer. So there's a lot of it in my family and now I've had it twice. Two years ago my PSA was high, took the antibiotics and then everything was fine until early this year. PSA was up, tried antibiotics and PSA was higher. Had the biopsy and they found 10% of one core positive. My urologist told me these options; prostate removal, the normal radiation treatment that involves about 40 treatments, the beads in the prostate (80-120 of them), and cyberknife. I had never heard of cyberknife, they told me it involved putting two gold beads in the prostate and then five radiation treatments every other day. The problem was, the treatment was of course, very expensive, and BCBS of Alabama would not pay for cyberknife. I opted to at least try and see if I could get approved for cyberknife since it seemed to be the least invasive of all the options. I applied for it and of course they denied it. But I saw that the reason they denied it was because they (BCBS of Alabama) said they don't cover \"investigative procedures\". So I wrote them a letter back, explaining that cyberknife is not an investigative procedure, it's the treatment and hopefully the cure. After that I reapplied and by the grace of God I was approved; first one in the state of Alabama. I had the treatment in April of this year at Brookwood Cancer Center in Birmingham. It wasn't bad; they always tell you that you won't feel any affect from it but by the third or fourth treatment I was starting to feel it a bit. My wife said I looked awful. I started having to take Flomax to be able to urinate somewhat normally. The thing about all of this is that I never had one symptom before I was diagnosed. Everything worked pretty normal as far as urinating although I have been dealing with some partial(?) erectile dysfunction for a while now but that's another story. Anyway, I was checked three months later and my PSA was down to 2.8 which is almost normal for me; I'm usually about 2.2. That being said, since the cyberknife I have never felt \"normal\". Even with the Flomax I still have some slight urinary issues, especially at night. And my ED issue is more obvious now than it ever has been. Not to be too graphic but before any of this, even with some ED issues I would frequently wake up having to urinate and having a VERY firm erection because of it. Since the cyberknife this has not happened one time. Also, on the rare occasion I can perform sexually, I usually experience some mild discomfort, even pain, immediately after orgasm. This is usually accompanied by a strong need to urinate. Also, my \"output\" does not seem normal. Again, not to be too graphic, but it seems very thin, almost watery and also it looks a bit yellowish. And sometimes I get no output at all which is definitely not normal for me. I do apologize if this is too much detail... I have discussed this in some detail with my URO and she still seems to think it's related to an infection but I have to admit I am more than a little concerned. So that's where I am at today. They say that cyberknife has about an 85-90% success rate but numbers like that don't mean much to me. Eight years ago I was told that the nodules on my thyroid had only about a 5% chance of being malignant. 95% they were only goiters. Well, I landed right smack in the middle of that 5%; they found two massive tumors on the thyroid and it even spread out of the thyroid and I had to have three lymph nodes removed as well. So much for numbers... I have about two weeks till I get checked again. I will refrain from any sexual activity till then (not that it happens very often anyway). And maybe by Gods grace everything will be back to normal. I saw what my oldest brother went through at the end of his life and I would not wish that on anyone.",
