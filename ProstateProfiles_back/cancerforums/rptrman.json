      "Content": "IHT (intermittent hormone therapy) is now recognized as a legitimate practice and may even prolong Lupron effectiveness as the likelihood of Androgen deprivation causing the cancer cells to find another way to feed is interrupted. I suggest finding your \"baseline\" Lupron effectiveness by stopping dosage and monitoring monthly or bi-monthly to determine how long you can go. The notion that once the PAS starts to rise it can be difficult to regain control is nonsense...as long as you get right back on Lupron as soon as the PSA rate of increase doubles in any given period. I went to 3.0 after 2 years off, then 6.0 2 months later. Got back on and next month's number was back below zero. The point is EXPERIMENT and TEST often to determine your course of action!",

      "Content": ":::: Diagnosed 6 years ago. Started at PSA 27. Radiation 54 treatments, Lupron started following radiation completion. PSA stayed below zero for 3 years. Horrific hot flashes and night sweats, plus low energy and weight gain. Finally stopped Lupron to see what would happen. After 2 years of below zero PSA started to rise. First 3, then 2 months later 6. Based on the PSA doubling so quickly Lupron was started again. PSA back to below zero...so it sure works; however side effects are worse than ever. Pretty much intolerable. After 6 months I intend to stop Lupron to determine how long I can go. My issue is that doctors seem to make no effort to establish an effectiveness baseline for Lupron. I seem to be so sensitive with such serious side effects that I believe a 1 month shot, for me, actually does the job for a lot longer, so why not determine that period and dose accordingly? Would this not strike a happy medium between effectiveness and side effects? To keep shooting me every month, or worse yet, a 4 month shot, seems ridiculous without determining the actual dosage by experimentation/",
