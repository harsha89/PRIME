      "Content": "Hello All: I recently had my first Gout attack on my right toe. Went to see the doctor and was sent to have a blood test and a PSA test at the same time as I am 62. Surprised was not the word to use when I saw the PSA was 51. Had it checked 2 years ago and it was 1.0. Doctor ordered another test a week later, and it went to 64 !!!!! Now we are all concerned and trying to book an appointment with a urologist next week. Has anyone of you seen a jump in the PSA so fast as in a week ? Other than that I do not have any symptoms. Any info would be much appreciated.",
