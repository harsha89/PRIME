      "Content": "Originally Posted by HighlanderCFH Welcome aboard, Lucky. The others are giving you good, solid advice. As for Gleason 6, it is strongly thought to be next to impossible for it to ever metastasize. This is because Gleason 6 (AKA 3+3) is considered incapable of surviving outside of the prostate. But, as also noted in another post, the biopsy only samples a tiny portion of the prostate and there could always be other tumors there. Can you tell us your PSA history? If your PSA is relatively low, the one tumor that was detected could be all there is. Chuck I hope I'm replying in the correct reply window. If not, my apologies. These replies are very, very helpful. Thank you. Highlander, I\u0092m encouraged by your assurance that Gleason 3+3 lesions virtually never metastasize. If you have any reference material on that, please pass along the links. If I can read several sources to confirm this, it will really put my mind at ease. (I\u0092m a research junkie.) I\u0092m a relatively healthy 70. My PSA history is as follows: I have BPH. 15/18 years ago, my annual PSA started a steady climb with the occasional spike; in 2010 I spiked to 11, but the biopsy (my first) came back negative. I have cruised at mid-7s, slowly dropping, since 2010 and my (former) urologist was content because PSA velocity is all that matters to him. This February, I spiked to 14.5. He refused to give me the PHI test or even a free and total PSA, so I fired him. Since then I dropped to 10.6, 10.2 and 9.6, with 13% free. (BPH has made my prostate large, about 72 cc.) My T3 MRI in September (at Hoag Hospital in Newport Beach CA) showed two PIRAD 4 lesions, plus a possible PIRAD 3 in the transition zone. For fusion biopsy, Hoag uses the Uro Nav which is good, but perhaps less accurate then the Artemis. When I opted for UCLA (because they use the Artemis fusion biopsy machine), they repeated the 3T MRI and found only one target lesion. (Why did the other lesions disappear? I assumed that the UCLA radiologists, with more experience reading the difficult MRI images, were probably correct.) All 11 cores were negative, except the targeted lesion. The lesion is 2 mm with 10% involvement. I feel okay with the UCLA pathologist. He\u0092s young, but a 3+3 diagnosis is relatively easy to make (per my niece, who is a Johns Hopkins trained pathologist) and the UCLA department head signed off on it. The tricky part is the finding that there is no evidence of ECE. I would love confirmation on that. Reading the T3 MRI images takes so much expertise and talent. Thank you, guys.",
