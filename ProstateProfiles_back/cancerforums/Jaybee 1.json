      "Content": "Hi everyone. I have been scouring forums, blogs, info sites, scholarly articles and everything else I can get my hands on, for the past 3 months since my darling hubby of 30 years was diagnosed with PC. He is 57yo. We thought his PSA was 21.6, but have just discovered that a month before his biopsy, it had risen to 23.6, which means that in the two months following, (one to biopsy then another one after that until his surgery), by my reckoning, his PSA would have been well into the 30s by the day of his surgery. They took blood that morning, and I've asked his surgeon about it, who stated rather ominously that I should \"wait until our next consultation to hear about that\", which is next week (5 August). That will be 5 weeks post-surgery. Not knowing anything at all about PC, we rushed into having the op done, without understanding anything about alternative options, and were told afterwards that he had a \"very large tumour\", which was graded as Gleason 7 (4+3) - Grade Group 3. He was a pt2c, with no positive margins, seminal invasion or EPE. His tumour was in the Transition Zone (TZ). his prostate weighed 49g - I can't remember how much the tumour weighed/occupied, but all I can remember is his surgeon saying it was \"very large\". Hubby (GG) made it through the op pretty well, all things considered. He is continent, but with complete ED it would seem (although only time will tell there). I am freaking out about those PSAs though. He looks very anaemic almost 4 weeks post surgery, and I can't seem to get any colour back into his face, despite my best efforts at feeding him nourishing food etc. He seems too ashen to be well. Is this normal? He says he hasn't been feeling too good over the last couple of days, so I am terrified his PCa is metastatic, which would appear to be borne out by that disastrous pre-op PSA level. With no positive margins, this is another (from what I can gather) ominous sign that any residual PSA will not be found in the prostate bed, but rather, has migrated to bad places. Feeling like we may have done him a disservice by having the op, instead of opting for RT etc, but of course it's too late for that now. I haven't slept since all this happened (3 months now), and am worried absolutely sick about him. I guess I'm just desperately trawling for good news stories, about which there seem to be none. Does anyone have a greater than 30 PSA story they could share? Some highly regarded folk on another forum where I posted (who I note also post here as well), have suggested that with his PSA at 21.6 things may have been OK, but now we know it was much higher, I'm not sure they'd say the same thing. Anyone...? Best regards to you all, Jaybee.",

      "Content": "Thank you Chuck and Jim. You are very kind to respond so quickly. I have been watching your warm, generous and incredibly informed responses to everyone for quite some time, and am full of admiration for all the support you give everyone. Yes, GG had a CT scan, an MRI (which guided his biopsy) and a full bone scan before the op. I guess that's why his surgeon thought he might have some luck with excising the cancer. All came back clear, although his surgeon said there was some \"wear and tear\"(?!) on his bone scans. They did indeed remove his lymph nodes - I think it was 8 in total. All were clear. The report also indicated there was no perineural invasion. But some folk insist that's not technically possible? I, of course, have no idea... In my reasoning for his PSA rising to over 30, it was going up alarmingly - almost 2ng/ml per week, but we never saw that until we received a copy of his blood results. He started PSA testing at age 52, when it was 7.9, and it escalated to 21.6 by April this year (4 1/2 years later), then 2 weeks after that it was almost 24, so I'm just guessing it continued to escalate wildly for the next two months until his surgery. An incorrect assumption perhaps. But from the time of his biopsy to the time of his surgery, he became whiter and whiter, until he looked like Casper the ghost. He looks the same again now, so I'm (perhaps wrongly) assuming his body is desperately fighting off those evil proteins, and losing the battle. Yes, I can tend to lean towards glass half empty. But this has hit me like a tonne of bricks. It's so hard for me to remain positive, as I have read on a reputable Prostate cancer site here in Australia, (St Vincents Hospital in Sydney), that: \"Surgery and radiotherapy have a very low cure rate if the PSA level is greater than 20 ng/mL.\" Oh how I WISH I had never read that. But I can't 'unread' it. It's here FYI in case anyone is interested. http://www.prostate.com.au/understanding-diagnosis/ And the fact his surgeon has already mentioned (when he removed GG's catheter) that he may need a PSMA PET scan, would appear to indicate he believes there may be some residual PSA for some reason. That's why I'm so worried about the pre-op level. Just confused and desperate is all... Makes me feel there is no hope for the darling man I love so much. To make matters worse, his GP only referred him in April when his PSA hit 21.6, after ignoring his results for all those years. Never said a word. So not only am I feeling shocked, but mad as he!! I have seriously thought about going and throwing rocks through the guy's window!! (but don't worry - I'm not about to - I just enjoy the thought from time to time)... Really appreciate your encouragement. I will try to start breathing again.",
