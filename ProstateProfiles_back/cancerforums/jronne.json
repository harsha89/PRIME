      "Content": "Have members had a positive above threshold USPSA test result and had subsequent test results stay flat and stable indefinitely ? Even better declining subsequent test results that are below the test sensitivity ? Or do these USPSA test results rise with time eventually hitting biochemical recurrence, BCR requiring salvage radiation therapy (SRT) ? Looking for hard data from studies and / or personal experiences. I am 58 years old and want to live a long life if possible. Specifically my ultra sensitive PSA test came back positive twice at 0.01 on two consecutive days with a testing threshold of < 0.06 meaning I was twice the testing sensitivity. This is my 1st positive test result above USPSA test sensitivity at 22 months post RP. I tested at < 0.006 on 6/4/2017. Some advocate doing SRT when USPSA levels hit 0.05 or even as low as 0.03. 7 Ultrasensitive PSA tests - 18 months clean post op RP, at 22 months detectable but small 1/14/15 5/4/16 8/29/16 12/1/16 3/3/17 6/5/17 9/15/17 9/16/17 <0.015 <0.015 <0.015 <0.015 <0.015 <0.006 0.010 0.009 many thanks in advance, jeff",
