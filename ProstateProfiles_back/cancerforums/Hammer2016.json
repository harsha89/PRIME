      "Content": "Hello, I am 53 years old and in good health. I have been very proactive with my prostate health, getting annual exams for several years due to family history. My father was diagnosed with stage 3 PC in the mid 1990's. He passed away 3 years later with prostate, kidney, bone and lung cancers. My older brother was diagnosed with stage 2 PC in 12/2011. He was 63 years old at the time. He had a robotic prostatectomy and has had a very good experience since. As you will see in my signature, I was diagnosed with an enlarged prostate several years ago. My urologist stated my prostate was enlarged, but it did not feel suspicious and my PSA results were at acceptable levels. The only problem I was having was a weak urine flow at times. I was prescribed tamulosin to help with easing my urine flow. It has worked as expected for several years. My PSA tests have climbed steadily over the past few years. In March of 2014 my PSA was 2.5. In March 2015 it was 2.9. In March 2016, it increased again to 4.1. My urologist suggested a prostate biopsy due to the accelerated increase in my last year. On May 3, 2016 I had my prostate biopsy (done under sedation). 12 core samples were taken. The biopsy results came in about a week later. Stage 1 Adenocarcinoma. The Gleason scores were as follows. 4 cores Gleason 6 (3+3) 1 core Gleason 7 (3+4) 4 cores were high grade PIN 3 cores were benign. So, I started doing research on the internet about PC. Wow, is there a ton of info out there. During my research, I stumbled across this Prostate Cancer Forum. What a blessing! I read several of your threads and compared \"my story\" to them. I felt as though I was learning a lot and the forum helped me formulate at plan. My urologist scheduled me for a full body bone scan and a pelvic CT. My doctor said both scans look good and there is no evidence the cancer has spread. I'm sorry if I'm not using the correct terminology. Based on my research, combined with speaking to my brother and another man I work with, I am leaning toward having a robotic prostatectomy. I have interviewed two surgeons and feel very good about the one I have chosen. I am scheduled to have a 3T MRI on 6/20/16 and then a robotic prostatectomy on 7/14/16. I am nervous about the surgery and possible side effects, but confident this will work out great for me. Again, I want to thank The Prostate Forum members and moderators for this site!!! Hold on...here we go!!!",

      "Content": "Hello all...its time for an update! On 6/20 I went in and did the 3T MRI with and without contrast. This procedure took about 30-40 minutes and I felt very comfortable inside the \"tube\". I just tried to keep my eyes closed and concentrated on slow breathing and remaining as still as I could. I guess I was too relaxed, because I actually started falling asleep, all while the machine was making all that racket! The technician told me I needed to try to stay awake, because my breathing started being deeper, which showed up on the test as movement. Ooops... On 6/24 I went back to see the doctor and go over my MRI results and found that I am very lucky. The test results indicated there is no evidence the cancer has left the prostate. There is no capsular indentation or extracapsular extension. The neurovascular bundles, seminal vesicals and rectal prostatic angle are all unremarkable. My doctor said he was very happy with these results and plans on being aggressive with nerve sparing. What a relief. Anyway, I feel very fortunate that I have many family members and friends praying for me and my family. I also wanted to say that everyone at MD Anderson Cancer Center that has been part of my treatment has been superb. What a great group of people! I just wanted to post my update for those who find themselves fighting PC. I know when I was first diagnosed, I was looking at anything I could just to learn about this disease. I found that reading the stories posted by \"us\" gave me so much relief. I hope others out there are as lucky as I was with the early detection. I am scheduled for my RALP on 7/14/16. My doctor said I will have one night in the hospital and then released for home the following day. Again, I want to thank everyone that has read and/or commented on my journey. Until later...

My urologist stated my prostate was enlarged, but it did not feel suspicious and my PSA results were at acceptable levels. The only problem I was having was a weak urine flow at times. I was prescribed tamulosin to help with easing my urine flow. It has worked as expected for several years. My PSA tests have climbed steadily over the past few years. In March of 2014 my PSA was 2.5. In March 2015 it was 2.9. In March 2016, it increased again to 4.1. My urologist suggested a prostate biopsy due to the accelerated increase in my last year. On May 3, 2016 I had my prostate biopsy (done under sedation). 12 core samples were taken. The biopsy results came in about a week later. Stage 1 Adenocarcinoma. The Gleason scores were as follows. 4 cores Gleason 6 (3+3) 1 core Gleason 7 (3+4) 4 cores were high grade PIN 3 cores were benign. So, I started doing research on the internet about PC. Wow, is there a ton of info out there. During my research, I stumbled across this Prostate Cancer Forum. What a blessing! I read several of your threads and compared \"my story\" to them. I felt as though I was learning a lot and the forum helped me formulate at plan. My urologist scheduled me for a full body bone scan and a pelvic CT. My doctor said both scans look good and there is no evidence the cancer has spread. I'm sorry if I'm not using the correct terminology. Based on my research, combined with speaking to my brother and another man I work with, I am leaning toward having a robotic prostatectomy. I have interviewed two surgeons and feel very good about the one I have chosen. I am scheduled to have a 3T MRI on 6/20/16 and then a robotic prostatectomy on 7/14/16. I am nervous about the surgery and possible side effects, but confident this will work out great for me. Again, I want to thank The Prostate Forum members and moderators for this site!!! Hold on...here we go!!!",

      "Content": "Hello all...its time for an update! On 6/20 I went in and did the 3T MRI with and without contrast. This procedure took about 30-40 minutes and I felt very comfortable inside the \"tube\". I just tried to keep my eyes closed and concentrated on slow breathing and remaining as still as I could. I guess I was too relaxed, because I actually started falling asleep, all while the machine was making all that racket! The technician told me I needed to try to stay awake, because my breathing started being deeper, which showed up on the test as movement. Ooops... On 6/24 I went back to see the doctor and go over my MRI results and found that I am very lucky. The test results indicated there is no evidence the cancer has left the prostate. There is no capsular indentation or extracapsular extension. The neurovascular bundles, seminal vesicals and rectal prostatic angle are all unremarkable. My doctor said he was very happy with these results and plans on being aggressive with nerve sparing. What a relief. Anyway, I feel very fortunate that I have many family members and friends praying for me and my family. I also wanted to say that everyone at MD Anderson Cancer Center that has been part of my treatment has been superb. What a great group of people! I just wanted to post my update for those who find themselves fighting PC. I know when I was first diagnosed, I was looking at anything I could just to learn about this disease. I found that reading the stories posted by \"us\" gave me so much relief. I hope others out there are as lucky as I was with the early detection. I am scheduled for my RALP on 7/14/16. My doctor said I will have one night in the hospital and then released for home the following day. Again, I want to thank everyone that has read and/or commented on my journey. Until later...
