      "Content": "I\u0092m a new member and I\u0092ve got PC. This is yet another club I never wanted to be a member of. But having said that, I\u0092m really glad it\u0092s here and I respect that the knowledge came at a high price. So, about me\u0085 I\u0092m 68 years old, live in south eastern Wisconsin, and in great health (except for the PC). DRE: normal PSA history: 2016 \u0096 1.50 ng/ml 2017 \u0096 2.24 ng/ml 2018 \u0096 3.69 ng/ml 3T mpMRI, December 2018 Found one PI-RADS 4 lesion, well contained in the prostate. Fusion TRUS biopsy, February 2019. 13 cores, one was 7% and rated a Gleason 6 (3+3). Upon my referral to a urologist, I started furiously reading all things related to prostate cancer and treatment (it\u0092s my new hobby). It didn\u0092t take me long to realize I was standing at the roulette table in Vegas betting on my life. Every decision I make will have benefits and consequences best described by actuarial tables of the many guys who have gone before me. From reading forums like this, I fired my first urologist for refusing to give me an mpMRI. He was adamant about doing a TRUS biopsy (blind biopsy). I wanted a better outcome and found it with my second urologist. I realize I\u0092m really lucky given my current disease state compared to many on this forum. It was caught very early. My urologist said I\u0092m a good candidate for AS or a CyberKnife. As for AS, one core was rated a GS 6, but is that really representative of the state of the disease? A core taken a millimeter over could have been a 7 (4+3), in which case AS would not be on the table. My guess is, we\u0092ll never really be sure. For me, AS is like holding a lit stick of dynamite while waiting for something else to kill me. Yes, it gives me several more years with an intact urinary and reproductive system, but at the cost of dealing with a more advanced disease at a later date. I had a brief infatuation with MRI Focal Laser Ablation for a couple of weeks and I lump the CyberKnive in with this since it treats the lesion that is known. The CyberKnife also has more collateral damage (radiation). I found a study that presented some interesting statistics gathered from pathology reports of surgically removed cancerous prostates. It said that only one in five of the prostates had a single tumor, and many that remained were so small that that they were undetectable by the MRI. So, unless I\u0092m really lucky, as with AS this will just buy me some time (but at a potential cost). So I\u0092m currently considering RP for the following reasons: 1) I\u0092m early stage so there is a better chance at getting it all out (a cure). 2) I can take a major surgery now a lot better than I can five or ten years from now. 3) I\u0092m currently working and have reasonable healthcare. 4) Incontinence and ED suck, but not as much as prostate cancer and I\u0092m willing to make that trade off. I\u0092ve read that if you\u0092ve had radiation you are no longer able to have a RP? Is that correct and does that also apply to a CyberKnife treatment? I\u0092ve also read that once you\u0092re over 70 years old you\u0092re not considered a good candidate for RP? If this is true then it\u0092s another reason to just get it done now. Any comments and opinions are greatly appreciated. Thanks",
