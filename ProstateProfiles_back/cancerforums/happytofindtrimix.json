      "Content": "I have used Trimix about 27 times in the past 6 months. Most of the injections have produced a good result with a dosage from 0.03 - 0.06ml. However on about six injections the erection never came or didn't last. On two occasions I injected a second dose a little smaller than the first with good results. I have reading what I can find and now believe it is important to apply pressure to the injection site for up to one minute to make sure the medicine stays where it should. Since I started doing that the injection has worked every time.",
