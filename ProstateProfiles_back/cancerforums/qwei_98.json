      "Content": "I am a 51 years old Asian man, I had my first PSA test late November 2012 as a routine exam recommended by my family doctor, I did not have any symptoms\u0085 My first PAS was 4.4, my family doctor thought I might have some urine infections, and he asked me to take one month anti-biotic (I forgot the name of medicine). Then I took my second PSA test in early January 2013, it went up to 8.2. I was recommended to have a prostate biopsy to determine I have prostate cancer. I am reluctant to have a prostate biopsy, so I have been keeping track of my PSA since then. Below are the results for each month. I understand PSA is a controversial indicator of prostate cancer, and a biopsy is the determining approach for prostate cancer. It appears my PSA level fluctuated in the past 10 months, and sometime it was getting lower. I consulted some doctors and read some online advise on PSA, most people say PSA level should always go higher if it is prostate cancer. My problem is more like prostate infection based on PSA variations. I don\u0092t have any prostate cancer or urological symptoms as far as I can tell. I would appreciate if someone can give me advise on my situations.

      "Content": "Thank everyone for your advice. If someone has PC, is his PSA persistantly rising as some doctors concluded? or PC patient's PSA can fluctuate? I had a DRE about 6 months ago, the result is normal with slightly enlarged prostate. I am hesitated to have a biopsy out of some concerns of possible spread of cancer cells during and after intrusive biopsy if I had PC, I wonder whether this is a legitimate concern? I am seriously considering to have a biopsy soon, I wonder whether I can have a short drive (15 miles) home myself after biopsy? Do people take days off and avoid lifting heavy things after biopsy ?",
