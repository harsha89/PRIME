      "Content": "Originally Posted by WifeinWorry My husbands PSA was over 150 in January, with a combo of hormone treatments and chemo since March ( 6 sessions of 1 hour), with only one more session to go, numbers looking good: 06/26/2015 08:14 0.97 ng/mL (c) 06/11/2015 08:47 1.16 ng/mL (c) 04/24/2015 07:31 3.18 ng/mL (c) 04/03/2015 06:40 5.06 ng/mL (c) My question is, from other experiences, knowing everyone is different, how long will these numbers stay low after chemo stops and its just the hormone treatments, what are the odds? My MO who is one of the top PCa docs in the country keeps reinforcing to me- we are all different. Very different. My PSA went from 2.5 in March 2013 to 658 in March 2016 to 1,57 in November after 3 jabs of Lupron (once every three months) and 6 rounds of Docetaxel from 7/18 thru 10/31, every three weeks. It is now 7.4, and up from 3.45 in December, so mine has gone up pretty quickly after the chemo ended. I see my MO again on 2/23, and he will be averaging the last three PSA results as the new baseline. He says that if it has increased again he will likely prescribe Casodex daily to see if that has any effect on the rising PSA. My bone metastasis is in the collarbones, back of the skull, pelvis, femurs, spine, and upper arms. The pain is generally tolerable, and I can do alot of activities without pain. I am currently on 30 mg of Hyrdocodone per day.",

      "Content": "Happy New Year forum friend, The last two weeks have been tough as I have to get my head right going into the new year. My last visit with the MO was 12/19, 7 weeks past my last chemo round of the 6 Docetaxel infusions he prescribed. I got some extra time off from the every three week chemo routine, and went in for labs, PSA, and Zometa. During the visit with the MO, he relates that he thinks things are going so well he doesn't need to see me until late April, and that we could get scans done about the same time as last year for the first time since diagnosis last March. I was pumped when I left his exam room - three moths off - wow!! Well, not so fast there buddy- as I am sitting in the infusion room waiting for meds, here comes the Docs RN to tell me the PSA came back at 3.41 after being 1.37 in October - so now he ants scans next week and a follow up with him on 1/23 and then Lupron. I was so happy, but then 20 minutes later it feels like i got kicked in the stomach...not sure what to make of the increasing PSA after chemo stopped but to say I knew it was a crapshoot with all of the treatments when you have a PSA that hits 658.....but my chin is up and ready for whatever comes next.",

I would have thought he would have tried that before chemo though. Keep up the fight! Thomas Hey Thomas, I have actually been on Lupron shots since April every 12 weeks- I have had 3 so far. Next one coming 1/23...so i guess we will see if they are being effective now as stand alone treatment.",

I am on Narco 10mg 3-4 times a day. Sometimes in late afternoon I will take a half to get thru til bedtime. If i miss a pill, or sleep in, I wake up with severe bone pain...I have found that cannabis smoked first thing in the am potentiates the Narco so I can get up and get moving earlie...if not it takes me forever to feel relief in the am. Hang in there brother on the chemo - I was lucky and only had bad side effects like 2-3 days per round, but the burnt food taste for a week was beyond annoying. Biotene spray works well.",

If anyone has any insight on the side effects from Docetaxel I would love to hear from you. I had my first infusion on 7-18, and after the first couple days I thought wow, this isn't going to be bad at all...little tired and achy but nothing too severe or life altering...until I woke up on day 4 after infusion feeling like something had run me over - like a big truck or a freight train - and it lasted a couple of days. Anyone with similar of different reaction would love to hear as next Monday 8/8 it is round 2.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by Michael F Hi otr! Very sorry for the diagnosis but very glad that you have found the TCTRT and our Forum! Remain encouraged and keep Hope at the forefront! While complete cure probability is currently not likely, sound management is now your reality. You have several Forum Brothers who have Stage IV PC and have it well under control and successfully managed. They are doing extremely well and will continue to do so for many many years ahead. Take a look at Todd1963 and you will quickly see that Hope is not just a wish. Also take a look at WaterUnderTheBridge who also discovered that his PSA was suddenly > 300. Also, if willing, please add your Age to your \"Signature.\" Re \"He was not believing the result, and had it redrawn and by then , three weeks later, it had nearly doubled to over 600:\" I suspect that 2 different PSA tests were used. The 1st (on 2-27-2016) was likely a standard PSA test with low upper limits and the 2nd (on 2-23-16) had high upper limits. Thus it is highly unlikely that your PSA actually doubled in 3 weeks. So let's back up a bit. What you know for certain is your PSA has had a meteoric rise in less than 2 years: 3.2 (May '14) to 653 (March '16). We don't know exactly when this PSA began to rise. During this time were you being treated with, or taking any testosterone in any form such as testosterone similar compounds? You be can be assured that you will receive a lot of support along your journey to get this \"fire\" beaten down to controlled smoldering embers! Congrats on already knocking down your PSA to single digits!!! Stay optimistic and remember that we are all in this PC battle together! MF Michael, yes, i was on a testosterone booster (testerol) which I presented to the oncologist at first appointment and asked if the compound had anything to do with the rapid increase, and he said maybe but could not identify one particular thing in the compound that would exacerbate the PSA to skyrocket. I had a PSA in May 2014, and then nothing again until this past spring almost 2 full years later. I experienced a lot of back pain and urinary issues all through last fall, so my guess is the PCa started to take hold and spread during late summer/early fall 2015. Stupid ass me didn't put the things together until it was too late- but now am determined to live many more years and try and beat this crap.",

      "Content": "Greetings. I found this forum today and read a lot of posts before joining, and everyone appears to be very supportive and informative, and that's what I am looking for. My story, quickly, is after experiencing a bunch of lower back pain and frequent peeing, I finally went back to the urologist in February and while he found nothing with the DRE, the PSA came back over 300. He was not believing the result, and had it redrawn and by then , three weeks later, it had nearly doubled to over 600. I was quickly scheduled for the dreaded 12 needle and within a week had the expected real bad news. The urologist delivered a very dire expectancy due to the aggressive nature of the carcinoma, and the fact that I was self pay with no insurance. He says to me \" well you better go get some quick, because Lupron is 2000 a pop and you need it now.\" With that he shook my hand, walked out the door, and I haven't seen the man since. I called around here in central Texas, and after being turned down by 3 other centers I stumbled onto university of Texas Cancer Treatment and Research Center in San Antonio, and their amazing staff. Within two weeks of the dreadful diagnosis, I had scans for a huge discount at a Seventh Day Hospital, prescriptions for Lupron and Zometa donated by the pharma companies patient assistance, an amazing oncologist that is one of the leading practitioners in the country, and now I'm on the chemo train, with one treatment down and five to go. Thanks for reading, and thanks for having me. M.",

My story, quickly, is after experiencing a bunch of lower back pain and frequent peeing, I finally went back to the urologist in February and while he found nothing with the DRE, the PSA came back over 300. He was not believing the result, and had it redrawn and by then , three weeks later, it had nearly doubled to over 600. I was quickly scheduled for the dreaded 12 needle and within a week had the expected real bad news. The urologist delivered a very dire expectancy due to the aggressive nature of the carcinoma, and the fact that I was self pay with no insurance. He says to me \" well you better go get some quick, because Lupron is 2000 a pop and you need it now.\" With that he shook my hand, walked out the door, and I haven't seen the man since. I called around here in central Texas, and after being turned down by 3 other centers I stumbled onto university of Texas Cancer Treatment and Research Center in San Antonio, and their amazing staff. Within two weeks of the dreadful diagnosis, I had scans for a huge discount at a Seventh Day Hospital, prescriptions for Lupron and Zometa donated by the pharma companies patient assistance, an amazing oncologist that is one of the leading practitioners in the country, and now I'm on the chemo train, with one treatment down and five to go. Thanks for reading, and thanks for having me. M.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by Wilde Hello OTR, and welcome here. Sorry to hear about your tough situation but at least it seems that you are in good hands now. I wish you all luck. If anyone has any insight on the side effects from Docetaxel I would love to hear from you. I had my first infusion on 7-18, and after the first couple days I thought wow, this isn't going to be bad at all...little tired and achy but nothing too severe or life altering...until I woke up on day 4 after infusion feeling like something had run me over - like a big truck or a freight train - and it lasted a couple of days. Anyone with similar of different reaction would love to hear as next Monday 8/8 it is round 2.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by Michael F Hi otr! Very sorry for the diagnosis but very glad that you have found the TCTRT and our Forum! Remain encouraged and keep Hope at the forefront! While complete cure probability is currently not likely, sound management is now your reality. You have several Forum Brothers who have Stage IV PC and have it well under control and successfully managed. They are doing extremely well and will continue to do so for many many years ahead. Take a look at Todd1963 and you will quickly see that Hope is not just a wish. Also take a look at WaterUnderTheBridge who also discovered that his PSA was suddenly > 300. Also, if willing, please add your Age to your \"Signature.\" Re \"He was not believing the result, and had it redrawn and by then , three weeks later, it had nearly doubled to over 600:\" I suspect that 2 different PSA tests were used. The 1st (on 2-27-2016) was likely a standard PSA test with low upper limits and the 2nd (on 2-23-16) had high upper limits. Thus it is highly unlikely that your PSA actually doubled in 3 weeks. So let's back up a bit. What you know for certain is your PSA has had a meteoric rise in less than 2 years: 3.2 (May '14) to 653 (March '16). We don't know exactly when this PSA began to rise. During this time were you being treated with, or taking any testosterone in any form such as testosterone similar compounds? You be can be assured that you will receive a lot of support along your journey to get this \"fire\" beaten down to controlled smoldering embers! Congrats on already knocking down your PSA to single digits!!! Stay optimistic and remember that we are all in this PC battle together! MF Michael, yes, i was on a testosterone booster (testerol) which I presented to the oncologist at first appointment and asked if the compound had anything to do with the rapid increase, and he said maybe but could not identify one particular thing in the compound that would exacerbate the PSA to skyrocket. I had a PSA in May 2014, and then nothing again until this past spring almost 2 full years later. I experienced a lot of back pain and urinary issues all through last fall, so my guess is the PCa started to take hold and spread during late summer/early fall 2015. Stupid ass me didn't put the things together until it was too late- but now am determined to live many more years and try and beat this crap.",

The MO is happy, and hopes that by the end of my last round of chemo and next Lupron on Halloween, we will use the number derived from an end of November PSA to set the baseline for the go forward which could be below 1.0. So Saturday the 15th is my birthday, and I think I may celebrate a bit given where I was 6 short months ago - and hats off to Dr. John Sarantopolous and his fine and smiling team at CTRC in San Antonio.

I have had three rounds of every 12 week Lupron, two rounds of every 13 weeks Zometa, 6 rounds of Chemo, and have metastasis to the bone and lymph. My PSA is down to 1.37, I am finished the chemo with no radiation planned for now. Now I am waiting on a next Zometa infusion in December, and the Lupron again in January, and then we will do scans to see where we are. I am feeling pretty good, however the bone pain can get quite bad if I don't take my pain pills about 3 times a day. PM me if you ever want to chat, and best of luck with the rest of your treatments.

      "Content": "Originally Posted by st3v3 Hey shreddedwolf, I've asked my urologist, radiation and medical oncologist the same question. The urologist would only say \"years\". He referred me to a radiation oncologist who said it was possibly curable. He ordered an MRI to prepare me for radiation which showed the cancer had spread to my lower spine. So he had a second total bone scan done which showed cancer throughout my skeleton. The RO referred me to a medical oncologist who told me how long men live varies with each individual. My wife was with me at each appointment. Not sure if her presence influenced each doctor's answer. I've Googled this question several times since diagnosis. The best answer seems to be those of us with prostate bone metastasis have a 47 percent chance of surviving to 5 years. They did say that rate resulted from data going back 10 to 15 years and treatments available at the time. My hope is that in 5 years there will be new treatments to extend life or a cure. As a stage 4 patient with Gleasons of 9 and 10, my MO told me few months back that I will be around for many years. Not a number, just many.",

The worst part was the hair loss after the first session (about day 14 it started to come out in chunks- so we shaved it.). The burnt toungue sensation was annoying, and the nausea was a little difficult the first few days of each cycle. My worst days were days 4-5 post infusion when the chemo (poison) hits the marrow and any bone mets you may have, and that pain to me was dibilitating the first three or four infusions on those days - but by day 14 or so you start feeling good, and by the time you hit the last day of each cycle you feel really good.

      "Content": "Greetings brothers and caregivers. In March of 2016, I was diagnosed with Stage 4 PCa with Gleason's in the 9 and 10's, escape from the prostate, Lymph node involvement, and widely diffused metastatic bone disease. My PSA on 3-23 was 658. I got to ring the chemo bell on Monday, 10/31, as I completed round 6 of Docetaxel treatment, and my MO gave me a 7 week vacation until 12/19 before we do another round of Zometa and labs. Scans will be in January to see where we are...and PSA monthly after the 12/19 visit. Better news from the Monday visit was PSA down below 2 for the first time, at a sweet for me 1.37 - or 2/1000 of where it was back in March. The journey has been tough, chemo is a drag, with 3-4 days of your life wasted by just feeling like you got run into by a truck, then the post steroid rage from the Dex in week two you have to learn to control - the hair loss, the nausea, the bone pain down deep inside even your fingers and toes - but for me no nueropathy, no nails changed colors or fell out- gained some weight I had lost over the winter last year when I was first getting sick - The bottom line is this- when faced with the prognosis that things are S4 and you have anxiety about your life and future - get a good set of eyes on your case and follow the plan they lay out for you. Yeah I was scared as hell, and was not sure if I would make it another Christmas as sick as I was, when walking up the steps left me pained and breathless- but the miracle workers at CTRC- San Antonio are my true heroes, along with my wife that has been the most amazing support for me - and all of you for your kindness and support- so if anyone is in or gets in my stage and wants to chat, please feel free to reach out and let me me know - and bless this wonderful forum.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by st3v3 Hey shreddedwolf, I've asked my urologist, radiation and medical oncologist the same question. The urologist would only say \"years\". He referred me to a radiation oncologist who said it was possibly curable. He ordered an MRI to prepare me for radiation which showed the cancer had spread to my lower spine. So he had a second total bone scan done which showed cancer throughout my skeleton. The RO referred me to a medical oncologist who told me how long men live varies with each individual. My wife was with me at each appointment. Not sure if her presence influenced each doctor's answer. I've Googled this question several times since diagnosis. The best answer seems to be those of us with prostate bone metastasis have a 47 percent chance of surviving to 5 years. They did say that rate resulted from data going back 10 to 15 years and treatments available at the time. My hope is that in 5 years there will be new treatments to extend life or a cure. As a stage 4 patient with Gleasons of 9 and 10, my MO told me few months back that I will be around for many years. Not a number, just many.",

I have been in the prgram since diagnosed last March, and have gotten three doses of LuPron so far- the only thing I had to pay for was the cancer center injection charge. the financial program caps at like 45,000 a year max income, so your SS retirement income should land you in their offering sweet spot. the link for the application below- i applied and was accepted in like two days.

      "Content": "Greetings forum brothers, Yesterday was a tough day in our household, as my monthly trip to the MO hows PSA rising again, more than doubling in 5 weeks, to over 220. Oncologist is starting me on Zytiga with Prednisone, which will start as soon as Jansen gets the drugs to me. Scans done last week show no real soft tissue involvement of anything new, but the lumbar spine is lit up like a super highway with numerous areas of concern. The bone pain is increasing daily it seems, with some days having a tough time just moving around normally with a decent range of motion and walking with the dog. I will update again as soon as we get rolling on the Zytiga- I am very curious as to what effects it has on my current situation. Keep the faith. OTR",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by garyi A life long, 68 year old friend, just spoke to me, really worried about his prostate condition. Why he thinks I'm a PCa expert is anybody's guess. From what I know, his PSA went from 3.3 in 11/2014, to 5.4 in June of this year. His urologist put him on a 7 week course of antibiotics; Cipro and Doxycycline. At the end of the 7 weeks his PSA is up to 7.9. Yes, he has frequent urination, nocturia, and burning. His initial urologist was nothing to brag about. He just had a 3T MRI, which was very difficult tolocate in San Antonio, probably due to him having 'just' Medicare Advantage. $1,300 out of pocket, that he can ill afford, but... Results, as best as I understand them, are Category 5 in the left anterior transition zone, and Category 4 in the peripheral zone from the apex to the mid gradient. No ECE evident. Looks like he has an aggressive cancer. Of course a biopsy is next, most likely followed by treatment. He says he prefers radiation. My guess is SBRT is probably best for him. So any suggestions for really good RO's in San Antonio??? On my quick review I can't find any. MD Anderson takes Medicare Advantage, if I can convince him to go there. Some places I've looked at for him: 1. START in SAT - ? 2. UT SAT - doesn't take Medicare Advantage Aetna 3. MD Anderson - Not convenience, but great and accepts his insurance 4. UT Southwestern - Dallas and Ft. Worth - to be determined. 5. ARA Diagnostic Imaging in Austin - ? 6. Lots of unimpressive SAT Google ads.... Any suggestions, advise and recommendations will be much appreciated, either public or PM. Thanks, in advance! He runs Start in SA. Would call him for his consult, his team is the best in the state.",

I see the oncologist Friday next week. I was going to wait to get a blood test a few days before, but not doing the drug I got the PSA today. It's at 4.357. It was 1.713 last month. Nothing is working for me since February when the PSA was at .118 with Taxotere. . I had my doubts about this drug, and after the first week thought I would never be able to handle the SE either - but the fatigue seems to have calmed down and the Nausea, with the help of meds, is tolerable. My PSA went down 60 points first two weeks- and the MO expected a rise...today after driving 400 miles and sitting in my hospital for the day Monday and the last two days sitting on bad chairs my hips and pelvis feel like they did three weeks ago so I am not so sure the drug is working as well as I first thought it was.

      "Content": "Originally Posted by dmcook695 My sweet father has his first treatment of Taxotere on Friday and I'm wondering what to expect as far as side effects? I know everyone is different but would anyone mind sharing their experience? Greetings. i just completed my 6 rounds of the chemo with the Taxotere on 10/31. My thoughts/experiences are as follows, and yes everyone reacts differently. Day of infusion - slightly tired, usually nauseous on the ride home so ask for Reglan to help with the nausea. It works like a champ, and works quickly. Days 2-4 post infusion - tired, flu like symptoms most of the rounds. Bad taste in the mouth like burnt rubber is stuck in your teeth. Nausea comes and goes, but usually if you eat something it goes away. Constipation is bad these days. Days 5-6-7 post infusion - this is the tough spot, have him plan on doing nothing these days if possible as the chemo drug hits your marrow and the bone pain can be hard to deal with.I am on a steady diet of Hydrocodone for bone metastasis and they help tremendously on those days. nausea seems to subside these days as well, and the burnt feeling in the mouth makes eating a chore because everything has no taste. Days 8-10 - tired and fatigued, no nausea, burnt mouth taste gradually goes away. Days 11-21 Back to baseline before it all happens again. Few tips from my end: 1. eat well, drink a lot of water and fruit juice. 2. take laxatives on days 2-5, as the sooner you can get a couple good bowel movements after the infusion the easier the rest of the cycle will be. We expel this drug through utine and feces, so the more of those two things you can excrete the better and faster you will be back to baseline. 3. Buy ginger candies and sugar free candies for the burnt mouth days- they help. 4. Chapstick is a MUST for the corners of your mouth - they will crack. 5. prepare for a few days in bed, especially until you get used to the effects. I thought after the first three days from my first infusion this is easy, and then I woke up day 5 like a truck had run over me. best of luck. OTR",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by st3v3 ontheroad, I completed 3 weeks of Zytiga with prednisone as of Monday this week. I had to quite yesterday, the side effects were killing me. I see the oncologist Friday next week. I was going to wait to get a blood test a few days before, but not doing the drug I got the PSA today. It's at 4.357. It was 1.713 last month. Nothing is working for me since February when the PSA was at .118 with Taxotere. . I had my doubts about this drug, and after the first week thought I would never be able to handle the SE either - but the fatigue seems to have calmed down and the Nausea, with the help of meds, is tolerable. My PSA went down 60 points first two weeks- and the MO expected a rise...today after driving 400 miles and sitting in my hospital for the day Monday and the last two days sitting on bad chairs my hips and pelvis feel like they did three weeks ago so I am not so sure the drug is working as well as I first thought it was. Keep the faith brother and know we are all pulling for you - hard. Peace.",

Stage 4 sucks - as we think things are getting better but behind the curtain is the nasty Pca which seems to find it's way to grow and keep us in treatment unending.....let me know what your Onc says - and i am sorry you are headed back up - i know how much the chemo treatments just freaking mess with your life and peace.

I will have it checked next month, so we'll see. I don't think I meet the diagnostic criteria yet for castration-resistant. Hang in there. From what I've heard, Docetaxel is no fun. I had an easier time, with Jevtana for my chemo. Well that is good news- I am guessing the PSA doubling thing is not considered a big deal until it gets up over 4 as usual - I am seeing my Onc on Monday before my last chemo, and I am going to ask what the next steps are and what he considers the need will be for treatment beyond ADT in the future- anything learned I will share.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by Thomasj I suppose i was to smug with my condition the past 4 years. The only thing i cared about was the terrible side effects the Lupron had on me and when i could stop them. I did elect to skip an injection to see if i could return to my old self. Well, going through puberty again was just about as bad having zero T. It did get better at the six month visit to the urologist. I felt good then, and planned on not getting another injection but my Psa jumped to 4. Of course i back on the lupron. The next visit Psa back down to 0.1. The next two 6 month visits 0.9. The following visit 6 months later is 2.9. In Febuary 2017 will see what goes and probably have some bone scans then. I had never been on any fourms before and like i said before very nonchalant about my PCa. I think this will change next visit not sure. Thanks for all on this fourm as i am learning more about my PCa. Thomas OTR here to lend you a listening ear, and my tale. Also a stage 4, with a PSA above 650 back in March 2016. Three Lupron injections, 6 rounds of chemo (Doectaxel), 3 rounds of Zometa, three months of daily casodex, and my PSA is down below 2 for the first time since 2007. I have had bone scan, CT with contrast, and both showed aggressive cancer in my nodes and bones - but no organ sites yet and hopefully it stays that way. Not sure what help I can be, but message me any time for a shoulder or advice - I am here daily. Peace.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by Debby H My 68 year old husband was diagnosed about 2 years ago with a very rare and aggressive prostate cancer. They started him on a hormone shot in March of last year. In September when they did a bone scan it showed it has spread to his hip and his spine. He decided against radiation treatment. But he did decide to continue his hormone shot. He goes every 6 months for that. He's due to go back this month for another one. He simply will NOT tell me how he is feeling but he says He does say that he feels bloated and has had to go up one pants size. He looks very pale to me. He got very angry with me the last time we went to the dr and the dr said to be sure we told him if he has any tooth issues. I told the dr that he had just had a tooth removed. The dr didn't say anything more. What was the purpose if it didn't make any difference? He had to have another tooth removed 2 months ago and I told him he should contact his dr. He refused. I know you don't have a magic ball you can look into but can you give me your honest opinion about his prognosis. I can handle anything if I'm somewhat prepared but I feel like I'm flying blind here. The Drs won't even give us a stage the cancer is in but if it's spread to the bone with my research I'm guessing it's stage IV. just a little insight would be great. Hey Debby - fellow stage 4 here- the tooth questions are to see if you're husband can get Zometa to help with the bone pain and cancer sucking the calcium out of his bloodstream. I am on it, and have found it helps a lot with bone pain and helps prevent breaks/fractures in the future. Tell hubby to stop being such a secretive man- there is nothing to be afraid of or ashamed of, and everyone is just trying to help him feel better and prevent the further spread of the cancer. Targeted radiation on bone metastasis is to try and stop the cancer at the spot of the targeted pain, but if it is diffuse and spreads faster than first seen, then the teargeted radiation to the skeleton does more harm than good. PM if you want to chat further - I was diagnosed in March 16 and have had one hell of a first year with the treatments....good luck and peace to you.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by Jack1954 Hello I am now confused regarding my further treatment. My path reports Gleason is 5+5 (surgery 04-nov) with positive margin and grade is pt3b n1 mx. My uro has advised me to wait for 3 months to monitor psa levels and then to decide on further treatment. I have consulted couple of private radio-onc they have advised I should do a psa next month and then start radiotherapy straight away? What would you recommend as uro surgeons and radio- onc have different opinions here. Thanks Trust the oncologists- I have found urologists to be of a different cloth than the oncologists when it comes to OUR health - they have done their part with the biopsy and delivered the news- take your care into your own hands and as Jim has offered, get yourself aligned with a cancer center so you are receiving the best and most comprehensive care available. 10 Gleasons must be dealt with asap. Don'y mess around.",
