I found out I had cancer 2 years ago. PSA 28, Gleason Score 4+3=7 Jan of 2012 I had my prostate removed via robotic surgery. By July of 12 PSA was 0.0. Dec of 2012 I had a penile implant and during the one month follow up doc visit they did a blood draw. I went back for a PSA check in April of 2013. It was .25, January's was .17. I began HT in May and then 8 weeks of External Radition. In Sept my PSA was .04. That's my tale. I look forward to reading of the experiences of the others on the forum. Thank you!",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by lLance Could you please tell me if you are pleased with your choice. At 66 going on 67 in Mar. I want to have one, but question whether it is worth going through another surgery at this point in my life. Hi Lance, I'll give you the straight poop on what I feel about my implant. Of everything I have done in my life, it is my only true regret. I take full responsibility for it. My doctor didn't talk me into it. I didn't wait very long to get the implant after the prostate surgery. The kick off of the whole prostate thing came from watching TV commercials about Low T. Things weren't working like they used to so I went to the Doc and after a DRE, my life changed forever. flkjr - yes it was nerve sparing surgery. I tried ciallas and did injections. The pills did nothing, the injections were impressive but painful, very painful. I had delusions of grandeur thinking I could pump it up and go as long as my wife wanted. I moved forward with the implant and it was far worse that the prostate surgery for pain and recovery. There was something psychological about it was well, seeing it looking like a hot dog over cooked in the microwave and bruising that looked like I was kicked by a Clydesdale. Once I healed, about the same time as the prostate surgery, and I got the green light from the doc to have sex, I pumped it up. Disappointment is the only word to describe it. I was about 8\". According to my wife, I had something to be proud of. Now it's about 5\" and slimmer. When I asked the doctor, he said he used the largest implant that they make and it didn't fill the tissue like the blood used to. The few times we tried to have sex before the PSA started to rise and I went on HT it was nearly as painful as the injections. The head is now soft because there is no blood to inflate it. With the filled saline tubes behind the head pushing against my wife, it feels like pinching the webbing between your thumb and your hand as hard as you can. (Not 100% accurate but the only way I can describe it). When I was able to achieve penetration it wasn't much more than the now soft and pliable head. I hoped for her to finish quickly so that the pain would subside. I heard from a friend who also got an implant around the same time that he had similar experiences. He recommended using a fake vagina to desensitize it. That didn't help much. I actually found starting HT a relief because now I didn't have any desire, my wife knew that it was chemical castration and there was no longer any reason to try and make the implant worthwhile. I have heard that others have had fine experiences (by the paid spokesmen at the discussion group hosted by the doctors office) but this is my tale. Just living with it and knowing that I eliminated ANY chance of having things recur naturally is a constant reminder of the worst choice of my life.",

I didn't have any adverse effects from the radiation but I think that it did contribute to the fatigue and was compounded by the HT.",
