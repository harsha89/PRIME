      "Content": "Thanks all for the kind words. What nice guys! Great report today, but it was a quick summary and I have not see the official copy within my online records yet, and I should have asked for a copy. gleason of 3+3=6 from 2012 biopsy moved to 4+3=7 post op, so PSA was detecting it! something about the primary was a 3, but the secondary was a 4 (can someone explain this?) percent of prostate involved by tumor was 40% (this seems high) all cancer was interior to the gland, it did not spread. This surprised me if 40% of prostrate was involved by the tumor. Guess I am cancer free for now Comments from the doc: \"Your case is interesting as we made the decision based on PSA and not biopsy and that is opposite of the norm.\" \"we'll see you in Jan for a PSA and I have no doubt we'll see a zero\" My thoughts: - interesting with the increase in gleason and the biopsy did not find it - the MRI which was 11 months prior to robotic surgery did not pick up the cancer, hmmm. - not happy today with the inability whatsoever to control urine flow (I guess it's the first day w/o catheter, but hoping for some control) - pulling out catheter was easy. Like others said, the drainage tube pull was worse pain. Happy camper",

      "Content": "My story to help others.... You can see my stats below. One additional data point is that my father had the devinci radical surgery in 2007 at age 70. I knew I would need to have the prostate removed sometime in my life, but at 49 years old, this seems like a bit young. So I am on day 7 without my prostate. Still have catheter in. Will be removed on Dec 3 and hopefully welcome me into to zero club. The doctor said that he did not remove any lymp nodes during surgery and the prostate 'felt' good. I took that news great. I decided to have this surgery based in the following reasons: * high psa and did not seem to be remaining steady with an increase of 3-4 points a year * family history * second opinion really helped (opinion received outside of current doctor practice) * I have great benefits with current cadilac plan in 2014, which will be reduced in 2015. This surgery will cost me nothing. * I am in great physical shape and run constantly and enjoy mountain bike riding * tired of active surveillance and the thought of another biopsy in march 2015 was not appealing. I heard too many biopsies can be harmful. Three is enough. Complications from surgery: * I am not a fan of narcotics. Got sick 5 hours of surgery after taking some, so moved to aleve over the counter. But would still take 1 or 2 if you need it * Was worried the day before surgery with the cleanse. But just drank apple juice and cranberry and stayed not starving hungry. The mag citrate cleaned everything out with some irritation down there using the bathroom so much. * day 2 after surgery invited a good deal of stomach rumbling as food was moving through * was worried on bowel movement, but one stool softener per day finally gave relieve on day 5. Let nature take it's course, as many of us have said. * some bruises around the belly. And I was alarmed at first with the stomach pain due to muscles there, but this improves every day. I sneezed on day 6 without much pain. I have enjoyed this forum and used everyone's data and stories to help me. I am surprised to see that surgery was completed by most when psa is under 10. With mine over 12, I was worried I waiting too long. We'll see when I get the pathology results this week. Wish everyone well. The surgery is great for fit guys with a low Gleason.",
