    "Content": "Hello 33 year routine annual blood test result of psa 4.5 last year Result 2.5 .. Two Years ago-0.95 There were no sex or cycling 48Hr before the test. I dont feel any infections and urinary tract infections, etc. ... 2 years ago i was diagnosed with azoospermia and Following this I did US Transrktali with no speacial findings. There is a sharp rise in the PSA values\u200b\u200b, which could be the reason? Is there anything to fear from? Thanks for the reply.",
