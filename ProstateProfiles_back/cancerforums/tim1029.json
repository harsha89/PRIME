      "Content": "Can anyone help me. I just was diagnosed at age 44 with very early stage 1 Gleason score 6 prostate cancer. My Doctor told me the standard for someone my age is to have a radical prostectomy to give me the best shot of a long life. My concern is how will my sex life be after the surgery. I hear many conflicting storys ranging from you will be able to have erections a couple weeks after surgery to, forget it you'll never be able to have sex again. Please is there anyone out there that could possibly give me some straight answers to what to exspect with the surgery. Also maybe a little advice on possible other options.",
