      "Content": "Hi Fran - Thanks for the reply! I can tell from reading many posts in this forum that it's a really supportive place. The hardest time for me is when I'm up and active. When I'm sitting (which is probably all too often ), I can do pretty well. If I head to the bathroom immediately, I can usually get there before it's ALL leaked out. But walking around my neighborhood - or even through the supermarket? Forget it - it basically all leaks out. I try to \"kegel\" for the entire time, but I just can't. Is that what doing the kegel's is for? I mean, is that the goal that I need to be able to do the mother of all kegels for an hour or more? Or is something else going to kick in and magically hold it in and the kegels just increase the strength until then? So strange - I've spent sooo much time reading and learning about this whole process, but I feel like I don't have a clue. Andy",

      "Content": "Sorry for the duplicate - I accidentally posted in the \"General\" forum by mistake: ------------ This is my first post. I have so many questions that I don't really know where to start. I had DaVinci a little over three weeks ago. The pathology showed negative margins, for which I'm grateful. I got really lucky - or a really good surgeon - or both and have already conquered the ED spector (well, with a little help from my friend cialis ). But the incontinence is clearly going to be my challenge. I know it's still really early, but I guess I had a secret belief that it wouldn't really affect me. So on to my first question. I'm sure this sounds dumb but... So I understand that guys have two ways of controlling urine, the sphincter that's part of the prostate and the pelvic floor muscles. And I understand that now that I have no prostate, I'm reliant on the pelvic muscles. So does this mean that I'm supposed to be clamping down on those muscles 24 x 7? If not, what's holding the urine in? (well, in my case nothing, but what SHOULD be holding it in?) I'm doing the Kegal exercises \"religiously\" (which is the exact word the surgeon used). Also - an unrelated question - how do I set the signature of my posts like I see others have done? Thanks! Andy",
