    "Content": "I'm 27 years old. I've noticed that lately, I've been cramp where my prostate is located. It feels like there's pressure. In the last couple days, I've noticed the cramping is starting to include my lower back. Today, the cramping has gone to my whole back. From what I understand, back pains might be a sign of prostate cancer. However, I'm not feeling other possible symptoms. I'm not urinating blood, nor does urinating hurt. Urinating doesn't feel frequent either. I'm not experiencing testicular pains. When I ejaculate, there's no blood (although orgasms have started to feel very weak). Are these early warning signs of prostate cancer, or am I just worrying too much? I'm only 27, and I hear that chances of prostate cancer for men my age are small, but a small chance is still a chance, so I just want to be sure. What could be causing the weak orgasms, prostate pressure, and back cramping? Are these signs of cancer?",
