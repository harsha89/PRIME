      "Content": "Originally Posted by HighlanderCFH Hi John, Welcome to the forum. Looks like MRJ gave you some good info from the link he provided. The odds are in your favor that you will not get prostate cancer and heavily in your favor that any PC found would not be aggressive. Can you tell us your age. It certainly is very possible that your elevated PSA is strictly the result of the BPH. However, it is good that you are following your situation closely in case a prostate tumor could be \"hiding behind\" that PSA that would seem to be from the enlarged prostate. Good luck, Chuck Thanks for your replies. I am 56. I have BPH with a prostate volume of about 70cc. My father had prostate cancer. I myself had sweat gland cancer 12 years ago. With that cancer the tumor was removed surgically and there was no concern since then. I guess what I really want to know is the weight that the original biopsy has in comparison to the other information. I know the statistics that were quoted and that a biopsy is one of the most definitive tests that can be done. Another question I have is about the ASAP. Could that condition be the result of BPH?",

      "Content": "Hello. A rising PSA after a couple of years made my GP send me to a urologist. An initial biopsy was done and one needle showed ASAP. Since then I have been on flomax which has brought down my PSA from 7.59 to 4.65 over the course of a year and a half. My DREs have found nothing. A MRI with contrast of the prostate a few months after the biopsy showed nothing of concern. A PCA3 test a few months ago shows no concerns. It has been two years since the initial biopsy and I am scheduled for another. Can I assume that all the data gathered so far makes it less likely cancer will be found or does the ASAP finding more important than all the other information? Thanks for your help.",
