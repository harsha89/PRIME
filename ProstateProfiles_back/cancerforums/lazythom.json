I question because I haven't seen doubling PSA incidents noted in many of the posts. age 54 dx PC. 7/14 psa 5.1 4/15 psa 5.5 5/15 biopsy 2 of 12 samples positive 3 + 3 gleasonT1 c (I think) 7/15 psa 7.1 12/15 psa 9.7 12/15 MRI - from what I read on the report no areas of real concern. for now doing the active surveillance and will do biopsy again in may 2016. i'm ok with waiting but the only thing that makes me wonder is the rising PSA. if I use the doubling time calculator i'll be in the 14 range by June 2016. thanks for input.",
