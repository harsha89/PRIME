However, what really matters is what is your outcome relative to the alternatives. You can never know, but if you listen to the person making the 4th comment on the NYT article, he says, \"When in doubt, do nothing.\" This, in my opinion, is not a good strategy for dealing with PC. In May of this year, my younger brother died of PC. I was diagnosed with PC on August 11. On August 26 I had my prostate removed by RP by someone who has done hundreds of these surgeries. I was very comfortable with his advice and that of my primary urologist. If you are in good health and have T2 PC, surgery appears to give the best outcome. I will also say that I do not care if I ever have another erection and that I would rather live with some incontinence that allow cancer to continue to grow in my body after what I saw my brother go through. Dying of PC is much worse than not having sex or wearing a diaper.",
