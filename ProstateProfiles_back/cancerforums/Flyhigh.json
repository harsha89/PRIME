      "Content": "Have had enlarged prostate over 8 yrs. Six years ago they did biopsy because PSA shot up to 10. Biopsy was negative. However PSA never returned to normal readings. With Proscar PSA 3-4. Was examined 8 months ago, all OK, prostate smooth. Three months had flu like symptoms,no fever. Appetite not good, and tired easy.I am diabetic, non insulin dependent. I watch weight. But I gradually began to fall from 162 to 150 in 3 months. Endocrinologist ran battery of test, all OK. I have Atrial Fibrillation 3 times in 5 yrs. On medication, which can make you tired.Noticed sense of urgency at times with bladder. Saw urologist this week(not regular guy I see, but only one I could see quick. He did DRE, said he felt nodule on right side of prostate. Said weight loss not good,but PSA was 4. He wants biopsy,with c-Scan. He said chances of cancer 50-50. Have procedure in 2 weeks,and scared. I have had annual DRE's, always OK,but even after last biopsy 6 yrs ago, PSA was never normal. My visit to urologist this week was two months early,due to my concerns. Obviously I didn't like Doctor,but he has raised fears to high levels. I feel since it was a nodule,it's cancer. Suppose I am looking for someone to put in perspective. Urine normal,ejaculation for my age (71) normal. I am fit,keep diabetes under control. This prostate issue,because it was nodule just seems grave",

      "Content": "Appreciate your quick response. We are in approximate age category.Like we all do,after seeing the doctor,I went to one prostrate health site. Seeking to get handle on my situation,the worse,the best,but concentrating on the worse. Having the prostrate removed,at least gives you 10 yrs of life.But many doctors seem to say/ imply it's a serious surgery for man over 70. That it results in 4 weeks at least to return to normal. You seem knowledgeable about removal of prostrate. Doctors seem to say,you need to be in good health to withstand it,and 70+ required extra consideration. This nodule was on surface of right side of prostrate,PSA was 4, but I take Finesteride, so doctors usually double the result. Having dealt with removal of prostrate what is most serious aspect in your view. You can tell it was a shock,I didn't neglect the BPH, suddenly, your in w/ a doctor you don't normally see, he shakes his head wants biopsy,and CT Scan bladder, said chances 50-50. If it came to it I would opt for longest chances if living,if that be prostrate removal,but to be redundant, doctors stress will be hard on you(i.e. ) if over 70. I shouldn't complain I have made it to 71, but 8 months ago people would swear I was in 60's, fit. You probably know where my thinking is at. I know so little about removal of prostrate,or what to do. Granted, I don't know at this point anything,except,nodule,weight loss,and loss of energy which cannot be attributed to any other condition. Appreciate your thoughts when you have time.",

      "Content": "I have had an enlarged prostate for about 10 years. PSA was 4-5 with Proscar.Six years ago did biopsy,was benign. Have had yearly checks since,and was due to have 1 in two months,but 3 months ago,I began to notice fatigue.I am non-insulin dependent diabetic. Weight control was important. My ta usual weight 163. I noticed weight loss,fell to 150, have had some urinary urgency issues time to time. I saw endocrinologist,ran battery of test- all OK. Tried to see my urologist,had to settle for a doctor with opening. Had PSA done. Saw Doctor,talked about BPH, and bladder issues. Did DRE,said was nodule on side of prostate,biopsy needed and CSsn with dye. Said chances of cancer 50-50. He didn't like weight loss.kept shaking his head. Then said is a biopsy OK? Sure, I was scared. Now I wait, and given it was nodule feel chances of cancer great. I am 71, healthy don't look my age, up until 3 months walked 5-6 miles indoor track 4 days a week. Had mentioned fatigue to primary care doctor. Three years ago had AFIB 2-3 times,cardiologist put me on medication which holds heart rate down, so a certain degree of fatigue was normal.Primary care doctor felt heart medication needed to be reduced. Obviously it was not that. I feel this is the real deal, and because it was nodule,it's not going to be your average PSA cancer. Any perspective appreciated.",
