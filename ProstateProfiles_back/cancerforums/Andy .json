      "Content": "Hello, If anyone knows of a LDR BT expert in orlando, please let me know. The two I talked to have low experiences. I know of dattoli in Sarasota , but he combines DART with seeds. I also know Terk in jacksonville. Prefer to find an expert in Orlando who has 1000+ under hos belt, rather than travelling out of town, and have to deal with follow ups and etc. Thank you.",
