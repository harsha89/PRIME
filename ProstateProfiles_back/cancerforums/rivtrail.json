      "Content": "They say I'm negative on cancer (PSA was 6+ and rising when I went in for my biopsy (56 years old). CRP also was high (2.9). Digital exam found a spot that was abnormally hard. Concerns now are what might be causing all of this? Also, my urine is clear of any blood, as is bowel but my semen is a freak show 5-7 days after. Should I be clearing myself of all the blood or let it stay in there? Should they be checking for cancer somewhere else? My only major symptom is high-volume urination episodes 2-4x per night, sometimes within a couple hours. Thanks.",

      "Content": "My Psa was 6 and rising (up from 3 a couple years ago, then 5+, then 6+ a few weeks later). Doc seemed optimistic after my biopsy and didn't mention any major concerns (I'm 56). Also, my CRP was high (2.9) on my most recent blood test. My concerns are these: 1) the freak show that is my semen (pure blood, after about five days). Been afraid to see it since then and am uncertain how to normalize. Should I be regularly ejaculating to empty things out or refrain? Everything else (urine, bowel) has checked out with no blood. 2) if no cancer was found, then what the heck else could be going on to make those numbers so bad? 3) what sort of special supplements, protocol should I be following? Thanks, in advance.",
