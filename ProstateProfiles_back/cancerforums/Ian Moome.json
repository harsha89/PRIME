      "Content": "Hey Stricks, I had my nerve sparing RALP just over 8 months ago. About 3 weeks after surgery, my Dr. started me on a combo of daily Cialis and vacuum pump to keep my penile tissues healthy. After 3 months of that process with no usable erection, the doc added Trimix ...to prime the pump so to speak. For me, Trimix works great. Too great, in fact, while figuring out dosing. Two to three hour erections are not as fun as they sound. Once we figured out the dose, the drug provides a very usable erection. There is some of the achiness during erection that others have mentioned, but it gets better. Injecting oneself is not as daunting as it sounds. It's a very small needle and only hurts for a second or two but the results are well woth the discomfort. For me, the priming the pump concept worked. At 7 months post-surgery, I began to experience periodic spontaneous nocturnal erections. At 8 months, they are almost nightly. Trimix is worth a try if your guys is up for it. Regards",

      "Content": "Hey Jake, I was 56 at the time of my surgery. My erections did not return until about 9 months post-surgery ...so keep the faith. If you Hopkins doc does not have time to address your ED concerns, I'd find someone who does. My doc was very aggressive with penile rehab. He started me with Cialis and a vacuum pump about a week after catheter removal. Neither had immediate stellar results but he encourage me to stick with the regimen since both promoted blood flow to penile tissue. He said that top priority was maintaining healthy tissue until my body took over. After about 4 months, he suggested that we do a few treatments with Trimix. He called it priming the pump. Once I got over the horrors of getting an injection in my junk, I tried it. Trimix worked great once we got the dosing perfected. The dosing was a little dicey ...3 hour erections are no fun. Spontaneous partial erections did start occurring after Trimix therapy began. Then one morning in January 2018 (surgery was April 2017), I awoke to an old friend staring up at me. The first few were a little painful but worth it. Be patient. Your body will heal. ~I",
