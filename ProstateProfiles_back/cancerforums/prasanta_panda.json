I have few doubts, biopsy report suggests perineural invasion. Gleason score is 6. Does it signifies there is some eye raising things within prostate ( maybe cancer) ? Is there error in biopsy report?",

      "Content": "Thanks Chuck for your quick and informative response. Some of the other things in Biopsy are ============ TURP CHIPS : Benign Hyperplasia of prostate with focal high grade prostatic interaepithelial Neoplasia ============ Microscopic description ============ section from prostatic tissue fragments comprising glands lined by double layered epithelial cells. Some glands are cystically dilated containing proteinaceous sections in the lumen. Stroma is composed of smooth muscle bundles which at places form microleimyomatous nodules. Few glands show for high grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia characterized by elongated nuclie and prominent nucleoli. ======================== The story is like this: Father had been feeling difficulty at urination for longer time. He did not disclose this. When examined doctor said that he has to undergo TURP. Recently ( 28th Jan) he had the surgery and biopsy report reveals this. As you said correctly, cancer might be there from longer period. Is it harmful that he underwent TURP surgery..... It is great to listen from you.",
