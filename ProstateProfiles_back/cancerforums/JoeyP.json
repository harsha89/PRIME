      "Content": "I had my prostatectomy on June 15th of this year. Post surgical pathology report reads: Specimen(s) Received A: Right pelvic lymph node B: Left pelvic lymph node C: Prostate and seminal vesicles Final Diagnosis A. Right pelvic lymph node: - 1 lymph node, negative for malignancy. B. Left pelvic lymph nodes: - 4 lymph nodes, negative for malignancy. C. Prostate and seminal vesicles: - Prostate adenocarcinoma, Gleason score 3+4 = 7 seen in right and left sides involving approximately 20% of the examined tissue. - Perineural invasion is present. - No extra prostatic extension of tumor seen. - Tumor is seen focally at right inked margin - Bilateral seminal vesicles with no evidence of involvement by tumor. Note Foci of tumor are seen within prostatic capsule but no definitive extra-prostatic extension seen. Nests of cells with clear cytoplasm are seen in extra-prostatic adipose tissue which is negative for PSA and PSAP, ruling out extra-prostatic extension. The morphology of these nests are in favor of ectopic adrenal cortex. Dr. _____ has reviewed this part and agrees with the interpretation. I just went back for 6 week eval, and I am healing well, can begin normal activity, and my 1st PSA since surgery showed no detectable cells. \"less than 0.014\", which is as low as their reading went. My PSA the week before surgery was 5.8 and my gleason was 3+4, 7. 11 of 12 regions of my prostate contained some cancer. My question is, with this pathology report and the non-detectable PSA after 6 weeks, does anyone have an idea of the chances of the cancer returning sometime?",
