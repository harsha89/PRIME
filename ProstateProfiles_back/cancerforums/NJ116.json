I do not remember all the results/pre tests, but after the operation he did say the cancer was worse than the biopsy indicated - as expected. He also said that the cancer was \"close\" to the wall of the prostate, but it did not break the wall of the prostate. My father had prostate cancer. He went the radiation route (1980 ish), and ended up with a bag for both pee and poo, which I do not want to go through. Options that I read about do not look good and I really worry about the radiation operation. Any suggestions or advice? Are my numbers that bad?? Thanks much.",

      "Content": "Wow, sorry... I did not notice your question earlier. FYI, yes, my post op PSA was .01, then .02, then .04, then .07 At .07 we went for the salvage radiation. I'm done with the treatment, and the PSA is now at <.02 which is considered perfect! Odd though... originally, the test result of <.01 was considered cancer free, where now <.02 is now the base. I'll take it.. and get rechecked on a regular basis.",

Your first BM is supposed to be a bit rough, but it was absolutely fine for me!! Call the doctor's office if you have pain. I ASSUMED that it would be painful, and ended up putting up with catheter pain for 10 days! The hospital did not give me proper instructions on dealing with the catheter. Best wishes!",
