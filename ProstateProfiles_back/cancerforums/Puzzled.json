      "Content": "Originally Posted by HighlanderCFH Hi Puzzled, I moved your post from the \"signature\" sticky thread to it's very own thread so you get more attention. However, it would be helpful for you to post your stats into a signature so we can see what type of case you are/were dealing with. If your PSA is at 0 seven months after surgery, you have every reason to consider yourself cancer free. A lot of it depends on how aggressive your cancer was, what the post-op path report shows, etc. Once again, it will be very helpful to have your stats so we can offer better comments. In the meantime, indeed the value of ZERO is exactly what a man wants to see after prostate cancer surgery! Oh, my pre surgery PSA was about 18 - it had been climbing for several years but never doubled in 1 yr. 1st biopsy 3 yrs. ago was negative, my 2nd biopsy last April had 1 of 10 with a gleason score of a 6. I had Davinci RP last June at U of Mn. My pathology showed a positive margin gleason 7 but no positives in the seminal vesicles or lymph nodes and no extraprostatic extrusion. PSA tests since then have all been <0.01 with frequency of these at 3 months. Wife has me drinking lemon juice and pomagranet juice daily.",
