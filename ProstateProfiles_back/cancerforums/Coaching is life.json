      "Content": "I have Prostate cancer. I was diagnosed at 48. I had radiation therapy, hormone therapy and lots of issues since my treatment. My PSA was never super high and the reason I had it checked was I am the third generation to have prostate cancer and each generation it has gotten younger and more aggressive. I have had to have my spinchter removed , several cysto's, I have had severe clotting, and the inability to void. I currently am on my second artificial spinchter with two resrviors. This has helped with the level of incontinence. However, I am now ashamed to say, I cannot have sex with my wife with out voiding in her. She is very careful in her words and never complains... but for me, I am just mortified that I pee every time. Does anyone have suggestions or has anyone else's had this issue?",
