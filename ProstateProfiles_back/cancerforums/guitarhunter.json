      "Content": "Originally Posted by chiguy Met with my urologist/surgeon today, and after discussing the issue of a continually rising PSA in the face of several biopsies finding only 1 or 2 cores of G6 cancer, he suggested trying Finasteride (Proscar). The way I understand it, it should lower my PSA by 50% in 3 months time. If not successful by then, it should achieve the 50% reduction within 6 months or there is a likelihood of a more aggressive cancer. Also, if, after whatever reduction is seen, there is ANY increase in PSA, it's also an indication of something more serious than a G6 and would likely require treatment. I understand that reducing the PSA is NOT eliminating any cancer. The way I understand this strategy is that it will eliminate any possibility that there is an issue of BPH, even though my prostate is not enlarged outwardly. (I have also been taking Alfuzosin since September '17) It will allow us to be more certain of a missed aggressive cancer if the PSA continues to rise. The 'risk' to this path, as I see it, is that I am allowing an aggressive cancer 6 months growth time. Is this an accurate understanding on my part? I spoke to my urologist about this about six weeks ago. He didn't recommend it at that time saying it could mask what was going on. He's still as confused as I am about what is going on with my case. I've got my follow-up next week Thursday to see my next step.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by chiguy Met with my urologist/surgeon today, and after discussing the issue of a continually rising PSA in the face of several biopsies finding only 1 or 2 cores of G6 cancer, he suggested trying Finasteride (Proscar). The way I understand it, it should lower my PSA by 50% in 3 months time. If not successful by then, it should achieve the 50% reduction within 6 months or there is a likelihood of a more aggressive cancer. Also, if, after whatever reduction is seen, there is ANY increase in PSA, it's also an indication of something more serious than a G6 and would likely require treatment. I understand that reducing the PSA is NOT eliminating any cancer. The way I understand this strategy is that it will eliminate any possibility that there is an issue of BPH, even though my prostate is not enlarged outwardly. (I have also been taking Alfuzosin since September '17) It will allow us to be more certain of a missed aggressive cancer if the PSA continues to rise. The 'risk' to this path, as I see it, is that I am allowing an aggressive cancer 6 months growth time. Is this an accurate understanding on my part? I spoke to my urologist about this about six weeks ago. He didn't recommend it at that time saying it could mask what was going on. He's still as confused as I am about what is going on with my case.

A round of Cipro seemed to clear it up or at least caused my symptoms to go away. I was under for this MRI guided biopsy so it was much more pleasant than the first. The Surgeon did make a comment to my wife that he saw nothing on the ultrasound and if he didn't have the MRI data the suspect area would never have been sampled. He also said that he's seen cases like mine before but they are very rare.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by lastchance I had two negative biopsies, a MRI , and a PCA3 test and they all indicated I did not have cancer. At the time my PSA was 24. The uro that did these test did not want to do anything else unless it went up ten points. I went to another URO six months later (as quick as I could get in) and he suggested a saturation biopsy, which I was all for. PSA ended up at 40. Saturation biopsy was about like the other two with the exception of being put under. I did/do ( first post surgery PSA is in March) have cancer G7, (3+4) in three of the 26 samples. I had been dealing with this for about two years and already decided I was going to have surgery if it cam to that. Surgery was 12/4/2017 and I could not be happier. Prostate was 67 grams and the doctor is pretty sure it was confined, not trying to be pessimistic but I would push for the saturation biopsy, I wished they had done mine about a year earlier. Good luck,it can be a long road with a lot of decisions , I truly wish you the best as I have been there and done that. Thanks for your response. Did anything show up on your MRI? Like I said they saw a small area on mine and sampled that area heavily. I really have no other symptoms at this time other than the increasing PSA.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by edwardtyme Hello- My name is Edward From Florida and I'd sincerely appreciate any advice / guidance some here may provide: I'm a healthy 59 year old male with an increasing PSA reading over the last 5 years. Back in 2013 my PSA reading was at 4.6 and it steadily increased over the years to a current reading of 17.5 which was verified as my blood work taken twice over 5 weeks. I have had three negative biopsies and 18 months ago I had an MRI which indicated a two small mass with a PIRADS score of 4. I believe my urologist, that is also a part-time assistant Professor of Urology at a major medical school in Florida will suggest yet another biopsy. Any suggestions ??? Anything different you would do if you were in my predicament ? Thanks, Edward God Bless Kind of sounds like me Edward. You can see my details in my signature. Right now I'm waiting for everything to heal from my December 29th biopsy to have another PSA check. I'm pushing for PHI and/or free PSA which has never been tested before in my case. I've been told another MRI might be in my future followed by another biopsy.",
