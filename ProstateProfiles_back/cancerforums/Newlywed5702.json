    "Content": "I received two 3 month shots of Eligard then 44 radiation treatments followed by a 6 month Eligard shot which ended 1 year ago. I still have HOT flashes. PSA dropped from 8+ to .01 but I don't know my testosterone level. I don't feel I have recovered at all from the side affects except that I don't get a tired. My urologist doesn't want me on HT because he likes the low testosterone levels. My Oncologist says the Eligard was not needed. Whom do I believe??????? Hot Flashes ED Loss of body hair Bruise easy Muscle mass gone and replaced with Boobs Not sure what is next.",
