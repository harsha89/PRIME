      "Content": "Thanks, Wilde. That looks like the one encouraging outcome in addition to no spread to lymph nodes or seminal vesicles. Congratulations on passing 6 months successfully! I assume your PSA's are holding down there at <.1. My surgery was just 2 weeks ago and I'm actually amazed that I feel as good as I do physically. The mental strain from the path report is another issue! tmack",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by HighlanderCFH Welcome to the forum tmak, Ray and the others are giving you wonderful -- and very happy -- information. Indeed, it is strongly believed that Gleason 6 postate cells CANNOT survive outside of the prostate. Recall the Johns Hopkins report, as cited above, where 14,000 cases of true Gleason 6 cases yielded ZERO cases of metastasis. If you had had a higher Gleason score in your post-op report, there would be cause for concern. But just being a Gleason 6 -- and having it confirmed by the pathology -- means that you are overwhelmingly likely to have been cured. Stick around with us and we'll be happy to help as any other questions arise. Chuck Thanks to all for the encouraging information! While I understand that the Gleason 6 cells are not aggressive, the report does indicate that they were outside of the prostate (extraprostatic extension) so it seems they do survive there. They also grew to involve 25% of the prostate. I still don't understand if the \"perineural invasion\" means inside the prostate or in the nerve bundles outside the prostate (which were spared). Can anyone shed light on the meaning of the \"less than one high power field\" used in both the 'margins' explanation and the extraprostatic extension explanation?? I'm amazed at the amount of collective knowledge here and am learning a lot from reading many of the posts! tmack1",

      "Content": "I've just received a path report following a robotic prostatectomy and there seems to be a major disconnect with the \"good news\" cited by the surgeon after he reviewed the report. Based on his coments I expected to see a pT2 or pT2c at worst. Instead, the path report cites a pT3a with a Gleason 3+3 (6). It shows \"extraprostatic extension present (noted as a microscopic focus at the right posterior aspect)\" and that \"adenocarcinoma extends to within less than one high power field at the right posterior aspect\". Also indicates \"perineural invasion: present\". There was no \"regional lymph node metastasis\" or \"seminal vesicle invasion\". Regarding margins, the report states: \"margins:less than one high power field from inked surface at the right posterior aspect\". 25% of the prostate was involved by tumor and the disease was bilateral. I've been unable to find any literature on-line that interprets the \"margin\" information in terms of \"power field\" and there is nothing on the report indicating \"positive\" or \"negative\" margins. Based on what I've been reading this appears to be a cancer requiring follow-up radiation and depending on what the \"margin\" notes mean, there may be a significant incidence of recurrence 5 and 10 years out. I'm a newbie on this site and hope that some may be able to provide some interpretation or explanation of what I'm seeing before I over-react. Thanks for any help you can provide. tmack1",
