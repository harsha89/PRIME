Which of my vehicle choices would be the easiest for me to come home in? 2015 Mazda 3 This is my wife's car and the one she'd prefer to drive. I have to sit low and back in, then swing my legs around to get in. 2005 Ford F250 Lariat Diesel My truck. I would have to step up on the running board then another step up to get into the cab. My wife hasn't driven it and it intimidates her but it has adjustable peddles and seats so she could drive it. 2006 PT Cruiser My son's car. Similar to my wife's car, but not as low to get into. So would it be easier to squat or step up after surgery? Thanks in advance- Gary",

The other side has 4 cores, some at 95%, which I assumed was why he didn't want to spare those. I've been reading that a few guys here had nerve sparing surgeries with all 12 cores showing positive, which now makes me question what the criteria might be in determining whether to remove or leave a nerve bundle behind. Can anyone weigh in on this? Thanks, Gary",

      "Content": "So we met with Dr. Hettinger, our first possible surgeon yesterday. He is the younger and less experienced of the two that we decided to meet, having done \"hundreds\" as opposed to Dr. Emmott that is my age (61) and has done over 1000. Both happen to be with the same urology group as Dr. Bock, the urologist that did my biopsies. Besides age and experience, they seem to disagree on the use of the Rocco stitch on the bladder. Dr. Hettinger said he doesn't think it's necessary as he has had the same continence success without it and avoids stitching into healthy tissue or organs whenever possible. He said that there is a remote chance the bladder could actually rupture which really sounds no bueno. We meet with Dr. Emmott tomorrow and we'll go over why he uses it, but I would love to hear input from you guys first, if possible. Meanwhile- My beautiful and incredibly supportive wife (52) now has to have her uterus biopsied next week because of some raised suspicions and just to keep things interesting, we learned this morning that her mammogram shows calcium grains which could possibly be yet another early warning sign of cancer. I beginning to wonder if our house was built over native burial grounds or a toxic dump. God, if you really feel the need to smack someone, please consider ISIS. They like martyrdom. Gary",

      "Content": "We met with the radiologist today and she too recommends surgery, because of my age (61) and general good health. Should the surgery not get it all, which is unlikely, then we can do radiation. Although I am a good candidate for either, they say surgery after radiation is very difficult and not too many doctors attempt it. Kind of a no brainer, then. We are going with Dr. David F. Emmott. He is the older surgeon (61) of the two we met, with the thousand plus daVinci surgeries under his belt. His explanation of why he does the Rocco stitch made sense. He said I was the first patient to ever ask him about the Rocco stitch, which is a credit to the information available on this site. He only schedules himself for one surgery a day, which is great. He was very sincere, pleasant and brutally honest about my somewhat slim chances of getting natural erections. He will not spare the nerves on the right side as he feels there is too much risk in leaving some cancer behind. He will try to spare the left side nerves, however. Better limp in life than stiff in death, right? For those who are following along, my wife is getting her uterus biopsied on Monday and her breasts biopsied on Tuesday. Positive thoughts that both her pathology reports come back negative are appreciated. Hell of a week we've had. Gary",

The next year they see each again and he discreetly asks if he went ahead with the transplant. \"Yeah, but I'm not at all happy with it.
