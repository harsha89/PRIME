      "Content": "Hi all, by way of a brief introduction: I'm 60 this month. In the last three years both my parents have died of stroke, my 30 year marriage collapsed, I've moved house twice, been on and off anti-depressants most of the last three years and this January discovered I have prostate cancer that has gone to my bones; nearly all of them. A lack of energy and motivation means I sleep between 10 and 16 hours a day. To say I'm a mess physically and mentally would be an understatement.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by 35coupe When the cancer has spread to the bones causing bone pain can anybody explain what it feels like. IS it a stabbing pain, does it come and go. Can you feel it at rest, is it there all the time. Will over the counter meds give you relief. My first signs of PC was bone pain in June 2012. The pain was constant and it made it very hard to walk or sleep. It was like strained back muscle pain only a lot worse. Unfortunately at the time it was misdiagnosed and I was prescribed pain killers and anti-inflammatory drugs and ten days in bed. It was thought it was an old back injury (slipped disc 1991) that had flared up again. The pain returned with a vengeance at the end of December 2012 and it was so bad I felt like I wanted to cut my leg off to escape it; it seemed to be centred on the join of my left leg to my bondy and even with large doses of Codeine I couldn't sleep for more than two or three hours at a time. In January 2013 PC was finally diagnosed by biopsy; my PSA was 97.7 and scintigraphy scan showed the cancer in most of my bones. The largest site in my left hip and that was the source of the immense pain. My prostate is inoperable, I haven't had radiation therapy. I'm on Zoladex 10.8mg implant every three months. Bicalutamide 50mg daily. Prolia 60mg injection every six months. Plus assorted other drugs for high blood pressure and depression. I'm 60 this month. My PSA a couple of months ago was 0.24 and the bone pain has to a large extent abated or diminished to a sporadic dull ache but if someone shakes my hand it can hurt a lot. I could go on but...",

      "Content": "I sacked my first oncologist because the treatment he was insistent on giving me was not only close to 100 times the cost of an alternative but the one he was so insistent on giving me wasn't as efficacious as the alternative, oh, and his drug of choice very nearly killed me! He also told me the alternative, whilst good, wasn't available where we live. I went to a chemist the next day, asked for it and it was delivered the day after; I got my urologist to administer it and I suffered no adverse side effects. This oncologist told me he didn't believe me about the serious reactions I had (he said: \"they are very rare\") but since I was concerned, as a precaution, the next time he'd give me the drug, he would have me in hospital for three days and give me other drugs to counter the serious side effects. I could see me having heart failure and an emergency bypass all adding to my bill or perhaps dying on the table. As far as I'm concerned, his singular interest was money; I know other people who have also dismissed this particular oncologist. It's a total disgrace that this man has the power over lives. My new oncologist isn't money orientated, which is just as well because I have to pay for all my treatments and drugs etc.",

      "Content": "Sorry to hear of your problems Jerry, I'm in a similar boat. >My questions are basically how do you deal with pain that never completely goes away. As we age, pain is something we all experience to some degree or other. I've had back pain since 1991 that periodically puts me in bed for a week at a time. I take the medications prescribed and wait until it abates enough for be to get out of bed but it never goes away completely and it limits the things I can do. That's my lot so I try to \"grin and bare it\" so to speak. >How do you sleep and concentrate at work, etc. I am also taking strong narcotic pain medicines, which have done little to alleviate the pain. When I was diagnosed with PC and bone cancer I was in so much pain that work was out of the question and energy levels since have meant that I can no longer work. The fact that you are still able to work is possibly a good sign. >How do you deal with or prevent the depression? I'm on anti-depressants. They take the edge off it but, just like pain meds, it never goes away completely, the meds just dull it. That helps a lot. >How are you dealing with the fear of experiencing terrible pain for longs periods. Although I suspect my terrible bone pains will return one day I don't fear that. For me, fear is not a valid response because with fear, our mind is capable of generating multiple scenarios, some possible, some flights of fancy; speculation runs wild. Reality is often not as bad as what our mind can generate when feeding on fear. We are not our mind. It is very powerful but we command it, not the other way around. >Last, how do you come to grips with your mortality?????????? We know from a very early age that one day we will die. Having cancer can be viewed as a shortening of a life but we could just as easily still be hit by an unrelated bus today or tomorrow. Life is uncertain. It's pointless to worry and speculate about things we have no control over. Best of luck to you.",
