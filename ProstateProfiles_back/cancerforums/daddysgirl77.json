      "Content": "Originally Posted by HighlanderCFH Hi DG77, We're glad you found our forum because you'll get lots of support & helpful comments here. Does your dad have any history of prostate infections? I'm not sure if an infection would push the PSA that high, but it does definitely elevate the PSA. An enlarged prostate also causes a higher PSA, but probably not that high. Let's see what the others have to say. In the meantime, please share his biopsy results with us and we can offer further comment and hopeful encouragement. Good luck! Chuck Thank you for your response. My dad does get frequent kidney stones and kidney infections. I'm not sure if that would affect PSA or not.",

      "Content": "Hi everyone, I found this site searching for potential non-cancer causes of a PSA in the 300s. I will be accompanying my dad to his appointment tomorrow to find out the results of his biopsy, and I'm so worried for him. He had a PSA of over 300 and he has pain in his lower back. I'm very worried he may have advanced prostate cancer. I would appreciate any positive thoughts you can share, as well as any information about what I should ask at the appointment tomorrow regarding the biopsy results. I know that with the PSA levels being so high, chances are low that this is not cancer. However, I will continue to be hopeful. I was diagnosed with a very aggressive form of breast cancer at the age of 29, and will be cancer-free 10 years this year. I definitely believe in miracles and am praying for one for my dad. I can't imagine my life without him.",

      "Content": "So the news is not good. My dad definitely has advanced prostate cancer. Bone scan and CT scan being done this week to determine if it has metastasized, but the doctor thinks there is a good chance it has due to the pain my dad is experiencing in his back. Doctor started him on Degarelix- gave him one shot yesterday, and said that's for a month, then will be every six months. If there are mets, doctor said there is a new trial that is promising: LATITUDE Trial (addition of Abiraterone to standard hormone therapy.) He also said maybe radiation. We have a follow up on Monday so hopefully I will know more then. I am so upset about this. can't seem to think straight. I would appreciate any suggestions of additional questions to ask at the next appointment. Here is the pathology report from the biopsy (looks pretty bad to me, based on what I've read): Specimen - # of places - L (mm) - Diagnosis - Gleason Score - Grade Group - % tumor - Tumor L (mm) A.
