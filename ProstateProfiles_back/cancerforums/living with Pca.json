I am looking into a clinical trial at U of M but so far nothing more than what we are doing. U of M is looking into combining some drugs such as Zytiga and Xtandi but the trial is not accepting anyone yet. It has been a great past 5 years for new treatments and our oncologist is great at getting Steve on them, but not many has worked to slow the spreading and growing of his prostate cancer. We also went to John Hopkins cancer center and they gave the same opinion as how to treat. Thanks for the suggestion and we will think and talk about anymore any one can give us. Carol",

      "Content": "Just got back from CTCA in Ilnosis. They were very professional with a caring one on one feeling that I have not felt from our onocolgist. The cancer has advanced and is now extensive liver cancer plus his many bone cancer. They offered Carboplatin which only has a 20 % change of slowing down the growth of cancer in the liver but it was more than our home oncologist offered. The part that is great and is going to help the most is the making some one feel better while they are going through all of this. The help for all the side effects and the symptoms from the cancer that they addressed was very helpful. It made sense to me to make a person feel better will make them tolerate and have success with the treatments. So many times I have been told there is nothing that can be done and now I hear try this--if it does not work call me and I have more ideas. Such as the bad taste in the mouth which makes you not want to eat which leads to nutrition problems- they suggested Zinc 30 mg 1 two times a day and the next day the bad taste was less. He told them the nausea was bad and had to take Zofran --they added Ginger Max and it works. They addressed his blood cell counts and immune system and bone marrow function and vit deficiencies. Maybe they did not offer any more help for the cancer growing than anyone else but the way they work with a person to make they feel better and want to get up and live was wonderful. I hope everyone can find a cancer center who will work at keeping the patient living with Pca and not just surviving with treatments. Carol",

      "Content": "Hi chemo can suppresse the bone marrow that makes your blood. It can effects only parts of the blood. Steve had low WBC and has to get Neulasta injections that helps. Than his RBC dropped causing anemia and he got on the ESA apprise oncology program that is injections of Aranesp and it helps. Last time his Platelet counts were low but we reduced the chemo by 20% and that has kept his counts up. It is so hard to keep up with all the side effects and we do not always know if they are caused by chemo or cancer or meds he is getting with chemo or stress or anything else. I am so glad we have a good oncologist and with my research we are able to keep side effects low. I try to stay in front of all side effects so we can react early. So yes low RBC is a side effect of chemo but can be helped. Carol",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by Daughter79 Hello all, My Dad (67) went for a PSA test in 2010 and it came back at over 60 and he was diagnosed with prostate cancer. Following a course of hormone injections and radiotherapy he was given the all clear and put on annual check ups. His PSA remained below 1. He began to feel ill in 2014 and his PSA went up to 9. He had various scans and has been told it's spread 'slightly' to his bones (surrounding area so I'm guessing pelvis?). His last PSA was at 22 and he's on his second hormone injection. Latest PSA result is 25.8 (after one months treatment). Basically - I'm scared about what I've read about Metastatic prostate cancer and don't really understand it. My parents come back from his specialist appointments full of positive news about them being able to control it for 'years' ... but is this true? His results in 2010 were T2 and Gleason of 4+3 - please can someone explain this to me? And will these have changed now it's metastatic? Also - does metastatic mean it's advanced/terminal? I've read so many positive prostate cancer stories ... but it all seems to change once it's spread. Can it spread 'slightly' and be controlled/cured/offer a long life expectancy? Or does the fact it's spread at all ... change things significantly? I'd appreciate any words of wisdom and I apologise in advance if I've not understood the terminology of things or spelt things wrong Many thanks Hi I feel educating your self about prostate cancer is the best. Get on the computor and look up words. Get on you tube and put in advanced prostate cancer there are so many experts who give good opinions. With the advancement in new medications and treatments they can give men years to live, but not everyone response to the treatment the same way so some get less. Go with your parents to appointments sometimes, the oncologist will not mind. Get copies of reports and look up what they mean. Be an advocate for him. Keep records and remind them of appointments. My husbands Psa is 99.5. For five years I have been in the back ground but helping all I can. I hope you get involved and keep \"living with Pca\" Carol",

      "Content": "Hi Talked with oncologist and he would not give Jevtana every week. He states it has not been approved to give like that and he did not want to try. So Steve got 20 % less dose. He does feel better. The side effects were bad first two cycles and the third cycle the side effects were about half. But He got medications for low WBC / low hgb/ steroids/ IV nausea meds. HIs PSA went from 300 down to 99 on full dose and we get a PSA in two weeks to see if reducing the dose still keeps PSA down. Does he get the Neulasta shot the next day for low wbc? That can causes some pain. Let me know what his PSA was at atart of Jevtana and what it is now please. Steve only got 3 Taxotere doses and PSA went from 597 down to 99 first cycle than back up to 300 by thrid cycle. Thank you Carol",

I had taxotere and first cycle brought Psa down but the next two cycles my psa went up so they say it did not work. Now I am on Cabazitaxel/ Javtana and the first cycle brought psa down and having my psa checked from 2nd cycle in another week. I have met some who got chemo and as long as they were on the chemo psa was down but as soon as the chemo was over in weeks psa came back up. My bone mets is spreading fast so I am hoping for some slowing down of the cancer but that chemo sure is a hard thing to take. Hope someone can share that chemo worked for them by keeping psa down for awhile after treatments were over. Steve",
