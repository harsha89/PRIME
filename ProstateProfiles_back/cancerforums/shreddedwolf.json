      "Content": "Hey everyone! I am new to this forum. First off thank you all, after reading a few posts on this forums it has really given me further insight about prostate cancer and bone mets. I am currently undergoing chemotherapy Docetaxel, 6 total cycles every 3 weeks also with lupron shot every 3 months. I am on my 4th cycle and currently my PSA levels are 0.071. I am feeling fine just sometimes worried about whats going to happen. Recently about 1 week ago they found something in my Appendix and they said it may be a second cancer. I did further research online and a few have said chemotherapy can form a second cancer. I have an appointment with a surgeon who will check on that. I am going to UCSF for my treatment. I am worried but am willing to fight this fight and have a lot of love around me Thanks guys!",

      "Content": "Hey all, Hope everyone is having a good day. I have finished my chemo I did 5/6 cycles. We had to stop due to pneumonitis developing from the chemo. I was on docetaxel and am taking lupron shots every 3 months. I am 56 years old my gleason score is 4 + 4 = 8 on all the categories. Roughly 80-90% on all of them as well (don't know what this means) My PSA was 0.071 then went to 0.163 then went to 0.309 and now is 0.5 I know this is low but does slow blips of rising PSA like this mean anything? This is my only concern. Thank you hope you all have a great day!",

      "Content": "Today I walked in for my 6/6th chemotherapy treatment when doctors found out I have developed pneumonitis from the treatment. We didn't continue the treatment as it would have made it worse and now I am taking 70mg of prednisone daily for the pneumonitis. Anyone experienced this? Is this something I should be worried about? Thanks guys hope all is well",
