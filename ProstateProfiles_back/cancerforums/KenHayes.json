      "Content": "First time on forum, just wanted to meet up with others in the same boat, share my initial outcome from surgery and see what you folks think. Diagnosed June, 2015, 2 of 12 cores showed cancer, 5% and 10%, Gleason 9 (4+5), had surgery in August, Seminal vesicles impacted, and one lymph node of 24 had a VERY small number of TINY, TINY (doc's words) micro cells. Initial PSA was 10.9. Got my first PSA today post-surgery, came back at <.019 - which to me (as a Gleason 9) makes me very encouraged, and tells me it was caught early. I know I'll be monitored closely for the rest of my life, but am I on track with that thinking? Thanks, Ken",
