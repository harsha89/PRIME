      "Content": "A friend had a test in July when his PSA went from 2 a couple of years ago to 10. He cleaned out his diet and started on a regiment of herbs and this week his PSA results are 6.38. Any ideas as to what this could mean? He is considering to have a biopsy. Can anyone suggest a good doctor in Charlotte NC or Duke University area? Or Atlanta, GA? Thank you",
