      "Content": "Exactly 11 weeks after surgery, and 10 weeks post catheter removal. I've learned that progress should only be measured in the number of pads used. I started with 6-8 max pads a day and in the last 3 weeks switched to the thin liners and now one will last the day. Unless I walk, where I will soak one and into my underwear. But we walk fast and far and if I cut it short I may not leak at all, or very little. I've been dry at night since about week 3. The thing that I was so uncertain about is whether my recovery was normal because there is so much mixed information out there. Also, after finding this forum I see that there is a tremendous recovery range. I've changed to the Mayo kegel process in the last 3 days and I think it's helping further. It just makes more sense to me. On ED, I've been on a Canadian generic of Ciallis (20mg cut into 4) once a day so 5 mg a day. I've yet to have an erection and I had a perfectly functioning unit that always performed on command before the surgery. I think I have less drive too. Bought the pump and found it painful so haven't used it a second time. After 3 weeks in, I realized I should begin documenting notes about things in general, how much leakage, how many pads, coffee or not, wine or not, enough sleep, etc. The notes do help to clear confusion afterward. I wish I would have found this forum sooner. It's helped to answer a lot of questions. Good luck to all!",

Coffee is another, I'm a half-caf, one cup coffee drinker now. I don't think it had nearly the same effect that alcohol has on me but the information I was given by my doctor said to give it up.",

      "Content": "Thanks for the feedback guys. Although I'm drying out, I'm not dry. I think it will be a couple more months before I can do anything without the worry of leakage. The ED thing is an unknown. I'm confident I'll return to normal but I think that will take several more months. The big thing is not knowing what others have really experienced and not knowing what is \"normal\" because you really can't nail an answer down talking to the doctors. And that's what I find so helpful about this forum.",
