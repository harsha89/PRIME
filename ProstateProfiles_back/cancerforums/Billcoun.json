      "Content": "Radical prostatectomy 6/2011 Gleason grade 3+3 Tumor - pT2c Involved less than 5% of entire gland No perineural invasion No seminal vesicle invasion No positive margins Because PSA was only 4.1 at diagnosis, lymph nodes were not biopsied PSA has been checked every 6 months. All PSA's were 0.00 until 10/26/12 when it was 0.01. PSA continued to raise about 1/100th of a point every 12 to 18 months. PSA on 6/2015 was 0.03. Urologist said he wasn't too concerned since it was increasing at such a slow rate. 0.1 is the cut-off point he uses to qualify as a reoccurrence. Then in July 2015, I had inguinal hernia surgery which can be caused by open radical prostatectomy surgery in about 15-20% of the cases. I recovered exceptionally well from surgery with very little pain or swelling. Then in 12/2015 I had my 6th month PSA - and I was totally shocked to see that it jumped (doubled)from .03 to .06. This sounds like an aggressive tumor and my post op's indicated a 3 + 3. What do you think? I haven't discussed this with my urologist yet, but this sudden jump in PSA doesn't sound good. My Gleason score was 3 + 3= 6 at biopsy and following surgery and my post op data was so good. The only risk factor seemed to be that it was a pT2c tumor that was in both lobes. I'm wondering if the surgery disturbed the area where the cancer cells existed that was causing the low psa or if the tumor mutated to a higher gleason score. Dr. Myers from Virginia, whose website I go to frequently, talks about cancer cells being dormant or in remission and their always being a possibility of recurrence, but I wasn't expecting this with a 3 + 3 gleason score. I know you guys don't have all the answers, but let me know your views on this issue and what to expect. It helps talking to people who had prostate cancer. I suppose my next step is salvage radiation when it reaches 0.1. But I'm wondering if the cells are still in the prostate bed. Do you get sick with radiation, like chemotherapy and does it usually cure or just prolong. Thanks Bill",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by HighlanderCFH Hi Bill, It sure is extremely unusual to see a possible recurrence with a Gleason 6. One thing to keep in mind is that, according to medical research, it is almost impossible for a Gleason 6 to metastasize. It is also supposed to be virtually impossible for a Gleason 6 cell to survive outside of the prostate. So, if there is a recurrence, it is seemingly a 1 in a million situation. As for the 3+3 progressing to a higher Gleason grade, that does not happen. However a cancer cell forms, it remains at that same Gleason grade. Is it possible that the pathologist failed to identify another (higher grade) tumor during the post-op exam under the scope? In any case, if it is a few Gleason 6 cells hanging around the prostate bed, radiation should take care of them. Also keep in mind that your PSA is still not quite at the point where recurrence is definite. It takes 2 or 3 consecutive readings of 0.1 for recurrence to officially be declared. So it is still possible that there is nothing happening in that regard. Good luck! Chuck Thank you both for responding. I read the statistics on 3 + 3 gleason cancers as well and know that they normally don't grow outside the prostate, so there is a possibility there were some 3+4 cells in the prostate that were not biopsied. I read somewhere that they can't examine all the cells of the prostate. They merely section it up and examine tissue from each section. Hopefully, with such a low PSA, the cells are still in the prostate bed and radiation should take care of it. I was glad to hear of Jim's favorable experience with radiation. It gives me hope that I still might go back into a remission. However, I don't know if anyone who has had cancer is completely \"out of the woods\". One question that I still have is in regard to the hernia surgery which involved the bed of the prostate. If there were a few cancers cells left in the bed of the prostate that was producing the slow rise in PSA, could disturbing this area, cause the cancer to start growing more rapidly? Or was this just a mere coincidence of the two events? It probably doesn't make any difference in regard to my prognosis, but I'm just wondering if anyone has heard of this before. Also, do you consider a rise from .03 to .06 in 6 months an indication that this cancer is now highly aggressive? This is another thing I can't quite comprehend - how a gleason 6 or even a gleason 7 can multiple that rapidly all of a sudden. Again, thank you both for responding. Battling this disease alone, can pull you down emotionally and talking to others who have travelled down this same path helps so much.",

He is not compliant with PSA testing and bases his behavior on what he sites as very unlikely to progress based on the science. I have included a link which actually is supportive of Active Surveillance. However the first two bullet points have significant relevance to your situation. If your pathology is accurate it would place you in an extremely uncommon position. One possibility could be that you are one of the very rare people that have biological grade progression, Gleason 3 cells giving rise to Gleason 4 or 5 progeny. As noted in the attached document this can occur overtime but is very uncommon. Did you have a second opinion on your pathology? I did not have an official second opinion (4+3-7) but it would be a consideration given the situation that you find yourself in. Good Luck, Very interesting, please keep updating Thank you for responding and for the link on gleason 6. No, I have not had a second opinion on the pathology. I am familiar with the study of 1000+ gleason 6 cases where none of them metastasized to the bones and very few even left the prostate or went to lymph nodes. I mentioned this study to my urologist in June/2015 and he stated generally that is the case, but we are beginning to find out that the genetic makeup of the tumor itself, probably plays a significant role in recurrence. We just don't know. So apparently, all gleason 6 cancers may not be created equal. These may be the rare exceptions referred to in the link that you sent. There is also the possibility that there were higher grade cells in the prostate that just didn't get biopsied. It is my understanding that they section the prostate and take a sample from each section and examine it. It is unlikely that there would be gleason 4 and 5 cells in the prostate since my pre-surgery PSA was only 4.1, but I guess it is possible. Cancer doesn't always play by the rules, probably because we don't fully understand it. I personally think the key lies in the genetic makeup of the tumor itself. I think some of these cells may have markers that allow them to mutate and upgrade in order to survive. This could explain why cancer doesn't always follow the rules. My post-op pathology was very favorable. I plugged in these numbers to the nomograms predicting the chances of recurrence, and my chances for recurrence were very, very small. But here I am, 4 1/2 years post surgery and my PSA is rising fairly rapidly. One question I have that no one, including my urologist will probably be able to answer is - why did these gleason 6 cancer cells which were behaving so benignly for the last 4 years, suddenly decide to take on a more aggressive pattern after inguinal hernia surgery which involved the bed of the prostate. Could disturbing these cells cause them to mutate and take on a new form of aggressiveness in order to survive? Or was this just a coincidence? Thank you again for the input and the link. I truly appreciate everyone's support. I'll keep you posted. [",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by HighlanderCFH Hi Bill, Welcome to the PC forum. And a thank you to Di for moving you over here so you can get more attention. Your case is amazingly similar to my own, even down to the timeframe. I was DXd in Aug. 2011 and met the robot in November. It would seem very highly unlikely that you are having a true recurrence since you had such a low risk type of PC, with a small involvement and with no PMs. From what I can see, the surgeon did not check any lymph nodes? Even so, it is probably HIGHLY unlikely that any would have been positive. Sometimes a patient will have metastasis even with negative margins, usually due to perineural invasion -- but, fortunately, you did NOT have perineural invasion. It is VERY strongly suspected that Gleason 6 cells CANNOT SURVIVE outside of the prostate and virtually never metastasize, so you will probably be just fine. The only thing I can think of is if some cancer cells were left behind in the prostate area -- but this is, as I noted, very unlikely because they usually cannot survive without the nourishment in the interior of the prostate. Higher grade Gleason cells CAN live outside the prostate because they are advanced enough to survive on their own. But Gleason 6 cells simply cannot (as far as they know) live outside the prostate. It is very possible that you are just seeing meaningless microfluxiations of the PSA readings -- which is a pretty normal thing. This is a reason why Mayo Clinic does not use the ultrasensitive PSA test, which your doctor apparently is using. They can cause a lot of unnecessary anxiety. Also, regarding official recurrence, I believe it is generally considered to be factual at the 0.2 level, not 0.1. At least, they do not usually begin considering salvage radiation until it has hit 0.2 on two consecutive PSA tests. So, the basic bottom line, as this uneducated patient sees it, is that you are probably just fine and are just seeing those microchanges in PSA levels -- which can still happen even without a prostate. Remember, that, according to the STANDARD PSA test, you are still a zero/undetectable. What has your doctor said about these ultrasensitive readings? Take care -- you're going to be just fine, Chuck Thanks for responding so promptly. My doctor was trained at Mayo Clinic. He generally interprets these ultrasensitive readings as essentially zero until they reach 0.1, but did mention that when these readings increase steadily and consistently in one direction without fluctuations, they could very well lead to a biochemical reoccurrence. At this stage of the game, he is uncertain and thinks they still might be due to benign tissue left that grows over time. If the PSA would fluctuate such as being .04 at one time, then .02 at sometime later, this would be more consistent with the microfluctuations you referred to in the ultrasensitive test, but mine doesn't jump around. It has been rising consistently but slowly. He mentioned that the ultrasensitive test can cause unnecessary worrying for people like myself. At my last visit in 6/2014, he sensed that I was anxious and worried and mentioned that from his experience with prostate cancer, he didn't think that I was going to die from prostate cancer, but neither did he say that he didn't think I wouldn't have a chemical reoccurrence. He mentioned that if it did reoccur, he felt the radiation would take care of it. He frequently mentions my favorable pathology report and the Gleason score of 6 being in my favor. The reason he didn't biopsy any lymph nodes, is because my pre-surgery PSA was so low. One thing I failed to mention is that prior to surgery, they did a PCA3 test and mine was positive. It was wasn't particularly high, but it was positive. As you have probably gathered by now, I am a worrier, and every time the PSA rises a little, I get anxious. Thanks again for the response and the encouragement. It helps lessen the load.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by HighlanderCFH Hi Bill, Welcome to the PC forum. And a thank you to Di for moving you over here so you can get more attention. Your case is amazingly similar to my own, even down to the timeframe. I was DXd in Aug. 2011 and met the robot in November. It would seem very highly unlikely that you are having a true recurrence since you had such a low risk type of PC, with a small involvement and with no PMs. From what I can see, the surgeon did not check any lymph nodes? Even so, it is probably HIGHLY unlikely that any would have been positive. Sometimes a patient will have metastasis even with negative margins, usually due to perineural invasion -- but, fortunately, you did NOT have perineural invasion. It is VERY strongly suspected that Gleason 6 cells CANNOT SURVIVE outside of the prostate and virtually never metastasize, so you will probably be just fine. The only thing I can think of is if some cancer cells were left behind in the prostate area -- but this is, as I noted, very unlikely because they usually cannot survive without the nourishment in the interior of the prostate. Higher grade Gleason cells CAN live outside the prostate because they are advanced enough to survive on their own. But Gleason 6 cells simply cannot (as far as they know) live outside the prostate. It is very possible that you are just seeing meaningless microfluxiations of the PSA readings -- which is a pretty normal thing. This is a reason why Mayo Clinic does not use the ultrasensitive PSA test, which your doctor apparently is using. They can cause a lot of unnecessary anxiety. Also, regarding official recurrence, I believe it is generally considered to be factual at the 0.2 level, not 0.1. At least, they do not usually begin considering salvage radiation until it has hit 0.2 on two consecutive PSA tests. So, the basic bottom line, as this uneducated patient sees it, is that you are probably just fine and are just seeing those microchanges in PSA levels -- which can still happen even without a prostate. Remember, that, according to the STANDARD PSA test, you are still a zero/undetectable. What has your doctor said about these ultrasensitive readings? Take care -- you're going to be just fine, Chuck Thanks for responding so promptly. My doctor was trained at Mayo Clinic. He generally interprets these ultrasensitive readings as essentially zero until they reach 0.1, but did mention that when these readings increase steadily and consistently in one direction without fluctuations, they could very well lead to a biochemical reoccurrence. At this stage of the game, he is uncertain and thinks they still might be due to benign tissue left that grows over time. If the PSA would fluctuate such as being .04 at one time, then .02 at sometime later, this would be more consistent with the microfluctuations you referred to in the ultrasensitive test, but mine doesn't jump around. It has been rising consistently but slowly. He mentioned that the ultrasensitive test can cause unnecessary worrying for people like myself. At my last visit in 6/2014, he sensed that I was anxious and worried and mentioned that from his experience with prostate cancer, he didn't think that I was going to die from prostate cancer, but neither did he say that he didn't think I wouldn't have a chemical reoccurrence.

      "Content": "Prostate cancer diagnosis - 3/2011 Prostatectomy - 6/2011 Pre-surgery PSA- 4.12 Biopsy - 2 of 12 cores positive (Gleason 3+3) Surgery pathology report: adenocarcinoma, Gleason grade 3=3+6, Primary tumor-pT2c, extraprostatic extension-neg., perineural invasion-neg., seminal vesicle invasion-neg., no positive margins, malignancy involves less than 5% of prostate gland, lymph nodes-pNX (not done), benign neck bladder tissue. PSA 9/2011 - 0.00, PSA 10/2012- 0.01, PSA 11/2013 - 0.03, PSA 12/2014 - 0.04 In spite of having a fairly favorable surgery pathology report, my PSA appears to be rising about 1/100th of a point each year. Although anything under 0.1 is considered by many sources as undetectable, I am becoming very concerned that it is a biochemical reoccurrence. The good thing is that the increase seems to be rather slow, at least for now. My urologist informed me that 0.1 is the magic number where we consider radiation therapy. I'm not there yet, but is there anything I can be doing to slow down the PSA doubling time? I started drinking pomegranate juice and just ordered several antioxidants (Lycopene and Resveratrol Defense + Vitamin C). I also increased my Omega-3 fish oil to 1000 mg daily. My urologist isn't into supplements and I just want to do everything I can to slow the cancer down before radiation is recommended. Let me know your views and anything else I might try. Thanks.",
