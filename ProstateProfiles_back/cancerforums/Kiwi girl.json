    "Content": "My partner had a radical prostatectomy 5months ago. It was not possible to do a nerve sparing surgery therefore impotence is a real concern for him. We have asked different Drs many questions and always seem to get different answers. Is it possible to get an erection again after such aggressive surgery? I understand he would need some form of help achieving,but is it out of the question? has any one had success with Viagra? While it certainly does not bother me and I am just so grateful that he is healthy again it really is getting him down and playing with his mind. Any advice would be greatly appreciated",
