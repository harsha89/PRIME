Last year, PC-SPES was found to be contaminated with various prescription drugs (not, of course, shown on the label) and was banned. So whatever effect it had was from the prescription drugs, not the herbs. IOW, it was a scam. AFAIK, there has been no clinical trial of Prostasol reported in any professional peer-reviewed medical publication. For that reason alone, I would steer well clear of it. There are conscienceless thieves out there who wish to exploit the desperation of many cancer patients, and will do just about anything to do so.
