      "Content": "Good day all. I had my 2nd biopsy last month showing 3 cores ASAP (small foci of atypical glands suspicious but not diagnostic of carcinoma) and 2 cores HGPIN out of 30 cores, 1 with adjacent ASAP. This was instigated 2 years ago as I was having urinary symptoms (frequency, urgency, nocturia) for some years, I was referred to urologist due to rising psa (9.5 July 2015, 32 June and Dec 2016, 46 March 2017, 33 May 2017, 39 July 2017). Results of multiparametric 3T MRI done 2 years ago were 'PIRADS 2, peripheral zone prostatitis, mild BPH on central gland with prostate volume 30cc, no lesions'. Repeat MRI done this year before my 2nd biopsy showed same 'PIRADS rating 2, no focal lesions, but with moderate prostatomegaly with BPH in central gland, prostate volume 49cc, PZ prostatitis'. Due to rising psa, my first transperineal saturation biopsy was done on Aug 2016 with all 36 cores benign, bone scan and PET scan using gallium 68 PSMA done early this year showed no metastasis. However, my rapid psa velocity (rising 4 times in a year), free psa 4.3 and phi (prostate health index) 97.6 suggest most likely aggressive carcinoma progression. Throughout this time, I am not treated for prostatitis, BPH and noncarcinomic biopsy. I am 57 years old, 72kg, with healthy lifestyle, no other medical issues and no family history of cancer. I am seeing my urologist in 2 weeks time to discuss my recent biopsy diagnosis. Thanks a lot, would really appreciate your thoughts of this. John",
