      "Content": "Thank you very much, @Fourlegsgood. I do not really know that much about his cancer, but no, he doesn't have diabetes. However, he is overweight (not morbidly, but weighs something like 230lbs - ~100 kg and he's like 1.83 tall). He has blood tests often and I am certain that they would've shown if he has diabetes or not, so I'm glad he doesn't. My mom is buying all kinds of stuff, but none of them are harmful, really - shiitake, maitake and lingzhi mushrooms and the doctor has prescribed him vitamin D and some other pills. AND: The doc just told us on the phone that it's most likely because of his enlarged prostate and he wasn't surprised at all that it has happened. He prescribed him something and dad's going to start taking it tomorrow. Treatment, as far as I know, is hormone therapy every 2-3 weeks, however he's also had a surgery, but I am not sure what for. However, I'm very glad that the cancer probably hasn't metastised. Thank you for your posts!",

      "Content": "My father has prostate cancer and recently he's had swelling in one of his leg. He has a catheter and a tube on one side of his belly which, I think, gets rid of the leftover urine. He takes antibiotics, vitamins and some supplements. Can the swelling be because of the medication? He has a doctor's appointment for Saturday. I don't think he has an advanced cancer and I really hope he doesn't. What should we be worried about? The swelling is in the leg on the side of the second tube (not the catheter). A weird thing is that if he walks for a little bit (even though he gets exhausted easily) the swelling becomes lighter. I read about metastasis and I'm scared that it might be it. What do you think? EDIT: I found out he's been taking Ciprofloxacin. Could that be a valid reason for the swelling?",

      "Content": "Currently undergoing hormone therapy, reevaluation every three months and has two catheters. They have mentioned something about changing the therapy to taking some sort of pills, but none of us are sure what this means. Could it mean that the cells have become resistant or is it just another way of treatment? Can a metastatic cancer go into remission? Thank you in advance.",
