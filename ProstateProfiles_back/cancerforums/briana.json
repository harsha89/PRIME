      "Content": "First time poster, almost 3 weeks out from davinci. Would welcome some feedback on incontinence and how long it took folks. Given my age I was hoping to be out of the diapers quickly but at almost 3 weeks I continue to leak heavily. Am able to make it through the night. Went back work last week(I sit at a desk) and doing the kegels. I know it is marathon and not a sprint. Hard to be patient. Been lurking for a couple of weeks, have found the forum very helpful/informative. Thanks, Brian",
