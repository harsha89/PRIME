      "Content": "Thanks for y'all's replies. A bit about me: I'm 57. Began having problems with psa in 2007 when I had a psa of 7. Did a round of antibiotics at that time, the psa went down to 6. Had a 12 core biopsy, all negative. psa has hovered around 4 ever since until approx March of this past year when it was 6 and change with an enlarged prostate ( GP said grade 2?). Went on a 30 day course of antibiotics and it dropped to 5 something and was referred to a urologist. The urologist was great, took a detailed history, got all my old records, examined means dre was unremRkable. Waited another month and did a repeat psa which came back at 7.6 with a free psa % of 0.07. My doc had this look on his face when he told me the results. I'm nervously awaiting the biopsy in August.",

      "Content": "As I wait for my biopsy on August 11 all kinds of questions come to mind. 1) when my urologist talks about my psa (7.6) he qualifies it by saying \"on Avodart.\" what's that mean. 2) I see the term \"positive margins\" talked about. What does that refer to? I'm trying to not get worked up in anticipation of the biopsy, but easier said than done.",

      "Content": "The waiting is terrible! I'm not sure how many cores they'll take and I haven't even thought about the saturation biopsy. I have thought of telling my urologist to take as many cores as possible so as to not miss anything. Anyone have thoughts on having local anesthetic versus general anesthesia? The biopsy I had in 2007 wasn't all that bad, as I recall. I appreciate all the support and advice!",

      "Content": "Hi all, looking for some insight. I'm 57 years old, had psa done in March that was 6.1( on Avodart) Negative dre and went on 30 days of antibiotics, psa dropped to 5.6. Was referred to a urologist. He examined me and still negative dre. Repeated the psa may. It was 7.2 (on Avodart) with a free psa % of 0.07. Not sure what all this means, but my urologist had \"a look\" on his face when he shared the results with me. I'm scheduled for a biopsy on August. 11. Can anyone offer any insight?",
