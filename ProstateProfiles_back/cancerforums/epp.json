      "Content": "I live in Canada so my post treatment option question is specific to Canada. I don't have the financial resources to search out private post surgery care out of country. Brief history: had my prostate removed 6 years ago at age 55. I was told it was my best option and I should make a full recovery \"no problem \". I didn't question my treatment and even though I had doubts I went ahead with the surgery. Viagra & Cialas didn't work for me and an implant would only give me a 3 inch erection. Injections do work but my erection is substantially less than what it was (length & girth) evidently this is normal (no one told me that beforehand). So my question is ... is there plastic surgery options available in Canada that could help me ? Mentally I'm a mess most days, barely a day goes by that I don't regret having the surgery. I can barely look at my penis. If I was a female who wanted to transition to male , that a penis could be constructed, correct ? I'm not getting much help from my doctors, so that's why I reaching out here in hopes finding some information I can take to them. Any information is much appreciated. Please",

I'm a few days from 58th birthday, psa was 8.2 in 2011, my last check up a few weeks ago psa was 0. I left my doctor's office in tears. Nerves were sparred & various therapies have been tried with little success.",
