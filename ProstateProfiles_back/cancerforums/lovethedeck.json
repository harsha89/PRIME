      "Content": "It was the urologist who told us the stage T2b. And no, he had never had a PSA test and never a biopsy...ever. Problems with urination started two or three years ago....kept getting worse....went to regular physician in March....who found his PSA at 51.7 and sent him to urologist. Sometimes it is still hard to believe this is really happening. The biopsy looks so bad.....and he feels so good......so far. We both feel we have very good doctors and trust them....so that is not a problem. I have just researched so much lately....and wonder how long this \"good\" can last.",

      "Content": "My husband was diagnosed last May with prostate cancer after his biopsy showed 12 of 12 cores positive for cancer 8 cores were 3+4=7 (30-100%) 3 cores were 4+3=7 (60-100%) 1 core was 4+5=9 (90%) tertiary pattern 5 in 3 cores bone scan showed two small spots on lower back and shoulder also found in lymph nodes beginning PSA was 51.7 He started the Lupron shot for every 4 months...has had two. He had 40 radiation treatments also is getting a calcium infusion every 4 to 8 weeks to strengthen bones current PSA is 0.1 age 74 Doctor said his stage was T2b......but I thought since the cancer is not confined to the prostate...it was stage 4 ???? He feels fine with very few side effects. I know this is bad....but how bad? What should we expect?",

      "Content": "We were told the cancer WAS in the lymph nodes. BUT, all doctors kept asking if he had had any old injuries. And because of the small size and no pain....the bone spots were not radiated....only the prostate and lymph nodes got radiation. He had another bone scan yesterday.....waiting for the new result to see how things look after 7 months and radiation and Lupron. Guess we'll see......",
