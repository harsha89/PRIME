      "Content": "Hi Vince, Sorry to welcome you to the forum, I hope having your RALP behind you is giving you some well earned peace of mind. My experience was similar to yours (please see my signature below), and have shared in a previous post: I opted for surgery given my age, overall health (good), and like many others hoped to hold the radiation card for the future. After surgery with final not-so-good pathology in hand, my surgeon advised we would be discussing adjuvant radiation at my first post-op PSA appointment. Three months later the wife and I were thrilled to see PSA results were <0.01, and surprised when surgeon suggested holding off on radiation plans until next visit. His rational was there is much healing taking place at this time after surgery, and given the \"0\" PSA level his reco was to hold off radiation plans until next PSA reading. If the needle moved, we'd proceed with what would still be considered adjuvant therapy (vs salvage). Since then, we've been blessed with three PSA readings of <0.01 and have since moved the \"R\" card to my back pocket. I can appreciate your disappointment at the margins, been there. You've been treated at a leading PC facility, and it sounds like they're making an informed call that your positive margin is not a concern. As others may comment, this happens more often than you might expect. I'm assuming you've been told your PC was organ confined (might want to add this to your signature)? My reco would be to follow the experts advice; worst case if your PSA numbers indicate activity you will still have the option of adjuvant radiation. I was very lucky with continence, never had an issue (ok, exception for too much beer + good belly laughs). They did have to scoop wide around one nerve, so ED definitely present but every month still seems to be getting better. Best of luck with that August appointment, Groot",

      "Content": "Dear FB's & FS's, Hoping you won't mind if I vent a bit, life's been a roller coaster lately, assume many of you can relate. The first arc of that \"circle of life\" is a bitter one. I lost my 73 year old sister last week after a nine year courageous fight against endometrial cancer. I'm preparing for her life ceremony today, truly one of the nicest people New Jersey had. News flash for anyone on this site: cancer, of any kind, sucks. Alas, the circle also has a shiny side. My wife and I just became first time grandparents, a beautiful, healthy baby girl. She brought us all, sister included, much happiness during a difficult time. Between all of the above, I get a call from my older brother who's been battling mental illness most of his adult life. His PSA results came back over 5, and needs to make an appointment with a urologist. Oh boy, here we go.... Aside from being a bit dizzy from all the above, think I'm doing ok with my PC battle. I go for my 3+ year PSA test next month. This is my first one year stretch between tests, but with everything going on have not had much time to think about that G9.... Forum bothers and sisters, stay strong and keep up the good fight! And thanks for letting me blow off some steam!!!",

My experience was very similar to yours, very smooth surgical procedure followed with a disappointing path report (Gleason upgrade, IDC, pos margin...see my sig below) not what you want to hear. But hang in there, as MF suggested there is a good chance your surgery was a success. My surgeon said we'd be planning AR when I came back for first post-op PSA checkup, but when level came back <0.01 he suggested to wait another 3 months to allow the healing to continue. I'm now out 18 months and hopefully still in the \"zero\" club (getting tested next week). I can't say how your treatment plans might be affected by your IDC, but given this showed up on my path report too, will see if I can get my docs perspective. Happy to share if I learn anything useful. Best of luck to you, and Keegle On!",

      "Content": "Hi Mark, Given my situation was similar to yours, thought I would share my experience. My biopsy came in as a 4+3=7 and had a positive DRE, so urologist was clear action was required. I was 58 at the time, and was advised I could go either way (surgery vs. RT). If I was older, he would have advised RT, younger would have been surgery. After doing much homework (as you're doing now), I opted for surgery. One of the reasons I went this way was to hold onto the option of future RT to the pelvic area, if needed (i.e. for PC BCR or other pelvic issues like colon, etc). RT technology is constantly improving, so this may not be a factor for you, easy enough for you to discuss with the experts. As other FB's have shared with you, it looks like you've caught this aggressive issue early and you have an excellent chance to be cured. Following surgery, my pathology report bumped me up to a 5+4=9 which was a big surprise. The plan was then to follow up with ART, pending my 3 month PSA results. Fortunately, with PSA <0.01 the ART plans were put on hold, and now at 2 years+ still holding at <0.01 (yay!). I've been remarkably lucky with continence, no issues other than occasional dribble (good beer+good laughs). ED not bad, sildenafil keeps the equipment working just fine (did have to give up partial nerve). One regret I have is I did not have genomic testing done. If you follow DJ's sticky you can get a good idea of the information you can gain, another topic worth discussing with the experts. Hang in there, keep doing your homework, and best of luck to you with whatever course of action you choose! Please keep us posted.",

Fully functional with Sildenafil, sometimes without but that took more than a year of healing. For what it's worth, my surgeon told me to expect this up front (due to nodule location during DRE). I appreciated he was talking about my situation, not \"general stats\" and one of the reasons I went with him. And just curious, do both surgeons plan up front on taking any lymph nodes?

You've already gotten what I consider good advice from our FB&S's, all eyes on that next PSA. My path report had a few similarities to yours, and I was on a similar course to yours for follow up treatment. In my case, my 3mo PSA came in at <0.01 which was a pleasant surprise. The bigger surprise was my uro suggested holding off the ART initiation until next PSA, saying this would still be considered adjuvant. My wife and I did struggle with this, as we were very prepared to \"hit this hard and early with all we've got\". We did decide to follow his advice, and so far we've kept additional treatments on the shelf. Please keep us posted as you learn more, and if you have any more questions we're here to help.

What is their track record for patients maintaining continence? Surgical technique is critical in these two areas, not to mention the most critical complete removal of any suspect tissue.
