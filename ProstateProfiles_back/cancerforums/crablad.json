      "Content": "My husband was diagnosed with prostate cancer in 1996, PSA 44 Gleason 6. The cancer was on its way out of the seminal vertical. Radiation was the only alternative at that time and he had 38 treatments. Then caxidex, protocols with alter viruses, zytiga, zometa, provenge, taxotere and probably more protocols that I can remember. BUT today his PSA has gone form 187 to 26 and holding. That is still a high number but he has no pain and is working like he used to. So for everyone...there is hope and lots of options. At 72 he still looks good and works hard.",

They started him on hormone therapy and after 6 weeks his psa fell to 139 and then after another 6 weeks it is down to 39. I am very glad to see the numbers drop but does this mean they will go back up faster as well and the cells become resistant? I have so many questions just not sure where to start?? My husband was diagnosed at the age of 54 PSA 44, he is now 72 and his PSA is 30. We have had it go up and down, up and down. He has had probably every type of meds available plus three clinical trials. When his PSA went to 187 he started chemo with taxotere which worked great, some side effects. He is now on Xtandi...we will see how that goes. He is still strong and works hard...so there are lots of options...just find a good oncologist.",
