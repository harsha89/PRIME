      "Content": "Originally Posted by Fairwind When considering robo-surgery, you want a surgeon who has done 300 or more, is comfortable doing them, and can show you a long list of successful outcomes. ... My surgeon is one of the foremost in the USA. He is rapidly closing in on 2000 davinci operations. However, regardless of the talent and skill of the surgeon, each person's body can react quite differently than the majority of patients. It is unexplained why my heart beat went out of control. Has nothing to do with the surgeon. The same for the pain in my groin. I have had two operations affecting my pelvis: hernias and the Davinci. Maybe a nerve was affected by the combination of both opperations, an anomolous effect, not predictable. It is interesting that I saw at least 15 people from the same surgeon who underwent Davinci. All walked normally except me. I was a bit envious.",

      "Content": "The following are my side effects of the Davinci surgery: 1. Episodes of fast heartbeat which required two trips to the emergency room. Heart beating as fast as 180 BPM. These episodes finaly stopped 3 months after surgery. They were indeed scary. They lasted up to 1 and 1/2 hours. 2. Penis end pain which took roughly 3 months to subside. 3. Very serious groin pain which may require more surgery. I will be seeing a pain physician specialist this week. My guess is that I have a damaged or compressed nerve in the groin due to either scarring or stiching in the operation. It's just a guess, keeping in mind that my lymph glands were removed during surgery. This groin pain is so serious that it incapacitates me. I can only walk short distances without pain, and I can not exercise at all. Other than that, my PSA is now zero and I have excellent continance, and excellent sexual function. I am greatful to be alive. UPDATE: Went to pain clinic at McNeal Hospital in Chicago. Their initial diagnosis is groin nerve problems due to scarring from the surgery. They DO NOT recommend further surgery, but are treating me with a drug called Lyrica which tones down the nerve response, and also another drug for reducing inflamation of the tissues. I'll provide an update later. It makes sense that scarring is the issue because I was recovering normally experienceing no pain, then all of a sudden the severe pain came on, and stayed. So far I am real happy with my pain specialist because he is ver y responsive and easy to contact, which is not the case for the University of Chicago clinics. June 30 - Good News. My groin pain has subsided dramatically. The drugs are working their magic. I can now walk, clean my house, and go food shopping without sufferring dibilitating pain. Thanks to McNeal Hospital Pain clinic and my pain doctor. In late July, I should be off all drugs pertaining to the operation (on February 17).",

      "Content": "I had davinci prostate surgery Feb 17, which basically cured me of prostate cancer. My PSA is now zero. I was doing great two months after surgery, walking a mile a day. But one day a pain started in my left groin, just under the skin, and it continues until today. IT is an intermittent pain brought on by standing or walking. It is so serious that when it comes on, I can not walk, nor stand, or do anything. I MUST sit down for a half an hour before it eases. I have no skin rash or lump, nothing except it seems right under the skin in my left groin. The CT scan showed nothing. It is really puzzling: Two months ago I was fine, and now this. I need to see a specialist, but what specialist? Any suggestions? The pain is very localized and feel like someone is jabbing me with something sharp or pinching me hard in a sensitive area. The pain is intermittent, brought on by just walking, stretching, standing, and any other movement of the groin and left leg. It is a sharp pain both in one place and along the V of the groin. I have had only two relatively pain free days in the last two months. Right now I must walk very gnigerly to avoid pain. I have been advised to see a pain clinic for a diagnosis.",
