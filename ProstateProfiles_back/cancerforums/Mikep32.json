      "Content": "Well, good news for me on 2 fronts. My latest psa test result is still in the undetectable range. That's 2 years now, so looks like the C is gone. I've also now tried my first trimix injection, and it works well for me and no pain! I'm a happy chap, and to put the cherry on the cake, the trimix is a fraction of the cost of the caverject I tried. Thanks, MM16, for the advice. I wish I'd done it 12 months ago. I guess the lesson is, don't settle for the advice, if any, from your surgeon if he does not seem to be up on penile rehab. And persevere even in the face of uninformed general practitioners, find a specialist!",

      "Content": "Thank you for your interest and help, MM2. Yesterday i finally got to see a specialist in ED. He has pretty much repeated your early comments, that none of the ed pills will help me. He is however familiar with bi mix and trimix, and i am about to trial trimix to ascertain what specific blend and strength will hopefully work for me without the pain from the Caverject I've been using. It seems there's a compounding lab in adelaide, 200 miles from home, same as the specialist, but that's ok, i can manage with that. It'll be another 10 days before i get the trimix and although I've injected myself just 12 times with the Caverject he wants to see me to ensure i am ok with the trimix injections once i get them from the pharmacy. I'll post my success or otherwise. Fingers crossed!",

      "Content": "Thanks MM, sounds like we're in similar boats. I wish you luck with your journey. My surgery was open, belly button to groin, he removed the prostate, some lymph nodes and fatty tissues around the prostate, supposedly sparing both nerves. Unfortunately i needed the catheter in for nearly 4 weeks, then another 4 weeks before he removed a stent he had placed so recovery had a slow start for me. ED seems a largely ignored area here in Australia, even arising from pc treatment. I'm seeing my gp tomorrow for my next psa test, and I'll ask him about bimix and trimix, but i have asked before and he had no idea what i was talking about. It is seemingly not common here in Australia,, but i have found a compounding lab in Sydney which does prepare it - getting the gp to bother to learn about it might be a challenge. I will try for an appointment with a practice in adelaide which specialses in ed and men's health. I'm paying $190 for 28x5mg cialis, or $100 for 4x10mg cialis, so your suggestion is good. Maybe if i can up my dosage it'll help, worth a try! And affordable if i can get them from a place like you suggest. I know forum rules forbid advertising, is it possible you could pm or email me the contact you refer to? The Internet is so loaded with non-genuine drugs suppliers that I've not been confident enough to actually try ordering online offshore from Australia. That is 100mg cialis you're talking about? That's ten times what my gp said, might be a reason I'm getting no result.",

      "Content": "Hi, I'm 2 years post open radical nerve sparing prostatectomy, psa results all undetectable so far, continence pretty good except for the occasional sneaky minor leak, no pads needed. All good really. But, also have never had a natural erection, nor one with use of viagra or cialis. Got no advice re penile rehab from my surgeon and did no rehab as a result, penis has shrunk about 3cm (bit over an inch for you usa people). I've now tried viagra, 100mg, and cialis 10mg as required. Neither have any desirable effect for me. It's frustrating as i do get some reaction if my wife and i pet, but apart from the initial small stirrings, nothing comes from it. I thought maybe testosterone might help but my first two tests showed slightly under the normal range then my third test showed within the range so my uro would not prescribe. I've used caverject about a dozen times and is ok but i ache for a couple of hours after, and sticking myself is off-putting and there can be complications like peyronies. I'd like to use cialis if i can get it to work. Viagra gives me a serious flush and unpleasant feeling that would put me off sex anyway. I did also try the cialis 5mg daily and it did not seem to help at all. So, getting to the question, can people tell me what strength cialis have they found effective? Thanks.",

      "Content": "Thanks, Man16, for the advice, my uro who did the surgery wanted about a year ago to do implants, but i gave him a definite No. Specialists in men's health not available in my quite small home town. Seems to be one in the state capital Adelaide, 200 miles away, so i can make an appointment but regular visits could be a problem. I guess I've lost some functionality due in part to no rehab, but as there seems to be some response, even if not a lot, to natural arousal, I'm going to persist for a while with the least invasive which seems to be pills. I've tried only a few strengths of cialis, not high, highest only 10mg (hence the question). I haven't tried Levitra as yet, might it be worth a try? Have people who have failed with Viagra maybe had success with Levitra, and if so, what sort of strength? I can't see myself persisting with injections much longer, the ache after is too unpleasant.",
