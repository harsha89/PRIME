      "Content": "Originally Posted by newporter Without drilling down to compare treatment modalities, the study is not very helpful to us prostate cancer patients. There are numerous studies within the prostate cancer treatment communities on comparing secondary cancer risk from various treatment methods. The findings (I can go back and dig those studies out if someone is interested) I remembered when I was searching for treatment options were: 1. For surgery, colorectal and bladder cancer risks were no different from the general population. 2. For brachy, the colorectal and bladder cancer risks were only slightly higher than the general population. 3. For external beam radiation, they about double the risk of the general population, but if you looked at the absolute number, i.e., case per 100,000, it was still a very small number and comparable to the risk of death/complications due to surgery. But remember, the outcome for radiation was taken over a long time (years if not decades) and the technology in external radiation has improved so much that I am sure the risks are much smaller nowadays. And, I think that was the reason many doctors recommended surgery for very young prostate cancer patients as they still have decades to live and cancer risk due to radiation goes up in time after treatment. So, it is correct that we should watch out for the possibility of secondary cancer, it is not a risk high enough that those needing treatment should stop getting treatment. Specifically, those that were treated with external radiation should not lose any sleep. Others should perhaps just follow the guidelines for the general population. Peace, just want to add my comments and not try to create a fight. As I understood this paper, it's not about your treatments that cause a second cancer, it's about the common mutations that drive a primary cancer and a second primary cancer. They can be concurrent or one after another. And each of the cancers should be treated as best as possible.",
