      "Content": "After one Prostasol capsule a day my PSA has gone from 1.4 to 0.6 to 0.8 and yesterday, 0.9. I had hoped it would remain around 0.6 or decrease even further and although the rise is slow I'm going to increase to 2 capsules of P. a day and check it in a month. Anyhow, I had the first visit with my local urologist since October, when with a PSA of 1.3 he advised hormonal therapy. Advising him of my Prostasol usage for the first time, he was not familiar with the product (but was with PC SPES). His comment was that \"it only slows it down\" -- radiation therapy being the only thing that \"kills it\". This last procedure I refuse to undergo, for various reasons. He asked if there was any estrogen in Prostasol. None shows by name on the bottle, although some side effects seem identical with those of conventional estrogen therapy. Further, the doctor said that if estrogen was present, that usage on a long term basis can cause a breakdown of calcium in the body which can then lead to osteoporosis. Anyone aware of estrogen in Prostasol? Thanks.",

      "Content": "Let's hear it for Prostasol. Had radical prostatectomy in 1992. Some cells escaped the capsule, however my PSA remained low for 11 years. Two years ago it began to rise and in Nov. 2005 it was 1.4. My urologist recommended immediate hormone therapy. I didn't like the sound of it. Went to Mayo Clinic in Jacksonville, Fla. CT and bone scan OK -- it had not metasticized. (Colonoscopy OK as well.) Mayo recommended radiation therapy immediately or no later than after my PSA had risen to 2.0. Didn't like that procedure either. At Dr. Donsbach's recommendation I have been taking one capsule daily of his PROSTASOL for one month. My PSA has now dropped by more than half to 0.6. There are no noticeable side effects except perhaps increased tinnitus (ringing in the ears) for awhile. No painful nipples, no depression or anything else I can determine, although I am taking the minimum dosage. My next appointment with my urologist is May and the PSA may have diminished even further. I will be most interested in his reaction. I am very relieved I did not go for the hormones or radiation. I think I read somewhere that PROSTASOL is not refractory? Could someone comment on this?",
