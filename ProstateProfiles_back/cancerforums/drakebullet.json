      "Content": "This could be answered on different fronts senior1957 and respect seems to be the core issue. Secondary smoke has been shown to contribute/cause cancer. Because you had prostate cancer probably doesn't put you at any higher risk than anyone else. Right now I'm somewhat driving my family crazy because of the healthier lifestyle I'm pushing around the house. While eating healthier won't do anything about prostate cancer (it's out anyway), but it will help mitigate potential other cancers like colon. That said, I think your main issue is respect and perhaps joint counseling might help.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by Patsuz1 What are your thoughts on all of this? Thank you in advance. You're on the right path. (See a thread I started about ED as some of the guys put great feedback in it). My doctors at Stanford (surgeon/urologist & ED specialist) advocate using - pills to initiate oxygenated blood flow into penis to restore/rejuvanate the tissue - pump to vacuum veinous (non-oxygenated blood) to restore volume and length If those do not restore function, then they recommend injections or a urethral suppository. Google this and you will find similar plans of action. I found U Michigan and UC Irvine prostate cancer departments had similar guidance. I take 25mg Viagra at bedtime to promote \"nocturnal\" erections and because viagra gives me the usual headache and screws up my vision (normal side effects). 50mg for me is just awful. They advised beginning injections in 2 months if the viagra does not move things along fast enough. The pump - weird is about the best I can say about it, but they said use it, so I do. Later on, I can try adding a little rubber ring to maintain the erection pumped up. A number of guys said this works pretty well. Note: viagra is expensive. The Stanford docs wrote a Rx and sent it to a Canandian pharmacy (don't know if mentioning name is allowed here). It is orders of magnitude cheaper. Ordering was simple. Am waiting for shipment to arrive. I wish you well. You are among people who care about your success.",
