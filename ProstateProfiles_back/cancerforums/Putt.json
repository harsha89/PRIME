There is no test or doctor on this earth that can make that prouncement. I cring because I have seen with my own eyes men that were told they were cured and less than 5 years later they found that uncontrollable PC had returned. How did that happen? It was because they had become convinced they were cured and disregarded any future testing. The PC had come out of remission, metastasizied to bone and other organs without detection. As a result treating required massive radiation and/or chemo to try to arrest the PC. You have started a journey down a road that appears headed for a long life, however, do not forget, it still requires CONTINUED PSA TESTING, never less than every 6 months. Good luck to you and your family........",

      "Content": "My wife's infusions never resulted with any pains until they stopped giving her 2 of the 3 types she was being treated with. Within 2 weeks she started suffering from extreme total body muscle/skeletal pains. They started pain management with low doses of Lowertab and Oxycontin. That helped some but she didn't want to increase the dosages to higher levels. The Doc gave her a sample of a new drug called Cymbalta. Within 3 days her body pain is almost gone. She also started taking OTC NSAID's (Advil) so we aren't shure which one helped the most. Anyway between the 4 of them something is working better. Speaking as an experienced Lupron user (or victim, whichever) your husband can expect a number of SE's. Getting tired easily, hot flashes, muscle atrophy, bone loss, and others, but it also serves a purpose of reducing the size of the prostate, plus stops the body from producing testosterone which is a type of fuel for the growth of PC cells. Because your husband is already suffering, I pray the SE's are minimal Surely your doctor can establish some type of pain management while the chemo is working. Unless one is directly exposed to the horror's of chemo, most do not have a clue about its effects. Our prayers go out to you both....",

At age 79, side-effects can be just as fatal as the cancer. .. Fariwind I have been reading your comments for while and have always thought you provided decent info, especially to the \"newbys\". The above quote is completely off the wall and not what someone without any knowledge of the ins and outs of PC should hear. A blunt statement without any supporting documatation is a little harsh. Maybe you were in a bad frame of mind when you wrote it. We all have been there and done that many times. I'm not jumping your case, I just reminding you that there are readers out there that do not have your knowledge and experience. Many of us are facing Chemo and with the help of an Oncologist that specializes in PC, we expect to live the rest of our lives as comfortably as possible.",

Later they find their PSA has sky-rocketed and they have mets that have appeared in bone, lymph nodes, and/or other organs. Now a more drastic treatment must be found (chemo) to try to halt its growth. Success (remission) has now been placed at a very low percentage rate. Why take those chances when one can monitor their PSA every 3, 6, or 12 months and be pro-active before it gets out of control?",

Seeing the Urologist is the correct next step. Tell your Dad to relax. I'd bet big money on lab error. It has happened to me. I had about a 40 point jump on one of my test once and my Oncologist immediately retested. Errors happen once in a while, thats why one has to pay attention to what going on and not be led like a blind sheep. Like the old saying \"Knowledge is power\".

      "Content": "My concern are the patients, who are in their 40's - 60's, who were treated and told they were cured and never looked back. Later they find their PSA has sky-rocketed and they have mets that have appeared in bone, lymph nodes, and/or other organs. Now a more drastic treatment must be found (chemo) to try to halt its growth. Success (remission) has now been placed at a very low percentage rate. Why take those chances when one can monitor their PSA every 3, 6, or 12 months and be pro-active before it gets out of control?",

During the treatment with ADT (Lupron in my case) if the PSA level remains at undetectable (<0.05) and the Testosterone level remains at <20 ng/dl for 12 months, then one can stop the ADT and enjoy a vacation from the treatment. PSA and T must be monitored regularly. They both go together. If you are not having the T level checked, then you don't know for sure if the ADT is working as well as it should. I was bordering on the edge of restarting another round of ADT, when for some unexplained reason my PSA started going back down and my T is normal for some one my age. My doctor said to continue whatever I was doing, something was working. Whatever it is, I'm a happy camper for now. Next check in 3 months.",

Were you being treated with something during this time?
