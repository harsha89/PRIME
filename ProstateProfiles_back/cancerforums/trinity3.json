      "Content": "Hi Guys, It\u2019s good to be back home. I would like to update you on my experience and surgery results that I have thus far: \u2022Surgery on Wednesday at 7:30am. Very impressed with staff and Johns Hopkins Brady Center \u2013 many of the staff with 20+ years experience \u2013 it\u2019s all they do, the surgical technician in the OR told me he has been working with Dr. Allaf for 20 years including when he was a resident. You hope that kind of team work and experience counts for something! \u2022JH is an extraordinary complex. When you arrive and see all the oil on canvas portraits of the many esteemed doctors you have a feeling you\u2019re in a first class place. Really quite impressive. \u2022Wednesday there was a lot of tiredness and some discomfort \u2013 all managed great by the pain medication. Amazing how fast an IV works. By Wednesday 8pm I had a two hour burst of energy, walked a little which felt fine, then off to sleep with a bit of pain at 4am Thursday that was managed quickly with meds. \u2022Thursday was a real good day \u2013 very pain free, walking a lot, and feeling surprisingly good \u2013 I had more discomfort after arthroscopic surgery. Finally has some food Thursday evening and first bowel movement. I did feel some bloating that lasted for a few days but nothing causing a problem. \u2022Left hospital on Friday \u2013 been feeling very good ever since. Traveling with the catheter bag was a major pain in butt \u2013 but this is because Allaf does not like the small bags that attach to thigh\u2026maybe slightly higher risk of infection as you swap out small and overnight bags. \u2022Saturday \u2013 great to get home and all going according to plan\u2026I think. \u2022Surgery update. Dr Allaf told me the procedure when great and said I looked very good. Very little blood loss. Very clear urine almost immediately. Wounds look great. He told me he felt some firmness in the tissue on the side of prostate where the grade 8/9 tumor was so he cut wide until he felt softer tissue. This does make him suspicious about cancer outside of prostate. He sparred nerves completely on one side and partially on the other. He thinks he got it all but of course he does not have a microscope on the end of his glasses. I would be very surprised if there is no evidence of cancer outside prostate \u2013 hopefully he got it all. The real interpreter will be path report that we will discuss later this week. As always I welcome your comments/suggestions. One thing I have experienced a good amount of urine leakage around tip of penis. They checked out catheter at hospital and said no blockage or problems. Seems to happen when I walk \u2013 not an issue when resting. A couple extra comments - the suggestion to have chap stick and extension cord were both great! One other question - the catheter care they gave me only involved using petroleum jelly and soap with water to clean penis and insertion area- no mention of Neosporin or the like, can anyone elaborate on that Steve",

Also, they will work with you on additional exercises to build your pelvic floor muscles. I think it's a good move if you have concerns or doubts about your recovery in this area. Steve",

Anthony D'Amico who was my Radiation Oncologist is world class - and very much on the leading edge of many trials and studies. I'm sure the other 3 doctors are also eminently qualified. I could not attached the pdf because the file size was beyond the forum's limit - please see the link below. It is extraordinary how many new developments there are in treating and managing this cancer. I hope this post finds all of you doing well and staying positive. Steve This URL is for the 17th annual - the current event is September 6 (NOT SEPT 16). The lineup of speakers is the same except for different Medical Oncologist (Dr. Mary-Ellen Taplin).

      "Content": "Hi Tom, Ultra PSA's are an interesting experience. Many do not even test less than 0.04 since there are a number of things that can produce up to 0.04 psa - so there is nothing thus far that signals a problem or biochemical recurrence of the cancer. What are your doctors recommending at this point based on your positive margins? If you do proceed with radiation, based on your Gleason 6 score you should be sparred any hormone therapy. With G6, my guess is you will simply monitor until there is evidence that you need to take additional action. I think you will do great in the long run based on what you have written - just stay on top of things. All the best!! Steve",

I experienced that first hand in Rhode Island - approach was, \"this is what you have\", \"this is what you need to do\", \"what don't you understand about what I just told you\". My experience is that when you go to first class facilities or research hospitals, the doctors are not only the best, but they talk with you, not at you. Find a good place for care. My experience at Johns Hopkins and Dana-Farber was great! All the best to you. Steve",

The good news is my psa is still considered undetectable with readings below 0.1 ( I have 0.019 and 0.030; different lab 0.060). The hope is that my disease remains localized. I am reaching out to any others who have undergone radiation and hormone treatment to try and understand the side effects apart from the doctors standard speech. Michigan Man has been extremely helpful, as he just completed radiation for a very similar case. I have to say the hormone piece is what I am questioning the most.

As I thought about this and did some reading, I called him back and asked what about the next two PSA readings would change your mind about recommending a biopsy. His anwser, \"probably nothing\". So I told him I would do one more PSA and I wanted to see the free psa vs. bound psa numbers - he said ok but it was not part of what he originally ordered for blood work. Obviously I am concerned. I don't have any symtoms other than these results. Orginally it was suggested that only 20% come back positive, but at my age to have both of these show up concerns me. I am thinking about proceeding to the biopsy sooner rather than later. Any thoughts or advice based on the information I have shared?",

Perhaps is something more troubling shows up in all the other tests that I have to get between now and then that could change. He did perform a DRE, and felt the prostate in the area where the 4+5 is - he commented that it felt good which he took as a good sign since there was no evidence of something worsening in that area.

I had 3/12 cores test positive \u0096 all were 3+3 Gleason Score with one core at <5%; second core 10%; third core 25%. The surgeon said this is considered a \u0093clinically insignificant\u0094 amount of cancer and it his recommendation that we repeat biopsy in 6 months. Therefore he is recommending active surveillance. He was very clear that in his opinion this is not an aggressive situation. I\u0092m curious what any of you would do based upon these results??

      "Content": "Doctor said my PSA should not be above 2.5. I was 1.9 in 2011, 3.7 in 2013, 3.3 in 2014. My interest in getting another PSA imdediately is to see the free psa percentage and to make sure no other factors are influening my numbers prior to blood sample (e.g. no biking, no ejaculation, no recent dre, etc). My primary said it felt soft, not hard but thought it could be a nodule. Urologist said it was definitely abnormal and bigger on one side than other...I think he said it was a nodule. Again, when I asked what would change his mind about a biopsy based on what he already knows vs. what he hopes to find out from two more psa's over 3 months - the answer was \"probably nothing\". I guess I'm questioning why I would delay the biopsy. Also, not sure how concerned I need to be about skill level of person doing biopsy? This guy has been practicing for over 40 years. Steve",

My local Urologist who has treated me over the past year for 2 biopsies and kidney stone surgery called me this week to follow up on what my choice of treatment would be. When I told him I had decided to go out of state for surgery, he stated that he would not see me for any of the follow-up or treatment of my condition moving forward. He said that for malpractice reasons he would not remove a catheter or provide any other treatment for me moving forward - he went on to say that I will need treatment for prostate cancer for the rest of my life and essentially is dissolving our doctor - patient relationship. When I asked if he would treat me for unrelated prostate issues (e.g. kidney stones), it was clear that he had not intention to do that. I think this is an unusual response . It was also very hurtful. He is an arrogant kind of guy, but I think good at what he does which allowed me to overlook he personality quirk. Has anyone else experienced this kind of response? It almost borders on being unethical to be able to completely recuse yourself midstream. It certainly is not logical as how would one take a such a harsh position if a patient had surgery in another part of the country, moved to RI, and sought to become a new patient with this doctor. How could one remain in practice with the position that they will not treat someone who has been treated by another doctor. Steve",

Perhaps is something more troubling shows up in all the other tests that I have to get between now and then that could change. He did perform a DRE, and felt the prostate in the area where the 4+5 is - he commented that it felt good which he took as a good sign since there was no evidence of something worsening in that area. I have to wait a certain period of time from biopsy for the MRI...two of my doctors think it should be at least 6 weeks. Thanks for your comments and well wishes. I will keep you posted. Steve",

      "Content": "Gentlemen, I am curious about what level of confidence you have in the tables that predict the likelihood of cancer outside the prostate. I had a meeting today with my urologist who will handle my after surgery care. He was very blunt telling me my cancer would be classified \"High Risk\" - not medium risk, not low risk. He does not like the Parton tables because they don't look at ranges that are as precise as Memorial Sloan Kettering. Based on my 5 positive cores and one being a grade 8, he told me there is a 70% change that there is cancer in the nerve bundles. He said that if he were treating me and performing the surgery, he would recommend taking the nerves out and not consider nerve sparring. This of course was a bit disheartening. He also said there is a very good chance that I will need radiation therapy. This sounded less optimistic than what was explained to me at Johns Hopkins. So, I am a bit confused. Just wondering if you all have any insight as it relates to this. Happy Thanksgiving to all!! Steve",

      "Content": "My biopsy is scheduled for Nov 25. It has been a while since I last posted. I found a new Urologist who is also a surgeon and after the DRE, he concluded that there is a nodule on one side and that the prostate is asymmetrical. Just as a reminder, my PSA in 2011 was 1.9, 2013 3.7, 9/2014 3.3 , 10/2014 2.9 with 13% free psa. The new surgeon was very reassuring - he said a lot of guys our age [58} have cancer cells in their prostate but that does not mean the most radical procedures - it appears to depend on all the grading factors. He was confused that the last psa test was ordered from a differnt lab that uses a different testing method - as the whole point of the test is to see how it is trending and using a different test method would disrupt that. Here are my questions: 1. I can't remember how many cores he said he was going to take. Do you all agree that 12 cores is the right number? What if he wants to take less - is that something I should contest with him? 2. For some reason I will undergo general anesthesia - not sure why. I did not gather that this is normally the way a biopsy is done - can you comment? 3. Should I expect any problems the next day or will I feel normal? Thanks so much! Steve",

It can be very frustrating if you try measuring progress in weekly increments. I too was terrible after first couple weeks, wearing diapers and going thru many pads. After a 4 weeks, still burning thru at least 5-6 extra absorbent pads a day. The last week - 2 pads a day, holding urine better, everything improving. The ED takes longer but tell him to be patient and remember there are a number of fixes for ED. I think he is fine doing some outdoor work.

      "Content": "Hi Nick. I was diagnosed with low grade cancer a year ago, but more recently it has progressed such that I have surgery scheduled the first week in December at Johns Hopkins. I did a considerable amount or research and partially due to regional considerations, viewed JH as one of the very best options. Dr Walsh no longer does surgery although he is still on staff at JH. I emailed Dr. Walsh asking who he would recommend and he replied that Dr. Mohamad Allaf was \"Excellent\". I met with Dr. Allaf and was very comfortable with him - great guy to talk to and review options - he is described as one of those surgeons who is very skilled and gifted at performing the surgery (in my case robotic). I have emails that I would be glad to share with you - if you need any contact information. Also, there are at least a few others who have been to JH on this forum who have been helpful to me. A friend of mine was at JH recently for the surgery and spoke glowingly about how everything was handled and managed. I have another friend who chose University of Maryland and was pleased with results. Again, if I can provide any other input to help please let me know. Best wishes to you and STAY POSITIVE - things will work out well. Steve",

      "Content": "Hi FXOPTIONS, I also like the advice you are getting above. I think you should monitor psa for any evidence of recurrence and hold off doing anything while you have more time to heal and recover continence. Be careful, there are RO's out there that will try to rush you into radiation treatment - it's possible you will never need it. The fact that you are a G7 gives you the luxury of watching and waiting...not something that MM and I had given the G9. My understanding is that >G8 is the more serious concern and even then there can be some flexibility to wait based on psa (although in these cases it is highly recommended that treatment begin before evidence of biochemical recurrence). I would also mention that should you decide at some point that radiation is required - with your Gleason score you may NOT have to be treated with hormone therapy. Again, take your time and stay on top of things. All the best to you!! Steve",

I am consulting with another doctor -also not sure if you can completely trust the grading system as some people get second opinions and an 8 can become a 6. So we will see. I really like the idea of some alternative to surgery, but at 59, I don't want to be foolish. This of course begs the next question as to which form of treatment. Since none of the procedures come with a penis warranty, maybe you could let me know your thoughts on what best option is for ED and incontinence issues. Also, I have some concern about running to some of the famous cancer centers for fear that someone other than the doctor I choose will be performing the procedure. I certainly welcome any comments!!",

      "Content": "Hi Jamie, sounds to me like you are doing very well so early on. Nothing you have described is unusual. Keep in mind that continence takes time and is best not measured weekly but monthly. I went through a lot of pads in the first 3 months, always had squirts when standing up - it was frustrating and at times I wondered if I was going to have long term problems. My surgeon wisely told me that continence would return and although some men regain it very quickly, other will catch up over time. He was right for me. I still use one light pad a day because there are occasional dribbles - but nothing too much. I will tell you that tight underwear helped me a lot. Continued best wishes to you during your recovery. Steve",

      "Content": "Hello to all my friends on the site and to so many of you who have encouraged me and been of great support in helping me navigate through PCa. Monday will be day one of post RP radiation treatment. Actually Monday is simulation and Tuesday the radiation begins at Dana-Farber B&W Hospital. Feeling excellent even though I have been on ADT for 30 days. I suppose some point soon I must begin to feel the effects of the ADT but so far only a decreased libido. My psa prior to ADT was in the undetectable range so I have every expectation that if any cancer remains it is localized and the radiation therapy will kill it off. I will keep you posted at this stage of the journey begins. Steve",

      "Content": "Hi Guys. I was outside the home tonight when I got call from surgeon to review path report. Unfortunately I have to go by memory so I thought I would post this while my memory is fresh. Good news is - no can cancer in lymph nodes ( and he took out a lot - 22) and no cancer in seminal vesicle. There was evidence of cancer outside the prostate. He said something about 3mm - which he thinks makes me a candidate for adjuvant radiation therapy. He told me the margin where the cancer showed up is very close to the edge where he cut out. He thinks there is a better than 50% chance that he got all the cancer, but the radiation would be the way to seal the deal. Need to wait 8-10 weeks before new psa. He also wants to make sure continence is in a good place before radiation as it does not often improve after radiation. He did say there are two schools of thought on weather to proceed with radiation so I would be very interested in your interpretation of what I have been able to share so far. I expect hard copy of path report early next week which I will add to my profile. I do seem to remember him saying the gleason 9 was not just a random area - sounds like the cancer I have is fairly serious. I have not spent any time at this point on radiation or oncology issues so I could certainly use some direction. Steve",

      "Content": "Hi Mike, I want to make a suggestion about one part of your question, with which I have had personal experience. Many doctors do not want to provide follow up treatment for patients who have chosen a different surgery site. This is not always the case - but many will site legal/liability concerns. I'm not sure what MSK's policy is - I would discuss with your current doctor so you feel comfortable about the decision. Some of this also depends on the nature of the \"follow-on treatment\". This is only intended as a word of warning. All the best to you and don't lose hope - many good cures for PCa!! Steve",

      "Content": "Hi Jack, I had RP surgery 10 months ago. My bone scan and MRI were clean, but it turned out my G9 was not organ confined and I did have positive margins. Because my psa was 0.050 or less, I delayed radiation in order to regain full continence. I have just started radiation this week. I think your analysis and the comments above are right on. It's interesting that I met a gentleman at Dana-Farber who was also G9, organ confined, and they still pushed him to proceed with radiation. I did ask my RO if we knew when I was diagnosed what we know today, would I have been better served to simply proceed with Radiation. He said this is a common topic of discussion but his feeling was better to get the highly diseased prostate removed. I wish you all the best and let me know if I can be of further help. Steve",

      "Content": "I start my journey on Tuesday to MD with surgery on Wednesday. I think I am well prepared based on much help from this site...maybe over prepared. I have everything from cough drops, to stool softener, to Neosporin, to Vaseline, to lip chap, to extension cord for hospital room so I can get power easily...I don't know if I'm going to hospital or on ski trip. I have pre surgery call with doctor on Monday afternoon to discuss a few things. One of the major issues is the subject of what he could possibly find during robotic surgery that would impact any decision about how much to remove around the prostate. One doctor told me my path report should be all he needs. So the journey begins. I am very thankful for this website! I know this is not a \"religious\" forum, but I want to say that I have great faith in the Lord, and trust him entirely for my care (as I have for many years). I know He will not leave me or forsake me and regardless of what the outcome, my affliction is ultimately designed for my good and makes me depend on His grace, which is more than sufficient. Amen.

      "Content": "Hi Jamie, sounds to me like you are doing very well so early on. Nothing you have described is unusual. Keep in mind that continence takes time and is best not measured weekly but monthly. I went through a lot of pads in the first 3 months, always had squirts when standing up - it was frustrating and at times I wondered if I was going to have long term problems. My surgeon wisely told me that continence would return and although some men regain it very quickly, other will catch up over time. He was right for me. I still use one light pad a day because there are occasional dribbles - but nothing too much. I will tell you that tight underwear helped me a lot. Continued best wishes to you during your recovery.

      "Content": "I think 7/12 is too many positive cores. If you are seriously thinking about AS or alternative approach, I would suggest you do a consultation with Dr. Aaron Katz - NY - this can be done by phone and will cost you a couple hundred dollars. Katz was way ahead of the curve on watching and waiting. I do like your approach with diet as that may slow down progression. I did AS for 1 year, but only had 3 positive cores all GS 6 - unfortunately for me the next biopsy turned showed a GS 9. This is not what normally happens (in only about 15% of cases). All the best to you and don't stop asking questions and checking things out. Steve",

I think the fact that you have found a way to do that is very understandable. As Fairwind said, we are all going to die from something - it's more likely that it will not be this. I choose to focus on what I have to live for rather than what I am going to die from - The Lord knows that - for my days were numbered when there was yet but one. I would add that I am not trying to cling onto this world in a way that would compromise my quality of life - Although only 59, I have been blessed with many years already. Steve",

      "Content": "Thank you Runlikewind! Really appreciate your sharing. The surgeon sent me an email this morning which summarized our conversation, it said the following \"As we discussed yesterday, the pathology revealed that all 22 lymph nodes were negative for cancer, the seminal vesicles were also free of cancer. The prostate had a Gleason 4+5=9 prostate cancer that had escaped the capsule of the prostate on both sides (left and right). On the right there was a positive margin that was 3mm long. My recommendation is that we get a PSA in 10 weeks. If PSA is undetectable, I would recommend adjuvant radiation to begin a few weeks/months from the PSA depending on the recovery progress. If the PSA in detectable, depending on the number we would likely recommend radiation plus/minus other therapies.\"",

Keep in mind that continence takes time and is best not measured weekly but monthly. I went through a lot of pads in the first 3 months, always had squirts when standing up - it was frustrating and at times I wondered if I was going to have long term problems. My surgeon wisely told me that continence would return and although some men regain it very quickly, other will catch up over time. He was right for me. I still use one light pad a day because there are occasional dribbles - but nothing too much. I will tell you that tight underwear helped me a lot. Continued best wishes to you during your recovery.

      "Content": "Hello to all my friends on the site and to so many of you who have encouraged me and been of great support in helping me navigate through PCa. Monday will be day one of post RP radiation treatment. Actually Monday is simulation and Tuesday the radiation begins at Dana-Farber B&W Hospital. Feeling excellent even though I have been on ADT for 30 days. I suppose some point soon I must begin to feel the effects of the ADT but so far only a decreased libido. My psa prior to ADT was in the undetectable range so I have every expectation that if any cancer remains it is localized and the radiation therapy will kill it off. I will keep you posted at this stage of the journey begins. Steve",

      "Content": "Hi Everyone, I just got my lastest psa results. Just to remind you, I did have an abnormal DRE which has led to some further testing. My psa results are as follows, 2011 1.9; 2013 3.7; 8/2014 3.3; 9/2014 2.9. This last result also for first time measured free psa - which was 13%. The doctor still seems to think I am headed towards a biopsy just based on all the above considerations. He said the 13% free psa is abnormal as he would be looking for 15% or higher. So he wants to wait 3 months and have me do the psa again. I think he recognizes that I am hessitant about a biopsy but I am wondering based on what I have shared, is there any reason to hope that something will change to lead me away from a biopsy and am I being foolish to not demand one sooner? While the doc cannot be certain, there is nothing in the numbers that make him suspect we are dealing with anything aggresive. Steve",

      "Content": "I got my path report this morning. Now have 5/13 cores positive with 4 7's and one 8. Recommendation is surgery. I am consulting with another doctor -also not sure if you can completely trust the grading system as some people get second opinions and an 8 can become a 6. So we will see. I really like the idea of some alternative to surgery, but at 59, I don't want to be foolish. This of course begs the next question as to which form of treatment. Since none of the procedures come with a penis warranty, maybe you could let me know your thoughts on what best option is for ED and incontinence issues. Also, I have some concern about running to some of the famous cancer centers for fear that someone other than the doctor I choose will be performing the procedure. I certainly welcome any comments!!",

      "Content": "I start my journey on Tuesday to MD with surgery on Wednesday. I think I am well prepared based on much help from this site...maybe over prepared. I have everything from cough drops, to stool softener, to Neosporin, to Vaseline, to lip chap, to extension cord for hospital room so I can get power easily...I don't know if I'm going to hospital or on ski trip. I have pre surgery call with doctor on Monday afternoon to discuss a few things. One of the major issues is the subject of what he could possibly find during robotic surgery that would impact any decision about how much to remove around the prostate. One doctor told me my path report should be all he needs. So the journey begins. I am very thankful for this website! I know this is not a \"religious\" forum, but I want to say that I have great faith in the Lord, and trust him entirely for my care (as I have for many years). I know He will not leave me or forsake me and regardless of what the outcome, my affliction is ultimately designed for my good and makes me depend on His grace, which is more than sufficient. Amen.

They recommend 18 months for anyone who has not had RP surgery. So we will see about duration of time. So far, I am handling the ADT extremely well. I can tell you I have no interest in being on this longer than I need to. I will be sure to keep the forum informed as things unfold. Steve",

I never had a detectable psa - opted to do radiation based on GS9 and strong likelihood that there was some remaining cancer cells. The team at Dana-Farber said the success rate with treatment PRIOR to evidence of biochemical recurrence, was much higher than if I waited for a detectable psa.

This was part of what led me to the decision to proceed with radiation therapy since a 3mm margin means the cancer was right up against where the cut was from the surgeon - bottom line, there is higher degree of probability that some cancer cells were left behind.

      "Content": "My wife is a kindergarten teacher. Recently at the lunch period, the kids needed to visit the restroom an unusual number of times. This prompted her to say that maybe they needed to see a Urologist. She then said that anyone who could tell her what a Urologist is would win a prize. Here are a couple of the answers: 1. A Urineologist (yes pronounced as spelled) is someone who works on urine. 2. A Urologist is someone who works on toilet seats. A couple years ago there was a young man who used the restroom and came out to report the urinal was not working - He said, \"Mrs. D, there is something wrong with the penis machine\".

      "Content": "I just discussed this very topic with my surgeon from Johns Hopkins yesterday. There are two schools of thought. If psa is undetectable, it could be monitored closely and only given treatment once psa becomes detectable. He indicated it is very possible that all the cancer was removed. It is true, that with a Gleason 9, which I have, there is additional risk. One option Dr. Allaf suggested was - if psa is undetectable, perform a genetic test on the prostatectomy sample - if score is high, this would lead to more caution by proceeding immediately with AR. If score is low, we could monitor closely. If psa is detectable - all bets are off and most likely looking at Early Salvage treatment. Steve",

This prompted her to say that maybe they needed to see a Urologist. She then said that anyone who could tell her what a Urologist is would win a prize. Here are a couple of the answers: 1. A Urineologist (yes pronounced as spelled) is someone who works on urine. 2. A Urologist is someone who works on toilet seats. A couple years ago there was a young man who used the restroom and came out to report the urinal was not working - He said, \"Mrs. D, there is something wrong with the penis machine\".

      "Content": "Thanks DD - I am feeling a bit pressed because I don't have a year. I may only have 6 months before I will need to begin adjuvant radiation. Once that starts, I am told continence does NOT improve. So yes I am feeling a bit stressed. However, I think there have been lots of folks who have very good continence in 4 months...hopefully I will be counted among them. As for other activities - I am laying low as instructed. Steve",

One option Dr. Allaf suggested was - if psa is undetectable, perform a genetic test on the prostatectomy sample - if score is high, this would lead to more caution by proceeding immediately with AR. If score is low, we could monitor closely. If psa is detectable - all bets are off and most likely looking at Early Salvage treatment. Steve",

There is a high likelihood they will want to do adjuvant radiation with a Gleason 9 - even if the cancer is organ confined. There is some controversy about weather to have the surgery or just proceed with Radiation treatment - I assume you have spoken to your doctors about this. I am presently being treated at Dana-Farber following RP surgery at Johns Hopkins a year ago. All the best to you! Steve",
