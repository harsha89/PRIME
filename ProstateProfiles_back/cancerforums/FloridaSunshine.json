      "Content": "Wanted to give an update on our dilemma when, after 18 mos of zero club post surgery and radiation, the PSA went to 1.7. It was retested a week later and still 1.7, but two doctors were suspicious of that and asked us to go to a different lab. Third test showed 2.53 or almost doubling in a week's time. Not good. Nothing was shown on CT scan or the bone scan so doctor opted for ultrasound around area where prostate had been removed. Still nothing showing so the consensus is that it's in the lymph nodes. From here, nothing looked like an ideal plan. Thanks to all the many, many discussions here and our own research my husband does not want to subject himself to basically chemical castration. His theory is that would add another entire layer of symptoms on top of the actual hormone deprivation. Since he's a heart patient he wants the route easiest for his body. So he's opting for the surgical route. \"D\" day will be December 29 when the doctor views the results of the next PSA test. Since the original cancer was so aggressive, the odds are that it's still going to be aggressive and fast moving I suppose. We've got lots of people praying but we well know God doesn't always answers prayers like we want. Thus, come December 29, it will be either a miracle cause it's going back down or a date for surgery early January. Any advice from others who've gone this route? Any particular things to be aware of when CA heads to the lymph nodes? Aliza",

      "Content": "Greetings to all of you from sunny Florida. First I'd like to say my husband and I are very thankful for all of you who take time to respond to us newbies with your experience and insight, so much learned through your individual trials. We've learned so much just reading. A special double thanks to our moderator HighlanderCFH. I've been bombarding Chuck for several days now with PMs over all the technical problems with the forum and he graciously worked with forum moderators even over the weekend to get us posting. With the technical slowdown our timing is poor since tomorrow is the doctor appointment to discuss HDT options. I'll let my husband speak for himself now. Aliza ____________________________________ When I was 74 we discovered enlarged prostrate was aggressive cancer. Treatments were RPP (7/14)and SRT, 40 treatments (9/14- 11/14). Post radiology and surgery PSA\u0092s = .1 (1/15 and 5/15). On 11/4 = 1.7. <sigh> I meet with urologist this week re: HDT. Brain working very well; body not so much. I experience fatigue, bloating, peripheral neuropathy, lumbar pain daily. I walk a mile or two a day. Naps infrequent to frequent. In 2000 diagnosed CAD: six bypasses; two stents and pacemaker since. This March had a major heart attack. A third stent inserted. Blood flow in cardio arteries is good. Heart muscle loss about 10 per cent. Questions: 1) if muscle loss is frequent side effect of HDT, especially with guys my age, wouldn't I lose heart muscle as well? 2) Considering my other non-PC symptoms, would you consider moving forward now or take a wait and see approach? 3) Since original PC was aggressive, does that mean it will always be aggressive and fast moving, since I had 2 virtually zero PSA readings post-surgery and SRT? 4) What are opinions out there re: surgical removal vs. chemical HDT? My present thinking is that going the chemical HDT route, I\u0092d be dealing with two types of side effects (chemical and loss of testosterone) while with surgery just the latter.",

      "Content": "After being diagnosed with a Gleason of 9.2 in 2014, my urologist, a wonderful surgeon, recommended surgically removing the prostrate, followed by 40 radiation treatments. As a result in January and May of 2015 my PSA was zero. Now the cancer is back and growing rapidly. If my next PSA indicates it, I will undergo an orchioectemy (surgical removal of testes) in January. Here are the reasons I have opted for surgery over drugs. 1. It will be over quickly rather than spread out for months or years. 2. Since I'm a heart patient, drugs put an extra strain on the heart, according to a recent study; 3. I will be dealing only with the side effects of loss of testosterone and not also possible fall out from the drugs; 4. It's cheaper; 5. I'm impressed that it is the procedure of choice in Europe, according to my wife.",

      "Content": "While Ron is right that officially the diagnosis isn't fully confirmed until the biopsy, if you have an experienced urologist whose done a ton of digital exams, he can feel the cancer. Mine knew I had cancer, and felt it was serious before the biopsy. The biopsy is necessary. Multiple samples of the prostrate is taken in different locations. I had 12 of them. The results from that was a Gleason rating of 9.something. Then my doc was able to tell me how serious the cancer was, which in my case was aggressive, Stage IV. After surgery to remove the prostrate and radiation, my PSA was zero for six months or so, but now it's up to 2.5 and growing rapidly. If my next PSA continues this way I am opting for surgical removal of testicles rather than by drugs. Studies I read indicate surgical removal is less likely to cause heart issues, and since I had a heart attack last year, It is an outpatient procedure and I will just get it over with in one stroke, rather than spreading it out over time. In Europe surgery is the treatment of choice. It's a small incision and the testes are removed. Prostheses made used to replace the missing organs.",

Mine knew I had cancer, and felt it was serious before the biopsy. The biopsy is necessary. Multiple samples of the prostrate is taken in different locations. I had 12 of them. The results from that was a Gleason rating of 9.something. Then my doc was able to tell me how serious the cancer was, which in my case was aggressive, Stage IV. After surgery to remove the prostrate and radiation, my PSA was zero for six months or so, but now it's up to 2.5 and growing rapidly. If my next PSA continues this way I am opting for surgical removal of testicles rather than by drugs. Studies I read indicate surgical removal is less likely to cause heart issues, and since I had a heart attack last year, It is an outpatient procedure and I will just get it over with in one stroke, rather than spreading it out over time. In Europe surgery is the treatment of choice. It's a small incision and the testes are removed. Prostheses made used to replace the missing organs.",

      "Content": "Pain in the testicles is symptomatic of epididymitis, i.e. infection of the epididymis. I know, because I had it. This painful malady led to prostatitis, i.e. infection of prostrate in my 40's. Since being diagnosed with PC. I've been told prostatits can be a precursor to PC. My urologist back then told me it was bacterial and prescribed five different anti-bacterial medications over three month period. None of his drugs helped. At my fifth visit, I asked him if my infection might be a yeast infection. He told me, rather arrogantly, that men don't get yeast infections and prescribed sulfa drugs which did nothing to eliminate the problem. However, since my wife had some medication in the refrigerator (nystatin) for her serious yeast problem, I began taking the dosage she had taken. My prostatitis was gone in four days. Now I'm going to say something that may sound strange. This is just me. Knowing what I now know about prostratitis and prostrate cancer, back before my cancer diagnosis I would have had a serious discussion with my urologist about the possibility of removing the damned organ, I have two reasons: (1) to vastly reduce my chances of PC, (2) To eliminate all those various, irritating, uncomfortable problems with urination that the prostate gland caused me in later life. Please keep us posted. Wade P.S. a good urologist often can detect irregularities in the prostrate with a digital exam. These irregularities are often associated with PC. My urologist knew I had PC when he did the digital. His biopsies determined the seriousness of it. It was Stage iv, aggressive.",
