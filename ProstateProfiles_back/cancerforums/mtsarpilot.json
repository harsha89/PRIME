      "Content": "2.5 weeks out from surgery you need to be pretty inactive. Walking is about the only activity you should be doing. Most doctors advise 4 weeks before beginning any physical activity or strengthening. No lifting more than 10 lbs for the first 4 weeks. For us active guys, this drives us bonkers to sit around, but you have to do it. You have 6 incisions in your abdomen and some major healing to do in the pelvic floor. Don't do too much or you'll do damage instead of healing. At 4 week I started light abs workout like a few situps, a short plank, some stretching, etc., then when the body did well with that I added a little more each day. At 7 weeks out I am going at full force. I play competitive level tennis, and played doubles with 3 teaching pros today, so you can imagine the intensity level. All went fine. You'll get back to it, just give you body time to heal.",

The thing you are feeling about the waste systems closely linked will be a learning experience for you as you progress in regaining your continence. The muscles that control passing gas are tightly linked (either neurologically or physically, I can't tell) with the bladder sphincter control. So passing gas without leakage is tough. After a while you learn to seperate the two actions for the most part, but that is still the one time I occassionally get a drip. Hang in there, it just gets better from here.",

      "Content": "Wow, you are doing fantastic. Small amounts of blood in the form of tiny clots that look like flecks of red is not uncommon. If it persists for more than a few more days, give your surgeon a call. Likely nothing, but it does not hurt to call. Pain is also very normal. Rememer you are only a week out from major surgery, you have a massive amount of healing to do. As good as you feel, be careful not to push it. Do lots of walking, but no lifting over 10 pounds, and nothing abdominal. Most doctors say 6 weeks. Follow whatever your surgeon advises. Let your body heal. The drips after stopping urine flow are also common. I am 6 months out and still have that. I suspect it will be lifelong. A suggestion from one forum member a while ago that works for me is after completing flow, press up on the perineum with a finger. That ejects the small amount of urine stilll in the urethra. You don't have all the muscles that used to do that function. When I do that, sometimes I'm empty and sometimes there is a good bit of urine. That extra fluid is what would have dripped had I not manually pushed it out. Congrats on the excellent pathology. You are on the road to a long healthy life !",

      "Content": "2.5 weeks out from surgery you need to be pretty inactive. Walking is about the only activity you should be doing. Most doctors advise 4 weeks before beginning any physical activity or strengthening. No lifting more than 10 lbs for the first 4 weeks. For us active guys, this drives us bonkers to sit around, but you have to do it. You have 6 incisions in your abdomen and some major healing to do in the pelvic floor. Don't do too much or you'll do damage instead of healing. At 4 week I started light abs workout like a few situps, a short plank, some stretching, etc., then when the body did well with that I added a little more each day. At 7 weeks out I am going at full force. I play competitive level tennis, and played doubles with 3 teaching pros today, so you can imagine the intensity level. All went fine. You'll get back to it, just give you body time to heal.",

      "Content": "JB22, your experience is not uncommon, maybe even closer to the norm. The first stage is being dry overnight - you are there. Bask in the positive of that. Over time you'll progress to being dry when seated, then when standing, then as you transition, and so it goes. 5 days out is real early to expect great continence. You'll hopefully see some fairly big improvements week on week over the first 6 weeks. Your doctor's advise on liquids is close but a bit misguided based on what my surgeon and local Uro both told me. Drink lots of liquids for sure. There are many bladder irritants, and any of them in your urine will cause your bladder to want to get rid of the urine. Making it tougher to control that lonely bladder sphyncter. The more you drink, the more you keep any of the irritants diluted. Some of the irritants to avoid include: - Uria. Yes, you by definition has urea in your urine. But the more dehydrated you are, the greater the concentration, thus why your urine gets yellower. Keeping well hydrated keeps the urea concetration down. Drink lots to keep your urine clear. - Caffiene. It's a diuretic and an irritant. Thus drinking tea is a bad idea if it has caffiene. Herbal teas are as the are not caffinated. Coke and other caffinated soda are also therefore unfriendly to your continence. - Alcohol. A double whamy. An irritant and a muscle relaxer. Just say no. Even when I was doing real well on continence, when I tested with a beer I had problems holding it. - Citric juices. They are irritants too. Orange juice and grapefruit juice are the worst offenders. Highly concentrated in citric acid. - Cranberry juice. I don't know why, must be the acids in it too. Just know they told me to stay away. So what can you drink - water, water, and more water. If you like juice, go with apple. Caffiene free soda if you like soda. As FLmlp mentions, do your Kegel exercises. The single greatest thing you can do at this point. Check out my post on Physical Therapy regimen. Careful not to overdo it until the muscle gets stronger. Overstressing the muscle will tire it out and make things worse. Build up slowly. At 50 years old you are young, this plays in your favor. This along with physical condition affect recovery as well. The stronger you came into RP, the better you'll do in gaining control back.

The thing you are feeling about the waste systems closely linked will be a learning experience for you as you progress in regaining your continence. The muscles that control passing gas are tightly linked (either neurologically or physically, I can't tell) with the bladder sphincter control. So passing gas without leakage is tough. After a while you learn to seperate the two actions for the most part, but that is still the one time I occassionally get a drip. Hang in there, it just gets better from here.",

      "Content": "Wow, you are doing fantastic. Small amounts of blood in the form of tiny clots that look like flecks of red is not uncommon. If it persists for more than a few more days, give your surgeon a call. Likely nothing, but it does not hurt to call. Pain is also very normal. Rememer you are only a week out from major surgery, you have a massive amount of healing to do. As good as you feel, be careful not to push it. Do lots of walking, but no lifting over 10 pounds, and nothing abdominal. Most doctors say 6 weeks. Follow whatever your surgeon advises. Let your body heal. The drips after stopping urine flow are also common. I am 6 months out and still have that. I suspect it will be lifelong. A suggestion from one forum member a while ago that works for me is after completing flow, press up on the perineum with a finger. That ejects the small amount of urine stilll in the urethra. You don't have all the muscles that used to do that function. When I do that, sometimes I'm empty and sometimes there is a good bit of urine. That extra fluid is what would have dripped had I not manually pushed it out. Congrats on the excellent pathology. You are on the road to a long healthy life !",

      "Content": "I'll echo the other replies, you are doing great. Getting an erection at 6 weeks is fantastic. I had about 30% of the nerves removed, and like you, showed early signs of response. At 6 weeks Viagra worked like a charm. Erections quality reduced at around 4 months which Mulhall asserts is common. At 6 months I get response without meds but not sufficient for full use. Viagra does the trick. I hope to get to not needing the meds, but one never knows. As for the drips, those too will likely get better over time. From what I have read, it is not a steady improvement, but one that goes in steps. I was pretty dry and without pads and just the occassional leak starting 5 days after catheter removal. But I still get the occasional drip when passing gas, yawning, laughing, etc.. Keep doing those Kegel's and try to do one whenever you doing anything that will stress the system such as standing up. Keep in mind, you have had major surgery. You have a LOT of healing still to go at 6 weeks. Give it time and things will get better. Hang in there and congrats on the progress so far.",

      "Content": "In a different thread FLmlp asked about Kegels and suggestions for help. I felt it would be better to post this in a new thread so others can more easily find it instead of burying it in a thread under another title. My Uro had me do one session with a PT that specializes in RP recovery a month prior to surgery. She used biofeedback to help me learn how to do a Kegel correctly which was important. Then once doing them correctly, here is the regimen transcibed exactly from the instruction sheet: 1) First for warmup and to develop strength: Squeeze pelvic floor muscles as strongly as you can (use the muscles as if you are trying to stop yuor urine stream), hold for count of 3, then let go all the way. Fully relax and breathe at the bottom Don't let your legs, buttocks or stomach muslces help the pelvic floor, it is a very subtle movement of the muscles between the tailbone in the back, the pelvic bone in the front, and the bones we sit on 2) For endurance Squeeze the pelvic floor muscles as firmly as you can, hold for a smooth, slow count of 10 (count out loud if it helps you breathe), then let go all the way. Relax and breathe for a count of 10. Even if you feel that you are losing the contraction, keep thinkinng about lifting and squeezing throughout the hold. Mentally don't let go. Build up to being able to do this 10 times in a row 3) For control Slowly start squeezing the pelvic floor muscles over a 5 second count up to your strongest contraction, at the top hold for a count of 5, then slowly relax the pelvic floor down to fully relaxed. Don't just drop the hold, try to be smooth Do this one a few times after #2 above for focus on graduated amounts of control. --------------------------- Do all of these exercises daily wherever you are: lying down, sitting, standing and walking. Put your pelvic floor on with coughing, picking things up, or getting up from sitting. For each set, do 5-10 of #1, 10 of #2, 5-10 of #3. Do at least 5 sets per day. -------------------------------------------------------------------------- OK, back to my commentary. I did at least 5 sets per day, often more once I had could do them well. You'll notice the muscle hold slowly breaking down in #2 over the 10 seconds. That will strengthen and then you'll be able to hold. Once strong sometimes I'd hold for 30 seconds or longer. I'd do these standing in a grocery line, sitting in an office chair during a meeting, laying in bed. Wherever I could remember. I even put a tiny sticky note (corner of a Post-it cut out) on my work computer with a \"K\" on it to remind me without others knowing what it was. No-one has ever noticed or asked, I still have it there. As I noted in another post - Kegels are important, but you need to get the Abs strong too. Start strong before surgery if you can, get strong after surgery once your doctor releases you to do abdominal exercises. Hope this helps folks",

Testicular issues are not something one should let sit for more than 24 hours. While what you are experiencing is not likely Prostate Cancer, and this forum deals with some pretty heavy stuff that you likely don't want to have to think about at your age (I'm guessing there may be an 18 year age restriction for the forum as well), I commend you for reaching out for help.

The test is in no way dangerous to the patient. The test itself has no danger as it uses the same blood already drawn. What is dangerous is how a doctor or patient interprets the results. Doctors who scare patients, or jump to conclusion that biopsy is warranted is where the issues kick in. I am one of those individuals whose life has been saved by this test. I am younger for this damn disease. Given the state of advancement of the disease, had I gone 1 more year, it likely would have been outside the Prostate and 2 or 3 and no doubt the picture would be bleak. There are rarely symptoms of PCa until it is way too advanced. This test saves lives, but it takes competence with the result and good guidance from a Urologist to determine the appropriate actions. If I were in your shoes, I'd still use those shoes to get to a Urologist. You don't know why your PSA is where it is, but that is not normal for a 36 year old man. Prostatitus should be treated. And knowing your prostate health history will be important in the future. Get the issues understood and resolved. Don't just trust your family doc and walk away when there is indication you may have a health issue, even if minor.",

      "Content": "I agree with Fairwind. Yes, your PSA is high for someone your age, but there can be many reasons for that which are not cancer. Doing a biopsy with just this piece of data is also not warranted. But also waiting 4 years for your next PSA is also not responsible. Seeing a Urologist is the right step. You may have inflamation in the Prostate, BPH, or one of many other things that cause elevated PSA, or maybe your body runs at a higher PSA. At a minimum you have established a baseline. Let a Urologist sort it out with you. Did your Doctor advise you to abstain from any form of sexual activity for 48 hours before the PSA test? Did you participate in any sexual activity within 48 hrs before the blood draw? That alone could account for the elevated PSA. Again, the expert is a Urologist. He/She will figure it out and put your mind at ease.",

      "Content": "Tom, your initial presentation is similar to mine. I am 49. PCP felt what he characterized as a 3mm mass on the right side and I had an elevated PSA. Urologist felt the same thing. Interestingly the MRI showed a tumor on the left side. Biopsy showed signifcant cancer in the base on both left and right side. What was most interesting was after the biopsy, the mass was never detectable again. I had 4 doctors do DRE's in the course of visits and none felt it again. The folks at Johns Hopkins did the longest DRE one can ever imagine and found nothing. Very weird. You'll want to get all the details of the biopsy from your Uro. Get a copy of the biopsy report. Gleason is the scale used to evaluate the aggressiveness of the cancer. The Gleason number and how it is composed (there is a difference between 3+4 vs 4+3 = 7) along with the number of positive cores and % of cancer in each are all germain to helping you select the best course of treatment for you. There is no one right answer. You need to evaluate all your options and select the answer best for you. Get a copy of Dr. Walsh's Surviving Prostate Cancer. This book will educate you big time and enable you to know what to ask and what it all means. Talk to lots of doctors to find the course of treatment you are most comfortable with such that you never look back afterwards. If you are interested in surgery, I can highly recommend Dr. Vipul Patel in Orlando. I live in Colorado and travelled to Orlando to go to who I felt was best for me. I'm 3 weeks post surgery and amazed at where I am at this point. He did a great job on the surgery, specially given the extensiveness of my cancer. His practice is fantastic with the patients. A very well run shop that takes great care of you. Preps you with all the info you need, classes, and long term rehab care. With the number of surgeries he does per week, one would think it would just be a factory and that is what I feared at first. It is anything but a factory. Impressive how they care for their patients. And he is only a couple hours away from you. There were men there that have driven up from Miami, so your distance is not a problem. Google him, you'll find him on the web. Quite self promoting, but I found him to be excellent and the self promoting to not be far off.",

I've heard good things about Cleveland Clinic as well. I did not research them, so can't speak from experience on their surgeons. When going to a teaching institution, make sure you ascertain whether the experienced surgeon is the one controlling the robot or if it is the resident.

Radiation and surgery may both be effective treatments for you. Talk to your Uro about the probability that the cancer has spread beyond the prostate. If it has, you will likely be looking at radiation after surgery. At which point, some folks choose to do the radiation because you are stacking up more and more side effects by doing both surgery and radiation. Hormone Theraphy combined with External Beam (EBRT or IMRT) and Brachytherapy (seeds) is a common approach for your level of cancer. Explore all the options and make the choice that you feel most comfortable with. Bounce lots of question around here.

      "Content": "What you are experiencing is pretty common. You are hyper aware of everything now. It is tough to relax when you don't know what's going on. Definately read Dr. Walsh's book, and if you can before the Uro visit, go for it. While it is big and thick, I read it in a weekend because I wanted the knowledge. Knowledge is you best friend right now. It will enable you to understand what the doctors are saying, and better yet as the questions you want to know about. Most likely the Uro is going to recommend a biopsy. With the high PSA, that pretty likely in your future. Though doing a round of antibiotics is a good step to ensure the issue is not from something else (though that high a PSA, I'm sorry to say, has a pretty high likelihood of being PCa). Another test to discuss with the doctors is PCA-3. It is done from a urine sample after a DRE. So no pain, no medical intervention into your body. It gives a reading on the likelihood of PCa. That helps in deciding if a biopsy is a right next step. Another would be a Free PSA which is a blood test. If both these come back with high probability of PCa, you'll want to do the biopsy to know what you are dealing with. Yes, you are correct that PCa is usually slow growing, so a PSA velocity as you have is unusual. That does not mean the world is collapsing and even if it is PCa that you can't be treated. The first step is to find out what you are dealing with. Then go from there. Take a deep breath, read lots to learn, then dive in with some good doctors.",

      "Content": "I am not a runner though I am an avid athelete, so I can't speak to the literal mechanics of the muscle engagement for that activity, though I can give you basic background. The first piece you will be dealing with is the potential for incontinence. Every patient is different. Some come out of the surgery totally continent (the lucky few), others with absolutely no urinary control (the unlucky few). Most land somewhere in the middle, improve over time, and what the final state will be is so person by person dependent. In my case, I met the medical standard for \"continent\" (which is less than 1 pad per day needed) the day after catheter removal. 5 days after catheter removal I no longer needed any protection. I just get 1 or 2 tiny dribbles in a day during weird muscle motions such as yawning, laughing, or moving in a funky way while seated. If you are not continent during non-active times, it will not be any better during running. Likely a little worse. Depending on how much flow you have, just wearing a pad (which is no big deal) may be sufficient. Again, your mileage may vary. Once you achieve continence (I'll define that as not needing any protection) the next step is remaining continent during activity. Leakage during activity is referred to as Stress Incontinence. How well someone gets past that also is very person dependent. If you just have minor stress incontinence then just toss in a pad and off you go for your long runs. I am now 6 weeks post surgury and have absolutely no stress incontinence. I am a 49 year old avid athlete. I play competitive level tennis (so running in short spurts, not distance like you) which is pretty harsh on the muscle systems. I have been playing now for 2 weeks with not a single urine drop. I was afraid of serving for example and had no issues. Today was my first day skiing. I am a former ski instructor and for me skiing means aggressive, moguls, steep stuff, and I pushed it pretty hard. I wore a pad just in case. It was dry at the end of the day, I was amazed. So you could have no problem at all, or be anywhere on the spectrum. That is so hard to tell up front. Factors that play into likelihood of continence are age and physical fitness. Given you are a runner, I'll make the assumption you are in good shape. If you are in good shape, you'll have a much higher probability of being continent and having no problems, though no-one can guarantee that. Both my Urologist and surgeon told me I likely would have absolutely no issue given my age and physical condition. They would not promise of course, but they'd seen enough men to be pretty confident. They were right. The other thing you can do starting right now is Kegel exercises. Get that bladder sphincter strong and responsive. You can find info on the web to guide you. Though I would recommend getting your Urologist to give you one Physical Therapy session with a PT that specializes in this. Mine did and I believe it has made a huge difference. Knowing how to do them correctly (very easy to do them incorrectly and not really be working the right muscle) and having a regimen is valuable. Then keep doing them after the catheter comes out. With that you have given yourself the best possible chance at a great outcome. Hope this helps. Good luck with your treatment. Let us know what your plans are and how it goes.

      "Content": "TKI - As others have said, at 39 PCa is much less likely, but always a possibility. Did you by chance have sexual activity the night before the PSA test or even within 48 hours. That will cause a higher PSA. An infection could, Prostatitus can, so many reasons. So at this point, it is not yet time to start thinking PCa. Some people have physical signs of PCa such as pain in lower back or other areas, others do not. So you pains are not necessarily indicative of PCa either. PCa is a very slow grower. IF (big IF) you were to have PCa, the 6 weeks your doctor suggests waiting for the next PSA will have no affect on the state of the cancer. So don't worry about the lost time there. The Cipro can address an infection, but not always. Different infections respond to different antibiotics. Cipro is pretty broad spectrum, but won't kill all. So it is not unheard of to still have whatever you had after Cipro if you have one. I'd suggest giving it the 6 weeks, abstain from sexual activity and bicyclying at least 48 hours before the test, and do the next PSA test. If that comes up high, have the Urologist do a Free PSA. It is another good blood test that gives more statistical probability of having PCa. There are others such as PCA3 though I'm not familiar with them. Let the blood work indicate if you need a biopsy. You don't have to just immediately jump into the biopsy. I did as you are doing and gave it the 6 week period then did multiple tests before choosing biopsy. The biopsy is relatively simple, but there are risks with any procedure, so don't take it lightly, ensure you want it before you do it.",

I was given a leg bag and expected I'd be switching between the big bag and the smaller leg bag and never did. The hospital put the bag in something similar to a fabric shopping bag with a handle. I took a strap from a duffle and added it to the shopping bag loop and threw it over my shoulder. The shopping bag then hung just below waist line which was perfect. I had the hose come out the waist band of my sweat pants and right into the shopping bag. Walking around was no issue in this configuration. People could not even see the hose. Just looked like I had a shopping bag on my shoulder. With this, I never felt the need to switch to the leg bag which is nice as I did not have to do any of the cleaning associated with the transition. Wear boxers, not briefs. I've never done boxers so my wife ran out and bought some. That gives plenty of room for the hose to casually float where it needs to go without tugging which would be bad. The hospital gave me antibiotic ointment and instructed to put some on the tip of the penis where the catheter comes out. Kept everyting from getting sore. So no pain was had. Just a little uncomfortable due to the whole setup. Sleeping was easy, no issue. Just put the bag on the floor (in it's shopping bag) and slept like normal. One person mentioned the blood clots. There will be some in the first day or two, don't worry, that is normal. Catheter removal is a non-event. No pain, quick and over with. And you are so happy to get it out. Ask the doctor if they will provide you with pads or diaper or if you need to bring them. After a day you'll know if you are flowing or just leaking, i.e. do you need diaper or just pads. If just pads, go to briefs, boxers are way to loose. Some people come away after catheter removal being dry, but that is the rare exception. I flowed like a faucet for about 3 hours, then it slowed. I was dry overnight the first night (though wore a diaper as I did not know what to expect) and was less than a pad leakage starting that first day. I'm now 3 weeks post surgery and pretty much dry. I have not worn a pad since 5 days after catheter removal. Only get the rare occasional drip when I laugh. Each person is different, your mileage will absolutely vary. Good luck with the surgery. You'll be surprised the pain afterwards is far less than you might expect, you are up and about that night and walking OK by the next day, just guarded due to abdominal discomfort from the surgery and this hose hangin out where you never would want to see one. That all goes by pretty quickly. If you would like to talk with someone to explore more questions or experience, I'm happy to jump on the phone.

The hospital gave me antibiotic ointment and instructed to put some on the tip of the penis where the catheter comes out. Kept everyting from getting sore. So no pain was had. Just a little uncomfortable due to the whole setup. Sleeping was easy, no issue. Just put the bag on the floor (in it's shopping bag) and slept like normal. One person mentioned the blood clots. There will be some in the first day or two, don't worry, that is normal. Catheter removal is a non-event. No pain, quick and over with. And you are so happy to get it out. Ask the doctor if they will provide you with pads or diaper or if you need to bring them. After a day you'll know if you are flowing or just leaking, i.e. do you need diaper or just pads. If just pads, go to briefs, boxers are way to loose. Some people come away after catheter removal being dry, but that is the rare exception. I flowed like a faucet for about 3 hours, then it slowed. I was dry overnight the first night (though wore a diaper as I did not know what to expect) and was less than a pad leakage starting that first day. I'm now 3 weeks post surgery and pretty much dry. I have not worn a pad since 5 days after catheter removal. Only get the rare occasional drip when I laugh. Each person is different, your mileage will absolutely vary. Good luck with the surgery. You'll be surprised the pain afterwards is far less than you might expect, you are up and about that night and walking OK by the next day, just guarded due to abdominal discomfort from the surgery and this hose hangin out where you never would want to see one. That all goes by pretty quickly. If you would like to talk with someone to explore more questions or experience, I'm happy to jump on the phone.

Ended up spending 3 days in the hospital with sepsus (blood infection) from e.coli in the blood. A gift of the biopsy. I'm guessing you may have an infection, but hopefully just a UTI and they can deal with it with oral antibiotics. I'm surprised the Uro only had you do a few days. If they suspect an infection, which they obviously do given they gave you antibiotics, it is usually a couple week course of meds to kill it. Watch your temp carefully after you finish the meds. If it comes back up, talk with them immediately. Hope all is doing better for you now and it all goes away. It's nice to have that negative biopsy, and hopefully you don't have PCa. However as others have said, that elevated PSA is an indicator of something going wrong. Make sure your Uro gets to the bottom of it. You may only have a small volume of cancer and the needle biopsy did not hit the spot. At least if that is the case, it is very early and easily treatable should it show up in a biopsy in the future. If it were me, I'd be watching that PSA closely. Do another one 3 months or at most 6 months and see if it keeps rising. No sense doing one shortly after a biopsy, it will be falsely high. I had a Medical Oncologist do one 2 weeks after biopsy and it was 8.0. All other doctors said it was a silly thing to do because it would be known to be high and of no value. Good luck.",

I was given a leg bag and expected I'd be switching between the big bag and the smaller leg bag and never did. The hospital put the bag in something similar to a fabric shopping bag with a handle. I took a strap from a duffle and added it to the shopping bag loop and threw it over my shoulder. The shopping bag then hung just below waist line which was perfect. I had the hose come out the waist band of my sweat pants and right into the shopping bag. Walking around was no issue in this configuration. People could not even see the hose. Just looked like I had a shopping bag on my shoulder.

I personally do not know much about BHP to answer you questions directly. What I would offer is that with a PSA of >100, though you don't want to hear it, it is quite likely there is Prostate Cancer involved. My understanding is BHP will elevate the PSA a good bit, but not to that level. Prostate cancer is not always felt in the DRE. That fact that his DRE found nothing is good. If something is felt, it can mean the disease is that much more advanced. In my case, 2 doctors detected a 3mm mass in the DRE. Yet my cancer appears have still been Prostate organ contained. So every case is different. The true indicator is the results of the biopsy. That tells you if there is cancer there, and at least the aggressiveness (Gleason score) and nature (how widely spread, how much in each core, etc.). The biopsy results, should they come up positive, can also be used to give a first glance at what the likelihood of spread beyond the Prostate would be based statistics from years and 10's of thousands of men. There is no direct answer, just statistical data. Should his biopsy come up positive, he'll have a lot of learning to do to figure out what course of treatment is best for him. Again there is no one answer, please do not let one doctor call the shots. Have him do his research, learn, talk to many specialists, and make his own decision. An excellent book to start with is Dr. Patrick Walsh's Guide to Surviving Prostate Cancer. It is a must read for anyone dealing with this stuff. Again, IF his biopsy comes up positive, post the details of the results here and we can offer many good suggestions on how to proceed. One good news piece is that Prostate Cancer tends to be slow growing, so people have time to do their research and make the best decision for them. Here's to hoping the biopsy comes out negative for Prostate Cancer and you can look to what other causes might be there to resolve the issues ! Let us know what you find out.

Here's to hoping the biopsy comes out negative for Prostate Cancer and you can look to what other causes might be there to resolve the issues ! Let us know what you find out. Best of luck to you and your uncle.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by w0rried Assuming if the original enlargement might have started several years back, unnoticed. Possible? That is not only possible but likely. Prostate Cancer is slow growing. IF he has PCa, with a PSA of 100, it is likely it's been growing for many years. My PSA was 4.5 (normal size prostate) and they estimate based on the quantity and type of cancer that it was growing for 5 years. I had regular PSA tests, they just were not indicative of cancer. Part of the nature and variety in this disease. As others have noted, as hard as it is, relax, wait for the biopsy, then IF it is positive you can deal with it in a careful and methodical manner. There is no hurry with this stuff unless it is so advanced into the bones and such. At your uncle's age there are numerous treatment choices which can give an excellent outcome (albeit each with their own side effects, understand them carefully) for longevity of life. I'm 49, I plan to live a long full happy life.",
