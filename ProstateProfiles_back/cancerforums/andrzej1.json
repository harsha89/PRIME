      "Content": "I recently had mp3TMRI and report found one lesion described and located as follows: \" in the 7 o'clock location of right peripheral zone on image 10 is a 5 mm nodule..... This is suggestive of a small volume of low to intermediate grade prostate cancer\" further down in the report under Impresion: \" Small indeterminate finding measuring 4X5 mm in the posterolateral right peripheral zone at the mid gland described above..... This either represents a small component of low to intermediate grade cancer versus inflammatory response\" So, I got a second opinion from two well known prostate MRI radiology experts confirming the above. Subsequently my uro knowing my MRI results referred me for a targeted biopsy, being a standard 12 core plus two additional cores in targeted areas as identified on MRI. MRI guided biopsy not available in my area. Today I just got pathology report as follows: Carcinoma Summary: Gleason score:3+3=6 found in right base lat, 15% of one core involved High grade PIN: identified in 4 cores out of 14 Extend of cancer on biopsies: 1/14 cores, approximately 1% of total core tissue. Targeted area on biopsy report was: Right apex TZ(transitional zone) So here is why I am confused, why biopsy radiologist targeted different area from one identified in MRI, MRI clearly identified \"right peripheral zone\" and biopsy targeted Right apex TZ(transitional zone) those are two different areas right?, am I correct?? And why area identified by biopsy with G6 was not found by 3 prostate expert radiologists reviewing my MRI, how it's possible?? now I wonder if I still have this MRI found lesion still lurking and growing?? but not found on biopsy need some explanation, please, before I see my urologist, thanks I am 68 years, live in Canada PSA 7.2 raising over the last 2-3 years from ~4.0 freePSA 18.2 PCA3 26 DRE negative",

The average 12-core \"blind\" biopsy misses tumors about 20% of the time.

      "Content": "Hello, I am 67 old with PSA slowly growing to currently at 6, recent test shows PCA3=26, %PSA free 23.3%, PSA free1.14, PSA total 4.9 I am not rushing for a biopsy and my urologist, very experienced one, is OK with this and I intend to have 3T MRI done (before possible biopsy) at Rolling Oaks Radiology, in Thousands Oaks, CA, under direction of Dr. Princenthal, anyone with any experience with this facility or this radiologist? Any comments will be apreciated, thanks, Andrew",

      "Content": "I am retired and already snowbirding in Arizona right now, I don't have \"lots of money\" but spending $895 is definitely worth to me and I can afford it to spend this on my care, single biopsy also can often tell nothing, and taking multiple biopsy is no fun",
