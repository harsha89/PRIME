      "Content": "Hi All First post on here, just been scanning through all the posts and I have a question. I see lots of PSA results being described as undetectable, but what reading actually classes as undetectable? A bit of background I had a blood test August 17 due to severe night sweats, one of the tests turned out to be PSA which was 9.8, I was referred to urology and had my first consultation in October, a further PSA showed 11.3 which I was told was not necessarily an increase but could be due to inacurate readings. I had 2 DREs, MRI and bone scan which were all clear but biopsy showed 4 out of 12 positive Gleeson score was 3+5. I opted for RARP which was carried out 5th December 17 and I was very happy with the outcome. My first post op appointment was Feb 18 and my PSA was 0.023 Gleason score 7, I was overjoyed until the consultant said that they tumour had been more agressive than first thought and started to push me towards HT and Radiotherapy. I can't understand why with a PSA of 0.023 and Gleason score 1 point lower I should need further treatment.",

      "Content": "Thanks for the responses, yes I am from the UK, consultant said that Cancer \"could\" have left the capsule, Lymph nodes and nerve bundles were left and I am schedueled for another PSA in around 8 weeks and as most will know 8 weeks is a hell of a long time when you are waiting for something so important. Yes the first meeting with the surgeon was Feb 18th, (trying to answer all the questions asked) Apart from the Gleason score and the details above I have no further information from the post op report. Forgot to mention I have 4 UTIs since my surgery and only finished antibiotics today.",
