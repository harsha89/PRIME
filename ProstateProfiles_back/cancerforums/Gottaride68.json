    "Content": "It's been 14 mons since my surgery, my bladder control has come back, I'll say 80%. I consulted with a new surgeon, (different from the RP) he says I'm right in the middle between the two methods, the mechanical sphincter, and the sling. He did a scope check, and he suggests the sling. So I am booked in for surgery June 15/16. My question; how are others who have had reconstructive surgery experience, outcome, progress? My surgeon has informed me, in the future, I still might have some leakage, but for the most part, the sling will make a difference.",
