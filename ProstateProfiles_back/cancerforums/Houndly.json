They have botched most of what they've had to do so far and are difficult to reach. Does anyone have any good experiences with practices in the Northern VA area?",

      "Content": "Yes, I'll be changing urologists. I don't need the extra stress. I'm working with the lab to try to get the bill partly paid- somehow they're able to get some coverage allowed even though they are not in network. But the urology practice said they'd take care of it and didn't. Then I had my consult scheduled with the doctor, I took the day off work (vacation day), and they canceled 1 hour prior, saying they hadn't scheduled it for the right amount of time (an hour). They said the doc would call back. No call. The office has no voice mail, either during or after hours, and no email. Oh, sure, you can wait in the queue for half and hour or more, but I can't do that at work. Last time I just drove over there on my day off instead- it was faster. They're understaffed and seems like they're just churning patients through. I appreciate the advice here- not just in reply to my post, but all the stuff that's been posted. I also have a cancer survivor colleague at work, who's been very supportive and helpful. If I go with Johns Hopkins, is it still good to find a local urologist, or is an oncologist better? How does one approach JH? Sorry for the stupid questions.",

      "Content": "Thanks for the suggestions. I've been thinking about Johns Hopkins, but I really wanted some other opinions. I'm 54. In October I had a PHI test done as a follow up to the PSA tests. Here are the results: PSA Total: 8.4 (on 9/19/ it was 7.6, DRE normal) PSA Free: 1.03 pro2PSA: 14.79 % Free PSA: 12 Prostate Health Index (PHI): 41.6 The biopsy numbers, from Feb., what I was given, anyway, are: 16 cores: Left lat apex: Gleason 3+3=6, 10% of specimen Left lat mid: Atypical small acinar proliferation, suspicious Left medial base: Gleason 3+3=6, 10% of specimen The rest benign. Biopsy was done by Bostwick (which is out of my network, without being told it would be done with them, so I'm working on them to get at least some of the $3K+ paid anyway- no help at all from my urology practice). A second Urologist who looked at the numbers noted that it's very low risk with almost no metastatic potential. He suggested besides the surgery option that I consider active surveillance. I did have a bone scan, abdominal/pelvic CT scan with contrast, and chest x-ray, all of which were clean. I had an appendectomy a couple of years ago, which revealed some carcinoids there, and that's what got me thinking, then the rising PSA numbers. In the last six months I've also done a colonoscopy (clean except for hemorrhoids), kidney ultrasound (I had a kidney stone recently) and an upper endoscopy (some issues there, but not related to cancer). Prostate is enlarged some also, but not to the point of giving me much problem urinating- just not like my young days",
