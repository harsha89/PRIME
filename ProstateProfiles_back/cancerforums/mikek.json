      "Content": "this site has been invaluable to me, so thanks to all who have contributed... I am 58. My dad, his brother and their uncle all died as a result of prostate cancer in their 80's. Have been diligent with PSA, DRE and Urine workups.. -PSA has been .4 or .5 for more than 15 years -small prostate 30 cc. -No real problems with urination, etc.. -All very good until... Lumps discovered on DRE in January. MRI was taken as part of fusion biopsy. MRI report says Lesions in both nodules: -left is 15mm by 10mm, \"characteristics are highly concerning for malignancy\", \"capsular disruption suspected and potential invasion into seminal vessel\" -also a smaller lesion 4mm by 4mm may or may not be part of larger one. -right is 9mm by 5mm with the same characteristics of larger left lesion. Fusion biposy done 5 days ago -30 samples taken 16 from lesions and 14 general. -should have results in another week or so... Concerned would be an understatement!!! Having watched my dad go through this I vowed to get this out of me if I ever had any inkling of cancer.. I know I am getting ahead of myself but have two questions: -does anyone have any experience with procedures in Jacksonville Florida that they can share.. I live very near the Mayo clinic.. -the same question about NYC, I have relations at Memorial Sloan but would take a view on docs there and anywhere else in NYC -has anyone had similar results to mine, ie such a low psa and had cancer? Thanks to all...",
