      "Content": "Thanks for that az! As I said to my regular doc (G.P. over here), \"We don't know what we don't know\", so there's little point in worrying about \"What if?\".....but we do. Your insight gives me a lot of comfort & reassurance (always with the caveat that we're only as good as our next PSA test!). I hadn't thought of the assay, in spite of the fact that kit by Siemens - Immulite was subject of a furore over here and was withdrawn. The first and last of the recent three tests were done in my local hospital, while the middle was in the Uro's hospital lab. I'll make enquires via some of teh Cancer Support organisations I'm involved with, to see of there has been any change in procedures/assay methods. Yes your \"POSSIBLE explanation\" HAS helped! Thanks!",

      "Content": "Thanks guys. Yeah, i know the answer...but I'm in a lot better place than I was just yesterday. What's puzzling me is the way this is working out: 5.5 years with no rise whatsoever. Then trebles (from a very low base) in 6 months. At that point, I was expecting another rise, maybe to 0.07/0.08, but it stayed static at 0.06. Now, two moths later, it's fallen to 0.05. I'm an Engineer, not a Uro. I look at/for data trends. This just looks random, of late. It's this type of movement that I'm querying.",

      "Content": "It's been a couple of years since I posted here - In the meantime, I've \"dropped in\" occasionally. I had an open RP in May 2008. Gleason 8 (4+4), Cancer in one lobe, Negative Margins, Lymph nodes & Seminal Vessicles taken - all negative. Nerve spared on \"free\" side. My PSA was 0.02 from surgery all thro' to Mar 2013. Then, out of the blue, it was 0.06 in Oct, prior to my first annual visit (up to Sep 2012, I was on 6 month visits) to my Uro. The Uro had my bloods taken again that day, 30 days after the previous one, and it was the same, 0.06. The Uro put me on 6 month visits, with PSA tests every three months. It's only been two months since the last test, but, as I was having my Thyroid tests done, I had the PSA taken early. I got the results today and PSA is down slightly, to 0.05. I know that 0.05/0.06 is regarded as undetectable, and many here would love to have levels like that, but my Uro was very concerned about the sudden rise, having been so low for so long. Thank God it has dropped/is stable - I was \"crapping myself\" that it was on an upward trend - PSA Anxiety rears its head again! I'm a long way (I hope) from being diagnosed with Recurrence, but can anyone throw some insight into what's going on? Not scheduled to see Uro until May. PS: Other than that still doing fine. No incontinence, but leak a little when running. ED is a bit of an issue, but 'still have a grin, between the sheets'. Running is getting worse (by my own standards) but I'm still running Marathons - 3:49, last October, @ age 60.",
