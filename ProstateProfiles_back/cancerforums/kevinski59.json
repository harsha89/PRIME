    "Content": "I just learned i have prostate cancer. in the biopsy 3 cores out of 12 were 9's with 30% involvement, the rest 6's with 60% involvement. Urologist talked RP or RP with radiation. Must get bone scan and cat scan. I am concerned that different teams of doctors recommend what they are good at. Is there any clear evidence that one treatment is better than another. I;m confused. Does anyone have similar circumstances i am 59. kevinski59",
