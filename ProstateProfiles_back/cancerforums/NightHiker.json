      "Content": "Originally Posted by bomber I am 4 weeks post Davinci surgery/ Not sure if I should be drinking lots of water or only 2-3 glasses a day. Can I drink coffee alcohol etc. I am dry at nite but leak when walking bending etc. Tried doing the Keagels during the day and at nite. I think doing them early makes me worse with the leakage at nite??/. Just really tired of the depend and being wet?? Bomber, I'm 2wks post DaVinci RP today. Incontinence was a big concern of mine and I did some research on the topic. If your control is not good then drinking excess fluid can result more leakage (as you would expect), too little fluid intake can cause dehydration, increase the likelihood of bladder infection and can irritate the bladder (increase the probability of bladder spasms w/ muscle contractions and \"squirts\"). So you have to find a balance for your body. If your urine is dark yellow you're probably not getting enough fluids. Food and drinks that \"may\" irritate the bladder include caffeine, carbonated drinks, alcohol, chocolate, citrus fruits, spicy foods and more (as if that isn't almost everything). To increase my odds 1wk prior to surgery I cut all alcohol, caffeine and carbonated drinks. Just couldn't cut the chocolate though. Since my control has been good post-surgery I am going to start adding some items back into my diet. Today I hit Starbucks for a latte first time in several weeks with no issues - woohoo. So you may want to try cutting many of the items that can cause bladder irritation and add them in slowly to gauge the effect they have on you. Best of luck to you.",

I was so confident going into the biopsy that I was going to either come up \"clean\" or worst case still a low volume 3+3 that I talked the Urologist into only taking 8 cores (12 total but 4 went to PASS study). I questioned 2 very experienced urologists on falling PSA and basically just got a shrug. What was significant for them was the biopsy result. In their mind pathology was a total override on the fact that the PSA dropped and was below 4. I've typically been careful about trying not to do things that may affect PSA readings a few days prior to my testing (bike riding, sex, strenuous exercise). So based on what I've been reading and have experienced I think it's hard to have an exacting correlation between PSA readings and volume and aggressiveness of cancer. I think to many things other than cancer can affect the PSA levels for it to be an exacting science.",

      "Content": "Hi all. I've been lurking here for several months off and on and thought I would step forward and share my story. First I would like to say I'm very appreciative for this forum and those of you who share your experiences, opinions and suggestions. It's been very helpful for me to read your stories. I was diagnosed with Gleason 6 (3+3) a little over 3 yrs ago and have been on AS since then. Latest biopsy (August 2014) resulted in higher volume and grade of cancer (50% volume of Gleason 3+4 in 1 of 8 cores). After the Gleason 7 diagnosis my Dr cautioned against continuing on AS and recommended that I seek more aggressive treatment. At my age (57) and otherwise good health his opinion was that my PCa would be life limiting. This particular Dr only performed open surgery so an open RP was his recommendation. After considering the treatment options, reading this forum and talking with various doctors I somewhat reluctantly decided on RP. I selected an experienced surgeon (over 3000 DaVinci robotic RPs) in the Seattle area and I have RP scheduled in about a week. However, as this date approaches, reservations on going through with the surgery become stronger. I scheduled the surgery over a month ago with the idea that I could always cancel at the last minute. Somewhere in the back of my mind (maybe not even that far back) I had the hope that diet and lifestyle changes (which I've made great progress on in the last 3yrs) could allow my immune system to keep what I believe to be a slow growing cancer at bay without aggressive treatment. My goal has been to delay treatment as long as possible and even now I vacillate as to whether I really need to take aggressive action now or whether I can wait another year or 2 or maybe longer. Less than 10% of the cancer found was Gleason grade 4 so my pathology appears to be Big3-Tiny4 Gleason 7. I had the pathology confirmed by John Hopkins. But I read stories here of those having surgery and being downgraded to Gleason 3+3 (even from Gleason 4+4). Not sure how that happens, especially when you have 2 good Path labs give you a higher grade prior to surgery? I would be confident with staying on AS if I knew my cancer was truly a Gleason 3+3. Many of you with similar grade (Gleason 6 & 7) seemed very confident in your decisions to pursue treatment with the hopes of having the cancer removed. Just doesn't seem to be as clear of a decision for me. I read that some of you wanted to \"put the cancer behind you\". Practically speaking, even in the best of outcomes, do you ever really? Even if your PSA stays low don't you always have it in the back of your mind?",

I selected an experienced surgeon (over 3000 DaVinci robotic RPs) in the Seattle area and I have RP scheduled in about a week. However, as this date approaches, reservations on going through with the surgery become stronger. I scheduled the surgery over a month ago with the idea that I could always cancel at the last minute. Somewhere in the back of my mind (maybe not even that far back) I had the hope that diet and lifestyle changes (which I've made great progress on in the last 3yrs) could allow my immune system to keep what I believe to be a slow growing cancer at bay without aggressive treatment. My goal has been to delay treatment as long as possible and even now I vacillate as to whether I really need to take aggressive action now or whether I can wait another year or 2 or maybe longer. Less than 10% of the cancer found was Gleason grade 4 so my pathology appears to be Big3-Tiny4 Gleason 7. I had the pathology confirmed by John Hopkins. But I read stories here of those having surgery and being downgraded to Gleason 3+3 (even from Gleason 4+4). Not sure how that happens, especially when you have 2 good Path labs give you a higher grade prior to surgery? I would be confident with staying on AS if I knew my cancer was truly a Gleason 3+3. Many of you with similar grade (Gleason 6 & 7) seemed very confident in your decisions to pursue treatment with the hopes of having the cancer removed. Just doesn't seem to be as clear of a decision for me. I read that some of you wanted to \"put the cancer behind you\". Practically speaking, even in the best of outcomes, do you ever really? Even if your PSA stays low don't you always have it in the back of your mind?",

      "Content": "Nice to hear you are doing so well. I had a similar experience as you. I live over 2hrs from my urologist office and after catheter removal I was surprised that I was dry on the ride home. We stopped at a couple of stores on the way home and at both I felt a pretty high urgency to pee - but both times found I was dry and able to pee fairly normally. My bladder volume seemed limited and urgency high but at least I was able to hold it and keep dry. My level of control was a fine line in that I barely relaxed and the flow was immediate. I also had to pee quite frequently at first but this improved greatly over the next couple of weeks. Now after 3mos I feel my bladder capacity is back to normal. A couple of days after catheter removal I went on my first longer hike (4mi)..... I had no leakage problems at all with the ups and downs of the trail. However, the first time I did the 'ol turn the head \"farmer's blow\" I felt a small squirt. I contract the pelvic muscles and repeated and was able to hold it. So from then on anytime I sneezed, coughed or blew my nose I would bear down prior. The body quickly adapts and I think I just do it automatically now. I now notice no stress incontinence in any activities. I have resumed my daily workout routines and also do not experience stress incontinence (I don't do heavy lifting but squats and lunges with 10lb in each hand are not an issue). Went skiing twice this past week with my son and was completely dry thru the whole day. And, I'm leaving for 9 days of backpacking in the Grand Canyon next month with some friends and have no worries whatsoever about that trip (even sleeping in a 2 man tent after a long day on the trail ) . I can't be more pleased with the results of my surgery and do give my surgeon a great deal of the credit. Going into this I wondered if I would ever be back to where I am now after this relatively short time. I do believe surgeons are constantly improving their technique and level of expertise (they call it a \"practice\" for a reason) and can only hope that we'll see a higher percentage of similar favorable outcomes for early detection cancers.",
