    "Content": "Hi all, I was feeling slighted by the universe getting PC \"so young.\" I just turned 60 a couple weeks ago. After seeing the ages on this forum of those fellows who have had this disease (many 40's and 50's) I feel more fortunate and humbled for feeling sorry for myself. My Dad was 76 when diagnosed, had external beam radiation, and will, God willing, celebrate his 83rd birthday in August with no recurrence. Because f my relatively young age, my doctor recommended surgery rather than radiation because of the greater chance of cure. I am now two days shy of 5 weeks post op and things are going OK. I'm impatient so I want to be back to normal RIGHT NOW, but the logical side of me realizes I will likely never be fully back to \"normal.\" Down to two pads a day and improving continence each day so I am optimistic that will be normal again. Sexual function is another matter. I had some challenges before surgery, in fact, was on Cialis 5mg daily and Testosterone prior to diagnosis. I am able to have an orgasm but nothing like an erection that would allow penetration. Maybe that will come in time. OK, here are my stats...I want you to look at the PSA number as a warning. The PSA is not an absolute indicator of PC. Diagnosed 1/28/13. PSA 3.7, biopsy positive 2 of 12 specimens. 3+4=7 and 4+3=7 DaVinci Surgery 3/29/13 Pathology: negative lymph nodes, negative margins. Cancer confined to Prostate with 10% involvement, T1c stage. Catheter removed 4/8/13 too many pads to count initially 2- 3 pads per day currently I will be back diving at 5 weeks and 3 days post op. Take that to the bank.",
