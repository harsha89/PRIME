      "Content": "New to forum today. Seeking information as to where in Southeast US to get Saturated 3D Perineal Mapping Biopsy performed? Even if I have to pay out of pocket I would like to know who is performing this type of biopsy. I am located in Aiken, SC, 30 minutes from Augusta, GA. I am 69 and have 20+ year history of prostatitis with some events of spiking PSA as high as 10. Had TRUS biopsy done 12 years ago and it was negative. PSA's done annually for past 10 years have been 1.0 or less. 2 months ago PSA was 3.0, one month ago 3.1 and this past week 6.1. Recent DRE and Ultrasound indicated slight enlargement but smooth and no pain. Seeing urologist this week to talk next steps. Urologist will most likely do MRI next and then biopsy along with more blood and urine tests. Thanks for your help.",

      "Content": "Thanks MF! The advice I am getting is very informative and helpful. Phone conversation with Uro last night led to ordering more non-invasive molecular blood and urine tests along with another PSA soon. Pending those results will talk about doing MRI with or without contrast. I was glad to hear that URO is not in favor of jumping into another TRUS biopsy right away since my first one 12 years ago was negative and I have experienced one other time when my PSA spiked quickly to 10 and came back down to consistent 1.0's. No saturated perineal biopsy recommended till we do all the things above first. Thanks again, SC",
