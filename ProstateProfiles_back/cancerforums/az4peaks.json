      "Content": "Hi MM, - It appears that you are presently stabilized at roughly ½ of what would, normally, be considered a clinically \"detectable\" PSA. A sudden increase that then stabilizes is more likely from some procedural change in the Laboratory, than it is from PCa, although the time between tests could also have some impact as well. A change in the assay used is one possibility, as is a change in calibration, a switch in the Standardization from the WHO Standard to the Hybritech Standard (or vice versa) or some combination of these. Importantly, laboratory variability can range from 20\u201325% depending upon the type of standardization used. Assays using the 1999 World Health Organization standard yield results 20\u201325% lower than those using the Hybritech standard. It strongly recommended to use the same assay for longitudinal monitoring, because PSA assays are not interchangeable and there is no acknowledged conversion factor between them. I always recommend confirming an \"abnormal\" PSA and establishing a reliable trend, if one exists. This sometimes takes time and a variation of .01 ng/ml in hyper-sensitive PSA readings is often clinically meaningless, particularly when a slight reduction. As long as there is no steady upward trend recognized and it remains below the traditional 0.1 ng/ml threshold, most would consider it as clinically \"undetectable\". Hope this POSSIBLE explanation helps! - [email protected] (aka) az4peaks .",

      "Content": "Hi AIO, - Congratulations! Your treatment choices for your Prostate Cancer (PCa), so far at least, seem to have been extremely good ones and the post treatment pathology results appear to be \"outstanding\" for a Gleason 9 patient. I hope you are as encouraged as you should be, by the significantly favorable indicators contained in your post surgical Pathology Report. BECAUSE you chose surgery at age 50 years, you have available to you, the most reliable scientific evidence, examination of the excised gland by direct examination under the microscope, that is presently available. You also have the satisfaction of having had the best possible results of the simultaneous relatively extended lymphadectomy, showing no observation of malignant invasion in the 15 lymph nodes that were removed, which is very encouraging that, at this time, there is no evidence of PCa extension into the lymph system. Of course, only time will tell whether you have had a permanent \"cure\" by your choices and your next key element in weighing success, is the post surgical PSA monitoring. Again one of the advantages for those patients selecting surgery as the appropriate treatment of choice in their situation, are the relatively clear-cut definitions of successful and failed treatment. Their application is also relatively quick. TECHNICALLY, the established half-life of PSA residual remaining in the body following radical prostatectomy, of any form, is approximately 4 to 6 weeks, however because there are always exceptions to the rule, many Urologists obtain the first PSA at 10 to 12 weeks, to assure clearance of any significant residual PSA from the body. At this time the PSA result should be \"clinically undetectable\", which is usually defined as LESS THAN 0.1 ng/ml (<0.1) and, optimally, should remain there on all future results. As long as it does, you will be considered, \"PCa free\". The schedule for regular monitoring PSA's vary by individual Physicians and Institutions and the circumstances involved but ROUTINE monitoring PSA's are usually done in 3 month intervals initially, and with \"undetectable\" results, progressing to 6 month and/or, eventually, to 12 month intervals. Your ED recovery is way ahead of the average results reported and your incontinence will hopefully resolve relatively quickly and completely, as well. It is usually recommended that 6 weeks pass before resuming ALL normal activities, so be careful to promote healing. To answer your specific question as to \"painful\" and/or \"restricted\" urination; it could be irritation of the urethra caused by catheter or infection, but if the stream is significantly restricted, it could be the formation of stricture forming scar tissue during healing. Stricture can also result in urine retention and/or incomplete emptying of the bladder, which can cause and/or contribute to such morbidity as urgency and/or frequency and most often requires physician intervention to correct. Talk with your Urologist, if troubling, The path which your Surgeon/Urologist has assigned to you and the recommendations he has made sound extremely reasonable. My impression is that you have a very competent Urologist whose reasoning seems spot-on to me. Good luck! - [email protected] (aka) az4peaks P.S. If you will E-mail me, I will furnish you with a very recent Study that evaluated results of early salvage radiation therapy (SRT) vs. adjuvant (ART), which favored SRT when everything was considered.

If the chances of \"cure\" are determined to be small, or non-existent, because the disease is thought to be systemic, then an effective treatment regimen is pretty much limited to some form of Hormone Therapy (HT), usually starting with Androgen Deprivation Therapy (ADT).

      "Content": "Hi alihamilton, - The prostate sits immediately in front of the colon and any residual problems relating to the previous Radiation Therapy (RT) for his rectal Cancer, would likely be exacerbated by further radiation, even though RT is more precise today than ever. But, at this point, you don't know that he has Prostate Cancer (PCa) and therefore it may not be necessary. It is true that a high PSA is often a sign of PCa, but it is also a sign of BPH (Benign Prostate Hyperplasia) and Prostatitis, both of which are NOT Cancer, but benign conditions. BPH, you are already familiar with and Prostatitis, which is inflammation, often caused by infection. Bacterial infections are often transient in nature and an anti-bacterial medication like Cipro is usually very effective in resolving the problem, if prescribed for 4-6 weeks. But not ALL Prostatitis is bacterial in origin. Chronic Prostatitis often is NOT and is therefore usually much more difficult to cure, or even adequately control. Since symptoms of all three diseases are very similar, it often becomes a matter of elimination to determine which is the main culprit. Many times, more than one may be, at least temporarily, contributing to the elevated PSA readings. IN GENERAL, if the PSA trend has been STEADILY upward, it is more likely a result of PCa or BPH, while PSA readings from Prostatitis tend to be more erratic. The fact that his PSA has only risen 3 points in the 10 years from 61 to 71 y/o, would normally be a very encouraging sign, and may still be, but the TURP surely would have altered his readings because of the de-bulking it entails, somewhat distorting it's true significance. The TURP relieves the symptoms of BPH, but does nothing to control its future growth so, depending on when it was done, BPH may well be a factor again. I would suggest that if he has not already put his PSA results in chronological order on paper, that he does so and preferably chart it on graph paper, where PSA trends can be easily spotted. They are more informative than any single reading. A Pathologist directly viewing Biopsy obtained tissue under the microscope, is the ONLY widely accepted method of diagnosing PCa so eventually, that will probably be necessary.

      "Content": "Hi Mimi, - Lymph Nodes are found on both sides of the body and I can completely understand why you \"wonder\" when a supposed lymph node can't be \"grossly identified\" (seen by the naked eye), when that was what it is supposed to have been excised. But pragmatically, it makes little difference now, since the surgery has been completed and only one lymph node was present upon pathologic examination and that one was \"negative\" for PCa involvement. This finding is good, but with only one lymph node examined, its true value is deflated to a point of relatively limited significance. ALL of this, however, is trumped by the results of future PSA monitoring that is necessary with ALL forms of treatment. . Let's look at the additional FAVORABLE aspects of his \u201cpathologic\u201d results: No EPE (extra-prostatic extension)= Good, No SVI (seminal vesicle involvement)= VERY good and the identified PNI appears to have been found in tissue within the Prostate Capsule (intra-) rather than having escaped outside.= Good For reference purposes: a \"normal\" adult Prostate, UNAFFECTED by BPH (Benign Prostate Hyperplasia or Hypertrophy), USALLY runs between 20 to 24cc in size. BPH is the natural (non-cancerous) growth of the Prostate that occurs in most men (in widely varying degrees) after about 40 years of age, often continuing to increase in size as age advances The tumors \u201cpathologic\u201d result of pT2 is the LOWEST (most favorable), and also the most common, found in American men that are diagnosed today. There is NOT a T1 tumor classification in the \u201cpathologic\u201d TNM Staging System UNLIKE the \u201cclinical\u201d TNM Tables that do include a T1 designation. The \u201cclinical\u201d designation is applicable to Biopsy Pathology Reports and other testing that report only on SAMPLES of the whole Prostate. Therefore there is always the rhetorical question as to whether the SAMPLES accurately reflect the state of ALL cancer that may be present in the TOTAL Prostate Gland. A significant number do not! ONLY men choosing radical surgery as their primary treatment have the advantage of the Pathology results from the much more accurately reliable \u201cpathologic\u201d Pathology Report, due to the POST-SURGICAL availability of the entire excised Prostate Gland for direct examination. To better understand the relative risk of recurrence, let\u2019s put your husband\u2019s present situation into the easily understood context of the most reliable estimation of the future risk for recurrence, in my OPINION. Under the latest recommended Johns Hopkins system for more clearly defining \u201cprognostic risk\u201d based upon Gleason Score reporting, your husband would be classified as Group 2 out of 5 progressively worsening risk categories. The group 2 risk category is next to the most favorable ranking possible and is there because it most often progresses most similarly with the very favorable Gleason 6 and under. Five Gleason Groups Based on Prognosis Prognostic Group I: Gleason score <=6, Prognostic Group II: Gleason score 3+4=7 Prognostic Group III: Gleason score 4+3=7 Prognostic Group IV: Gleason score 8 Prognostic Group V: Gleason score 9-10 . If you wish to see the entire article summarizing their results, contact me at the e-mail listed in my signature and I will provide a copy by return e-mail. I believe this helps put things in a proper and more understandable, perspective for many patients. So, all in all, your husband\u2019s future looks pretty darn good, as far as contemplated Cancer control is concerned although, as you know, no results can be guaranteed. Congratulations on the favorable prognosis and I hope this helps better deal with your concerns. \u2013 [email protected] (aka) az4peaks",

      "Content": "Hi creekrat, - Simply put, \"SALVAGE THERAPY\" is any secondary treatment initiated after the initial \"primary\" treatment has failed and signs of a recurrence have been identified. \"Salvage THERAPY\" is applicable to ANY secondary treatment that is administered in an attempt to supplement the effects of the original treatment, with the intent to complete a \"cure\". This is true whether the Primary treatment choice was surgery, radiation or any one of the \"other\" forms available. In the case of \"failed\" SURGERY (usually defined as 2 successive post-operative PSA readings of 0.2 ng/ml or more) is most often treated with \"salvage RADIATION', which is administered in some form of \"external-beam\" delivery. SALVAGE THERAPY is only given to those demonstrating active signs of Primary TREATMENT \"failure\". In the case of \"failed\" Primary RADIATION treatment, salvage SURGERY is NOT the most favored choice of Secondary treatment not because it is not possible to do but, pragmatically, rather because of the exceedingly elevated percentages of accompanying permanent morbidity statistics (side effects) and diminished satisfaction rates, reported in most Studies that objectively address the subject. More often, Cryotherapy (freezing) and/or HIFU (heating) are recommended as Salvage Treatments although in some specific circumstances Brachytherapy (internal radiation/seeds) MAY be possible. Technically, what Chuck has described as adjuvant radiation is, in actuality, NEO-ADJUVANT radiation, which is radiation that is administered as part of a pre-planned COMBINATION therapy administered either simultaneously or immediately following the Primary treatment. In the case of \"failed\" SURGERY (usually defined as 2 successive post-operative PSA readings of 0.2 ng/ml or more) is most often treated with \"salvage RADIATION', which is administered in some form of \"external-beam\" delivery. SALVAGE THERAPY is only given to those demonstrating active signs of Primary TREATMENT \"failure\". In the case of \"failed\" Primary RADIATION treatment, salvage SURGERY is NOT the most favored choice of Secondary treatment not because it is not possible to do but, pragmatically, rather because of the exceedingly elevated percentages of accompanying permanent morbidity statistics (side effects) and diminished satisfaction rates, reported in most Studies that objectively address the subject. More often, Cryotherapy (freezing) and/or HIFU (heating) are recommended as Salvage Treatments although in some specific circumstances Brachytherapy (internal radiation/seeds) MAY be possible. Technically, what Chuck has described as adjuvant radiation is, in actuality, NEO-ADJUVANT radiation, which is radiation that is Primary treatment. ADJUVANT radiation is also often administered prophylactically (with preventative intent), as not everyone receiving it has already failed treatment, but it can be done anytime within 6 months of initial therapy and is often administered based upon the statistical RISK of POTENTIAL recurrence and preliminary results, rather than an acknowledged Primary treatment failure. Logically, neo-adjuvant and adjuvant patients should ALWAYS have better STATISTICAL results than salvage patients in comparative Study results, because they have the real statistical advantage of including \"successful\" results from \"RISK\" patients that may have stabilized at extremely low PSA levels from initial treatment and would never have advanced to recognized \"failure\" standards. I believe that this built-in statistical advantage is probably what Logo is referring to as potentially \"skewed\" results in some other Posts. The same is true of those radiation Studies that implement intervention at extremely low monitoring PSA levels, based upon hyper/ultra-sensitive PSA results, such as 0.02 ng/ml. They SHOULD have better statistical success rates than those at higher levels because, AGAIN, they get to include as successes, those OVER-TREATED patients that would have never reached the more accepted Primary treatment failure standards. Treatment decisions are, and in my opinion should be, personal choices that are made for a variety of reasons, including their own individual personality characteristics. There are no absolutely right or wrong choices, since NO ONE can ever know what the results of any OTHER decision would have been, so no second guessing is ever productive, regardless of eventual results. Good Luck! - [email protected] (aka) az4peaks",

      "Content": "Hi NJ116 - The first thing that I would suggest that you do, is get a copy of your Post surgical PathologyReport, so that you have direct access to the information you need to make any informed decisions. Certainly it would have been more comforting to have your pst-op PSA to have been <0.2 ng/ml, BUT the fact that you had a reading of 0.02 ng/ml is hardly a logical reason to immediately move to secondary treatment such as Radiation, in my layman's opinion. There are many men who stabilize at levels below the traditional 0.1 ng/ml that constitutes a clinically reliable \"detectable\" PSA reading. This is why the trend of the following readings are of important significance during the observation stage following and the fact that your next PSA reading was higher MAY be a significant marker showing advancement of your PSA reading. In my opinion, however, at such a highly sensitive level in the very low 4/100ths of a single gram, it MAY also Not be caused by recurrent Cancer. Only time and at least another additional result may start to clarify the situation. If the trend continues significantly upward then secondary treatment may well be in your future, but if it stabilizes a a level below 0.1, I would probably choose to continue to monitor until recurrence is more clearly defined, but you may feel differently. Some aggressive Cancer specialists have decided to act with salvage procedures at levels below the traditional 0.2 ng/ml, but most still adhere the higher levels of failure thresholds. Some Studies have shown that radiation instated at levels below 1.0 nanogram per milliliter have better results and preferably before PSA readings reach 0.5 ng/ml (5/10ths) is even better, but you are substantially below that measurement at present. Although adjuvant treatment, which is precautionary in higher risk cases shows some limited improvement, over salvage treatment results, we must remember that ALL salvage patients have already failed initial treatment, while those opting for neo-adjuvant or adjuvant treatment have not yet failed Primary treatment and we know that, statistically, some would not have needed secondary treatment to remain biochemically stable at levels below the \"treatment failure\" threshold. But these are the complicating factors found in making such difficult decisions, since we are rarely comparing \"apples to apples\" patients in PCa.

By definition, in the AJCC 7th edition it specifies p\"t3b\" as the appropriate designation when Seminal Vesicle invasion is identified. The two statements CONFLICT and you may wish to check to see which is correct, so that your signature information is accurate. Perhaps it was a typo or the t2a was actually the CLINICAL (pre-surgery) Staging, which would be replaced by the more accurate Pathologic Stage. Just wanted to bring the error to your attention, to handle as you wish. It MIGHT have some significance in light of your complaints. Best regards! - [email protected] (aka) az4peaks",

      "Content": "Otega ASKED, \"Perhaps someone can give us a link to such opinions about trends in brachytherapy.\" My response: Hi Otago and ALL, - Here are the results of a formal Study done on the subject, based upon SEER results at the time! - [email protected] (aka) az4peaks. Prostate Brachytherapy Use Decreasing The proportion of cases treated with this modality decreased by 14.3% from 2004 to 2010. Brachytherapy for low-risk prostate cancer (PCa) may be on the decline, according to study findings presented at the American Society of Clinical Oncology annual meeting in Chicago. In addition, a growing proportion of low-risk PCa cases is not being treated. Kamran A. Ahmed, MD, and collaborators at the H. Lee Moffitt Cancer Center & Research Institute in Tampa, Fla., analyzed recent trends in the management of clinically localized PCa using 2004\u20132010 data from the Survival, Epidemiology and End Results (SEER) database. The study population consisted of 216,785 men with low-, intermediate-, and high-risk PCa. For patients with low-risk PCa, use of brachytherapy decreased by 14.3% over the study period, whereas the use of no treatment increased by 15.7% and use of radical prostatectomy increased by 7.6%. In multivariate analysis, patients were more likely to receive no treatment if they were single, diagnosed in 2010 compared with earlier years, had low-risk disease versus high-risk disease, were African American versus white, and were older than 65 years compared with 65 or younger. A decline in the use of brachytherapy for localized PCa has been documented previously. In a study of 1.5 million patients treated for localized PCa from 1998 to 2010, Marc C. Smaldone, MD, and colleagues at Fox Chase Cancer Center in Philadelphia found that the proportion of patients undergoing brachytherapy peaked at 16.8% in 2002 and then declined steadily to a low of 8% in 2010, according to a paper published online ahead of print in Cancer. Meanwhile, during the study period, the percentage of patients treated with radical prostatectomy increased from 46.1% in 1998 to 59.1% in 2010. The change in clinical practice with the greatest impact on the use of brachytherapy during the study period is likely the substantial increase in the number of radical surgeries performed, possible due to the adoption of robot-assisted laparoscopic prostatectomy, according to Dr. Smaldone's group. In adjusted analyses, increasing age and Medicare coverage were associated with a greater likelihood of receiving brachytherapy. Patients with intermediate- or high-risk PCa, Medicaid insurance, increasing comorbidity burden, and later year of diagnosis were less likely to receive brachytherapy. -30-",

Smaldone, MD, and colleagues at Fox Chase Cancer Center in Philadelphia found that the proportion of patients undergoing brachytherapy peaked at 16.8% in 2002 and then declined steadily to a low of 8% in 2010, according to a paper published online ahead of print in Cancer. Meanwhile, during the study period, the percentage of patients treated with radical prostatectomy increased from 46.1% in 1998 to 59.1% in 2010. The change in clinical practice with the greatest impact on the use of brachytherapy during the study period is likely the substantial increase in the number of radical surgeries performed, possible due to the adoption of robot-assisted laparoscopic prostatectomy, according to Dr. Smaldone's group. In adjusted analyses, increasing age and Medicare coverage were associated with a greater likelihood of receiving brachytherapy. Patients with intermediate- or high-risk PCa, Medicaid insurance, increasing comorbidity burden, and later year of diagnosis were less likely to receive brachytherapy. -30-",

      "Content": "Hi boeinguy, - From what you have posted, I would say that you have ASAP (Atypical Small Acinar Proliferation) that is considered as \"highly suspicious for Prostate Cancer (PCa)\", but cannot be clearly identified as such. So, at this time, I would not consider myself as having been diagnosed with PCa. I would suggest that first, you get copies of the Pathology Reports from both of your Biopsies, if you have not already. Second, I would ask that the slides from those biopsies be sent for a second opinion, to a recognized authority on examining Prostate tissue, such as Johns Hopkins, under the direction of renowned Pathologist, Dr. Epstein. The details can be found here: http://pathology.jhu.edu/department/...s/urologic.cfm If you are found to actually have PCa, it would APPEAR, from what you have Posted, to have been caught early and you may well be a candidate for Active Surveillance (AS), along with other options,, but AS should be determined and overseen by a competent Urologist. I would be happy to try and answer any questions you may have. Please note that I am NOT a Physician but, rather, a well informed layman with a 30 year Medical Administration background and 15 year successful PCa treatment survivor and PCa \"educator\". My input should not be considered as professional medical advice. - Good luck! - [email protected] (aka) az4peaks",

A rapid rise from 2.0 to 5.3 in just 4 weeks time calls for action, which (s)he is taking by adding Xtandi to the mix. Therefore a new \"baseline\" reading is established at the new PSA result (5.3), to mark the PSA measurement level, against which future readings will be compared while this new drug combination is being used. Rising or falling PSA results is one measurement of this treatment's success or failure, during the time-frame it is employed. As you put it, \"a new beginning\".

      "Content": "To ALL, - Back in May of last year (2013), a COMBINED committee appointed by the AUA (American Urological Association) and ASTRO (American Society for Radiation Oncology) EQUALLY representing Urologists and Radiation Oncologists, collaborated to form Guidelines acceptable to both organizations which address Radiation recommendations following Prostatectomy surgery. They provide guidance for decision making to those Physicians and Patients who are considering Adjuvant and/or Salvage Radiation. This collaborative effort between these professional organizations to voluntarily COMBINE their efforts to offer such guidance is something that should be applauded by all PCa patients and, hopefully, represents a collaboration that, in my opinion, exemplifies professionals working together, in the best interest of patients. Since many seem unaware of it's existence, I Post it here for educational purposes. I hope it helps! A Press Release describing the Guidelines immediately follows this message. - [email protected] (aka) az4peaks AUA/ASTRO: Guidelines on Radiation Therapy After Prostatectomy San Diego, May 7, 2013 \u0096 The American Society for Radiation Oncology (ASTRO) and the American Urological Association (AUA) are pleased to announce the publication of the joint guideline on radiation therapy after prostatectomy for patients with and without evidence of prostate cancer recurrence. The 81-page document represents an intensive collaboration among experts in the radiation oncology and urology fields, led by Richard K. Valicenti, MD, MA, professor and chair of the department of radiation oncology at the University of California Davis Comprehensive Cancer Center in Sacramento, on behalf of ASTRO, and Ian M. Thompson, MD, director of the Cancer Therapy and Research Center at the University of Texas Health Science Center at San Antonio and the Glenda and Gary Woods Distinguished Chair in genitourinary oncology, on behalf of the AUA. The Adjuvant and Salvage Radiotherapy After Prostatectomy: ASTRO/AUA Guideline is a comprehensive review of 324 research articles of English language publications within the Pubmed, Embase and Cochrane databases, published from January 1, 1990 through December 15, 2012. The guideline is available online free as a PDF document at www.redjournal.org [1] and www.auanet.org [2], and will be published in the August 1, 2013, print issue of the International Journal of Radiation Oncology \u0095 Biology \u0095 Physics (Red Journal), the official scientific journal of ASTRO, and in the August 2013 print issue of The Journal of Urology, the official journal of the AUA. The strategies and approaches recommended were derived from evidence-based and consensus-based processes in the reviewed articles. The systematic review included articles that provided detailed efficacy in patients with detectable and undetectable prostatic specific antigen (PSA) levels, toxicity and quality of life impact, and optimal imaging strategies to determine the appropriateness of radiation therapy use in patients suspected of recurrence. Only studies in which PSA data were provided for 75 percent or more patients were included in the guideline. The guideline document provides the following clinical principles, recommendations, standards and options: 1) patients who are being considered for management of localized prostate cancer with radical prostatectomy should be informed of the potential for adverse pathologic findings that portend a higher risk of cancer recurrence; 2) patients with adverse pathologic findings including seminal vesicle invasion, positive surgical margins and extraprostatic extension should be informed that adjuvant radiation therapy, compared to radical prostatectomy only, reduces the risk of biochemical (PSA) recurrence, local recurrence and clinical progression of cancer; 3) physicians should offer adjuvant radiation therapy to patients with adverse pathologic findings at the time of prostatectomy, including seminal vesicle invasion, positive surgical margins or extraprostatic extension because of demonstrated reductions in biochemical recurrence, local recurrence and clinical progression; 4) patients should be informed that the development of a PSA recurrence after surgery is associated with a higher risk of development of metastatic prostate cancer or death from the disease; 5) clinicians should define biochemical recurrence as a detectable or rising PSA value after surgery that is ≥ 0.2 ng/ml with a second confirmatory level ≥ 0.2 ng/ml; 6) a restaging evaluation in the patient with a PSA recurrence may be considered; 7) physicians should offer salvage radiation therapy to patients with PSA or local recurrence after radical prostatectomy in whom there is no evidence of distant metastatic disease; patients should be informed that the effectiveness of radiation therapy for PSA recurrence is greatest when given at lower levels of PSA; and 9) patients should be informed of the possible short-term and long-term urinary, bowel and sexual side effects of radiation therapy, as well as the potential benefits of controlling disease recurrence. In addition to Drs. Valicenti and Thompson, authors of the The Adjuvant and Salvage Radiotherapy After Prostatectomy: ASTRO/AUA Guideline include Eric A. Klein, MD, of the Cleveland Clinic; S. Larry Goldenberg, MD, of the Vancouver Prostate Centre at the University of British Columbia; Peter C. Albertsen, MD, of the University of Connecticut Health Center; Jeff M. Michalski, MD, MBA, FASTRO, of the Siteman Cancer Center at the Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis; Mack Roach, III, MD, of the Helen Diller Family Comprehensive Cancer Center at the University of California, San Francisco; Oliver Sartor, MD, of the Tulane University School of Medicine; Brian J. Davis, MD, PhD, of the Mayo Clinic; and Martha Faraday, PhD, of Four Oaks Inc. \u0093This guideline explicitly includes a multitude of significant clinical trial results from more than 20 years of thorough research,\u0094 said Dr. Valicenti. \u0093There is a critical need for evidence-based standards, recommendations and options to maximize our ultimate goal of increased patient survival and quality of life. This guideline is a compendium of the vast wealth of research available and provides a thorough treatment template for us to consider for prostate cancer patients after a radical prostatectomy. \u0094 \u0093The work of the AUA and ASTRO staff, as well as our exceptional guideline panelists, was outstanding,\u0094 said Dr. Thompson. \u0093This guideline provides a very practical approach for the clinician to help guide in patient decision-making that will result in the very best patient outcomes.\u0094",

Volanis D1, Neal D, Warren A, Gnanapragasam V. Author information ABSTRACT With the widespread clinical use of PSA, biopsy of the prostate has become one of the most commonly performed urological procedures. In general it is well tolerated although there is some morbidity and risk of infection. In recent years, there have been increasing concerns that prostate biopsy may lead to tumour seeding along the needle tract. The aim of the present paper is to review the evidence on the prevalence of tumour seeding after prostate biopsy and to define the risk of this event in the context of current clinical practice. A Pubmed literature search was conducted in January 2014 according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analysis (PRISMA) statement. Literature was examined with emphasis on the incidence of seeding, clinical presentation and on risk factors including type of needle used, transrectal versus transperineal approach as well as tumour grade and stage. Twenty-six publications were identified reporting needle tract seeding post prostate biopsy. In total, the number of patients with needle tract seeding reported in literature is 42. In the majority of cases seeding was reported after transperineal biopsy of the prostate, while 9 cases occurred following transrectal biopsy. Based on the reviewed series the incidence of seeding appears much less than 1%. The increase in the number of biopsies and cores taken at each biopsy over the years has not resulted in an increase in the reported cases of seeding. In conclusion, seeding along the needle track is rare complication after prostate biopsy. Its actual incidence is presently difficult to quantify. It is reasonable to advise appropriate counselling and take measures to reduce this event where possible; however, we do not advocate avoidance of biopsies as the benefits of appropriate cancer diagnosis and management outweigh any potential risks from seeding.

      "Content": "Active Surveillance in Younger Men? Active Surveillance has been a \"hot\" topic in recent months. Like so many aspects of Prostate Cancer (PCa), it is filled with controversy and disagreement among experts, as well as laymen. Although it's use is widely acknowledged as a perfectly appropriate consideration in properly selected cases, it's application remains controversial. It is the criteria for such selection about which the controversy centers. Most experts agree that older men, with less than 10 years of life expectancy are, indeed, appropriate candidates for Active Surveillance. What about those whose expected lifespan exceeds that number? Even more in question, is whether otherwise healthy, younger men, (those under 65 y/o) should be considered for such monitoring programs. If you are considering Active Surveillance, I would strongly urge you, and any others interested in the subject, to listen to an audio presentation by the renowned Urologist, Dr. William Catalona of Northwestern University Medical Center. It is titled: \"Limitations of Active Surveillance in Young Men with Prostate Cancer\" Although it will not remove the burden of personal choice from your shoulders, it and the accompanying slides, will surely provide information of interest and relevance. Careful consideration of it's content, some of it previously uncited, will provide valuable information on the subject, thereby enhancing the decision-making process.

Be aware that clinically \"undetectable\" PSA readings are ANY result reported that is less than 0.1 ng/ml (<0.1). You will continue to need regularly scheduled PSA monitoring, as do ALL treated patients, but such monitoring thresholds following surgery are much more clear-cut and more immediately available than other forms of treatment. Your Pathology Report is encouraging, (except for the primary Gleason 4 pattern) but permanent success must be further confirmed, by \"undetectable\" PSA monitoring results, that will be maintained on a continuing basis.

If they followed the recommended format included in the Protocols that were adopted by every significant Standard setting organizations in Pathology, internationally, the report should describe the findings for each individual core sample including the Pathologists estimate of the percentage of PCa found in each, individually.

      "Content": "Hi Iw911, - Radiation is Radiation, it is the delivery of the RT to the Cancer site and that varies. The effects of radiation are much the same at the targeted site, the Prostate itself, but the amount of \"gys\" can vary and so can the entrance and exit strategy involved, as can collateral damage variations. The published data shows little or no significant advantage to the curative affects of the various forms of delivery but morbidity (side effects) CLAIMS do vary. Proton versus Photon beams is one of the many controversies in PCa. Be aware that enthusiastic supporters of varying approaches tend to exaggerate their claims of effectiveness far more than does the published data confirm such alleged superiorities. One of the unanswered questions is whether any advantages of Proton Therapy, IF ANY EXIST, are sufficient enough to justify the extreme differences in cost to an already strained medical reimbursement system. A question that to date has not yet been satisfactorily decided. The question of surgery following radiation is not a question as to whether it can be done, it can be by experts, but the published data reflects a much higher rate of morbidity, with side effects SUBSTANTIALLY higher than those reported for initial RT treatment. Incidentally, both Proton and Photon Radiation Therapy ARE forms of the general classification of External Beam Radiation Therapy (EBRT), which describes the method of delivery. In a 2009, one hundred page Report of the Emerging Technology Committee of ASTRO (American Society of Radiation Oncologists) it concludes: \"In hepatocellular carcinoma, prostate cancer and ocular tumors there is evidence for the efficacy of PBT but no suggestion that it is superior to photon based approaches.\" Good luck!! - [email protected] (aka) az4peaks",

      "Content": "Hi Jiff, - These are 2 significantly different procedures, one essentially diagnostic (Biopsy) and the other (TURP) treatment oriented, usually in to attempt to improve or resolve urinary problems often associated with more severe BPH (Benign Prostate Hyperplasia), which is the non-cancerous growth of the Prostate. Neither adequately replaces the other for diagnostic purposes, in my opinion. Whether, which (or perhaps both) is appropriate, depends on the details of your clinical symptoms and diagnostic results, to which we are not privy. Although the \"shavings\" from a TURP (Trans-Rectal are normally sent to pathology for examination, by itself, is not sufficient to replace a Biopsy screening for Prostate Cancer (PCa), since they are obtained from the \"inside\" of the Prostate, while the substantial majority of PCa occurs in the outer layers of Prostate tissue.

      "Content": "Psa normal & free-total ratio high Hi Don, - I am replying to your Post here, so that we don't hi-jack the thread on which it was first posted. The note made by your GP regarding suspected BPH is referring to the fact that that your Free PSA registered a quite high 55% and, normally, readings \"greater than\" (>) 25% are more often due to benign causes (non-malignant) such as BPH (Benign Prostate Hyperplasia or Hypertrophy) and/or Prostatitis (inflammation), than they are from Prostate Cancer (PCa). It appears that he properly sent the results on to the Urologist for further interpretation. HOWEVER, in the USA the Free PSA is only FDA approved for men over 50 years old that have PSA readings between 4 to 10 ng/ml, so the reliability of the results are in question, even though at least one independent Study has shown reasonable reliability down to 2.5 ng/ml and another asserts it up to 20 ng/ml. I think many experts would be concerned about the MEANINGFUL accuracy of results at the less than (<) 1.0 ng/ml level, where you presently register for Total PSA. This even though patients 50 to 60 y/o meeting the the 4 to 10 ng/ml requirement and having Free PSA of >25%, are only 9.1% likely to be found to have PCa identified upon follow-up Biopsy. I would think the Urologist might have some comments after seeing the PSA readings. I hope this helps your understanding! - [email protected] (aka) az4peaks . YOU POSTED: \"I live in Brazil, 58 years old, and my blood test revealed the following: Total PSA = 0.76 ng/ml Free PSA = 0.42 ng/ml Free/Total Ratio = 0.55 GP's NOTE: \"Results suggest BPH: Free-Total PSA ratio > 25%.

      "Content": "Hi RileyO, - I have some suggestions for you. FIRST, RELAX a bit, as there is no reason for panic at the levels of PSA that you report in your Post. It appears, from the results you post, that you are not using the same Laboratory or that different assays are being used in your testing. Settle upon one laboratory and one assay to be used, since variations in readings can substantially increase as more sensitive assay materials are used and they provide little, if any, additional clinically useful information in the ROUTINE monitoring for Prostate Cancer (PCa) recurrence. Results comparability can only be RELIABLY maintained when you do so. SECOND, The long standing, widely accepted CLINICAL standard for the term \"undetectable\" PSA is LESS THAN 0.1 ng/ml (1/10th of a nanogram). UNLESS there is a particular reason, like a particularly bad post-surgical Pathology Report, for using the hyper-sensitive PSA assays, that measure PSA to levels of 2 or 3 decimal places (1/100th and/or 1/1000th of a nanogram), I would suggest that you strongly consider using ONLY the regular PSA test for monitoring, which appears in your Laboratory's case to have a reporting sensitivity threshold of 0.05 ng/ml., which is already ONE-HALF of the clinical standard for an \"undetectable\" PSA. IF you had done this, ALL of your PSA tests would have been reported as LESS THAN .05 (<.05 ng/ml) and you would not be suffering the anxiety that you are now experiencing. THIRD: MOST attending physicians would not consider introducing salvage radiation, until the PSA level, at least, reaches 0.2 (2/10ths) and there is some evidence that, IF JUSTIFIED, that it has statistically more success if it is instituted by PSA readings of 0.5 ng/ml. You are nowhere close to these numbers, if accurately reported in your Post. FOURTH: Be cognizant of the decimal point placement in these results since they are of utmost important when comparing results. Although you can't rule out the POSSIBILITY of an eventual recurrence at this time, you certainly cannot rule it in either. So regularly scheduled PSA monitoring is necessary, as it is for ALL those previously treated for PCa. With all readings having been LESS THAN .05, (I ASSUME, that the 0.3 reading was a typo or reporting error), there is no reason for unnecessary anxiety, at this time. I have been post-surgically monitoring my PSA for 15 years and it has never exceeded <0.1. It could be anything from .000 to .099, but why do I, unnecessarily, care as long as it remains clinically \"undetectable\", and there is no indication for additional action.

      "Content": "Hi RileyO, - I have some suggestions for you. FIRST, RELAX a bit, as there is no reason for panic at the levels of PSA that you report in your Post. It appears, from the results you post, that you are not using the same Laboratory or that different assays are being used in your testing. Settle upon one laboratory and one assay to be used, since variations in readings can substantially increase as more sensitive assay materials are used and they provide little, if any, additional clinically useful information in the ROUTINE monitoring for Prostate Cancer (PCa) recurrence. Results comparability can only be RELIABLY maintained when you do so. SECOND, The long standing, widely accepted CLINICAL standard for the term \"undetectable\" PSA is LESS THAN 0.1 ng/ml (1/10th of a nanogram). UNLESS there is a particular reason, like a particularly bad post-surgical Pathology Report, for using the hyper-sensitive PSA assays, that measure PSA to levels of 2 or 3 decimal places (1/100th and/or 1/1000th of a nanogram), I would suggest that you strongly consider using ONLY the regular PSA test for monitoring, which appears in your Laboratory's case to have a reporting sensitivity threshold of 0.05 ng/ml., which is already ONE-HALF of the clinical standard for an \"undetectable\" PSA. IF you had done this, ALL of your PSA tests would have been reported as LESS THAN .05 (<.05 ng/ml) and you would not be suffering the anxiety that you are now experiencing. THIRD: MOST attending physicians would not consider introducing salvage radiation, until the PSA level, at least, reaches 0.2 (2/10ths) and there is some evidence that, IF JUSTIFIED, that it has statistically more success if it is instituted by PSA readings of 0.5 ng/ml. You are nowhere close to these numbers, if accurately reported in your Post. FOURTH: Be cognizant of the decimal point placement in these results since they are of utmost important when comparing results. Although you can't rule out the POSSIBILITY of an eventual recurrence at this time, you certainly cannot rule it in either. So regularly scheduled PSA monitoring is necessary, as it is for ALL those previously treated for PCa. With all readings having been LESS THAN .05, (I ASSUME, that the 0.3 reading was a typo or reporting error), there is no reason for unnecessary anxiety, at this time. I have been post-surgically monitoring my PSA for 15 years and it has never exceeded <0.1. It could be anything from .000 to .099, but why do I, unnecessarily, care as long as it remains clinically \"undetectable\", and there is no indication for additional action. I have had little, or no, PSA anxiety over the years and neither need you! Let me make it clear that, although I consider myself a well-informed layman on the subject, I am NOT a physician and so my comments should be taken as medical advice and I would be happy to have you review its content with your Urologist for his/her professional opinion.

      "Content": "Hi Arthro, - IN medical terminology, the letter \"a\" at the beginning of the word \"asymptomatic\" specifically translates to \"without symptoms\". And Prostatitis is specifically defined as \"inflammation\" so the additional word \"inflammatory\" is somewhat redundant, but it is probably helpful to patient understanding since they are usually laymen, unfamiliar about medical terminology Your report of some \"urinary frequency and/or \"urgency\", however, are recognized symptom(s) that OFTEN are present with a diagnosis of Prostatitis. If this Prostatitis and it's symptoms are bothersome enough, you should discuss the possibility of a regimen of antibiotics to see if it might resolve such symptoms. Good luck! - [email protected] (aka) az4peaks Originally Posted by Arthro92 Hello, everybody. As some of you know, my urologist called and told me that I have Asymptomatic Inflammatory Prostatitis. He said that type of condition doesn't require treatment. From a bit of my research, I also read that AIP doesn't require treatment. I also read that AIP has no symptoms. From time to time at night (but not every night), I wake up making frequent trips to urinate. So, my question is if every so often I have to use the men's room quite frequently would that still qualify as AIP? How can I treat this condition?",

      "Content": "Hi JD, - Radical Prostatectomy (RP) does not alter the formation of sperm in a man's body since that production takes place in the testes, but the system of its delivery to the female egg is essentially destroyed, since the main function of the Prostate is to generate the fluid that makes the delivery of that sperm easily accomplished. Harvesting can be accomplished after surgery, but simply \"storing\" your sperm prior to the surgery is a much easier and simpler solution to having it available for impregnation in the future. It appears from your signature that it is not an option, at this point, for you. I suggest you check with Dr. Catalona's office for an appropriate referral. - [email protected] newPCa.org (aka) az4peaks",

      "Content": "Hi tomnan, - The two fees are normally both assessed, one by the Urologist performing the Biopsy itself and one for the preparation of tissue slides, their examination and the formal reporting of the interpretive results, which are sent to the referring Urologist, who obtained the samples at Biopsy. (1) The Urologist's fee is for performing the biopsy itself where, normally, there are 12 or more individual tissue \"samples\" obtained in a patterned manner, by needle extraction in placed in cassettes. The tissue \"samples\" are then forwarded to the Pathologist for examination under the microscope. (2)The Pathology fee is for preparing the multiple slides involved, the direct individual examination of each by the Pathologist and the formal report of the resulting interpretive results, found in the Pathology Report. (a printed copy of which, I would suggest you obtain from your Urologist, for your records). Best wishes for favorable results, my friend! - [email protected] (aka) az4peaks",

      "Content": "To ALL, - Back in May of last year (2013), a COMBINED committee appointed by the AUA (American Urological Association) and ASTRO (American Society for Radiation Oncology) EQUALLY representing Urologists and Radiation Oncologists, collaborated to form Guidelines acceptable to both organizations which address Radiation recommendations following Prostatectomy surgery. They provide guidance for decision making to those Physicians and Patients who are considering Adjuvant and/or Salvage Radiation. This collaborative effort between these professional organizations to voluntarily COMBINE their efforts to offer such guidance is something that should be applauded by all PCa patients and, hopefully, represents a collaboration that, in my opinion, exemplifies professionals working together, in the best interest of patients. A Press Release describing the Guidelines immediately follows here. This is where guidance should be sought rather than from a report by some ad-hoc committee, so often promoted here by one or two Posters, which was put together by RO's and consisted of 24 Physicians, 20 of whom were Radiation Therapists performing Brachytherapy procedures. - [email protected] (aka) az4peaks AUA/ASTRO 2013: New Guidelines on Radiation Therapy After Prostatectomy San Diego, May 7, 2013 \u2013 The American Society for Radiation Oncology (ASTRO) and the American Urological Association (AUA) are pleased to announce the publication of the joint guideline on radiation therapy after prostatectomy for patients with and without evidence of prostate cancer recurrence. The 81-page document represents an intensive collaboration among experts in the radiation oncology and urology fields, led by Richard K. Valicenti, MD, MA, professor and chair of the department of radiation oncology at the University of California Davis Comprehensive Cancer Center in Sacramento, on behalf of ASTRO, and Ian M. Thompson, MD, director of the Cancer Therapy and Research Center at the University of Texas Health Science Center at San Antonio and the Glenda and Gary Woods Distinguished Chair in genitourinary oncology, on behalf of the AUA. The Adjuvant and Salvage Radiotherapy After Prostatectomy: ASTRO/AUA Guideline is a comprehensive review of 324 research articles of English language publications within the Pubmed, Embase and Cochrane databases, published from January 1, 1990 through December 15, 2012. The guideline is available online free as a PDF document at www.redjournal.org [1] and www.auanet.org [2], and will be published in the August 1, 2013, print issue of the International Journal of Radiation Oncology \u2022 Biology \u2022 Physics (Red Journal), the official scientific journal of ASTRO, and in the August 2013 print issue of The Journal of Urology, the official journal of the AUA. The strategies and approaches recommended were derived from evidence-based and consensus-based processes in the reviewed articles. The systematic review included articles that provided detailed efficacy in patients with detectable and undetectable prostatic specific antigen (PSA) levels, toxicity and quality of life impact, and optimal imaging strategies to determine the appropriateness of radiation therapy use in patients suspected of recurrence. Only studies in which PSA data were provided for 75 percent or more patients were included in the guideline. The guideline document provides the following clinical principles, recommendations, standards and options: 1) patients who are being considered for management of localized prostate cancer with radical prostatectomy should be informed of the potential for adverse pathologic findings that portend a higher risk of cancer recurrence; 2) patients with adverse pathologic findings including seminal vesicle invasion, positive surgical margins and extraprostatic extension should be informed that adjuvant radiation therapy, compared to radical prostatectomy only, reduces the risk of biochemical (PSA) recurrence, local recurrence and clinical progression of cancer; 3) physicians should offer adjuvant radiation therapy to patients with adverse pathologic findings at the time of prostatectomy, including seminal vesicle invasion, positive surgical margins or extraprostatic extension because of demonstrated reductions in biochemical recurrence, local recurrence and clinical progression; 4) patients should be informed that the development of a PSA recurrence after surgery is associated with a higher risk of development of metastatic prostate cancer or death from the disease; 5) clinicians should define biochemical recurrence as a detectable or rising PSA value after surgery that is ≥ 0.2 ng/ml with a second confirmatory level ≥ 0.2 ng/ml; 6) a restaging evaluation in the patient with a PSA recurrence may be considered; 7) physicians should offer salvage radiation therapy to patients with PSA or local recurrence after radical prostatectomy in whom there is no evidence of distant metastatic disease; patients should be informed that the effectiveness of radiation therapy for PSA recurrence is greatest when given at lower levels of PSA; and 9) patients should be informed of the possible short-term and long-term urinary, bowel and sexual side effects of radiation therapy, as well as the potential benefits of controlling disease recurrence. In addition to Drs. Valicenti and Thompson, authors of the The Adjuvant and Salvage Radiotherapy After Prostatectomy: ASTRO/AUA Guideline include Eric A. Klein, MD, of the Cleveland Clinic; S. Larry Goldenberg, MD, of the Vancouver Prostate Centre at the University of British Columbia; Peter C. Albertsen, MD, of the University of Connecticut Health Center; Jeff M. Michalski, MD, MBA, FASTRO, of the Siteman Cancer Center at the Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis; Mack Roach, III, MD, of the Helen Diller Family Comprehensive Cancer Center at the University of California, San Francisco; Oliver Sartor, MD, of the Tulane University School of Medicine; Brian J. Davis, MD, PhD, of the Mayo Clinic; and Martha Faraday, PhD, of Four Oaks Inc. \u201cThis guideline explicitly includes a multitude of significant clinical trial results from more than 20 years of thorough research,\u201d said Dr. Valicenti. \u201cThere is a critical need for evidence-based standards, recommendations and options to maximize our ultimate goal of increased patient survival and quality of life. This guideline is a compendium of the vast wealth of research available and provides a thorough treatment template for us to consider for prostate cancer patients after a radical prostatectomy. \u201d \u201cThe work of the AUA and ASTRO staff, as well as our exceptional guideline panelists, was outstanding,\u201d said Dr. Thompson. \u201cThis guideline provides a very practical approach for the clinician to help guide in patient decision-making that will result in the very best patient outcomes.\u201d",
