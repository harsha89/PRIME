It is expected, and can continue for up to three years. There are opinions on typical patterns, timings, and post-nadir rises, if any. But, the bounces are part of the treatment process. Thanks for the reply! My oncologist called and unfortunately isn't all that familiar with CK, since he wasn't involved in my CK treatments(longstory), but the majority of what I read does say the same as you mentioned. It's been about 14 months since my last treatment and it's gone from 0.83 to 1.48 in 6 months. I waiting on a call back from someone I consulted with from MSK who wound up doing the CK and see what their take is.",
