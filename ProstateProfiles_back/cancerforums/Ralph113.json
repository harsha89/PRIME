I walked a lot, and I'm resuming more normal activity(No sex as yet), I'm being careful not to \"strain\" on any activity. My post surgical biopsy report was good(no cancer out of the prostate). I am having a problem with urinary frequency. It seems to me that it's more frequent now without a prostate. My stream is strong. I do feel some slight irritation at the tip of my penis, but does not hurt when I urinate. I attribute this to the catheter I wore for 9 days. I am doing Kegel exercises Anyone have any advice about the frequency? Thanks",

However I find myself urinating frequently, I had a urine test done and they found bacteria, I took Cipro for 7 days and it seemed to have cleared up. I was told that it may take some time for frequency to \"clear\" up due to the fact that the bladder has to become more elastic. I also note that there has been some changes in bowel habits as well becoming slightly more constipated. I wonder if there is a relationship between the two, Has anyone out there had any similar experiences? Thanks, Ralph",
