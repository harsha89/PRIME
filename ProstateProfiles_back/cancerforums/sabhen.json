Please provide your thoughts on the best course of action with respect to radiation therapy only. And any issues with side effects etc... A BIG THANK YOU.",

      "Content": "Thanks for the feedback. The URO did not provide a good rationale for why he thought RT without HT should be adequate. He even said I could still wait a bit before deciding. I do not want to dally. I am having a second opinion. I will have a consultation with the RO within the next few days. I checked one of the calculator on the MSKCC. With my data, the success of non-recurrence after 6 years jumped from 64% (RT) to 81% (RT+HT). Not sure how much reliability can one put on these on-line calculators.",
