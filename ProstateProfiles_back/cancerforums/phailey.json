    "Content": "New member here Paul in Dallas. I'm 56. Got results from biopsy on Friday. My PSA went from 2.8 to 4.7 in a year, then to 5.5 in 6 months and back to 4.4 last month. 3 of 12 cores (53%, 88%, 68%) Gleason Score 7 (4+3), 7 (3+4), 7 (4+3). Trying to figure out the whole radiation vs surgery argument. Looking for support and any kind of explanation of numbers. Thanks.",
