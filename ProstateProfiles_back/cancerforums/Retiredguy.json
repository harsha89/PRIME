    "Content": "Newbie here. This forum has already answered a lot of my questions. Four years after laparoscopic prostatectomy, my PSA has gone from \"undetectable\" to 0.1. NOT what I wanted to hear. In the range of \"undetectable\" to 0.1, just how reliable are the PSA tests? Aren't they pushing the limits of the testing technology? The urologist mentioned continued close vigilance, watching for PSA increases. Continued increases call for \"salvage radiation\". What might I expect from this therapy? Anybody here with any experience with this? TIA.",
