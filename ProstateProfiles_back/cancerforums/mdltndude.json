      "Content": "I am a healthy (well, I thought I was anyway...) 56YO white male. I have had a consistent PSA of 2.0 to 2.4 for several years. This October my PSA was 5.6. My Dr. sent me to a Urologist in November. The Urologist retested my PSA and found it to be 5.9. We did biopsies in December and the results were positive for cancer. My Gleason score is 7 (3+4). The Urologist said I have equal distribution of cancer in both sides of the prostate based on the biopsies he did (12 total). He also said I have a 40% chance of cancer cells already being outside the prostate. He graded me a T1C. From what I read, the T1C seems to conflict with cancer in both sides of the prostate gland and the liklihood of cancer being outside the prostate already. I questioned him specifically on the T1C and he confirmed that he did not think I was higher than that. I would like to retain as normal of a sex life as possible once this is all done. I had some ED from high blood pressue meds, but not bad. I am just learning so please overlook any misunderstandings I have and please feel free to educate me... that is why I am here! Will radiation (my urologist is recommending EBRT, Brachytherapy and hormones) result in a good possibility of being able to ejaculate? I would like to retain as complete of a sexual experience as possible. I am considering the radiation route in the belief that I have a chance at still ejaculating. If it were not for the idea of salvaging a complete sexual experience, I think I would opt for the surgery. Am I being naive? I appreciate your input guys. thanks!",

Believe me I understand the severity and I am doing my best to believe that either surgery or radiation will get me through this. All I have read tells me that my survivability is pretty much the same with both. Hoping that I can accept that as a given, I am focusing on quality of life after treatment to help me decide what treatment option is best for me.",
