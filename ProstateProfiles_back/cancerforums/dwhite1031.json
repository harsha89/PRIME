    "Content": "Hello from Midland, TX. I was diagnosed this past July after an elevated PSA & biopsy resulting in a Gleason score of 9. Almost a year to the day last year a biopsy had shown no cancer. So in a year I went from ok to HOLY COW!!! Went to MD Anderson in Houston right away. I've had hormone (lupron) & subsequent daVinci robotic prostatectomy as part of a clinical trial. Was to have a 6 week follow up January 15, but developed a very large & painful retro pertineal hematoma that left me hospitalized after the bleeding source (illiac artery in groin area) was found & stopped via angiogram. I return for my first post surgery psa February 11. MD Anderson has been fantastic & my Doctors, Dr Louis Pisters -Urologist/Surgical Oncologist and Dr Shi Ming Tu - Medical Oncologist are two of the most caring & compassionate men I have ever met. So far thats my journey. God bless you all!",
