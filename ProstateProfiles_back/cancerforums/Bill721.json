      "Content": "Saw Dr. Chen, Dr. radiation Oncology, today and my weight and insurance restrict me from doing Cyberknife, however, IMRT looks like the best option. Based on the aggressive gleason 8 reading and to ensure cancer hasn't spread out of the prostate I'm having a bone scan and ct scan on Monday. I'm starting on hormone therapy as soon as I can get into the urologist. So no good news to report. Bill",

      "Content": "I'm 63 year old male. I weigh 370 lbs and just found out I have Prostate cancer. My biopsy came back with 4+4=8 80% of tissue cancer in only 1 section. All other sections were cancer free. The cancer is still contained in the prostate. The Doctor is recommending cyberknife radiation for 5 days 30 minutes per day. How bad off am I really and thoughts on recommended treatment? Anyone in a similar situation sharing comments would be very helpful. Thank you",
