      "Content": "Originally Posted by GeorgeS I will do. Today (as I will once a week) I chatted up the RO who is very optimistic that long term recovery is not only possible but quite possible. He pulled up a few reports from PUBMED that had node positive folks (like me) in remission 5 and 10years out from the RT. (very healthy and respectable percentages to boot! (IE: Above 50%) He may insist that the \"recipe\" of RT+18mo's ADT be followed but I told him that was not an issue as long as I can have a END DATE for the ADT! I was diagnosed last month with a psa of 268 Gleason 8 with bone mets and one lymph node effected. I was immediately put on casodex then a week later lupron. Then 2weeks after that my oncologist scheduled me for 6 rounds of docetaxel. The day of my first round of chemo I got the test results of my baseline psa and it had dropped down to 48 from 268 in a matter of just 2 weeks of lupron and casodex therapy only. I'm hoping this is a sign that lupron will work very well for me going forward. I have read that lupron/docetaxel treatment right at diagnosis is having very good long term results for men with advanced PC that hasn't spread to any organs.",
