      "Content": "Greetings All. My dad is 78 years old living in China. He was recently diagnosed with poorly differentiated prostate cancer with bone metastases, PSA 100. Orchiectomy was given and he is doing well now. We were told though that the only treatment needed after castration is Flutamide and life expectancy is around 2 years. Is it true? My dad is very healthy otherwise. Would doctors do differently post-castration, in US or Canada? Anyone in the similar situation, what`s life expectancyï¼Ÿ Any word/advice would be appreciated!",

      "Content": "Hello, hope everyone is doing well here. My dad received surgical castration early June and has been taking Flutamide. PSA dropped to 4.08 first month after. Another blood test couple of days ago, and his PSA bounced back to 50!! So worried, what could be wrong? Does it mean it's castration resistant already? Doctor did not give much info yet as what the next step will be, we gonna talk to him later. Does anyone have similar experience, or know anything about what the problem could be, and next step? Thank you",
