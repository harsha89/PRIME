      "Content": "My husband was just diagnosed last week with PC. Gleason score: 9, age 61 Biopsy left lobe 5 out of 6 positive 4/4, 4/5. All 25-75%. PSA last year 1.7, this year 3.2 His GP told him to wait 4-6 months and get it checked again. Thank goodness he didn't listen and instead he went to a urologist for a second DRE which was abnormal and was able to get the biopsy done the next day! Given the high Gleason score, we have sought out a specialist and he will be having DaVinci surgery on Dec 9th Bone scan and rectal MRI were done today, we get the results Monday. We are, of course hoping it is still contained and researching all the available treatment options in case it isn't. This site has been a god send in seeing other's stories, learning what to expect and seeing the moral support. So happy to have found it!! Thank you!! Is there anyone else with a 9 Gleason score and low PSA? Is anyone active in any clinical trials? Thank you!!",
