      "Content": "I am from India and i am very new here. My father got diagnosed with Prostate Cancer and i am just trying to come out of the shock. He is 65 now. His PSA is 7 and has got an enlarged prostate (biopsy suggested prostatitis as well) G score is 3+4(7) 1 of 12 cores positive with 10% and is advised to get an MRI and bone scan done. Getting this done in a week. Dr says to get Da Vinci done if the former comes back localised to the capsule. i am quiet new to this and an unsure what treatment plan is good for him. He has no other health conditions and is healthy and active.",

      "Content": "Got the positive core checked by another pathologist. His report says G score 6 Adenocarcinoma found in a very small fragment. (doesn\u2019t say any %). So G score went down to 6 from initial pathology report, which was 7 (3+4). So now he has some G6 cells with no suspicious area in 3T MRI imaging. He is going to visit his urologist again with the new pathology report.",

      "Content": "Thank you all for your response. As suggested by his urologist, he got an MRI and a bone scan done late last week. Got the results today. Bone scan showed no issues.( which was understandable in layman terms). His urologist went through the MRI results and said there is no evidence of any cancerous growth in it.( it definitely talks about enlarged prostrate, prostatitis i guess). So he suggested to get a second opinion on the biopsy sample from another pathologist. (collected the positive core sample, going to see the 2nd pathologist in a day or two). Does anyone know of any similar cases, biopsy positive with no evidence in MRI.",
