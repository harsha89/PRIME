      "Content": "Hi all. I just found this forum tonight. I was diagnosed 12/12. PSA 7.5 Davinci surgery 3/13/13. Pathology results: Gleason 3+3=6 PC contained in prostate (all margins clean)...10% involved No cancer found outside of prostate. Catheter out 13 days post surgery. First PSA 5 weeks out = 0.02 I am confused about this PSA level and won't see my surgeon until next week. I'm not sure if I should be happy or not.",
