      "Content": "I am waiting for a referral from my medical group to see a Da Vinci surgeon. I believe it will be for Dr. Michael Louie. I also believe he works out of UC Irvine Medical center and Pomona Valley Hospital. I suspect I would prefer the UCI location. Does anyone here have any experience or in-sight with this Dr. or Hospitals? Thx",

Said he would advise his brother to treat with surgurey or radiation. Don't like the idea of waiting for it to spread. They opted not to treat my dad's leukemia and he is no longer with us....",

I did choose this kind of surgery because I think that the surgeon has better feeling (with his fingers) to control the cut. He did save all the nerves and it was very important to me (I am 41 years old). Bad side of the RPP, its painful. 9 days after, I still have a hard time to sit down. Only the time will make the recovery better. Best of luck to you in your recovery.",

      "Content": "Hi, As much as a shock as it has been, I think (hope) I am lucky compared to others on here. Age - 56 PSA 6.4 Gleason - 3+3=6 Biopsy, 1 of 13 samples positive. Showing 10% of the sample and deep, if I am reading it right. Stage - unknown to me. No other testing was done, just the biopsy I am very heavily considering robotic surgury if I can get it approved. My Urologist doesn't do it (he does open), but said he could refer me out. I am waiting for the referal so I can make an appt. to interview the surgon. Reasons I like am leaning towards the prostectomy idea: Allows for pathologic testing of the Prosate and surrounding glands. Allows easier (quicker) tracking of the PSA If confined to the prostate, should allow 100% removal of the cancer Reasons for robotic: Quicker healing less blood loss better for heavier folks Anything else? Am I off base? I really want to believe the lab report was wrong. Any chance of that? Thx for any input.",
