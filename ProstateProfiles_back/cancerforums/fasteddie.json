      "Content": "Hello Your situation needs to be moved on quickly. Gleason 9 is very agressive and requires an excellent large medical center or a university cancer treatment center that you can probably find in a large city near you. These institutions will have all of the options available to you. I would recommend that you start reading Dr. Walsh\"s, book Surviving Prostate Cancer and ask lots of questions. This will help you understand the lingo of prostate cancer. The possible involvement of the lymph node needs a biopsy to really determine the extent of cancer involvement. Have your dad start walking and exercising and doing his kegals. This will help him with whatever option he choses. This is not your grandfathers prostate cancer and the medical advancements over the last 10 years are giving lots of hope for advanced staged prostate cancer. Peace and Grace Ed",

It makes for a tough year when both of you are running the cancer gauntlet at the same time. It is good that you are there for them. They might well need your help. I agree with newporter finding a good prostate oncologist is critically important. I didn't see where your dad is from, his age, or cancer specifics. If you continue on this sight you may want to post your dad's signature (PCa info). Maybe someone on this sight can give you the name of an excellent Dr. in your area. Mine is Dr. Matt Lauer. Met with him at UNM Cancer Treatment Center in Albq. NM. after my surgery. I have him on speed dial if my PSA starts back up. Lastly, your statement that your dad is terminal could be a long way off. It is amazing what is happening in the PCa treatment world with drugs and treatments that significantly extend life. Our thoughts and prayers are with you and your parents. Peace and Grace Ed",

      "Content": "Chief, good to hear you made it through the surgery ok. I had very similar problems, but spent 6 days in hospital due to a complication. I used half of a pad and tape to wrap around the penis and catheter to absorb the leakage. The rest will heal quickly once you get the catheter out. My wife was the first girl I kissed when I got back from Vietnam and has stuck by me through thick and thin. If you start walking a couple miles a day, watch what you eat and do your kegals life will get back to normal fairly soon. I am at six months and the sex issue is alittle complicated but can be managed. That has probably been the biggest transition for me physically and mentally and is getting better with time. Make sure you hug and kiss her alot and say thankyou dear. She has been through alot.",

It was almost 3 months after surgery before I started to get some control while standing. Since you have control lying down shows some progress. My urologist considers my one pad a day or folded paper towel as continence. Alot of the time my problem is my own doing. I shouldn't drink two cups of coffee a day, one or two beers, a soda, or orange juice. Water is the best fluid of choice, less irritation. Sometimes medications can cause less control.

My urologist considers my one pad a day or folded paper towel as continence. Alot of the time my problem is my own doing.

For a while I just walked up and down my street to stay close to my home restroom. Being forced to try and hold it is unconfortable, but I had to get use to it and it got better. Now I walk and run on my treadmill and lift weights, strength is your friend, but it all causes minor leaks. I guess it is the price I will have to pay to be PCa free for the moment.

      "Content": "Sorry to hear that you have joined the club. It's amazing what they can do with PC today and it gets better everyday with medical advancements. Try to slow down and catch your breath. You need to inform yourself about what options are available to you. I would encourage you to pick up a copy of Dr. Walsh's, Surviving Prostate Cancer, a highlighter and read it from cover to cover. Information about what your dealing with will guide you in making the right decision for yourself. PC is like a finger print, no two are alike. Your age is working in your favor, so get the best medical advice available to you. I am partial to university medical centers and cancer treatment centers for treatment. I used both. Check out all of your options. You have time to work through this in an orderly and precise manner. If you have in questions, bring them to the folks here. Very knowledgable bunch and they helped me out alot when I was going through my trial by PC. Hang in there. Peace and Grace Ed",

He said that the one size fits all for prescriptions is out and personalized prescribing using DNA gives us more information on which drugs and dosages are right for me. He said this can give information on which HDT drug would be best for me and how the other prescriptions I take interact negatively. Has anyone else heard of this or currently receiving prescriptions with this method? I wonder about the reliabity of this method? Peace and Grace fasteddie",

Get yourself a folder and start collecting pathology reports, past and present PSA tests, biopsy reports, radiation treatment information and collect the business card from everyone your dad comes in contact with that is handling his medical care. Ask your dad to sign a medical release form for all of his medical information. Look over the material and get a copy of Dr. Walsh's book and a highlighter and read. Also, see if your dad will let you attend his Dr. appointments, take lots notes and ask lots of questions. As you get this information put it on the site and pretinent information into the signature. Your dad's case has moved rapidly and he needs information to make the best informed decision for himself. It takes two to be sick and your dad is very fortunate to have you by his side. Being stubborn and private is the personality of most of us on this sight, but we are here to assist in anyway we can. Keep in touch. Peace and Grace Ed",

      "Content": "Kazzi61, the outlook is far from bleak. Your husbands situation is very similar to my own. First perineural invasion and seminal vesical involvement is difficult to determine. My outstanding surgeon said he thought I had both after he did an MRI. After surgery neither was the case. I think they prepare you for the worst and when it comes back better than expected he looks like a miracle worker. The gold standard is surgery, because once the prostate is out you can get a pathology report that tells you exactly what you've got. In about 30% of cases the Gleason score is higher. I went from a 7 to a 9. Slow down and both of you take a deep breath. Investigate the options until you both make a decision together. My wife and I learned that it takes two to be sick and your support your husbands final decision for treatment is very important. After surgery it has taken us about 9 months to put all of this behind us, get ready for a life change. I would encourage your husband to get on this site or a similar one and get himself up to speed with men who have this problem and have been through their own cancer walk. Peace and Grace Ed",

      "Content": "Gunny, sorry to hear that you are now part of the club. Now is the time to inform yourself about prostate cancer. When I first found out, I grabbed Dr. Walsh's book and read it in a week and highlighted everything that pretained to me. You have time by the looks of your scores to really investigate your options. If you live close to a good cancer treatment center that has good results with prostate cancer, I would recommend that you check them out. Having a cancer medical team working on your case has advantages and you can get all of your options in one place. I opted for DaVinci because I was a 4+3 and after surgery it came back a 4+5 which happens about 35% of the time. Grab a folder and start keeping all of your test results, take notes when you talk with the doctors, and write down any questions you might have and then get answers. The gentlemen on this site have a wealth of practical experience and are willing to help you out. Keep in touch with updates and questions. Peace and Grace Ed",

      "Content": "Hello, you might consider a cancer treatment center associated with a university medical school. Lots of up to date information on trials and treatments. Plus it is one stop care. You can usually see a first class surgeon, radiation oncologist, and medical oncologist. The medical team approach offers a lot of information. Talk to all three before you make a decision. Educate yourself, get copies of all lab results, radiology, Dr. reports, and start building a file. You have plenty of time to make an informed decision. PC is a process that may take some time and it does put your life on hold for a few months. Work on this as a team with your husband. It takes two of you working together in concert. My wife handled all the appointments and insurance. I did all the driving and helped maintain the sanity of the situation and went through the medical stuff. Decide what is best for you. Divide and conquer PC. Have your husband start research on the forum. Lots of good information from guys who have been there and know their way around. It was a big help to me and demonstrates that PC treatment is hugely successful. This is not your grandfathers disease and medical advancements are occurring all the time. Peace and Grace Ed",

      "Content": "paulplus, sorry to hear that you are a member of the club. Your stats indicate that you are in the early stage of prostate cancer. I would encourage you to get a copy of \"The Guide to Surviving Prostate Cancer\" by Dr. Walsh. Read it cover to cover and you will have a better understanding of your condition. During your DRE did the urologist feel a nodule or an area of hardness? You definitely have time to research your next step. You may want to get a second opinion from a cancer center that specializes in prostate cancer. This would help you confirm active surveillance as an option.

      "Content": "My urologist is 200 miles away in Albq. NM and I had an appointment set up with him every six months. He is good about getting me in if needed. My April PSA was <0.08 good. He thought the restriction of the meatus could be the problem and if it doesn't improve he may will scope and widen a minimal restriction on my next visit. I started back on oxybutin tonight to see if it will help with the spasms. I take alot of medications for heart, blood pressure and other problems and adding one more pill is getting tiresome. Plus I like a shot of Makers Mark every night to and alittle spice to life. Since the robotic surgery I have gained 20 lbs and I believe that adds to the problem. Need to get back to my exercising and lose some weight. No sex and depression add to the problem. My grand children keep me going. I want to be around for them. So I keep on truckin.

At the time the nodule was detected I had a PSA of 1.86 and the year before it was .86. For some reason my prostate cancer doesn't emit a high PSA. I wonder if it does come back that it would be significant in nature with a very low PSA indicated and that I may not be able to get to it quickly enough.

The doctor said that is common because techicians and doctors don't prep or know how to perform the procedure properly. I have lived in misery for 8 months with painful, burning bowel moments, because of an mri tech inserting a prostate coil improperly. My recommendation to anyone going through any of these rectal procedures is to ask the person doing the procedure to throughly prep the area of insertion and to take it slowly. If you sense discomfort, have them back off and reprep the site or the instrument again. Don't let them rip you a new one.

      "Content": "I agree, your chances of having prostate cancer are very small. If the the antibiotics don't give you some relief take the next step. The next time you visit your MD doctor have him do a Digital Rectal Exam and have a PSA blood test. If those precedures have good outcomes then you can move on and not have prostate cancer on the mind. Sorry to hear about your pain. Sometimes internal and external hemmoriods can cause discomfort????? or possibly a herniated disc. I have and had both and many of your symptoms.",
