      "Content": "Saw my South Carolina urologist/surgeon today regarding the recent rise in uPSA from non-detectable (<0.015) to 0.040. This rise began about three years after surgery and appears to show a PSADT of about 6-7 months. Even with Gleason 8 pathology, the doctor was very positive about my situation in light of three three year non detectable PSA levels and relatively slow doubling time. He said there is the possibility that some benign prostate tissue may have been left behind at the prostate/bladder juncture. He prescribed Finasteride to see if it would knock down the PSA level. He said the drug has shown to be useful whether the rise is from benign or cancer cells. He told be not to worry about this as either way we will likely be here gen years from now discussing these same issues. Anyone else have a similar experience or wish to comment on the above. I plan to be back in New York in about a month and have an appointment scheduled with a RO to get his perspective.",

      "Content": "Saw my South Carolina urologist/surgeon today regarding the recent rise in uPSA from non-detectable (<0.015) to 0.040. This rise began about three years after surgery and appears to show a PSADT of about 6-7 months. Even with Gleason 8 pathology, the doctor was very positive about my situation in light of three three year non detectable PSA levels and relatively slow doubling time. He said there is the possibility that some benign prostate tissue may have been left behind at the prostate/bladder juncture. He prescribed Finasteride to see if it would knock down the PSA level. He said the drug has shown to be useful whether the rise is from benign or cancer cells. He told be not to worry about this as either way we will likely be here gen years from now discussing these same issues. Anyone else have a similar experience or wish to comment on the above. I plan to be back in New York in about a month and have an appointment scheduled with a RO to get his perspective.",

      "Content": "The importance of the 3T MRI? Several urologist kept telling me I was at low risk for prostate cancer with no family history, normal DREs relatively low PSA for my age and several urinary infections that temporarily raised PSA values. I finally got one urologist to refer me to NY University for the MRI. It found one small tumor. The next day the biopsy was done using the MRI data to locate and target the tumor. They took two biopsies at that location as well as the standard twelve grid biopsy of the entire prostate. Only one of the two \"targeted\" biopsies hit the tumor and all of the standard twelve grid biopsies were also negative. To repeat, 13 out of 14 biopsy locations were negative. Hence, without the MRI my Gleason 8 cancer would have been surely missed. The after surgery pathology report showed two additional tumors, Gleason 7 and 6. Need I say more about the chances of missing aggressive prostate cancers with hit and miss, blind biopsies. To prove my point, I had one jackass urologist that said he was so good at DREs that he never missed a cancer! Another jackass assured me that if he missed a tumor with a negative biopsy result, it meant I had a very small tumor that would not be advanced or life threatening! Everyone wants to hear they are fine. They think they have a great doctor. I now wish I would have found out about the 3T MRI imaging a year sooner and improved my outcome.",

I know that for me waiting the two months seems too long to find the trend. Perhaps more and sooner data points will help you plan a strategy. I does help for me as I plot the points on a graph (I use Excel, uPSA vs date) and bring that with me for my doctor visits. I feel it helps both me and my doctors see what's going on. Good luck!",

My urologist said it was nothing to worry about that it is still non-detectable. And, if I am worried, to repeat the test in six months vice one year. Has anyone else had a similar experience and what has the outcome been for you? Should I be concerned? Thank you for your thoughts on my concern as I have been though a rough time with surgery and several complications requiring more surgeries. I was hoping the Prostate cancer side of my health problems was over-with.",

      "Content": "My purpose here is not to scare anyone from their choice of treatment options but to make them aware of possible complications and a better advocate for themselves. Believe it or not, you may know your body better than your doctor. About three days after surgery at NYU hospital in Sept 2013, I developed a fever just under the cutoff for calling in to the doctor 101F. As you are on pain and antibiotic meds your temperature will be suppressed. I called the hotline anyway and was told not to worry but call back if you surpass 101F which it never did. As I live 200 miles north of NYC I had retained a hotel near NYU for ten days in the event a complication should occur. As it turned out the large incision at the umbilicus where the prostate gland was pulled through, had opened. When I presented myself first thing Monday morning at the doctors offices I at first was treated very poorly as to why I was there and then their response was that my wife should be able to dress my wound. When they saw that the wound was open and you can look into the deep hole in my body their attitude changed. However, they kept telling me the wound wasn't infected as the drainage was clear but since I was on Cipro as the cath was still in place they were wrong. Every morning I went to the doctors office and was told the same thing (no infection) as they had to pack a wet dressing deep into the wound. They had to arrange for a nurse to come to my home each day to dress the wound and allow it to heal from the bottom up. Once an incision opens it is considered a dirty wound that must be allowed to heal on its own. This took three months to heal and when I got home my internist changed the antibiotic after lab tests showed a staph infection that proved very difficult to resolve. I took antibiotics for nearly three months to clear the infection that would return in three days after completing each course of drugs. The problem here was that even though I felt I had a wound infection and kept telling them so from right after surgery, no doctor would believed me until I completed a round of drugs and smelly yellow fluid squirted out into my doctor's face as she pressed around the open wound that at least three or four doctors and many nurses said was not infected. Now that they had proof, they could then collect the yellow fluid to send to the lab and determine the best antibiotic treatment. Finally clear of infection, at my urging, my doctor ordered a CAT scan to see that there was no internal abcess and make sure all was well. The scan showed a huge mass in my abdominal area that the radiologist who read the scan thought was cancer. My doctor thought I was history. It was nearly two liters in size, compressing and displacing my bladder to the left. After much worry a good general surgeon I went to said it wasn't cancer but rather a very large lynphocele caused by removing a lymph node and not having a proper seal to stop the leakage of fluid. This process developed a cyst with many cambers containing fluid. Even though you may pick a fine surgeon to perform the robotic surgery he may be training others who may perform the lesser tasks like removing and sealing off lymph nodes. This may be especially true in teaching hospitals. I was told the lymphocele could be left in place unless it presented a problem. Some research literature states that small lymphoceles about the size of golf balls are quite common after cancer surgery but go undetected unless found as a result of imaging tests for some unrelated problem. About two months later I developed a very high fever 103+F and was rushed to a hospital and treated as a septis patient, a life threatening blood infection. I was put on every interveinous drug they had on the shelf and nothing lowered my fever. It turned out that Strep bacteria had invaded the lymph fluid in the lymphocele and I needed immediate surgery as drugs cannot get to the infected fluid. This was a very big surgery and a difficult recovery with a large incision from my umbilical to nearly my penis. Then after about six months recovery from these issues I developed a very big incisional hernia with small intestine bulging about four or five inches out from my stomach. The surgeon said it was probably a result of the tissue having been weakened from the prior infection. He wants me to undergo a four hour surgery to repair the hernia by patching in some pig skin at the defect. I am reluctant to do this as there is about a 40% chance it will fail and the hernia will return. I wear an elastic wrap to somewhat hide and protect the hernia. The good news is that my PSA at two years post op is 0.00! Although all of the many doctors and radiologists I saw steered my toward surgery due to my age and general good health, I may have been better served or had an easier experience had I chosen another treatment or maybe a local surgeon rather than a \"world class\" university hospital.",

My question is whether a tumor with Gleason 4 or 5 cancer cells are a result of Gleason 3 cells that have existed for a longer time and matured into a more aggressive cancer. Or are they different types of prostate cancer that are more aggressive than others. I realize the the more the prostate cancer cell looks less like a prostate tissue cell, the higher the Gleason score. But what makes them be more aggressive?",

      "Content": "He needs to get a \"good\" 3T MRI and tell him to keep still. That's really not that hard to do! Below is what I recently posted of my MRI experience on another thread. The importance of the 3T MRI. Several urologist kept telling me I was at low risk for prostate cancer and normal DREs. I finally got one urologist to refer me to NY University for the MRI. It found one small tumor. The next day the biopsy was done using the MRI data to locate and target the tumor. They took two biopsies at that location as well as the standard twelve grid biopsy of the entire prostate. Only one of the two \"targeted\" biopsies hit the tumor and all of the standard twelve grid biopsies were also negative. To repeat, 13 out of 14 biopsy locations were negative. Hence, without the MRI my Gleason 8 cancer would have been surely missed. The after surgery pathology report showed two additional tumors, Gleason 7 and 6. Need I say more about the chances of missing aggressive prostate cancers with hit and miss, blind biopsies. To prove my point, I had one jackass urologist that said he was so good at DREs that he never missed a cancer! Another jackass assured me that if he missed a tumor with a negative biopsy result, it meant I had a very small tumor that would not be advanced or life threatening! Everyone wants to hear they are fine. They think they have a great doctor. I now wish I would have found out about the 3T MRI imaging a year sooner and improved my outcome.",
