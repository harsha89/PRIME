      "Content": "Just sharing that my brother whom got diagnosed with a low level (perhaps considered the definition of indolent PCa, parameters as mentioned by Brady Urology-John Hopkins) has done W.W. (surveilance-monitoring) for about 5 yrs. now and does not seem insane. His psa has not moved upwards and even dropped a small amount over this time. It is his choice and he has read up on the issues, has Dr. Strums book A Primer on PCa, of which is an excellent source of overall information. Some people enjoy quality of life while they monitor, even though their uro-doc or whomever naturally recommended immediate treatment as if W.W. somehow is non-existent as a choice. It is a real choice, maybe not an easy choice to stand by and live knowing you have some form of PCa. Leading oncologists are less biased about immediate treatment at having indolent looking stats or even little higher stats. Never easy black and white on PCa issues on any level, everything you can think of is less than definitive, might be incorrect data, could even have false positives (prostascint scans). As Robert Young mentioned years ago....'it is a jungle'. (his website: www.phoenix5.org)",

No disrepect to you or others whom have been told they got it all or it was contained.....actual truth is maybe or \"likely\" or could have been. I don't necessarily want to quote Dr. Barken and other stuff, just always question anything on PCa is a good idea.

This is most of the related arsenal drugs used in one way or another on PCa. Alot of angles to fight this disease, once you are in the realm of post treatment (surgery, radiation, cryo, hifu etc.) and you fail the definition of cure psa levels, you might start thinking about a PCa onco-doc and these drugs to combat such. (of course you may have chosen a salvage treatment prior to the drug route or used the drugs in combo with a treatment or salvage). Bolla study shows decent results for combo of ADT hormone therapy prior and during and short time after radiations. Chemo therapies are numerous when used with combo drugs attacted with them, there is web information on alot of those protocols. I am not endorsing chemo treatments, but it is another choice in the PCa world. Dx-2002 I did (radiations) & ADT3 combo for 2 yrs.-Lupron+casodex+proscar, switched to DES-1mg shed myself of all those side effects and even better control, did well enough went of all drugs for 2 yrs., psa went up to 1.46 in Nov-2008 so resumed DES and psa now at .36 so far) Lots of choices to consider out there, the uro-docs do not know of or don't use hardly any of these other than LHRH and the casodex type drugs. Degarelix is new FDA approved- LHRH and does not give 'flare' at first as does the other LHRH, high stats people do not need any flare. It can be handled anyway by taking casodex and its equals 12-14 days prior to getting LHRH in your body (fyi). -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Post Edited (zufus) : 2/14/2009 3:28:54 AM (GMT-7)",

      "Content": "Yes to both of those items you mentioned, I cannot give specifics but those might be useful or to become useful (like) measles. As crazy as measles sounds it is maybe comparable strategy to the concept of using Provenge (a vaccines item). There could be a whole future to treating PCa in the vaccines area and in the manipulation of the cell receptors or at the stem cells too. Plants do have plant like estrogens, and estrogenic effects are super on PCa in general as to causing direct apoptosis (kills cells-PCa) not just making them dormant. There is a very interesting article (200 from Nature Publishing Group- Prostate Cancer & Prostate Diseases (200 11, 6-12 (1365-7852/08 $30) my onco-doc has this publication service apparently. Review: Soy isoflavone genistein in the prevention and treatment of prostate cancer (Dept. of Urology~University Hosp.~Bonn Germany) The concept of this document is this: these herbs which are generic and non-prescription could end up being used as a protocol for PCa and with decent results. The hard part is getting the doseage levels needed into a form that will be useable for patients, it is being looked at now. The players in this are: Genistein (comes from soy beans) and acts like a plant type of estrogen (safe) & then combined with Milkthistle which is 'Silymarin'. So Genistein + Silymarin (but in correct doseage levels), suggested you do not do this on your own or if you do understand the levels needed within this article, especially if you are on certain drug therapies currently, unknown if side effects would prevail. Soy products are useful in general and good to add into your diet if you wish to anyway. Silymarin is also used to promote good liver function, you can take it separately and should be useful to people. In general for foods: lycopene (tomatoes), bright colored fruits (anti-oxidants found), broccoli, cauliflower, watermelon, berries and even red wine, and dark chocolate, certain teas...all useful in helping to prevent cancers or assist in fighting cancers (local study showed patients got longer psa stabilization and even in the hrcpa group too(for some weeks to months), compared to control group without using like lycopene, carrotenoids and such. So there is some value in them.",
