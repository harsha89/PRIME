      "Content": "Agree with everything Highlander said. I had no side effects short of dry orgasms after surgery but that's probably because of luck, my very young age (40), the nature of my cancer, and the skill of my surgeon. The good news is that I've seen many men recover from the SEs over the course of a year or two. It's an ongoing process and you have reason to be optimistic. If things don't work out perfectly there are always medical procedures. Good luck.",

      "Content": "My surgery went perfectly, I'd recommend RP for qualifying cases any day under the proper circumstances (experienced surgeon). I've also read nothing but good things about BT and rarely a negative review. My thinking is that as a 40 year old with what appeared to be organ confined disease surgery was my logical choice, but if I was in my 60s I would have given more serious thought to BT. There are many equally effective forms of treatment depending on your particular situation and preferences.",
