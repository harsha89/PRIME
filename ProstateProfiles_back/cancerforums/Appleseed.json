      "Content": "..OK, I received via the telephone my first post operation PSA results today. It came in at 0.02 and that is a good start I might say. I am happy, but I know that it, the PSA can rise at any time in the near future having G9 aggressive PAc. Also, on paper I am stage 4 with the post operation pathology report of 1 positive lymph node out of 18 dissected. I say on paper because the cancer still needs to be metastasized proven cause it is so early post surgery. The Radiation Oncologist is ready to do Adjunctive IMRT with IGRT, I am still waiting to heal a bit more from incontinence and impotence. My Medical Oncologist would like to talk to his tumor review board for more opinions. My Surgeon suggests going for Adjunctive Therapy and using that window of time after surgery to go for Adjunctive.. I myself am confused.. ..Anyways a 0.02 is the great news I wanted to share with you all.. ............Appleseed.............Nick............ ..................................",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by mkane09 Nick, a first post-op PSA of .02 IS good, but don't fool yourself into thinking your treatment is over. You are very young, with a very aggressive disease. There is more cancer floating around inside of you. Let your doctors find it and kill it. If you have undetectable PSAs for the next 7-8 years, then I would consider using a word such as \"cured\". Now.....what are you confused about? mkane09 ..Good post mkane09. I need that............ .........Appleseed Nick.............................",
