    "Content": "Hiya, I've just joined this forum today as my Partner was diagnosed in September 2012 with Prostate Cancer. This followed 9 months of high blood counts and then a biopsy was done. He had the prostate removed in December 2012 and is now having radiation treatment as unfortunately the cancer had spread out of the prostate. Initially he was told it was contained (Sept 2012) but after they operated they said it was an aggressive tumour and the prostate was very full. He is currently having radiation treatment but is suffering badly with back ache and very bad pains in his legs. We asked a few weeks ago if they would be doing a bone scan but they said his levels did not require it. As he is in alot of pain do you think we should be pushing for a scan or can someone tell me why some people are scanned but not others. Unfortunately I don't know what his blood levels, etc were. We find it difficult to get any answers sometimes. My Partner is 53. Any advice would be appreciated. Thank you.",
