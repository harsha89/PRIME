    "Content": "Hello all, I have recently been diagnosed with PC. I am a T1c Stage IIa. I have a single isolated tumor 9mm. I had ruled out exteranal radiation, but i see here all of the positive feedback on that. Still, I was first considering robotic surgery and then met with a team that feels I am a prime candidate for High-Dose Radiation Brachytherapy as a monotherapy. It seems to me the latter might be best for me, and I am searching for someone who has my similar profile, has had this treatment, and maybe is at least a year out. I'd be interested in a first hand discussion if you are out there. I know UCLA seems to be trending this monotherapy, and I see there is currently a large study going on in Canada for this as a monotherapy. It just seems new, but realistic. so, if anyone is out there, who can weight in on your experiencd, I would be extremely grateful. Thanks!!!!",
