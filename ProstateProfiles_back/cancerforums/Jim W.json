Six times more men should blend out averages. Still, there are completely different predictions from the two.",

      "Content": "Gentlemen, Does anyone have a opinion/insight on the article titled \"If Prostate Cancer comes Back, Who needs Aggressive Treatment\"? The statistical information shows up in several internet web sites, but is easiest to understand there. It utilizes PSA doubling time, Gleason score, and time from surgery to return of PSA as the basis of the observations. It is completely different than the Prediction Tool of the Sloan Kettering Cancer Center. Both of these facilities are high on the list of quality care hospitals. How can they be so divergent? Thanks for your thoughts. Jim",

      "Content": "Gentlemen, Yale is part of a study trial called Hypofractionated Post Prostatectomy Therapy. There have been a few trials at different places already that appear to cause less toxicity. The pattern of fewer sessions with higher doses each time has been used for women's breast cancer. Overall, the total radiation strength is reduced. I was wondering if anyone on this board had participated or had any first hand information.",

      "Content": "Gentlemen, Highlander suggested I put this up for review. I have run the Sloan Kettering\"Risk of dying of prostate cancer in men with a rising PSA after radical prostatectomy\" nomogram. Basically, PSA 3.8 before surgery, G3+4, 65 years at surgery and now 72,PSA .238 at recurrence, 17.7 months doubling time, and 81 months from surgery to recurrence. Cancer contained to prostate. No further therapy. With that inputed, the SK nomogram suggests I have a 99% chance of dying in 5 years from prostate cancer. Inputing arbitrarily 1 month to recurrence rather than the 81, it suggests a 2% chance dying in 5 years and only 12% in 15 years. Something seems backwards to me. Has anyone else come across this? Thanks for your thoughts! Jim",

The radiation oncologist I spoke to suggested a 60% chance of success. My 7 year older brother has done this with the radiation only setting back his PSA 6 months with complications. So, we all would like to get to our use by date without something like this intervening. I'm just looking for qualified, informed, information as to the future possibilities. Johns Hopkins and Stephen Freedland suggests a 94% chance of going 15 years with my stats. I still don't understand Sloan Kettering's offering. Thanks for your thoughts. Third rock from the Sun Jim",

      "Content": "Gentlemen, This is a remarkable source of information I had not come across before. I had my Prostate out 4/5/10 with the DaVinci system. Ps after was .008 until 12/6/13 when it increased to .044. Then .057,.079,.112,.115,.151,and finally .238 at 6 month intervals. I have a appointment to see a radiation physician this month, but I am a little apprehensive. I'm 71 and in fair health other than the prostate glitch. My older brother went through this same program about 8 years ago and had some unfortunate side effects to the radiation. It also only temporarily set back his psa increase. So, given I'm 71, is the possible trade off of side effects vs possible inhibited psa worth the program? If I was younger, I'm told this would not be a difficult decision. Thanks for your opinion. Again, this is a remarkable site. My meter was leaning more towards the pessimistic side but not any more. Thanks guys My Gleason was 3+4=7 PSA before prostatectomy 3.8 perineural invasion identified carcinoma confined to the prostate lymph nodes clear pT2c Organ confined, bilateral disease",
