So the biopsy killed me and came here, gleason (who is this gleason guy anyway) 3+4 T1C and then doc said dont worry all good we just use the robot surgery, but first a pelvic scan or whatever it was, which was also killing me because id thought cancer was out and i didnt want to take it. So i came here and this person called HighlanderCFH gave me some nice words and told me to man up and do all exams so thats what i did. I promised to get back with the results so here i am, all good, no problem, ready for the surgery in 15 days. Im not sure if the waiting will kill me first, but i just wanted to say thanks, really thanks, i am now in god's hands, and also doc's hands too, so as a believer, i just expect to make a good comeback and start seeing life from another point of view. Theres always a time to change, might be my time now, thank you all.",

This time is about cancer recurrence, im reading that even if cancer is contained at that little thing called prostate, once its out, the recurrence chances are high, and most of the time, nuclear radiation (is it really nuclear radiation as the one used in bombs?) doesnt really help. Actually, most of the reading ive done says the optimal plan is A.- Surgery B.- If the bad guys come back, bring radiation in, if this doesnt work, goodbye. Ive read aswel that the highest grade of cancer, the most the recurrence will happen, so im kinda lost.

One last questions, since im stil not that old to meet jesus (next year i was expecting to become 60), why does everybody sound so optimistic? My doc, my girls, you (that dont even know me), all say theres solution, inside the prostate, outside the prostate, in the bones, not in the bones, because my numbers are not that bad. When they say they are good, does that mean i might see the man landing on the moon again or not that good? thank you for your time stranger, this is like my first time on a internet forum right after my girls said i should read more about others experience, been strange so far, but not regreting it, at least im not figthing this time hah",

I was diagnosed a t2c 3+4 if i recall good and soon i have to take the pelvic scan to check if theres any cancer there. Doctor said its just a normal procedure and that i shouldnt worry, that everything should be just fine before surgery with a robot, and this is a normal procedure. Im actually terrified because the doc sounded really , how to say, like if this werent a big deal, so in a few days im having this exam then results. What could i expect? 60 years old, t2c 3+4, both sides, found in 15% of the biopsy. Im really sorry for my english but i will do my best to answer questions regards luis",
