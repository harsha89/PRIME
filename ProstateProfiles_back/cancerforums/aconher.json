      "Content": "Hello guys, It's really nice to read your words. I've been reading a lot of information on Internet about PCa and finally I found this forum. 5 minutes ago I've been talking with my dad; I live and work in another city. The truth is that it's really unfair seeing how he has to fight to build his life after de Leukemia and now, when the things were going on well, a new cancer just appear. As my father says \"this is the life son and we have to take the things as they come and live the present; what is going to happen just will happen\". He is a normal country side hard worker man, focus on his family and his wife and fighting every day to bring money to the house. I hope that my superheroe fights hard and win the battle again. My best regards guys and keep fighting!",

      "Content": "Hello guys, my father has gone to the final appointment with the urologist. We have good news (we can call it good news). CT and MRI has been done and he is totally clean. Cancer is contained in the prostate. The urologist has said that the tumor is not so big and the surgery will be done ASAP. This weekend i´ll be visiting my parents and i´ll be able to see all the results and check all the papers. I´ll keep you informed. Thanks a lot and keep fighting!",

      "Content": "Hello dear all, I´m aconher, from Spain (sorry about my English, I´ve been studying some years but have to improve). First of all give you all my congratulations for this forum. It´s a nice way to share our emotions and feelings and a great database of experiences and stories. Our story is as follows: 18 years ago my father was diagnosed with Leukemia, on his 30s; fortunately he is so strong and due to he had really clear that he wanted to live he could win the battle. I was 15 years old and I remembered that it was a shock for me. My little sister was recently newborn and my little brother was 7 years old. A really bad time. Now, 18 years later, cancer is coming back, and over the same person, my lovely dad. He is 53 and 1 week ago he was diagnosed with PCa. He went to emergency with my mom because he said that in the zone of pelvis he noticed something \"rare\". When he finished of doing pee he noticed a \"freedom\" sensation or something like that on this zone. He also said that noticed some little pain on the anus zone (he has had always hemorrhoids so it could be related with this pain). The doctor made a DRE and he noticed that the prostate was harder than normal and recommended go to the urologist to made a blood analysis and determine the PSA level. That was his first PSA analysis, so I don´t have previous numbers. PSA before biopsy was 9.24 with a free PSA of 10%. The urologist made a Biopsy taking 9 cores, 5 on the right side of the prostate and 4 on the left side. The results has been as follows: - Diagnostic: PROSTATE CANCER - RIGHT AND LEFT LOBES - GLEASON 7 (3+4). - Right lobe: 5/5 positive cores -----> 30%, 30%, 20%, 10%, 10%. - Left lobe: 1/4 positive cores ------> 30%. On this week some tests will be done to determine if the cancer has spread to the body or is still on the prostate and on the next Monday we´ll have the final meeting with the urologist to see all the results and see what can we do. The truth is that we are all really sad and afraid because that is not fair, 2 times to the same person. A really good and humble person. I´ll tell you the news on Monday. What´s your opinion? Can you recommend me something based on your experiences? Thanks a lot for reading me and all my best wishes and love!",
