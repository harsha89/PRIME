    "Content": "Hi, I am presently a 54 yr. old \"low risk\" PCA guy with a single G6 core from a biopsy last year and on AS. In case I need to seek treatment based on my upcoming confirmatory biopsy, I'm considering SBRT. I've been going to Duke for consults thus far, and SBRT does not seem to be an option with them. Can anyone recommend an SBRT center in the Raleigh NC area if I end up needing treatment? Note that my plan and hope is to remain on AS for years, but in case I need something, I'm intrigued by these newer rad treatments. Thanks!",
