    "Content": "I had my prostate removed July 2007, and have/had constant urinary dribble (no control) ever since. Kegels and Bio feedback therapy didn't help, and i opted for a AUS implant Jan 2008 . Yes, it was soon, but my doctor predicted no control improvement. The sling was also ruled out ... just not a good track record. Now i have normal control, minimal leakage (1 lite pad per day or 1 fresh kleenex per bathroom stop). But this topic is to show how i handled those 7 months of constant flow, wearing shorts, playing golf, going fishing, with no stinkiness (well, very little anyway!), and no squishiness. Most posts i have seen on this topic discuss which diaper is best .... no thanks!! i tried them for a few days, and scurried to find/invent something better. So here goes .... if it can help someone else be more comfortable, more active, and less self-conscious, great! Daytime: Summer daytime wear when not sure about bathroom availability (golf course?): texas catheter, snugged up a little with stretch wrap and tape (just in hope of preventing backflow for a few hours), draining almost sideways into a disposable urine bag, supported (hung) by a shoestring from waistband of underwear (a jockstrap works well), with same shostring tied around thigh to hold it in place, then urine bag is folded upward in half, secured by a small strap. This can be worn with knee length shorts, needs to be emptied every couple of hours, and has lasted for 24 hours, although I usually remove and clean it before bedtime. Daytime when bathrooms are available: a CVS pharmacy male guard (pad), folded in half over the penis head, wrapped securely with a couple bands of tape (1 near the head, the other at the shaft base). I use painters tape from LOWE'S... a lot cheaper than Johnson and Johnson products. The tape helps prevent leakage and pullout. Wear this with BRIEFS. The adhesive on the pad, and the tight fitting briefs, and the taped sheath all work to prevent pullout. I drink about 60 oz daily, and these pads last 2 to 3 hours (a stretch). I watch the clock and change every 2 hours ... very little odor, no squishiness when sitting, not noticeable through outer wear. Daytime better solution: I later switched to the ALPHADRY condom system ... great results ... I wear it morning till bedtime. It's a condom with expandable bag attached directly; it all folds easily inside normal brief underwear. See alphadry.com At first glance, it seems pricey, but with 1 lasting 15 days (remove and clean daily), and me going through 10 pads in the daytime, it's actually cheaper. Also, more convenient than pads/sheaths etc., and although it's basically an external cath with urine bag , the compact configuration (no straps, no tubing) is a real PLUS! Nighttime : Same CVS male guard pads taped into a sheath, but instead of regular briefs, I wear Serenity Tena brief style underwear, in case overflow happens. Overflow rarely happens for me ... I tend to retain some urine when laying down, and I will awake with an urge to go every 2 to 4 hours ... the sheath will be pretty full, and will be changed at this time. For having cancer, and my prostate removed (cancer all contained) , ED, no urinary control (before AUS) , i am still one of the luckier ones. After the prostatectomy, i had NO futher treatments, no radiation required, no chemo required , and psa is still 0.0 . From what i have read in the forums, there are a lot of guys out there with 'not so good' results. And i also read that many are self-conscious, and have restricted their lifestyle, just due to urinary incontinence. Maybe this can help a little. Good luck!",
