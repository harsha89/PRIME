      "Content": "i would like to ask your opinion. i took my psa on may 25th. the results came back today as a 10.84 my uro prescribed me with cipro, because he believes it may be an infection. i'm instructed to take it once every 12hrs for two weeks, then come back july 3rd. for another psa testing. from my understanding cipro don't always bring down the psa or doesn't do a good job of treating infections. if you take a look at my signature, that would give you a good idea of my history. last friday, my urinalysis showed that i had leukocytes in my urine. the urine was taken for a culture, but came back negative. so, if the test came back negative, but the psa is ten, why would my uro think it may be an infection? if my psa was 7.74 in november, and 10.84 in may, that is a 3.1 spike. shouldn't that be a concern? my uro also performed a dre after having blood drawn. he said everything felt smooth and normal with the exception of a slight enlargement. he went on to say that it was to be expected considering my age and that i have bph. what R your thoughts on this matter?",

      "Content": "hello, i have my results of the biopsy. my report says 6 of the 8 cores taken are gleason 7 prostate cancer. here's the rest of what was said and written. i down't know how to attach the pathology report for everyone to C. that's quite a bit to copy. i'm scared and sad. i don't know what to do. This letter is a follow-up to our telephone call today 2/28/2019. As I discussed with you, your pathology results for your prostate biopsy indicates that SIX of your EIGHT sample cores were positive for prostatic adenocarcinoma (prostate cancer). The severity of prostate cancer is graded on a scale from 2 to 10 called the Gleason Score. Prostate cancer with Gleason Scores 7 through 10 are considered ones in which medical intervention is required. SIX of your prostate samples from the three lesions previously identified by MRI prostate had Gleason Scores of 7 or greater. Medical intervention is typically radiation therapy or radical prostatectomy (surgical removal of the entire prostate). However, these are not the only treatment options available to patients. Your earlier MRI of prostate indicated that there was no evidence of spread of cancer beyond the prostate to the lymph nodes or pelvic bones. This is great news! You have informed me that you will contact me early the week of March 4th 2019 to inform me who you would like to meet with for the Multidisciplinary Prostate Cancer Clinic appointment. I can schedule you with Dr. Sanda, Dr. Patteras or Dr. Filson. The purpose of the Multidisciplinary Prostate Cancer Clinic: \u0095 To inform patient of all available treatment choices \u0095 To help patient evaluate all the treatment options \u0095 To answer questions about available therapies \u0095 To help patient with choosing a treatment option What we recommend between now and your appointment is to do your own research on the following topics. Prostate cancer, radiation therapy for prostate cancer, prostatectomy, recovery time after prostatectomy, and Gleason Scores. This research will help you formulate questions to ask the doctor that you meet with at the follow-up. We encourage you to bring either a spouse, fiancee, family member or friend to your follow-up appointment. This will allow you to focus your attention on the discussion with the doctor while your guest can capture notes and provide emotional support. A copy of your pathology report for prostate biopsy is attached. Listed is a link that may be helpful in your research about prostate cancer: https://www.cancer.org/content/dam/C...ic/8796.00.pdf Please let me know if you have any questions in regard to your results.

      "Content": "i would like to ask your opinion. i took my psa on may 25th. the results came back today as a 10.84 my uro prescribed me with cipro, because he believes it may be an infection. i'm instructed to take it once every 12hrs for two weeks, then come back july 3rd. for another psa testing. from my understanding cipro don't always bring down the psa or doesn't do a good job of treating infections. if you take a look at my signature, that would give you a good idea of my history. last friday, my urinalysis showed that i had leukocytes in my urine. the urine was taken for a culture, but came back negative. so, if the test came back negative, but the psa is ten, why would my uro think it may be an infection? if my psa was 7.74 in november, and 10.84 in may, that is a 3.1 spike. shouldn't that be a concern? my uro also performed a dre after having blood drawn. he said everything felt smooth and normal with the exception of a slight enlargement. he went on to say that it was to be expected considering my age and that i have bph. what R your thoughts on this matter?",

      "Content": "hello, i have my results of the biopsy. my report says 6 of the 8 cores taken are gleason 7 prostate cancer. here's the rest of what was said and written. i down't know how to attach the pathology report for everyone to C. that's quite a bit to copy. i'm scared and sad. i don't know what to do. This letter is a follow-up to our telephone call today 2/28/2019. As I discussed with you, your pathology results for your prostate biopsy indicates that SIX of your EIGHT sample cores were positive for prostatic adenocarcinoma (prostate cancer). The severity of prostate cancer is graded on a scale from 2 to 10 called the Gleason Score. Prostate cancer with Gleason Scores 7 through 10 are considered ones in which medical intervention is required. SIX of your prostate samples from the three lesions previously identified by MRI prostate had Gleason Scores of 7 or greater. Medical intervention is typically radiation therapy or radical prostatectomy (surgical removal of the entire prostate). However, these are not the only treatment options available to patients. Your earlier MRI of prostate indicated that there was no evidence of spread of cancer beyond the prostate to the lymph nodes or pelvic bones. This is great news! You have informed me that you will contact me early the week of March 4th 2019 to inform me who you would like to meet with for the Multidisciplinary Prostate Cancer Clinic appointment. I can schedule you with Dr. Sanda, Dr. Patteras or Dr. Filson. The purpose of the Multidisciplinary Prostate Cancer Clinic: \u0095 To inform patient of all available treatment choices \u0095 To help patient evaluate all the treatment options \u0095 To answer questions about available therapies \u0095 To help patient with choosing a treatment option What we recommend between now and your appointment is to do your own research on the following topics. Prostate cancer, radiation therapy for prostate cancer, prostatectomy, recovery time after prostatectomy, and Gleason Scores. This research will help you formulate questions to ask the doctor that you meet with at the follow-up. We encourage you to bring either a spouse, fiancee, family member or friend to your follow-up appointment. This will allow you to focus your attention on the discussion with the doctor while your guest can capture notes and provide emotional support. A copy of your pathology report for prostate biopsy is attached. Listed is a link that may be helpful in your research about prostate cancer: https://www.cancer.org/content/dam/C...ic/8796.00.pdf Please let me know if you have any questions in regard to your results.

      "Content": "i would like to ask your opinion. i took my psa on may 25th. the results came back today as a 10.84 my uro prescribed me with cipro, because he believes it may be an infection. i'm instructed to take it once every 12hrs for two weeks, then come back july 3rd. for another psa testing. from my understanding cipro don't always bring down the psa or doesn't do a good job of treating infections. if you take a look at my signature, that would give you a good idea of my history. last friday, my urinalysis showed that i had leukocytes in my urine. the urine was taken for a culture, but came back negative. so, if the test came back negative, but the psa is ten, why would my uro think it may be an infection? if my psa was 7.74 in november, and 10.84 in may, that is a 3.1 spike. shouldn't that be a concern? my uro also performed a dre after having blood drawn. he said everything felt smooth and normal with the exception of a slight enlargement. he went on to say that it was to be expected considering my age and that i have bph. what R your thoughts on this matter?",

      "Content": "hello, i have my results of the biopsy. my report says 6 of the 8 cores taken are gleason 7 prostate cancer. here's the rest of what was said and written. i down't know how to attach the pathology report for everyone to C. that's quite a bit to copy. i'm scared and sad. i don't know what to do. This letter is a follow-up to our telephone call today 2/28/2019. As I discussed with you, your pathology results for your prostate biopsy indicates that SIX of your EIGHT sample cores were positive for prostatic adenocarcinoma (prostate cancer). The severity of prostate cancer is graded on a scale from 2 to 10 called the Gleason Score. Prostate cancer with Gleason Scores 7 through 10 are considered ones in which medical intervention is required. SIX of your prostate samples from the three lesions previously identified by MRI prostate had Gleason Scores of 7 or greater. Medical intervention is typically radiation therapy or radical prostatectomy (surgical removal of the entire prostate). However, these are not the only treatment options available to patients. Your earlier MRI of prostate indicated that there was no evidence of spread of cancer beyond the prostate to the lymph nodes or pelvic bones. This is great news! You have informed me that you will contact me early the week of March 4th 2019 to inform me who you would like to meet with for the Multidisciplinary Prostate Cancer Clinic appointment. I can schedule you with Dr. Sanda, Dr. Patteras or Dr. Filson. The purpose of the Multidisciplinary Prostate Cancer Clinic: \u0095 To inform patient of all available treatment choices \u0095 To help patient evaluate all the treatment options \u0095 To answer questions about available therapies \u0095 To help patient with choosing a treatment option What we recommend between now and your appointment is to do your own research on the following topics. Prostate cancer, radiation therapy for prostate cancer, prostatectomy, recovery time after prostatectomy, and Gleason Scores. This research will help you formulate questions to ask the doctor that you meet with at the follow-up. We encourage you to bring either a spouse, fiancee, family member or friend to your follow-up appointment. This will allow you to focus your attention on the discussion with the doctor while your guest can capture notes and provide emotional support. A copy of your pathology report for prostate biopsy is attached. Listed is a link that may be helpful in your research about prostate cancer: https://www.cancer.org/content/dam/C...ic/8796.00.pdf Please let me know if you have any questions in regard to your results.

      "Content": "hello, good people. i would like to share with you my MRI/Ultrasound fusion targeted biopsy experience. as some of you may know, there were three lesions found on my prostate during my 3T mpMRI. one was a PI-RADS 4 and the other two were a PI-RADS 3. well, my uro recommended i have a MRI/Ultrasound fusion targeted biopsy. my uro who performed the biopsy was dr. cara cimmino. she and i discussed my situation and she decided in order to prevent risk, she would only target the three legions and not take anymore samples. so she prescribed me bactrim for the antibiotic, magnesium citrate for a laxative and two pills of valium to reduce anxiety. i was scheduled to take the laxative the night before. i had water diarrhea. for most of the night, but luckily, it subsided 'round 2am eastern time. the bactrim i took at the next morning at 8am and i waited to get to the hosp. to start the procedure before i took the valium. right B4, dr. cimmino performed the biopsy, she performed a DRE and said that it felt normal. the nurse gave me an antibiotic shot, in my behind and numbed my rectal area. then she proceeded to perform the biopsy. she took like three samples from each lesion and told me that everything went well. she says the results should be back within a week. when i tell you i felt every nook and cranny, OMG. i thought the valium would knock me out. the valium didn't kick in until after the procedure was over. the biopsy took about 15 - 20 min. so, i'm guessing i'll know the results by this or next week.",

      "Content": "hello, good people. i would like to share with you my MRI/Ultrasound fusion targeted biopsy experience. as some of you may know, there were three lesions found on my prostate during my 3T mpMRI. one was a PI-RADS 4 and the other two were a PI-RADS 3. well, my uro recommended i have a MRI/Ultrasound fusion targeted biopsy. my uro who performed the biopsy was dr. cara cimmino. she and i discussed my situation and she decided in order to prevent risk, she would only target the three legions and not take anymore samples. so she prescribed me bactrim for the antibiotic, magnesium citrate for a laxative and two pills of valium to reduce anxiety. i was scheduled to take the laxative the night before. i had water diarrhea. for most of the night, but luckily, it subsided 'round 2am eastern time. the bactrim i took at the next morning at 8am and i waited to get to the hosp. to start the procedure before i took the valium. right B4, dr. cimmino performed the biopsy, she performed a DRE and said that it felt normal. the nurse gave me an antibiotic shot, in my behind and numbed my rectal area. then she proceeded to perform the biopsy. she took like three samples from each lesion and told me that everything went well. she says the results should be back within a week. when i tell you i felt every nook and cranny, OMG. i thought the valium would knock me out. the valium didn't kick in until after the procedure was over. the biopsy took about 15 - 20 min. so, i'm guessing i'll know the results by this or next week.",

      "Content": "hello, good people. how are you? yesterday, i went to have my 3T MRI done. it was a fairly easy process. it was sort of a two part MRI: 1. there was a procedure done with contrast. 2. the second 1/2 was done without contrast. after the MRI, the tech created a CD copy given to me, so the next time i see my uro, he can have a copy. i was told to take gas-x for breakfast, lunch and dinner the day before the MRI, and take one gas-x pill the day of the MRI. the MRI lasted close to an hr. i was told to expect results within 24 - 48hrs. i tried to look at the MRI pictures and all i saw was a bunch of black and white huey/gooey. there was one picture i saw a highlighted round circle, but who knows what that could mean? i could use some encouragement. please help.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by Wilde Hi Sw, did you also get a freePSA measure? That may indicate what is going on. hi, wilde. yes, i had a freePSA measured. here are the results.: 1/14/2016 15:44 Prostate Specific Antigen 7.66 ng/mL Free Prostate Specific Antigen 0.67 ng/mL Prostate Specific Antigen Ratio 8.7 % here's what my uro had to say to these results: PSA still high, with concerning free-fraction, making risk of having prostate cancer around 56% (normal risk with high PSA is around [30%). But you had inflammation on last biopsy, so the slightly higher PSA could easily come from that inflammation. There is another test performed on post-prostate massage urine sample that measures gene expression called PCA3 test. If the gene expression is low, the 75% negative predictive value that you do not have prostate cancer. If it is abnormal, then the 57% positive predictive value that you do have something. Thus, it is much better at reassuring us that there is nothing concerning there when negative, and sparing you from another biopsy. The PCA3 test is FDA approved, but insurance does not reimburse enough to cover the test, so patients are directly billed $175 for it. For most men, that price is worth it to avoid another biopsy. If you want to have that done, make an appointment for RV (return visit) and we can get that done quickly. If the PCA3 test is positive, then I would recommend getting a multi-parametric MR of the prostate which can identify suspicious areas for biopsy. We then would fuse the MR images with a 3-dimensional prostate ultrasound to get targeted biopsies of those suspicious areas rather than the 12 \"template\" biopsies with standard prostate sampling. You could skip the PCA3 test and go to the multi-parametric MR if you were concerned about the cost of the PCA3, but I think it is worth the price to avoid another biopsy if possible. so, i had a 2nd opinion from another urologist. his suggestion was to try a new blood test called Apifiny. this blood test is the only cancer specific, non-PSA blood test that measures specific biological markers known to be associated with an immune system response to prostate cancer. if the score is 0 - 59, this means i'm in a lower risk category for having PC. if the score is 60 - 100, this would place me in the higher category for having PC. my score was 41. so since my score was within this range, my uro decided to just monitor my PSA. should it rise, he will order a MRI.",

      "Content": "i can't recall if i told any of you i had my 3T MRI this past may. when i first went to see my new uro, he said we would monitor the PSA. if my PSA remains at a 6 or below, we would just continue to monitor every 6 months. if my psa elevates to a 7 or above, then a 3T MRI would be ordered. well, in april my psa was a 7.26. as a matter of fact, here's a list of my past psa results: 03.2016 | PSA = 6.21 07.2016 | PSA = 6.92 10.2016 | PSA = 6.94 04.2017 | PSA = 7.26 (3T MRI ordered) 10.2017 | PSA = 7.74 i'm not sure how to send you a full copy of my 3T MRI results, so i'll just send you the parts that concerns me. prostate: size: 3.4 X 4.1 X 4.3cm volume: 31mL peripheral zone: normal. there is a mild diffuse increased perfusion of the left prostate gland that could be secondary to prostatitis. basically, the MRI was normal, but it suspected or saw prostatitis. when i went for my six month follow up on oct 10th, he tested my psa. i asked him what is the next plan. he said we will continue to monitor my psa every six months. if the psa rises to a 9 or above, he will prescribe some antibiotics to make sure it's inflammation. if my psa is still 9 or above he will have another 3T MRI and possibly a saturated biopsy. the psa results were a 7.74 i was so glad to know there was no need for a biopsy because of the results of my MRI, i didn't think to ask him, why won't he treat the inflammation, since he might suspect that may be the case if my PSA goes to a 9. the MRI said it saw prostatitis. it seems to me as if he's still monitoring for cancer and not treating the inflammation which may bring down the PSA. why does my psa keep elevating? i'm glad it's not a 9 and i'm MOST HAPPY it's not cancer, but i feel if he treats the prostatitis or inflammation, then maybe my psa'll go down. i take saw palmetto 320mg. my symptoms are not unbearable, but i would feel much better if we could find a better way to bring down my psa. what are your thoughts?",

      "Content": "Hello, everybody. Let me first wish you a very HAPPY NEW YEAR!! As some of you know, this past summer, I took the regular PSA and it turned out to be a 5.9, higher than the 5.5 PSA in July of. So, my uro, asked me to have a free/total PSA done in six months. Well, yesterday, I had my free/total PSA and I'd like to share with you the results. I'm not ashamed to say that I am scared and confused. Please share with me your thoughts. Here are the results and comments: Here are the comments my urologist emailed to me: PSA still high, with concerning free-fraction, making risk of having prostate cancer around 56% (normal risk with high PSA is around 30%). But you had inflammation on last biopsy, so the slightly higher PSA could easily come from that inflammation. There is another test performed on post-prostate massage urine sample that measures gene expression called PCA3 test. If the gene expression is low, the 75% negative predictive value that you do not have prostate cancer. If it is abnormal, then the 57% positive predictive value that you do have something. Thus, it is much better at reassuring us that there is nothing concerning there when negative, and sparing you from another biopsy. The PCA3 test is FDA approved, but insurance does not reimburse enough to cover the test, so patients are directly billed $175 for it. For most men, that price is worth it to avoid another biopsy. If you want to have that done, make an appointment for RV (return visit) and we can get that done quickly. If the PCA3 test is positive, then I would recommend getting a multi-parametric MR of the prostate which can identify suspicious areas for biopsy. We then would fuse the MR images with a 3-dimensional prostate ultrasound to get targeted biopsies of those suspicious areas rather than the 12 \"template\" biopsies with standard prostate sampling. You could skip the PCA3 test and go to the multi-parametric MR if you were concerned about the cost of the PCA3, but I think it is worth the price to avoid another biopsy if possible. Here are the Results of the actual Free/Total PSA: Date Result Name Value Ref Range 1/14/2016 15:44 Prostate Specific Antigen 7.66 ng/mL (0.00 - 4.00) 1/14/2016 15:44 Free Prostate Specific Antigen 0.67 ng/mL 1/14/2016 15:44 Prostate Specific Antigen Ratio 8.7 %",

      "Content": "hello, everyone. i received a call from the urology office and my PSA went down from a 7.6 to a 6.2. because my PSA is still above 5.5 when it was first checked, my uro recommends a biopsy. my urologist understands since i had some concerns about him performing a DRE before having blood drawn, he doesn't mind re-checking my PSA. i asked the nurse about the results of the apifiny blood exam. she said those haven't come back, yet. i thought if the apifiny results were above a score of 59, that would be a reason to recommend a biopsy. so, i have a few concerns: 1. should i go ahead with the biopsy or wait 'til the apifiny results come back? 2. do you really think my uro performing a DRE before having blood drawn really caused my PSA to be 6.2? 3. since my uro recommends a biopsy with a 6.2 PSA, do you think he'll still recommend a biopsy if my apifiny results are under 59?",
