    "Content": "today i am at 3 months post radiation treatment(39) for prostrate cancer. i was expecting to go back to normal within 2 to four weeks as i was assured by my cancer doctor. i never started feeling better at all. i experienced dizziness, shortness of breath, no energy, tiring too easy, and plenty of anxiety. i visited my urologist and primary doctor, who recommended i see my cardiologist where it was determined that i have an irregular heartbeat.",
