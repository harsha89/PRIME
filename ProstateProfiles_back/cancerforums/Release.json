      "Content": "At the age of 50, I was diagnosed with Prostate Cancer and had a Laparoscopic Radical Prostatectomy 6 months later, including Seminal Vesicles August 2010 at a NCI Cancer Center. First PSA ever, 3/10 -16.9 with symptoms of a UTI/Kidney Infeciton. 6 weeks later folliowing 2 rounds of antibiotics, PSA 24.6. 6 weeks prior to Surgery and after small dose oif Casodex, PSA 17 Post prostatectomy pathology: Gleason 3+4. In Situ, Clear margins Nerve involvement in aproximately 25% required excision. 3 month post surgical PSA at operating cancer center <.1 6 month post surgical PSA operating cancer center <.1 9 month post surgical PSA operating cancer center .1 10.5 month at Quest .05 12 month post surgical PSA operating cancer center <.1 13.5 month at Quest .1 Additional info: The 10.5 Month Quest was a PSA Post Prostatectomy, using DPC Immulite 2000 Method. The 13.5 Month Quest was a PSA Total, using Siemens chemiluminescent method. So what does this mean? Question 1 The big question I can't seem to get answered is for tests that are not the \"Ultra\" type, do the labs use any rounding, i.e., if it is .06, does it get rounded to .1 ? Question 2 With \"nerve sparing\" surgery techniques, is there the possibiliy that there is benign PSA from the nerves left behind? Answer (no thanks to this apparently dead answer board - yes, prostatic tissue that remains, especially with nerve sparing surgery does produce some PSA) In fact, a PSA between .2 and .6 is subject to watchful waiting and does not automatically mean salvage radiation is the next course of action.",
