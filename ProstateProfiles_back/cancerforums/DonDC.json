      "Content": "And of course it is covered in the book on pages 186-187 - 1.5 percent misdiagnosed each year according to Epstein. \"Gleason scores are usually in excellent agreement at academic medical centers...but community settings\" not so much \"...get a second opinion before getting any further treatment...\" \"Beware the low grade Gleason score - particularly erroneous\" --------------------------------------- A FAQ page by Epstein www.adasp.org/FAQs ------------------ And more detail by Epstein http://cancernews.com/data/Article/701.asp \"If one looked at the entire group of men, only 3/684 (0.4%) outside benign cases were diagnosed upon review as cancer.\" but then notes how there is little info to go on - so don't take this to the bank. \"In summary, overall the vast majority of pathology diagnoses are accurate and rendered by competent pathologists who have received extensive specialty and, in some cases, subspecialty training and who continue to maintain their medical education through formal and informal processes. Nevertheless, there is a minority of pathology assessments that, when reviewed by experts in the field, will end up with a different diagnosis that could significantly affect the treatment and prognosis of the patient. Although the overall percentage of affected cases is not large, the consistent rate of discrepant diagnosis uncovered by second opinion surgical pathology may have an enormous human and financial impact. Given that the pathologic diagnosis is the foundation for all subsequent patient treatment, it is reasonable to consider obtaining a second opinion from an expert on your pathology specimen, especially for those with a malignant diagnosis or an equivocally malignant (ie. atypical) diagnosis. Atypical diagnoses have a relatively high likelihood of being more definitively diagnosed as either benign or malignant by an expert reviewing the case. Malignant diagnoses are very uncommonly changed to \u201cbenign\u201d upon review, but the consequences of a misdiagnosis are so drastic that it is reasonable to get a review for these cases as well. For example, with prostate needle biopsies, even though there is only about a 1.4% chance of a prostate cancer diagnosis being changed to not cancer upon review by an expert, this means for every 200 men diagnosed with prostate cancer there are 3 men who may not have cancer. This number, while low, is not rare. More frequently, even for the cancer cases with an accurate diagnosis, the grade may be changed in about 1 in 5 cases by expert review which could have a major impact in treatment and prognosis.\" (Epstein's words are worth reading)",

      "Content": "And of course it is covered in the book on pages 186-187 - 1.5 percent misdiagnosed each year according to Epstein. \"Gleason scores are usually in excellent agreement at academic medical centers...but community settings\" not so much \"...get a second opinion before getting any further treatment...\" \"Beware the low grade Gleason score - particularly erroneous\" --------------------------------------- A FAQ page by Epstein www.adasp.org/FAQs ------------------ And more detail by Epstein http://cancernews.com/data/Article/701.asp \"If one looked at the entire group of men, only 3/684 (0.4%) outside benign cases were diagnosed upon review as cancer.\" but then notes how there is little info to go on - so don't take this to the bank. \"In summary, overall the vast majority of pathology diagnoses are accurate and rendered by competent pathologists who have received extensive specialty and, in some cases, subspecialty training and who continue to maintain their medical education through formal and informal processes. Nevertheless, there is a minority of pathology assessments that, when reviewed by experts in the field, will end up with a different diagnosis that could significantly affect the treatment and prognosis of the patient. Although the overall percentage of affected cases is not large, the consistent rate of discrepant diagnosis uncovered by second opinion surgical pathology may have an enormous human and financial impact. Given that the pathologic diagnosis is the foundation for all subsequent patient treatment, it is reasonable to consider obtaining a second opinion from an expert on your pathology specimen, especially for those with a malignant diagnosis or an equivocally malignant (ie. atypical) diagnosis. Atypical diagnoses have a relatively high likelihood of being more definitively diagnosed as either benign or malignant by an expert reviewing the case. Malignant diagnoses are very uncommonly changed to \u201cbenign\u201d upon review, but the consequences of a misdiagnosis are so drastic that it is reasonable to get a review for these cases as well. For example, with prostate needle biopsies, even though there is only about a 1.4% chance of a prostate cancer diagnosis being changed to not cancer upon review by an expert, this means for every 200 men diagnosed with prostate cancer there are 3 men who may not have cancer. This number, while low, is not rare. More frequently, even for the cancer cases with an accurate diagnosis, the grade may be changed in about 1 in 5 cases by expert review which could have a major impact in treatment and prognosis.\" (Epstein's words are worth reading)",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by Pratoman Epstein looked at my slides, and downgraded me from G8 (3+5) to G6 I think a second opinion is always warranted in PC, the reading is very subjective. Thanks - not sure I can swing that much money for a low percentage chance. If needed I could but we are saving for college, etc. Reading the book by Walsh was reassuring. I will summarize pages 179-180 ------ Just a few years ago doctors believed PIN necessitated another biopsy soon cause cancer was likely missed. But with more samples now this happens less often. If pin found alone usually don't advise a repeat biopsy. A large study showed HGPIN and repeat biopsy no more likely to find cancer than other men - unless there is a lot of HGPIN. Epstein now says 3-4 cores = 40-75% eventually diagnosed with PCa. ----------- I had two cores - certainly worth PSA test in 6 months and further testing as advised by doctor - as I have decided to keep getting older and thus put myself in a higher risk bracket. I shall be aggressive in encouraging further testing as I am close to the edge it seems. Maybe an MRI like the doctor mentioned if the psa gets higher. The article quoting Epstein must have been a few years old. Fall of 2002. Ancient. Doesn't negate the idea of getting a second opinion - but it seems I am on the safe side of the cancer line for now? Epstein might downgrade me or even upgrade to a gleason 6? I am just not sure if it is worth the money - but maybe it is? My pathologist was Edward Poole In Oklahoma. Not sure why they sent the slides from DC to Oklahoma. He seems to have a lot of experience - mostly in prostate pathology and has published. http://www.vitals.com/doctors/Dr_Edw...le/credentials",

Dr thought it could lead to constipation (with my already enlarged prostate - making three possible impediments to being able to pee I guess) so instead wrote an Rx for anxiety pills - which I think helped. Pain is somewhat subjective and if one is fearing pain one will often experience more pain, or so the theory goes. I also took 1000mg acetaminophen as well which probably helped. I also found an NIH document that said about 1/3 of urologists use no pain meds at all for TRUS biopsies. http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4170156/ No wonder so many guys have awful experiences. See https://theprostatedecision.wordpres...opsy-revealed/ DURING - My doc uses lidocaine topical and injected (lidocaine I think). The gold standard as I understand (or misunderstand it) http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16280735 Getting a filling was worse and I have never had a bad dentist visit. Actually almost a pleasant experience. I would recommend my doc but he is moving in June. During the procedure he took 14 samples. I get results in one week. Only slight pain with first injection of pain med - that was it. Otherwise it felt like a toy gun was lightly tapping against my butt. At one point he said one of the later samples would be more painful but it wasn't. AFTER - blood of course - I asked about a pad or whatever but they didn't do that. Have to throw away a pair of shorts now - I guess next time I will bring a depends brief. Gets kind of achy when the Tylenol wears off - but not bad at all when it kicks in. After 6 hours no more Tylenol needed. NEXT APPOINTMENT- As I see it I have a lot of reading to do no matter what the results are that I get next week. 1) no cancer found - so how often should I come back for a psa or a biopsy or maybe the 4KScore test - if it makes it here soon from Cleveland. http://consultqd.clevelandclinic.org...ostate-cancer/ 2) Low grade/score cancer - lots to read about whether to watch and surveil or to get it out. Leaning toward getting it out while it is smaller. 3) High grade cancer - surgery or radiation or what? Being 57 I suppose surgery is the best option. There is a lot to staging that I need to learn once I get results, but I would like to be prepared to ask useful questions. Odds are 60% that no cancer is found, 23% that it is low grade and 17% that it is high grade according to the Cleveland clinic calculator http://www.clevelandclinic.org/lp/pr...ent/index.html Thanks for any insights.

      "Content": "Had biopsy done Thursday - get results next Thursday. Any advice is welcome. Not sure I belong here - hope I don't belong. But have paid some dues. My history of PSA Oct 2000 0.8 Oct 2005 1.1 Oct 2006 1 Oct 2007 1.3 Oct 2008 1.6 Oct 2009 2.6 Nov 2010 not done (I think doc said not needed every year) Nov 2011 not done - dr checked wrong box apparently Nov 2012 not done May 2013 3.78 Jun 2013 3.79 Feb?2014 3.7 - (Not sure of exact figure) Oct 2014 3.5 Mar 2015 4.7 April 2015 Free PSA at 13.7 (not very good) Cleveland Clinic had me at about 40% chance of cancer (online calculator) Age now 57 years BIOPSY BEFORE - (in case it is helpful to anyone) I asked the Urologist for some percocet or similar due to the up to 70% of folks that reportedly have significant pain during biopsy. Dr thought it could lead to constipation (with my already enlarged prostate - making three possible impediments to being able to pee I guess) so instead wrote an Rx for anxiety pills - which I think helped. Pain is somewhat subjective and if one is fearing pain one will often experience more pain, or so the theory goes. I also took 1000mg acetaminophen as well which probably helped. I also found an NIH document that said about 1/3 of urologists use no pain meds at all for TRUS biopsies. http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4170156/ No wonder so many guys have awful experiences. See https://theprostatedecision.wordpres...opsy-revealed/ DURING - My doc uses lidocaine topical and injected (lidocaine I think). The gold standard as I understand (or misunderstand it) http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16280735 Getting a filling was worse and I have never had a bad dentist visit. Actually almost a pleasant experience. I would recommend my doc but he is moving in June. During the procedure he took 14 samples. I get results in one week. Only slight pain with first injection of pain med - that was it. Otherwise it felt like a toy gun was lightly tapping against my butt. At one point he said one of the later samples would be more painful but it wasn't. AFTER - blood of course - I asked about a pad or whatever but they didn't do that. Have to throw away a pair of shorts now - I guess next time I will bring a depends brief. Gets kind of achy when the Tylenol wears off - but not bad at all when it kicks in. After 6 hours no more Tylenol needed. NEXT APPOINTMENT- As I see it I have a lot of reading to do no matter what the results are that I get next week. 1) no cancer found - so how often should I come back for a psa or a biopsy or maybe the 4KScore test - if it makes it here soon from Cleveland. http://consultqd.clevelandclinic.org...ostate-cancer/ 2) Low grade/score cancer - lots to read about whether to watch and surveil or to get it out. Leaning toward getting it out while it is smaller. 3) High grade cancer - surgery or radiation or what? Being 57 I suppose surgery is the best option. There is a lot to staging that I need to learn once I get results, but I would like to be prepared to ask useful questions. Odds are 60% that no cancer is found, 23% that it is low grade and 17% that it is high grade according to the Cleveland clinic calculator http://www.clevelandclinic.org/lp/pr...ent/index.html Thanks for any insights. Sorry for being so needlessly verbose.",

      "Content": "Thanks for replies A few thoughts that came to me - odds are I have cancer at this point. 12 core biopsies are 50% false negative or maybe higher (I can find the link to this info if you want). So, 17% chance aggressive, 23% chance non aggressive cancer that is found, and maybe 30% chance non aggressive cancer that was not found. And 30% chance of being in the clear - but outside of ex vivo tests who knows? Those are the odds I have seen. So, chances are pretty good I have non aggressive PCA - and this will be my last chance to talk to this doctor - who is head of the department and seems to know his stuff but is moving. I want to go in asking the right questions. So I will try to ask the general questions to see what he says about diet, supplements, Newer better PSA tests, AS - if it is wise, Surgery - the pluses and minuses, radiation, other treatments for my specific case. He has already mentioned Active Surveillance - I think that might be where the conversation heads. I ordered the book by Walsh. Also have been going through the book by Stephen Strum - though it is about 10 years old it was also recommended. And read a couple Harvard links that seemed like good places to start. I could post those links but you all probably have read similar. Thanks",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by HighlanderCFH Howdy, and welcome to the forum, Are you still with the same uro who said PSA tests are not needed every year? I would not place a lot of confidence in a uro who says such a thing. NO THAT WAS PRIMARY CARE DOC Yes, your PSA and fPSA \"suggest\" that prostate cancer could be present, but that is not a sure thing. The upward tracking of your PSA does hint at the possibility, although the doubling time does not seem to be real rapid. THANKS Your fPSA, while \"suggestive\" of PC, is not an automatic diagnosis. The biopsy will hopefully give the answers. If they should find PC, chances are that it will be lower risk and in the early stages -- which means curable. YES WITH SIDE EFFECTS BUT CURE IS BETTER. DEAD MEN DON'T HAVE ERECTIONS I READ SOMEWHERE We'll wait for next Thursday to see what the biopsy tells you. In the meantime, please don't hesitate to ask any questions that might pop into your mind. We'll be glad to help in whatever way we can. THANKS.
