      "Content": "Hi all. My Dad is 71. Some prostate cancer in the family (his dad died from it). Any rate his psa jumped from 2.5 to a 6.7 in 17 months. He got a 12 sample? biopsy that came back negative. The doctor said it's about a 10-15% chance the biopsy misses cancer. His recommendation is another visit (probably psa) in 6 months. Personally I am questioning this (dad is a little too) because of the PSA jump he experienced, and the family history. Should we push for a higher-sample biopsie? 6 months seems a long time to wait considering the facts, possibility of aggressive cancer. Isn't the idea to catch these things early?",
