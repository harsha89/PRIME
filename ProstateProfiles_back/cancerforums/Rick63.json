      "Content": "Iniatially diagnosed November 2013 with PSA 70. Surgery was January 2014, post surgery PSA 1.1. Had 39 sessions of radiation ending in July 2014. Post radiation PSA was 0.3, then 0.3, then 0.4, done about 6 weeks apart. Surgeon wants to jump on HT right now, but I feel great and I'm only 51 and don't like the thought of HT at all! Seeing a medical oncologist next week, but right now I'm thinking the PSA isn't really trending yet so maybe just keep an eye on it until it reaches a target number of ?",

      "Content": "I guess I don't know enough about HT yet, my understanding was that it is not a cure, just a treatment to slow it down. I also thought the treatment was pretty much permanent and that I could kiss any future sex life goobye, which at the age of 51 is a very hard pill to swallow. I'll find out more next week, but I have stayed positive throughout this last year, until the most recent PSA results showed it ain't over yet. Ug.",

      "Content": "Just turned 50 and had not had a physical since leaving the military in 1990. PSA came back 70, yes 70. Went to a urologist and he definitely could feel a firmness on one side and scheduled the biopsy. No symptoms whatsoever, and honestly feel more like 30 than 50. Biopsy positive with gleason 7 (3+4) all on one side, weird. CT negative and bone scan negative. I'll be consulting with a surgeon who has a ridiculous number (6000+) of robotics under his belt, and also a radiation specialist. What a crappy birthday gift to receive, on the other hand praise the Lord I finally got the physical.",

      "Content": "Met with oncologist this morning to discuss radiation treatment. Going in I was already leaning toward surgery, and the urologist warned me that each doc would lean toward his/her own specialty. Not surprising that he was recommending hormone + radiation treatment. His compelling argument is that the PSA is so high, and the biopsy showed one side was all positive, so he feels the likelihood of the cancer already at the surface and possibly beyond is very high. So, he thinks radiation would very likely be needed after surgery. Haven't met with the surgeon yet, so it will be interesting to see if he feels he can get it all with the surgery. I'm pretty square on the fence now, not leaning on way or the other. Does it make sense to get the PSA retested since the extremely high reading seems to be weighing heavily on the prognosis?",
