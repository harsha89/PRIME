I felt ill that evening, and found it difficult to pee. Went to my doctor who prescribed antibiotics for a UTI, and had a blood test 2 weeks later. My PSA level was 2.6, and my doctor said that I had a \"Biggish Prostate\" and has sent me off to the Urologist (I have a appointment in 1 week). I still feel a sort of \"pressing\" feeling in my pubic area, and feel the need to pee often. The info from the Urologist regarding biopsies, MRI scans hsa really scared me - My legs were shaking as I was reading the letter! I have a few questions that I'd really appreciate answers to as they keep going round and round in my head. If this is prostate cancer, does the fact that it is symptomatic mean that it will be advanced ? Is there any chance that the PSA level is elevated owing to the recent UT infection ? Am I too young for this to be BPH ? Many thanks for reading Rob",
