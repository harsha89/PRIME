    "Content": "I had bladder cancer surgery in late Oct. Catheter removal early Nov. The pain was off the scales in the tip of my penis for weeks. No help from doctor. Said drink more water. I was drinking a whole lake. He said he cannot help me and would not even let me make and appointment. (Deadbeat). Up until about 4 days ago I was improving and was down to about a 2 on the pain scale and at times had no pain at all. Then, about about 4 days ago it started getting bad again and today I am at a 9! What did they do to me? What is possibly going on? I cannot find anything on the web addressing what is happening to me. I have seen others comment on the same pain, but cannot find any reasons for the cause. I want to avoid this in the future and just know what is happening. Maybe I could deal with it better knowing what is going on and maybe I could do something to correct the problem if I knew what it is. My general doctor has no idea and looks at me like I must be making this up. If I sound desparate you are reading me correctly. Do you have any ideas what is going on? I appreciate any ideas you may have. I live in fear of my next cystoscopy and possible surgery in January. I really can't take much more of this.",
