I just focused on my job and my family and getting ready. But now that I've begun my time off from work, I am feeling very anxious. My main goal, of course, is for the cancer to be gone, so I think if I am fortunate enough to end up with a good pathology report, I will be in a much better state of mind.

Will my role of being a strong and responsible parent and husband somehow be forever altered? Will the change in my sexual abilities be tolerable for me? Most importantly, what if I don't get a good surgical outcome or pathology report regarding the cancer? I am wondering if taking a mild anti-anxiety pill during the next 3 days would be okay?

      "Content": "My robotic surgery will be in 4 days. I had been doing pretty well up till now in terms of keeping busy, and not letting myself get too stressed about things. I just focused on my job and my family and getting ready. But now that I've begun my time off from work, I am feeling very anxious. My main goal, of course, is for the cancer to be gone, so I think if I am fortunate enough to end up with a good pathology report, I will be in a much better state of mind. But at this point in time, my mind is just going everywhere, with worry. How will I handle perhaps months of incontinence? Will my role of being a strong and responsible parent and husband somehow be forever altered? Will the change in my sexual abilities be tolerable for me? Most importantly, what if I don't get a good surgical outcome or pathology report regarding the cancer? I am wondering if taking a mild anti-anxiety pill during the next 3 days would be okay? More generally, how should I try to spend my last 3 days \"on this side\" of the surgery? How did you guys cope? Or do you have any suggestions?",

      "Content": "My robotic surgery will be in 4 days. I had been doing pretty well up till now in terms of keeping busy, and not letting myself get too stressed about things. I just focused on my job and my family and getting ready. But now that I've begun my time off from work, I am feeling very anxious. My main goal, of course, is for the cancer to be gone, so I think if I am fortunate enough to end up with a good pathology report, I will be in a much better state of mind. But at this point in time, my mind is just going everywhere, with worry. How will I handle perhaps months of incontinence? Will my role of being a strong and responsible parent and husband somehow be forever altered? Will the change in my sexual abilities be tolerable for me? Most importantly, what if I don't get a good surgical outcome or pathology report regarding the cancer? I am wondering if taking a mild anti-anxiety pill during the next 3 days would be okay? More generally, how should I try to spend my last 3 days \"on this side\" of the surgery? How did you guys cope? Or do you have any suggestions?",

      "Content": "Three weeks ago, shortly after my surgery, I looked up the MSKCC nomogram for post-surgery. Putting in all my information, it said 5-year chance of no recurrence 88% and 10-year chance of no recurrence 79%. I am sure of this, because I did it a few times, trying different inputs just to see what would happen. Tonight I checked it again, and now it says 5-year: 73% and 10-year: 51%. Wow - I had thought I had much better odds. It was organ-confined, no positive margins. I realize this is a dynamic nomogram, but how could the odds have dropped so significantly? I noticed tonight that if I change from my Gleason of 4+3 to 3+4, the probabilities are almost the same as those I found 3 weeks ago. Another change in this nomogram is that 3 weeks ago, it showed virtually no difference in the outcome between \"negative margin\" and \"positive margin\" - which I found suspicious. This time, there is a difference in the outcomes. Do you know if this nomogram is correct? My surgeon seemed to say that my chances were very good that the cancer will not recur because of the pathology report; I was feeling pretty good, but now i am really down about it. One last thing: on page 377 of Walsh's book, it has a 71% chance of no recurrence in 10 years, and this is based on some older results. I assumed with a great, modern surgeon, that my chances would now be better than 71%, not so much worse as indicated by the nomogram. Does anyone know what is going on? My outlook has suddenly taken a bad turn.",

      "Content": "There's another nomogram from Montreal: www.nomogram.org (as opposed to nomograms.org). It gave a much better outcome: 5yr = 85.8%; 10yr = 70.4%. However, it did not distinguish between 3+4 and 4+3. Even so, if you input Gleason 8 or higher, it yields 5yr = 83% and 10=65%. So, erring on the side of caution, since my Gleason is 4+3, if take the average of their Gleason 7 and their Gleason \"8 or higher\" - I get 76.5% and 67% for 5-yr and 10-yr, which is still much better than the MSKCC. But I don't know if Montreal's is a good nomogram or not. I am going to talk to my doctor. I had gotten okay with 79% for 10 years; but 51% for 10 years is really different - I am going to have to make another big mental adjustment or get some reason to doubt this number.",

      "Content": "Three weeks ago, shortly after my surgery, I looked up the MSKCC nomogram for post-surgery. Putting in all my information, it said 5-year chance of no recurrence 88% and 10-year chance of no recurrence 79%. I am sure of this, because I did it a few times, trying different inputs just to see what would happen. Tonight I checked it again, and now it says 5-year: 73% and 10-year: 51%. Wow - I had thought I had much better odds. It was organ-confined, no positive margins. I realize this is a dynamic nomogram, but how could the odds have dropped so significantly? I noticed tonight that if I change from my Gleason of 4+3 to 3+4, the probabilities are almost the same as those I found 3 weeks ago. Another change in this nomogram is that 3 weeks ago, it showed virtually no difference in the outcome between \"negative margin\" and \"positive margin\" - which I found suspicious. This time, there is a difference in the outcomes. Do you know if this nomogram is correct? My surgeon seemed to say that my chances were very good that the cancer will not recur because of the pathology report; I was feeling pretty good, but now i am really down about it. One last thing: on page 377 of Walsh's book, it has a 71% chance of no recurrence in 10 years, and this is based on some older results. I assumed with a great, modern surgeon, that my chances would now be better than 71%, not so much worse as indicated by the nomogram. Does anyone know what is going on? My outlook has suddenly taken a bad turn.",

      "Content": "I have met with 2 top surgeons, one who does open surgery and one who does robotic. And I am now at the point where I have decided I will choose one of these two, but still am not decided. They were very helpful and accommodating. But (my fault) there are 3 questions that I still seek some clarification on that would help me with my final decision. 1) there's a possible side effect called \"bladder neck contracture\" - and my impression is that it is very rare with robotic, but maybe as high as 5% with open; is this true? 2) it sounds like the chances of complications involving the intestines are extremely rare with open, but more likely with robotic? Does anyone know what the possible problems might be with robotic, and how common they are? 3) do you know what a \"great answer\" would be to the question: how many robotic prostate surgeries have you performed in the last year? I feel anxious to schedule the surgery (as it will be 4-5 weeks out), and will attempt to talk to them on the phone to ask a couple more questions, but that may take a few days to hear back from them.

      "Content": "Originally Posted by HighlanderCFH Hi Logic, Did the biopsy report mention the staging? If it is a T2 or less (perhaps even a T3), you might have your choice between either radiation or surgery. They could all be equally curative. However, with your BPH, surgery would probably be the best route to take because it would eliminate any current (or future) urination problems you may be having. So I tend to agree with your leaning toward surgery. Chuck To answer you about the stage of the cancer, the biopsy doesn't say, but based on Dr. Walsh's book, since it was not palpable in a rectal exam, and the positive cores were confined to the left side, and since the CT scan was normal, I am thinking (and hoping) it is stage T1C. I am planning to talk to a very experienced robotic surgeon and a very experienced open surgeon, and a very experienced radiation person in the next 2 weeks. No known circulation issues; my EKG was normal; I had a little calcification in heart arteries (tested due to high cholesterol, but has become normal with statins). I have some history of fatigue issues (may have had some bout of chronic fatigue syndrome about 10 years ago, but it seemed to disappear after a year). Some tendency toward bowel issues/hemorrhoids - the fatigue and rectal things are one reason I am leaning more toward surgery - my local radiation oncologist said between 6 and 10% of people have some long-term rectal issues after radiation, and so I'm thinking that my chances might be higher.",

      "Content": "I am still trying to learn about the different treatment options. I have arranged to consult with a very experienced surgeon in 2 weeks at a top cancer hospital, and hope to consult with a 2nd one from that hospital. One does robotic, and the other is more known for open surgery. I was wondering if any of you have any information about open vs. laparoscopic (without robot) vs. robotic. Specifically: what would make me a better candidate for one over another? Do you know of much difference in incontinence with the various types of surgery? What about any differences in nerve-preserving? What about long-term cure results? Any advice on how to decide? I am not overweight, but am rather short in height; only previous surgery was an appendectomy over 40 years ago. Any advice or even anecdotal evidence would be appreciated.",

I have 3+4 confined to one side of prostate (knock wood, as I wait for report from JH). After talking to area doctors, and reading a lot, and talking to former patients, I decided to take a trip to a top hospital to talk to top surgeons, and I'll be meeting with an \"open\" guy and a \"robotic\" guy in 1 week. Just knowing I am consulting with the best in the field has already decreased my anxiety quite a bit. I will report back once I've made a decision. I already met with a radiation oncologist, and while I haven't totally ruled it out, at this point I'm 90% sure I'll go with surgery for the reasons outlined in this thread.",

      "Content": "Hi: My first appointment with a specialist after positive diagnosis is with a local radiology oncologist. Do you have any suggestions, or can you direct me to a list somewhere, of recommended questions to ask? I was just diagnosed (two cores positive, 3+4,PSA 11.9; negative biopsy 2 years ago; digital negative), and will need to decide between surgery and radiation. Almost 64 years old - in good health otherwise. Some history of BPH, but no treatment ever needed; size of prostate 59cc. My main concerns, in this order, are: 1) long-term cure 2) incontinence issues 3) ED issues I live in a fairly small city - only one radiation group - very good equipment, but some doubts about their personalities and experience. I don't think it is feasible to get radiation for so many days and weeks if it is too far from my home. There are more experienced hospitals 75 minutes from home. I have a team consult with John Hopkins in the next 2-3 weeks to get advised about treatment recommendations. Thanks, Logic1",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by Jim215 Ok. You haven't ruled out the radiation but when I calculate 75 minutes each way plus the minimal time to get zapped, then you're looking at a 3-hour a day crunch for 8 weeks (often 40 sessions). If you are employed, that could be problematic. Not sure how you felt it would take 5 weeks to recover from surgery. Usually, if it's robotic, you spend one night in the hospital then about a week at home with a catheter (some people actually go to work or go out in public with the catheter using a leg bag but I couldn't bring myself to do that). Normally, some leakage will follow but is mostly manageable. Some people have a longer road to full dryness. So, unless I've missed something, you're looking at 8 weeks (radiation) versus 8 days (surgery) for basically the same outcome with respect to a potential cure. Plus, as Chuck pointed out, surgery -- not radiation -- is the resolution for BPH if it rears its ugly head. And as Allen mentioned, if the cancer returns after surgery, you can have salvage radiation, as I did, as a fallback Plan \"B\". If the cancer returns after primary radiation, surgery is rarely an option due to the damage done to the prostate. Please let us know what you decide and why, which may be helpful to others who follow in your (our) footsteps. Best of luck to you. Jim - thanks. I didn't realize surgery recovery (back to work fulltime, I mean) is often only a couple of weeks. I thought that many people have significant incontinence for a month or more, and healing to do, that would maybe add up to 4 weeks or more. Would 4 weeks be unusually long to recovery from surgery?",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by Jim215 \"I don't think it is feasible to get radiation for so many days and weeks if it is too far from my home. There are more experienced hospitals 75 minutes from home.\" By your very words, you seem to rule out radiation as a primary treatment. With that said, I would be inclined to research your surgery options. I haven't ruled out the radiation as a possible treatment. Traveling each day back and forth 75 minutes would be an inconvenience, but I wouldn't rule it out if it is a better option for me health-wise. If I get radiation 75 minutes from home, then, depending on how many weeks the radiation lasts, it may not be any more inconvenient for me (thinking of how many weeks I will be out of work) than if it takes me 5 weeks or more to recover from the surgery. My own urologist seemed to prefer radiation but also added that he had some concern that with a larger than average size prostate, the radiation may make it swell more and possibly cause some constriction. One hope I'd have, regardless of the treatment, is to minimize future annoyances like catheters, cystascoping, needing to shrink the prostate, constriction problems, etc. I'm still pretty confused about which treatment - but I am hopeful that my visit to John's Hopkins \"Multidisciplinary Consultation\" will help a great deal.",

      "Content": "After my prostate surgery, we will stay in a hotel near JH. Do you have any experience with any particular hotels within 2 miles of the hospital? We may stay until catheter is removed, so probably a week in hotel after leaving hospital. Also, some amenities that we thought of: fridge, microwave, free shuttle or voucher (is there any difference between these two), see if they can bring a recliner in the room, free breakfast, nearby grocery store. Anything else we should look for? Prices for most of the hotels we are considering are similar ($150 or so per night), so that is not a big issue. Some hotels I found: Hampton, Inn at Henderson's Warf, Spring Hill suites, Renaissance Inner Harbor, Admiral Fell, Hilton Garden Inn. Embassy.",

The bone scan is scheduled for tomorrow, but I was reading that it is normally not recommended unless you are in the high-risk category. I am in the intermediate risk category, and I was wondering if I should go through with it, since it does sometimes yield false positives which would require yet further testing. Thanks",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by HighlanderCFH My urologist at home, who diagnosed my PC, told me I had low risk Gleason 6, which fortunately was confirmed by the post-op pathology. He also sent me in for the abdominal CT scan and nuclear bone scan. He told me in ADVANCE that both scans would be negative. But many doctors like to do this automatically, as the others have noted, just to establish baseline readings. They inject the radioactive dye in a vein and then you have to wait 2 hours for the dye to completely circulate through your body. The test, itself, takes about 20 minutes and is completely painless. No reason to NOT take it because it is likely to give additional peace of mind that there are no bone mets, etc. I decided I better have it. It will take place on Wednesday due to a clerical error. Thanks for your thoughts. This website has been very helpful to me.",

      "Content": "I had my surgery 16 days ago, and the catheter removed 7 days ago. I am just wondering, for each of the issues I am now having (which are listed below): (a) is this a normal problem, to be expected at this point in my recovery?, and (b) if it is normal, when might it go away? Here are the issues: 1. each night, I wake up about 3 or 4 times during the night with a strong urge to urinate and have to get out of bed and run to the bathroom in order to urinate; during the day, I have to urinate about every hour or hour and a half, and have to do so very soon after drinking a glass of water (note: I am not drinking anything later than 7pm) 2. whenever I urinate, it burns a little, and it is even a little painful sometimes, especially near the end of the penis 3. when I urinate, if I try to stop and re-start the stream (this Kegel exercise was advised to me by my doctor), more often than not I am unsuccessful in \"shutting off the valve\" (it just keeps on flowing) 4. there is general discomfort, and sometimes an ache, at various places in the groin area, including my backside 5. my intestines are not working normally - bowel movements are less well-formed than normal; not sure if I should increase fiber or take a bulking agent (this is contrary to taking a laxative or a stool softener, but with loose stools already, I have stopped taking stool softener) 6. very little stamina; hoping I can return to work in the coming weeks 7. not sleeping soundly enough - even though I am feeling physically tired, I am not sleeping as many hours as I'd like to. Thanks.",

Here's an update on all of the complaints I listed 2 weeks ago: I am now waking up only 1 or twice per night. Urgency during the day is getting better each week. The burning during urination is barely noticeable. Urgency during the day has decreased by around 50%. One stool softener per day has gotten things better in that area. General aching is down a great deal. Sleeping has improved. Energy slowly increasing. In addition, incontinence is gradually getting better: went from wearing the depends briefs to tena moderate guards; leaking down from 0.5oz or more per day to 0.2oz or 0.3oz per day. Can get by with just two guards per day. Ordered the lightest version - almost no leaking while I sleep. Patience is the key!! Just do all the recommended exercises and avoidances and be patient.",

      "Content": "I am wondering: what is the longest one should wait between the time of the biopsy and having surgery? I had my biopsy on Dec. 5; received the cancer diagnosis on Dec. 17. After doing all my research and consulting, I made my decision yesterday, Jan. 20, on having robotic surgery and on who would do the surgery. My understanding was that the surgeon had approximately a 4 week wait for surgery - so I expected to have the surgery sometime around Feb. 15 or Feb. 20. But it turns out that his earliest available date is March 9. Bottom line: the time between my biopsy and the surgery will be a little over 13 weeks (Dec. 5 till Mar. 9). It seems 8 weeks is about normal for those in this forum. Should I consider finding another surgeon at this point - the surgeon I choose is a top surgeon and I am happy with my choice, but don't want to risk the cancer getting worse because of waiting too long to have it treated. My Gleason is 3+4. Also, do you happen to know the likelihood of one of his patients cancelling their appointment before then (if there's a cancellation, they'll let me know)? My only alternative is to choose my 2nd choice for a surgeon, which would likely save me about 2 weeks. Did any of you have an intermediate risk case like mine, and take 3 months for the surgery after biopsy? Thanks",

I want to get the best advice I can regarding surgery or external radiation, and I have narrowed down my choices of a \"top\" center for a 1-day consultation between John Hopkins and M.D. Anderson. Does anyone have any advice about either of these 2 places for this multi-modal consultation? I have a lot of other questions about people's personal experiences with each type of treatment - the surgery really scares me, but I am only 63 old, and I want to live a long time! Thanks.",

      "Content": "I had my surgery last week, and had what the doc called a very good path report. But now that I have a copy of the actual report, I have a question. First of all, here are the good things that the report says: \"organ-confined throughout (PT2 grade)\" \"summary margins: negative\" \"no seminal vescicle invasion\" \"all 7 pelvic lymph nodes negative for invasion\" \"no regional lymph node invasion\" All of that, as told to me by the doc, is the best possible outcome. But the one thing that I'm unclear about is that it says \"lymphatic (small vessel) invasion: present\" I think these small vessels are in the prostate, and if so, they should now be removed, but I wish I had some re-assurance that there is no way the cancer could have already metasthesized. Do any of you have any experience of having this as part of your pathology report? Thanks",

An enlarged prostate is not so unusual - it is much different than feeling a \"nodule.\" I do suggest you have the .psa for peace of mind, but unless there is a suspicious lump, it seems very doubtful there is anything serious.",

      "Content": "Hi all: I am almost 9 months post surgery. I have been taking viagra once or twice per week. I am curious as to the differences between Viagra and Cialis. There are a few reasons I am considering switching to Cialis: 1) I always seem to get a headache after taking Viagra. Is this likely to also be true with Cialis? 2) my insurance company said they won't be covering viagra in 2016, but they will cover Cialis 3) my return to normalcy (in terms of erections) has been very slow; am wondering if I might see more improvement with Cialis. Any comparisons between the 2 different medications would be appreciated.",
