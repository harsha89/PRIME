      "Content": "My partner is currently weighing up his options on which treatment to go with. i feel rp is the way to go but he is really worried about how long the healing process takes and how long incontinence lasts for. I wanted to get some first had advice from others. I think it would be good to for him to hear about other peoples experiences. If you could let us know how long it took you get back to work and how long till you gain control of your bladder again we would really appreciate your input.",

      "Content": "My partner was diagnosed today with prostate cancer. We are devastated. He is currently in anothet state so im not with him to ask the doctor all the questions that i have. The doctor told him that he is a 6 on a scale of 1 to 10. What does that mean? Doc has sent him off for ct scan and bone scan on wednesday. A million things running through my head. The obvious one is what can be done to treat it. I suppose im searching for something to give me peace of mind and hope.",

As he is in another state and due to the fact that he didnt even want yo tell me cause he is concerned on how i will deal with the news its hard for me to get the info your asking but rest assured i will persist.

My partner is a very strong minded individual and csn be quite a difficult person to talk to at times but after 23years together if anyone can get him to open up its me. Thankyou again for the info. I am breathing just a little easier now.",

      "Content": "You have the nail on the head. Cancer = death in my head. Its not touched my life personally before untill recently where i saw a dear friend pass. I thank your all for yoir insight it has given me a great sense of relief. i can tell you he is 54. And he had blood tests that detected something which prompted the doctor to do further investigations. Maybe thats the psa your talking about. You have to excuse my ignorance while im not up on the terminology of things just yet im sure i will learn. He then had a digital rectal exam where a lump was felt. He was unable to go for a mri as he has metal fragments in his body. Hence then came the biopsy. Then this result. I will update the profile when the info comes to hand. There will be a slim chance of getting my partner on here as he doesnt use computers and forums like this are completely foriegn to him but i will encoursge him. And if he doesnt i will be there for him to ask for advice and information. I cant thankyou all enough for responding to me. It really has helped immensely.",
