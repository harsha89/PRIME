      "Content": "Originally Posted by HighlanderCFH Welcome aboard, JW. The first thing I would suggest is obtaining a copy of the 3rd edition of the Guide to Surviving Prostate Cancer by Dr Pat Walsh. This will be a huge resource book for you, as it is for many of us. Thanks to you and all who responded. I did find Dr Walsh's book a few weeks back and I've been skipping around various chapters. Another question - I noticed that some of the history block mention CT Scans. I assume this is to check to see if the cancer has spread to the bones. When is this prescribed? My Urologist said that in my situation it was not necessary. Would you agree? The diagnosis has yet to completely sink in. It's such a strange feeling to know I have cancer and yet feel completely fine. I've been on a bit of a roller coaster, emotionally. Finding this Forum has been very helpful. Thanks Again.",

      "Content": "Hi, I'm 59 years old, fit and in otherwise good health. A spike in my PSA numbers resulted in my GP referring me to a Urologist. Then a 4K, MRI, Biopsy and a diganosis of cancer T2C. Trying to decide what to do next. Taking a crash course in all the lingo. Initially I was considering Radiation Therapy but now moving toward having a radical prostatectomy.
