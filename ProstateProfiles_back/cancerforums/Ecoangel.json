    "Content": "Hi I;m Debbie and i came across this forum today while resarching into my husbands prostate cancer diagnosis and subsequent treatment . He was diagnosed 18 mths ago at age of 47, he had a radical prostatectomy in April 2011 and was doing really well with the 3 mthly check ups of his PSA level. On the second but last one which should have heralded him changing to 6mthly check ups the level had risen slightly so he was kept on 3 mthly. the last one showed another slight increase and he may need to have radiotherapy if the level keeps rising, anticpated that in 6 mths at the current rate of increase the level will be at a figure they use as the magic one that radiotherapy is needed. We have 6 months to avoid this as the possible side effects are ones he wants to avoid, having full control after the op of his bladder and bowel and nerves starting to grow up back slowly so we are trying all sorts of alternative things, keeping his body as alkaline as possible, using bicarb and basically eating a raw/vegetarian diet. We were heading down the healthy diet route anyway slowly but its just speeded us up. I look forward to having a look around the forum and sharing experiences and hopefully offering and receiving some support and having a few questions answered too. Its a scary time at diagnosis and a life changing one too for everyone concerned but especially the person who has been diagnosed. Debbie",
