      "Content": "Originally Posted by 4wheeler My doctor was of the opinion that casodex was effective as a pre-treatment to taking the Lupron and then was discontinued. I will definitely ask him about this again. He did talk to me about referring me to radiology again for direct radiation to the bone mets and will be discussing this with him at the end of January... Greetings and sorry to hear that your PC has returned. They also gave me Casodex pre-Lupron shot (to deal with the hormone \"spike\" from the Lupron shot) however 2x 4mo Lupron shots later I now take Casodex every day. When the bone mets finally happen they are planning on spot radiation. The DR's and I have not discussed specific drugs/medications they are lining up to turn to once the Lupron+Casodex starts failing however I'll be reading with interest in your case as your a bit further down the PC trail that I currently am. My DR's were very concerned about spine mets as spinal compression and/or immune (white blood cells/bone marrow) system compromise is very serious because of possible loss of mobility and possible lost ability to fight other illnesses. Best of luck!",

      "Content": "www.cancer.gov www.cancer.org Both have some survival statistics. Some of them are sort of useful, many of them not so much. If you've ever watched one of the \"CSI\" TV shows you'll get that while something may have seriously compromised a patients ability to live or stay alive, whatever that happens along to \"push them over the edge\" will end up being the official \"cause of death\" (COD). Hence \"most men die of something else\" is usually true. The national cancer sites divide cancers into three groups: Local, Regional and Distant. Off the top of my head for Stage4 it goes something like this: S4 - N0M0 - Best prognosis S4 - N1M0 - Not as good as above S4 - NxM1 - Metastatic to nearby hip/leg bones - not as good as above S4 - NxM1 - Metastatic to spine or primary organs - not as good as above In a nut shell, the more widely spread (volume) and distant the cancer is from the prostate the prognosis gets worse. So in answer to your question, out of the four \"S4\" groups I listed above, the 1st two \"S4\" groups have a very good chance (nearly 100%) at surviving 5yrs. Since every case is different (and none of us here are Dr's) it is best to consult with your Doctor.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by 4wheeler My doctor was of the opinion that casodex was effective as a pre-treatment to taking the Lupron and then was discontinued. I will definitely ask him about this again. He did talk to me about referring me to radiology again for direct radiation to the bone mets and will be discussing this with him at the end of January... Greetings and sorry to hear that your PC has returned. They also gave me Casodex pre-Lupron shot (to deal with the hormone \"spike\" from the Lupron shot) however 2x 4mo Lupron shots later I now take Casodex every day. When the bone mets finally happen they are planning on spot radiation. The DR's and I have not discussed specific drugs/medications they are lining up to turn to once the Lupron+Casodex starts failing however I'll be reading with interest in your case as your a bit further down the PC trail that I currently am. My DR's were very concerned about spine mets as spinal compression and/or immune (white blood cells/bone marrow) system compromise is very serious because of possible loss of mobility and possible lost ability to fight other illnesses.

      "Content": "Dave, I don't think any one that is on long term ADT would say that it is likeable or enjoyable. A few years later I'm still getting hot/cold flashes and the constant fatigue limits what I might be able to do on any given day. Still, the \"front line\" ADT seems to be working and while I may dream of a \"ADT vacation\", taking a break may not be in the cards. (for me at least) I'm sorry to hear that you have one of the rare PC's that does not produce excess PSA. As you know or can imagine that this form of PC is fairly difficult and expensive to keep track of - instead of cheap and inexpensive PSA tests expensive imaging tests are required to detect and track it. I'm told that ADT won't cure PC. In ether case (mine or yours) all we can hope for is the ADT will slow down the PC. So while our respective scans and numbers are low, PC is still there and slowly developing into hormone independent PC. If bone loss is an issue there are medications (besides taking calcium+D3) that can help slow that down as well. Your team ought to have had a bone density scan done at the start of your ADT so they can track the bone loss over time. You mentioned that you've already experienced some bone loss, I'm sorry to say that I'm not educated/informed as to how much loss might trigger adding medications to combat bone loss might be. Being told that you'll be getting life/energy sucking shots for the rest of your life is a bit to chew on, let alone swallow. You are not alone. g.",

      "Content": "www.cancer.gov www.cancer.org Both have some survival statistics. Some of them are sort of useful, many of them not so much. If you've ever watched one of the \"CSI\" TV shows you'll get that while something may have seriously compromised a patients ability to live or stay alive, whatever that happens along to \"push them over the edge\" will end up being the official \"cause of death\" (COD). Hence \"most men die of something else\" is usually true. The national cancer sites divide cancers into three groups: Local, Regional and Distant. Off the top of my head for Stage4 it goes something like this: S4 - N0M0 - Best prognosis S4 - N1M0 - Not as good as above S4 - NxM1 - Metastatic to nearby hip/leg bones - not as good as above S4 - NxM1 - Metastatic to spine or primary organs - not as good as above In a nut shell, the more widely spread (volume) and distant the cancer is from the prostate the prognosis gets worse. So in answer to your question, out of the four \"S4\" groups I listed above, the 1st two \"S4\" groups have a very good chance (nearly 100%) at surviving 5yrs. Since every case is different (and none of us here are Dr's) it is best to consult with your Doctor.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by Rick63 I guess I don't know enough about HT yet, my understanding was that it is not a cure, just a treatment to slow it down. I also thought the treatment was pretty much permanent and that I could kiss any future sex life goobye, which at the age of 51 is a very hard pill to swallow. I'll find out more next week, but I have stayed positive throughout this last year, until the most recent PSA results showed it ain't over yet. Ug. Your understanding is correct. ADT/HT is not a \"cure\" and while in some patients/cases (low Gleason scores) respond well to it for many years (and even over 10yrs) others might get less than 6-18 months response. The international mean is 3.5 years. (my Doctors and I are currently hoping for +3yr) ADT or HT can be used as a follow up/add on (secondary treatment) to ether surgery or radiation and/or used by itself as a primary treatment with (or without) other hormone manipulation drugs or chemo. When ADT is used very shortly AFTER a primary treatment, its use is generally of limited duration (<18mos to 3yrs). Many studies show that using ADT after surgery or RT can often times enhance any duration of progression free survival. However when ADT is used as a primary treatment, patents can/could expect to be on the treatment or some form of the treatment (different HT drugs used) for the duration of their lives. Since the duration of effectiveness is highly variable there have been a number of (sadly conflicting) studies which attempt to predict the actual duration. At the end of the day ADT/HT will work as long as it happens to work and thankfully there are a number of other treatments available once it stops working. (and more being researched) Honestly, my \"junk\" has been fairly to completely worthless since starting ADT. While currently I'm only 55yo and at first this was rather 'alarming', my partner has her own 'issues' and coupled with my complete lack of desire/want/need to have sex we have not bothered to investigate any ED drugs as we both are able to \"live with it\". While not 'good news' I hope this helps.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by ChiliDog We were told two different things. One that you can't tell for sure if lymph nodes are impacted except by surgical removal and pathology. And that the 3T MRI shows if a lymph node is enlarged, and therefore suspect. What I've gathered is that they can't tell for sure if the Lymph nodes are NOT effected by the enhanced MRI as the tumors have to be large enough to show up but nodes that are abnormal size and \"light up\" under the MRI with other factors taken into consideration (PSA, Gleason, #Cores effected+%Cores effected) all add up to where experience and statistics show that the abnormal lymph node(s) are cancerous with out doing a biopsy of them. It is my belief that this is why many patients have 'positive' lymph nodes removed during surgery as the camera and human eye can see better than the MRI can.",

      "Content": "Welcome, sorry you had to be here. If your looking for prostate cancer information, some folks like purchasing books, others like to surf the free information sites. While they are not as detailed and informative as some of the books, they generally are not biased towards any possible treatment option. The US government has a decent site as well as the American Cancer Society: http://www.cancer.gov/cancertopics/types/prostate http://www.cancer.org/cancer/prostatecancer/index Even most healthcare sites have prostate cancer specific information. Here's Kaisers: https://healthy.kaiserpermanente.org...0t7XrXsbcbaw!/ Even Wikipedia has prostate cancer information: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prostate_cancer As far as books go I tend to favor \"Winning the battle against prostate cancer\". Its smaller than Walsh's book but is direct, to the point and evenly covers all stages of prostate cancer. I highly recommend it. If your looking for more information on Gleason scores and grading, I think most of the website links provided above have information on it as well as this direct Wikipedia link here: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gleason_grading_system I'm assuming that your DR's ordered a number of imaging tests (MRI, Bone, CAT) to ensure that the PC has not escaped the prostate. The results of those tests will help determine which treatment options are available to you. Many of the men here seemingly favor surgery. While I'll let them speak for themselves two of the seemingly popular reasons are that they just wanted the cancer out of their body and if the surgery does not \"get it all\" (cancer) surgery can generally be followed by radiation however it is very rare that surgery can follow radiation.",

      "Content": "Greetings and sorry to hear about the diagnosis. It can be tough to digest. The good news is that attacking the PC with ADT+Chemo is the current \"state of the art\" treatment. The not so good news is something you've already come to understand, how well (or not!) he responds to treatment and for how long can't be answered up front. I'm going to go out on a limb and suggest that the Walsh book might have some useful information in a different format than WikiPedia. Both the nationally sponsered websites like cancer dot gov and cancer dot org will yield some useful information as well. Specific google searches on \"stage 4 prostate cancer\" will come up with lots of information as well. If your dad's cancer responds well to treatment you might be looking at \"years\" of survival. Conversely if the cancer does not respond \"well\" to treatment then we might not be talking \"years\" but rather less. Of the two people that I personally knew with Stage4 PC both passed because of causes other than PC. Personally I was diagnosed with Stage4 in 2014 and I'm still going strong. I hate to repeat what others have said but while a \"cure\" might not be in the making, there still is good reason for hope.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by Frenchy Body pH and oxygen levels can also be factors. The theory being that if we have a lower pH, less than 7.4, it is a more friendly environment for diseases like cancers. With a normal pH comes higher oxygen levels which also helps. One can easily find on the internet the list of foods with higher alkaline content, basically cruciferous and green veggies. All not all bottled waters are created equal, some much more acidic (certainly not neutral) than one would think. I now drink nothing but higher alkaline bottled water. Please read/educate yourself on how your body naturally regulates these levels and how the bodies digestive system works. Nothing ingested via your mouth will have any actual effect on your bloods PH levels. (that is actually a VERY GOOD THING) It is my understanding that changing the bloods PH via direct injection (up or down) can have very serious if not fatal outcomes.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by WifeinWorry Does your body have withdrawals when you stop this stuff? Doctor stopped Casodex because it wasn't working and also was trying to find out if it was causing the bad dizziness. Ruling out other causes. But what happens when you are not on a another for the month? Cancer would grow faster without it? He's only stopping it for about a month, then he will put him on something else. But isn't Casodex and Lupron for the same thing, why would he have both? Its like double dosing isn't it? Lupron and others in that \"family\" trick a signaling gland which tells the testicles to produce testostrone or not. Casodex and others in that family of drugs trick the adrenial gland not to produce testosterone. So the two drugs work on different sources of testosterone. Oddly stopping one or both for a short time often will cause the PSA to go down for a short time.",

(and I've had my nose shattered) All through it, I just kept reminding my Uro to do what he needed to get done and afterwards I had to remain in his office for ~1hr as when I sat up for the 1st time I fell right over with HR/BP/Temp going crazy. While the procedure was sold as a \"return to work\", I went directly home and was out for the next day (very uncomfortable sitting). If they EVER have to execute this test on me again they'll have to knock me out before hand. Worse experience EVER.",

      "Content": "(disclaimer: I'm in no way educated, trained or licensed to practice medicene, (or even spell it) the following is the results of much reading on the subject and reflects my own personal knowledge and opinions. Your mileage may vary.) Nodal positive What does it mean? How might it effect my recovery? How might it effect my treatment options? With the current TNM (tumor, node, metastatic) cancer staging system incorporated into the more generic \u201cStage1\u201d to \u201cStage4\u201d there can be a fairly large change in treatment options and possible outcomes (prognosis) between \u201cStage3\u201d and \u201cStage4\u201d. \u201cStage1\u201d to \u201cStage3\u201d (TxN0M0) generally define \u201corgan confined\u201d cancer. Ether (or all) of T4, positive lymph node(s) (N1) or distant metastasis (M1) define cancer which has escaped the prostate capsule and in some cases (N1 and M1) the prostate itself. Two of the most popular \u201cStage1\u201d to \u201cStage3\u201d treatment options is radiation and surgery. While they both have similar outcomes and are generally offered as a \u201cether or\u201d option, it should be mentioned that radiation can be used if surgery fails however very rarely (if ever) can surgery be used after radiation. A \u201cStage4\u201d diagnosis can be further defined as: local(T4), regional(N1) or distant(M1), the chances of treatments with curative intent (IE: surgery or radiation) working diminish with \u201cStage4\u201d (over \u201cStage3\u201d) and diminish even further with regional(N1) and distant(M1) disease. The most obvious (logical) reason for this is \u201ccurative\u201d treatments generally focus on the prostate itself and are of questionable or arguable benefit if the cancer has already spread beyond the prostate. While current state of the art imaging can detect tumors as small as 1mm in size, not all facilities are outfitted with it (mine used equipment that could only detect >5mm tumors) and frankly tumors can be much smaller than 1mm and undetectable by electronic imaging. The human eye (directly viewing a tissue sample) can often times be better at detecting abnormalities then electronic imaging. Depending on the region of the world, doctor, health care system or insurance (N1) or \u201cnodal positive\u201d can be dealt with differently. 1. In some cases if positive nodes are detected prior to surgery, the surgery is still done with the addition of removal of effected lymph nodes. (and possibly unaffected nodes) 2. In some cases if positive nodes NOT detected prior to surgery, BUT are detected during surgery the surgery is still done with the addition of removal of possibly effected lymph nodes. (and possibly unaffected nodes) 3. In some cases if positive nodes are NOT detected prior to surgery, BUT are detected during surgery the surgery is aborted and the patient is referred to a radiation oncologist. 4. In some cases if positive nodes are NOT detected prior to surgery, BUT are detected during surgery the surgery is aborted and the patient is referred to a medical oncologist for ADT (hormone therapy) 5. In some cases if positive nodes ARE detected prior to surgery, the surgery is canceled and the patient is referred to a radiation oncologist. 6. In some cases if positive nodes ARE detected prior to surgery or radiation, the curative treatments is canceled and the patient is referred to a medical oncologist for ADT (hormone therapy). As can be seen from the above, having \u201cpositive nodes\u201d in many cases can effect what treatment options are made available to the patent depending on region, doctor, health care system and insurance coverage. (or \u201cstandard practice\u201d or \u201cstandard level of care\u201d in the area the patient resides.) Even within \u201cexperimental\u201d or \u201ctrial\u201d based therapies, the health care system in the USA (and many other parts of the world) relies on \u201cevidence based\u201d treatment. Any given treatment option needs to have historical and/or statistical evidence that it will be beneficial to the patient or be more beneficial than harmful to be used. To quote Wikipedia: \u201cQuantitative research is the systematic empirical investigation of observable phenomena via statistical, mathematical or computational techniques\u201d \u201cQualitative research, is a research paradigm focusing on non-quantifiable measurements\u201d Doctors and researchers have developed \u201ctables\u201d and \u201cnanograms\u201d so that the collective knowledge of treating 10's of 1000's of patients can be used to help predict the possible outcomes and prognosis of patients so that more intrusive tests and treatments that might not be beneficial can be avoided entirely. In some cases \u201ccurative\u201d treatments for node positive diagnoses is considered a waste of time, energy, resources and needless suffering and side effects to the patient while in other cases a node positive diagnosis has little if any effect on the treatment options. While a handful of different statistical tools have been developed over the years it should be said that all popular statistical tools currently in use don't necessary agree with each other. As can be seen, how much \u201cweight\u201d or impact statistical prediction can have on treatment options can vary widely depending on region, doctor, health care system and/or insurance. It may be arguable if any (or all) of the six treatment options presented above are right or wrong entirely or for any given patient however they represent what may be available to the patient depending on region, doctor, health care system or insurance. It may be noted that some of the above treatment options make little to no logical sense. (to me at least) If surgery is considered a waste of time, why bother offering radiation treatment? If surgery is started, why bother aborting when positive node(s) are found? If curative treatments are considered ineffective, why bother offering any of them at all? (or one over the other?) Again, it might be all dependent on what the \"common practice\" is in your area of the world, doctors personal experience (and/or opinion), health care system or insurance coverage. A cancer \"cure\" is often measured in years of \"progression free survival\" (PFS) with 5yr and 10yr data points. I should add that as a PC patient with the 'dreaded S4 N1 Incurable' diagnosis I can understand how we'd want everything (including the kitchen sink) tossed at our condition no matter HOW LITTLE the odds of a benefit might be. However as an Engineer I can understand the reality of how most doctors, health care systems and insurance companies are very reluctant (if at all willing) to gamble on any sort of treatment that is not at least a bit better than a coin toss (50%/50%). While PC patients may want (and even demand) treatments which offer <=10% of a chance at progression free survival at 5yrs our doctors, health care systems and insurance companies may refuse anything that does not offer 55% or better odds of a cure. (or progression free survival at 5yrs)",

I was immediately put on casodex then a week later lupron. Then 2weeks after that my oncologist scheduled me for 6 rounds of docetaxel .The day of my first round of chemo I got the test results of my baseline psa and it had dropped down to 48 from 268 in a matter of just 2 weeks of lupron and casodex therapy only. I'm hoping this is a sign that lupron will work very well for me going forward.I have read that lupron/docetaxel treatment right at diagnosis is having very good long term results for men with advanced PC that hasn't spread to any organs.

      "Content": "I'm not a doctor or a licensed medical professional so when in doubt - ask your doctor. A word on how the Gleason scores plays into this. Experts believe that Gleason6 (G6) and less tumors never leave the prostate. However G7 through G10 not only are able to escape the prostate but are able to invade other parts of the body. While most of us might consider an \u201cinvasion\u201d as only the known visible tumors and simply removing the known tumors will remove the cancer, this is not the case. Not only do PC cells of this type not require to be in a tumor to survive but since even the best of modern imaging can only detect tumors >= 1mm, other smaller tumors (sometimes called \"micro mets\") might be forming that are currently undetectable. Here's where the starting PSA number, gleason score and other prognostic indicators can come into play. Those patients with fairly low starting PSA values and small and almost undetectable nodal involvement may have better chances at not having a high volume of PC cells moving about inside their bodies or very little or none at all. I suppose that those that had their prostate and positive lymph nodes removed during surgery and are now faced with a rising PSA might be offered Radiation therapy to stop the cancer and sometimes still offering some chances at a cure. Since I have no direct personal experience with Radiation Therapy, I'll let the www.cancer.gov fact sheet fill in the blanks here. http://www.cancer.gov/cancertopics/t...ion-fact-sheet My own personal knowledge of RT is that they kinda need a \"target\" to aim the radiation at. Again I'll let others with direct personal experience chime in here with their experiences. If cancer has progressed to a point where PSA is rising with out any diagnostic \"targets\" to aim local therapies at, \"systemic\" treatments which effect the cancer cells - no matter where they are - are needed to be used. When combined with localized treatments systemic therapies can help provide better odds of a cure (or longer period of \"progression free survival\") the problem with \"systemic treatments\" is that presently none of them can offer a cure by themselves. This is why most doctors believe that Stage4 prostate cancer is incurable. The generally used primary treatments for Stage4 node positive cancer is ADT (androgen deprivation therapy). Some doctors will even go so far as using TAB (total androgen blockage). While rare ADT can sometimes can keep the PC at bay for 5-10yrs or more. After ~3yrs a patient will need additional medication to protect from bone loss. A word on prostate cancer cells. The next step in the game involves cancer cells which are no longer responsive to ADT. There are two schools of thought on this. The first theory is that CRPC (castration resistant prostate cancer) or HRPC (hormone refectory prostate cancer) cells have always been there and it is the killing of ADPC (androgen dependent prostate cancer cells) which leave only them remaining to divide and multiply and cause further issues. The second theory is that the ADT causes the ADPC to evolve into CRPC or HRPC and after the ADPC cells are killed off the CRPC or HRPC cells are left remaining. Which ever the case eventually ADT will start failing. Some patients only get a few months to 18 months, others almost a decade or more. The average is 3.5 years. There is further good news in that there are now a few drugs approved for use after ADT fails which can be tried before trying chemo therapy. I know some readers will chime in and ask \u201cwhy not use the CHARTTED protocol?\u201d (this was a recent study where ADT+Chemo was used successfully to extend the overall survival of select groups of Stage4 metastatic patients up to 2 years.) The problem here is that while it may logically be assumed that it might be helpful for less critical patients, the study involved only a select group of very critical patients and even the authors of the study warn against attempting to conclude that the same results might be had with other patients. (recently a patient whom consulted with the famous \u201cSnuffy\u201d Meyers had the protocol mentioned and that the patient did not have enough metastatic tumors to qualify for the protocol) Actually CHARTTED won't apply to most patients who navigate though the treatments from early node positive to the much later stage treatments. The further good news (or not) is that a patients initial PSA value and Gleason score can/might play a role in how long (or if) different treatments are effective and how quick (or not) other tumors and issues develop. While a cure for Stage4 prostate cancer is not available today, new drugs and treatments are in the pipeline which may offer a cure in the future. George.",

Since I don't have any direct personal experience with it, I can only read about it at the above mentioned websites along with wikipedia.org and others. Personally, my case is/was to far along for surgery or radiation to provide any benefit. At some point I may be offered \"salvage radiation\" in case of painful bone mets or life threatening mets. Radiation even after surgery can be helpful for those lucky enough to catch PC early before the PSA is in the 100's and the PC is systemic. Best of luck to you and your husband Letsdothis.",

      "Content": "While not perfect PSA tests are a fairly good indicator of \"cancer volume\". Some patients on ADT will drop from astronomical PSA values to nearly zero in a matter of a few months. Others may flatten out above a value of PSA=10. The ADT is working as long as the value keeps going down and/or reached a low point within or at least near what a normal person the same age might have. As someone else mentioned, when ADT starts to fail the tracking of the time between the PSA value doubling will be watched. At some point in the PSA doubling your husbands DR will likely change up his medication to something else. I hope this helps.",

Then again if it works, it has yet to be in clinical trials in actual humans. Just another theory that is promising from lab work and mice.",

I wondered where the dividing line between post surgery radiation working/not working was. My (wrong) understanding always was that they needed something to \"light up\" in imaging to aim the radiation at. It seems that patients that don't have anything \"light up\" with this specialized imaging test can consider themselves cured at the end of post operation radiation. (and those that do \"light up\" still have +40% chance of 15yrs ahead of them!) There are a few users here that are just starting post operation radiation treatments, I'm hopeful for their positive outcomes and continued sharing of their personal experiences with their treatment. I have no idea if the test mentioned in the article is widely in use or even available in most areas but I'm glad so see diagnostic testing progressing. G.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by newporter George, Good points. I am a layperson but I agree with you 100%. Reading many of the advances in cancer and HIV treatments, a lot of breakthroughs came from combination therapy. It has been standard for breast cancer for at least 10 yrs; HIV became a chronic disease instead of a death sentence after combination of drugs given concurrently.... I just don't understand why this is not done for prostate cancer that has spread. The recent clinical trial combining chemo and hormone early showed significant survival advantage is just a first step. Intuitively, I would think a combination would cut down cancer cell mutation, drug resistance and have a higher chance of kill. Indeed. While historically the 'toss everything including the kitchen sink' resulted in diminishing returns (hence why common practice is not to do it) some combined treatments do yield improved results. As you mentioned the battle against AIDS was at a near standstill until one group of researchers came up with a combined 'cocktail' of a handful of treatment drugs which together worked where each drug by itself not so much. However one must be cautious in ingesting the headline grabbing 'results' as the 'devil is in the details' and the industry is rife with condensed press releases 'cherry picking' and otherwise overstating benefits. Preliminary results from the CHAARTED study were released in 2013, (ADT+Chemo for +5 metastatic tumor patients) and while their results might be logically extended to include patients with much less disease progression, the authors themselves warned that without further specific studies of that theory the logical extension ought not be made. That theory was tested in a recent study that someone else recently posted. The combined therapy did result in improved outcomes. Only time will tell if doctors, healthcare systems start using the combined treatments and insurance companies approve and pay for them.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by DjinTonic Hi George. Have you discussed with your docs whether local treatment could be of benefit for you, and if so, what are their opinions? On a side note, do you have any urinary symptoms from your large prostate? Djin I'll bring it up with the urologist in Feb when I see him next. It has in the past been considered a waste of time (I agree here) and effort. I no longer have UTS and would rate the 'plumbing' as 'normal' at this point. Then again I still take 'flowmax' daily and it might be masking some flow issues.",

He was in prime fitness before getting cancer and has been able to maintain otherwise good to very good fitness and health since his initial diagnosis. However it should be mentioned that he is not a 'typical' or 'average' case. Not everyone is able to tolerate chemo as well as he has. (with or without the advances in drugs which help reduce the more intrusive side effects of chemo) Not all those that are in otherwise 'good condition' are able to withstand it.

      "Content": "Link to publication about dealing with chemo side effects in general http://www.cancercare.org/publicatio...0UIRoCuR7w_wcB I know a \"runner\" who has lung cancer and so far has survived +6 rounds of chemo, he still runs and still has cancer. He was in prime fitness before getting cancer and has been able to maintain otherwise good to very good fitness and health since his initial diagnosis. However it should be mentioned that he is not a 'typical' or 'average' case. Not everyone is able to tolerate chemo as well as he has. (with or without the advances in drugs which help reduce the more intrusive side effects of chemo) Not all those that are in otherwise 'good condition' are able to withstand it. At some point (maybe when the \"palliative treatment\" card is dealt) \"quality of life\" could be more important to the patient then overall duration. Each patient is unique in their overall health and goals of treatment.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by hms03049 Hello George, Thanks for posting these links. It is becoming clear I may have had some advantage in pulling the ART trigger at 6 months and PSA= .05, instead of SRT at 12 months and PSA= 0.1. There seems to be a re-think on several fronts over just the past couple of years. Topics like adjuvant RT with HT, adding chemo with HT and radiation, the role of surgery ahead of radiation for high grade PC and others are showing up in more papers and also as topics for several new trials. Include some of the new imaging techniques, and more support for targeting individual mets with radiation it is a quickly changing landscape. HMS Frankly, I've never understood some of the thinking for waiting until a known problem is a much bigger problem before attacking with treatments. Is there some false hope that a patients PSA will flatten out at some low but detectible level as some minor amount of non-cancerous prostate may of been left behind? While as a child the concept of \"kick em while they are down\" may of been presented as a unfair and unsportsman like way to fight, it surprises me that when it comes to cancer everything (including the kitchen sink) is not automatically tossed at it as rapidly as humanly possible. g.",

One point that resonates with me is to find the best surgeon, Rad/oncol possible. I'm at a loss of how to go about that. With no contacts in medical circles or first hand knowledge of my areas talent. Does anyone have suggestions on where I can begin researching and rating my doctor options? Thank you so much and Merry Christmas. 1st off, welcome and sorry you've had to join our \"club\". Forgive me while I venture off topic for a moment.... Might I suggest that before researching various types of Doctors some time might be invested in reading a few of the Cancer specific websites to educate yourself on the various aspects of PC and the \"standard\" (and not so standard) treatment options are or might be available for you. After giving yourself a good 'short course' in PC you'll be armed with questions that you could then query different Doctors for answers on. As others will likely mention, some Doctors tend to recommend whatever treatment that they specialize in and this is why (IMHO) its important to have a basic idea of all the options that may be available to you. Personally I like to arrive at DR visits \"armed\" with questions. ; Good luck to you in whatever treatment option you decide on.",

With no contacts in medical circles or first hand knowledge of my areas talent. Does anyone have suggestions on where I can begin researching and rating my doctor options? Thank you so much and Merry Christmas. 1st off, welcome and sorry you've had to join our \"club\". Forgive me while I venture off topic for a moment.... Might I suggest that before researching various types of Doctors some time might be invested in reading a few of the Cancer specific websites to educate yourself on the various aspects of PC and the \"standard\" (and not so standard) treatment options are or might be available for you. After giving yourself a good 'short course' in PC you'll be armed with questions that you could then query different Doctors for answers on. As others will likely mention, some Doctors tend to recommend whatever treatment that they specialize in and this is why (IMHO) its important to have a basic idea of all the options that may be available to you. Personally I like to arrive at DR visits \"armed\" with questions. ; Good luck to you in whatever treatment option you decide on.",

I've nearly fallen off my chair reading the statements some Urologist or Oncologist's have made. In my humble opinion some of them sound almost down right criminal in the way they are pushing THEIR agenda and hopeful of billing someone for their services!

      "Content": "Originally Posted by goodlife307 Thanks Chuck. I should clarify . . . the docs just referenced the trials as evidence that this new approach can work . . . but he would not be in a trial. He will likely start Lupron in the next 2 to 4 weeks and maybe the docetaxel shortly after. His treatment will be independent of any trial. Not sure if he will stay on Casodex but I suspect they would want him to. What a very unique protocol. Generally Casodex is started before Lupron to combat a hormone spike when the lupron is started. Most times the Casodex runs 2-4 weeks before and 2-4 weeks after the Lupron shot then discontinued unless the PSA is not responding as they'd like. (then they may start it up again) Normally they would wait until the Lupron started failing and then ether move to a more modern ADT/HT or start Docetaxel at that point. While I think the trial the doc's referenced involved only newly diagnosed patients with +5 metastatic tumors and the protocol sounded promising for patients with less PC, it seems very unique to me to use ADT/HT+Chemo pre-surgery with N0M0 PC. Pretty cool the docs are \"pushing the envelope\" of treatment! Please keep us updated on the treatments and the results.",

With that said, hormone therapy is in many parts of the world used as the \"front line\" treatment for very advanced or metastatic prostate cancer. While 'localized' is usually defined as contained within (or sometimes on or attached to) the prostate itself, in this case 'localized' could of been redefined (or downplayed) to include the general area or even the entire pelvic region. Which ever the case, the period of remission caused by the hormone therapy may of been also downplayed as the \"deemed cured\" phase and the hormone refectory PC afterwards being the natural progression of the PC.

      "Content": "I'm sorry to hear of your loss. As others have mentioned, none of us are Doctors and its difficult at best to try to reverse engineer the possible sequence of events. With that said, hormone therapy is in many parts of the world used as the \"front line\" treatment for very advanced or metastatic prostate cancer. While 'localized' is usually defined as contained within (or sometimes on or attached to) the prostate itself, in this case 'localized' could of been redefined (or downplayed) to include the general area or even the entire pelvic region. Which ever the case, the period of remission caused by the hormone therapy may of been also downplayed as the \"deemed cured\" phase and the hormone refectory PC afterwards being the natural progression of the PC. Again, I'm very sorry to hear of your loss.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by meallem I have had prostate cancer for 13 years.in 2004 i had 45 radiations and couple of biopsies.in 2008 i had cryotherapy which did not succeed.i had gleason 7 +7 and maximum 25 psa.after2008. i have been having casodex during the last 9 years which managed to keep down the psa to maximum to 3 .two years ago i had a urine blockage and had to go to hospital .they found that my psa went up to 33 and the cancer got out to the bones. i am treated now with an injection called decaptil each 3 months and stopped the casodex.i started also to take xtandi for the lasr 2 months and i found that i am wanting to sleep all the time.and my urine problems aggavated. i am wondering if some patients are in a similar situiation and what have they done about it.i am 78 years old. Thanks. ezra meallem Decapeptyl SR injection contains the active ingredient triptorelin, which is a type of medicine known as a gonadorelin (LHRH) analogue. This essentially blocks the production of testosterone. The most common side effects of XTANDI include weakness or feeling more tired than usual, back pain, decreased appetite, constipation, joint pain, diarrhea, hot flashes, upper respiratory tract infection, swelling in your hands, arms, legs, or feet, shortness of breath, muscle and bone pain, weight loss, headache, high blood pressure, dizziness, and a feeling that you or things around you are moving or spinning (vertigo). Having low or nearly no testosterone at all can have a number of side effects, sleeping more than usual surely can be one of them. Welcome to the low testosterone club.",

      "Content": "C33, congratulations! What you've described is likely the most impressive and aggressive treatment that I've heard anyone get. Be thankful to your healthcare team and (hopefully) system that paid for all of that. I'm no Doctor, just another PC patient. There are places in the world which will take aggressive targeted local therapy off the table if positive nodes are detected before surgery. There are also places in the world which will abort any surgery if positive nodes are detected once they open the patient up for surgery. But enough of that. The good news is that positive nodes removed at the time of surgery generally have a better outcome. While there are chances that the surgery alone might of cured you, there are chances that it may not have. Hence the radiation. With radiation alone there are chances that it might offer a cure, however the chances are even better if ADT or ADT+CAB (I forget, but recall ~18mo is popular) is combined with the radiation. It is well known that ADT or ADT+CAB alone won't cure PC, it can just make it weak. Sure while some cells will likely 'starve to death', others will ether morph into being able to survive on whatever trace amounts of testosterone is still in your system or morph into creating its own antigen (hormone independence or hormone refectory). As long as the cells also don't morph into not producing PSA (very rare) these are the cells that can be detected with a rising PSA. The good news is that there are many other treatments available *IF* the current treatment course fails and there are many new treatments that are due to come out in the next coming years that combined could offer even more time with our families and loved ones (and who knows, maybe even a cure?). It would seem to me that your team has tossed everything (including the kitchen sink) at your case offering you the best chance they can/could at having a cure. Here's hoping that is exactly what they gave you and that you'll be in the \"zero club\" for many years to come, even after the end of the ADT+CAB treatment. g.",

      "Content": "C33, congratulations! What you've described is likely the most impressive and aggressive treatment that I've heard anyone get. Be thankful to your healthcare team and (hopefully) system that paid for all of that. I'm no Doctor, just another PC patient. There are places in the world which will take aggressive targeted local therapy off the table if positive nodes are detected before surgery. There are also places in the world which will abort any surgery if positive nodes are detected once they open the patient up for surgery. But enough of that. The good news is that positive nodes removed at the time of surgery generally have a better outcome. While there are chances that the surgery alone might of cured you, there are chances that it may not have. Hence the radiation. With radiation alone there are chances that it might offer a cure, however the chances are even better if ADT or ADT+CAB (I forget, but recall ~18mo is popular) is combined with the radiation. It is well known that ADT or ADT+CAB alone won't cure PC, it can just make it weak. Sure while some cells will likely 'starve to death', others will ether morph into being able to survive on whatever trace amounts of testosterone is still in your system or morph into creating its own antigen (hormone independence or hormone refectory). As long as the cells also don't morph into not producing PSA (very rare) these are the cells that can be detected with a rising PSA. The good news is that there are many other treatments available *IF* the current treatment course fails and there are many new treatments that are due to come out in the next coming years that combined could offer even more time with our families and loved ones (and who knows, maybe even a cure?). It would seem to me that your team has tossed everything (including the kitchen sink) at your case offering you the best chance they can/could at having a cure. Here's hoping that is exactly what they gave you and that you'll be in the \"zero club\" for many years to come, even after the end of the ADT+CAB treatment. g.",

In my case the boss got informed that I had applied for the leave but not the reasons behind it. Personally, I'm a open and honest guy and informed the boss what is going on.

      "Content": "Originally Posted by goodlife307 Thanks Chuck. I should clarify . . . the docs just referenced the trials as evidence that this new approach can work . . . but he would not be in a trial. He will likely start Lupron in the next 2 to 4 weeks and maybe the docetaxel shortly after. His treatment will be independent of any trial. Not sure if he will stay on Casodex but I suspect they would want him to. What a very unique protocol. Generally Casodex is started before Lupron to combat a hormone spike when the lupron is started. Most times the Casodex runs 2-4 weeks before and 2-4 weeks after the Lupron shot then discontinued unless the PSA is not responding as they'd like. (then they may start it up again) Normally they would wait until the Lupron started failing and then ether move to a more modern ADT/HT or start Docetaxel at that point. While I think the trial the doc's referenced involved only newly diagnosed patients with +5 metastatic tumors and the protocol sounded promising for patients with less PC, it seems very unique to me to use ADT/HT+Chemo pre-surgery with N0M0 PC. Pretty cool the docs are \"pushing the envelope\" of treatment! Please keep us updated on the treatments and the results.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by goatts Anybody know answer? Just got bone scan and MRI yesterday. Thanks Tom Depending on who you talk to it can go ether way. I've read that PC \"favors\" the bones as bone are more \"hospital\" to prostate cancer growth (this school of thought says the bones are 1st). I've also read that prostate cancer will jump to the lymph nodes 1st. It may just depend on which route the cancer took out of the prostate. Once the cancer is in the lymph node system it is more likely other nodes will become effected, the same goes for bone mets, it will spread to other bones. I don't believe there are hard and fast rules here. Eventually it will invade primary organs. My DR was concerned that my PC could just as well jump to my bones as another lymph node. Bone invasion eventually involves discomfort, pain and access to the rest of the body via the blood stream. Lymph node invasion gives the PC access to the lymph node system (and hence much of the body). There are good arguments on why ether one is worse however I tend to think bone invasion is worse as it involves possible discomfort and/or pain.

What are the odds of PSA numbers increasing again after the chemo is done and only injections follow...for a stage 4....?? It is my understanding that the effect of any chemo treatment is only temporary. Actually accept in rare cases all treatments for stage 4 are that way. Hence why they call it 'palliative treatment'. Some patients don't respond favorably at all to some chemo treatments, I believe that there are now at least 3 different chemo drugs approved for treating prostate cancer. g.",

      "Content": "I'm sorry to hear of your loss. As others have mentioned, none of us are Doctors and its difficult at best to try to reverse engineer the possible sequence of events. With that said, hormone therapy is in many parts of the world used as the \"front line\" treatment for very advanced or metastatic prostate cancer. While 'localized' is usually defined as contained within (or sometimes on or attached to) the prostate itself, in this case 'localized' could of been redefined (or downplayed) to include the general area or even the entire pelvic region. Which ever the case, the period of remission caused by the hormone therapy may of been also downplayed as the \"deemed cured\" phase and the hormone refectory PC afterwards being the natural progression of the PC.

The value is that someone else was diagnosed or had the same treatment prescribed and hence the users are not alone in their struggles as others have or are facing the same issues as they are. None of us are educated, trained or licensed to practice medicine or give medical advice. \"This is what worked (or did not) for me\", \"my personal experience was\" and \"this was my reasoning for the treatment decision I made\". Then again, if someone with direct personal experience with being \"cured\" of PC with a exotic treatment only available abroad dropped by the forum one day to tell us all about it do those of us who would never in a million years be able to get the same treatment want to hear about it?",

I need a little time with this. .25 mg Xanax is the lowest dose on planet earth....the typical dose is 2.5mg....ten times more...and the wine....well, that does seem to be a bit extreme but then I am feeling sorry for myself right now.... I am on point at work...cancer, benzos, alcohol......they are not a factor there. They become an element of MY time, so that I don't spend every waking moment wondering about the \"what if's\". tough for me right now.......looking for help if it's out there... Regards, DD You know there is a little line in the center of the pills which make it easy to cut in 1/2 right? Do you gamble or bet on sports at all? Here's almost a \"sure thing\" nearly ~85% of newly diagnosed PC patients are found with very early stage and very curable PC. Does that help at all? Then there's the national cancer center and American Cancer Society with the assuring statistics that most men with PC will die from something else. Does that help? When first diagnosed I found comfort in reading and researching what it is that I might be up against. Both national cancer centric websites along with health care system specific websites and even Wikipedia was helpful in understanding the diagnostic tests, what the results might mean for me, how test results fit into \"staging\" this thing along with the various treatment options that might be available. Lots of reading, lots of learning. Understanding took an enormous bite out of the fear for me. I think you'll find that the overwhelming majority of the users here are cured of PC (or in long term remission) just like you might be sometime in the near future. Cheers, G.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by Dogdollar Pat, Thanks SO much. I need a little time with this. .25 mg Xanax is the lowest dose on planet earth....the typical dose is 2.5mg....ten times more...and the wine....well, that does seem to be a bit extreme but then I am feeling sorry for myself right now.... I am on point at work...cancer, benzos, alcohol......they are not a factor there. They become an element of MY time, so that I don't spend every waking moment wondering about the \"what if's\". tough for me right now.......looking for help if it's out there... Regards, DD You know there is a little line in the center of the pills which make it easy to cut in 1/2 right? Do you gamble or bet on sports at all? Here's almost a \"sure thing\" nearly ~85% of newly diagnosed PC patients are found with very early stage and very curable PC. Does that help at all? Then there's the national cancer center and American Cancer Society with the assuring statistics that most men with PC will die from something else. Does that help? When first diagnosed I found comfort in reading and researching what it is that I might be up against. Both national cancer centric websites along with health care system specific websites and even Wikipedia was helpful in understanding the diagnostic tests, what the results might mean for me, how test results fit into \"staging\" this thing along with the various treatment options that might be available. Lots of reading, lots of learning. Understanding took an enormous bite out of the fear for me. I think you'll find that the overwhelming majority of the users here are cured of PC (or in long term remission) just like you might be sometime in the near future. Cheers, G.",

      "Content": "Greetings, if I recall, a measurement of <= as much as 50ng/ml is technically considered a \"castrate level\" of testosterone however your husbands DR will likely be happier with something much lower <=20ng/ml or less. They likely started your husband on a 'blocker' (Cassodex is popular, there are two other choices) which will help control the \"flare\" caused by the primary ADT medication, usually delivered via a shot every 1-2-3 or 4 months. The PSA drop can be a mixed bag. While it is expected to drop, how fast it drops and how far it drops (and how long it stays dropped) is different in each case. The DR may add another testosterone controlling drug if the PSA is not dropping as fast as they would like. (this is what I'm getting, Lupron+Cassodex) The drop in PSA I got after my first treatment is in my signature below. If metastatic tumors become painful or quality of life threatening, many treatment centers will use targeted spot radiation in efforts to reduce a tumor. While some modern forms of Radiation use 'triangleation' (or other forms) where the 'radiation beams' combine to effect a small area while the single beams are not strong enough to damage tissue that it is passing through, radiation (even more so than Chemo) won't just effect cancer cells but any cells enough of its energy is focused on. Not all men suffer the same side effects from ADT. While muscle loss, weight gain and loss of testosterone can \"suck the life\" out of some patients (such as myself) some men only have minor fatauge, hot flashes, constipation, trouble sleeping, frequent late night trips to the bathroom, aches in the joints/bones and other symptoms (that I don't recall at the present time). Sadly the primary ADT will last as long is it will last. Each case is different. Some patients may get only a few months where the treatment is effective and other patients may get over a decade. Your husbands DR may provide or offer a loose estimate on how long they are hoping the primary ADT might work in your husbands case. Not to fear, there are 'secondary' ADT treatments available as well as 1-2 modern drugs (I think that there are more on the way) that in many cases are able to control PC once it becomes \"castrate resistant\" or \"hormone refectory\" before resorting to Chemo drugs. Much like the primary ADT, the modern drugs can work for a number of months to a number of years in some cases. Again how effective it is and how long it is effective seems to be different on a case-by-case basis.",

My father's psa went from 145 in May to 3.5 as of yesterday so he is responding to the treatment. I guess now we just have to hope that they can help alleviate his back pain . He starts Zytiga as soon as everything clears insurance. His doc Had said that a psa under 4 at 7 months was s good indicator and we are at 3 months so finally there is some hope. Ahh... indeed good news. Greater than 80% drop and less than 4 within 7mos. Both positive indicators. I have no experience with bone pain. I do know that \"targeted radiation\" to bone mets might be in my future if needed and many others have had it. Maybe a referral to a R.O. is in the near future.",

      "Content": "C33, congratulations! What you've described is likely the most impressive and aggressive treatment that I've heard anyone get. Be thankful to your healthcare team and (hopefully) system that paid for all of that. I'm no Doctor, just another PC patient. There are places in the world which will take aggressive targeted local therapy off the table if positive nodes are detected before surgery. There are also places in the world which will abort any surgery if positive nodes are detected once they open the patient up for surgery. But enough of that. The good news is that positive nodes removed at the time of surgery generally have a better outcome. While there are chances that the surgery alone might of cured you, there are chances that it may not have. Hence the radiation. With radiation alone there are chances that it might offer a cure, however the chances are even better if ADT or ADT+CAB (I forget, but recall ~18mo is popular) is combined with the radiation. It is well known that ADT or ADT+CAB alone won't cure PC, it can just make it weak. Sure while some cells will likely 'starve to death', others will ether morph into being able to survive on whatever trace amounts of testosterone is still in your system or morph into creating its own antigen (hormone independence or hormone refectory). As long as the cells also don't morph into not producing PSA (very rare) these are the cells that can be detected with a rising PSA. The good news is that there are many other treatments available *IF* the current treatment course fails and there are many new treatments that are due to come out in the next coming years that combined could offer even more time with our families and loved ones (and who knows, maybe even a cure?). It would seem to me that your team has tossed everything (including the kitchen sink) at your case offering you the best chance they can/could at having a cure. Here's hoping that is exactly what they gave you and that you'll be in the \"zero club\" for many years to come, even after the end of the ADT+CAB treatment. g.",

This is where the \"tough get going\" and I have to be tough for my little girls. Thanks again everyone, Lantz I think I've been on ADT for as long or longer than anyone here. I've found that I go to bed much earlier: I used to stay up and watch the 11PM news, now I'm in bed at 9PM. I used to get up between 5-7am even on WEEKENDS and now I can sleep until 9-10am without trying. In other words get lots of rest. I'm down to 7 sessions of RT left and I'm still not quite sure that it has effected my energy at all. The extra gas and sometimes runs is rather annoying but I can't honestly say the RT has effected me. Best of luck... g.",

      "Content": "Check the USA national cancer sites, they have lots of information on Cancer in general and PC at various stages with some estimated survival rates. The good news is that some Stage4 Prostate Cancers can be slowed down so that many patients could expect ~5yrs or more survival. Internationally most men with Prostate Cancer die from something other than Prostate Cancer. The bad news is that Stage4 is considered non-curable. While your grandfather may have PC, at 84yo he may also have other things going on which are not related to the PC. It would be difficult to impossible to guess what stage and what his possible treatment options (and outcomes) might be until his Dr runs additional tests and comes up with more exact staging.",

Be thankful to your healthcare team and (hopefully) system that paid for all of that. I'm no Doctor, just another PC patient. There are places in the world which will take aggressive targeted local therapy off the table if positive nodes are detected before surgery. There are also places in the world which will abort any surgery if positive nodes are detected once they open the patient up for surgery. But enough of that. The good news is that positive nodes removed at the time of surgery generally have a better outcome. While there are chances that the surgery alone might of cured you, there are chances that it may not have. Hence the radiation. With radiation alone there are chances that it might offer a cure, however the chances are even better if ADT or ADT+CAB (I forget, but recall ~18mo is popular) is combined with the radiation. It is well known that ADT or ADT+CAB alone won't cure PC, it can just make it weak. Sure while some cells will likely 'starve to death', others will ether morph into being able to survive on whatever trace amounts of testosterone is still in your system or morph into creating its own antigen (hormone independence or hormone refectory). As long as the cells also don't morph into not producing PSA (very rare) these are the cells that can be detected with a rising PSA. The good news is that there are many other treatments available *IF* the current treatment course fails and there are many new treatments that are due to come out in the next coming years that combined could offer even more time with our families and loved ones (and who knows, maybe even a cure?).

      "Content": "Check the USA national cancer sites, they have lots of information on Cancer in general and PC at various stages with some estimated survival rates. The good news is that some Stage4 Prostate Cancers can be slowed down so that many patients could expect ~5yrs or more survival. Internationally most men with Prostate Cancer die from something other than Prostate Cancer. The bad news is that Stage4 is considered non-curable. While your grandfather may have PC, at 84yo he may also have other things going on which are not related to the PC. It would be difficult to impossible to guess what stage and what his possible treatment options (and outcomes) might be until his Dr runs additional tests and comes up with more exact staging.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by Don B Yes, Fran... That's why I'm trying to find out how extensive that procedure is. My preference for radiation is due to just recently adjusting to living alone after 46 years of marriage, and I have concerns about recovering on my own. But, to your point, if getting a sample to biopsy the node is a big deal, then I may as well just go for the surgery. Thanks for your humble opinion, Don Sorry to hear of your loss Don. I can see exactly what your focus on the single node is: in many cases having a positive lymph node precludes you from 'curative treatment' (many consider it a waste of time) where as if the node was negative you may be offered surgery or radiation treatments. I've often thought about this myself. If the 'positive lymph node' is the difference between a Stage3 advanced and a Stage4 diagnosis (and treatments) why not biopsy the thing and find out for sure? I've read that the 3T MRI can detect tumors down to 1mm (or less) and there are new 'radio markers' that can make CT scans much more sensitive. I suppose finding out if the node is positive or not depends on if it is limiting your treatment choices or not. Best of luck.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by Don B Yes, Fran... That's why I'm trying to find out how extensive that procedure is. My preference for radiation is due to just recently adjusting to living alone after 46 years of marriage, and I have concerns about recovering on my own. But, to your point, if getting a sample to biopsy the node is a big deal, then I may as well just go for the surgery. Thanks for your humble opinion, Don Sorry to hear of your loss Don. I can see exactly what your focus on the single node is: in many cases having a positive lymph node precludes you from 'curative treatment' (many consider it a waste of time) where as if the node was negative you may be offered surgery or radiation treatments. I've often thought about this myself. If the 'positive lymph node' is the difference between a Stage3 advanced and a Stage4 diagnosis (and treatments) why not biopsy the thing and find out for sure? I've read that the 3T MRI can detect tumors down to 1mm (or less) and there are new 'radio markers' that can make CT scans much more sensitive. I suppose finding out if the node is positive or not depends on if it is limiting your treatment choices or not. Best of luck.",

      "Content": "Surgery and radiotherapy are both good at \"fixing\" or curing cancer that is still contained within the prostate but nether are generally considered very effective if the cancer has grown beyond the prostate. DR's and treatment centers may not offer them if there is a high chance of cancer recurrence. (personally I have >90% odds of recurrence <=5yrs, >95% <=10yrs) So here's hoping that the 'suspect' lymph node in the belly does not respond to ADT (hormone treatment). It should be noted that some oncologists like to 'shrink' the tumor with ADT prior to radio therapy and continue it for a time afterwards as better outcomes can be had by combining the therapies.",

      "Content": "Greetings R22, I'm not a doctor. I don't have a \"bedside manor\". I'm sorry your brother was diagnosed with Stage 4. While Stage 4 is generally considered incurable its not the end of the world. S4 PC can sometimes be managed for a long time. What I would suggest is doing some internet research, namely at a site called \"pubmed\" which stores research papers from all over the world. There are two publications that might be of primary interest: - The first one is the NCI (national cancer insitute) Prostate Cancer guidelines. This is the document that many insurance companies and DR's look to for guidance for \"standard level of treatment\". (this is handy of your brother lives in the USA) - The second one is pretty much the same thing but comes from England and is the guidelines for their national healthcare system. The Brits even go into cost/benefit and include the trial/research references that lead them to making the recommendations. Pretty in depth stuff. With the above information on screen you and your brother can see for yourselves if he's at least getting \"the standard level of treatment\". The usual course of action in Stage 4 is generally the use of different drugs in a serial progression. If there is 'high volume', life threatening mets or quality of life mets ADT+Chemo might be offered. The progression of the medications go from least intrusive to more. Least expensive to more. Another member mentioned 'Provenge' which may or may not be used at the end of the succession as a last ditch effort (insanely expensive and with questionable effects). There might be some \"trials\" that your brother might qualify for. Many DR's don't keep up on this sort of stuff so it may take some prodding or self research from your brother to get the DR to refer him to a treatment trial. Cheers.... g.",

I think Dad will receive it but the consultant wants to wait and see how he reacts to the hormones. Because of the odds of the cancer coming back if there actually IS a positive lymph node, many DR's and medical centers won't offer surgery or radiation. However if after some months on treatment the suspect lymph node is scanned again and it is unaffected by the treatment, it is likely not cancerous and they can move forward with a curative treatment of Radiotherapy.

      "Content": "I debated on posting on this as the forum is generally upbeat and positive. The story here is not. I felt that I needed to write somewhere about it as it hits close to home. The Prostate Cancer Forum seemed to be the best place. I've known Dennis since the late 1980's. Always a \"fun loving\" and \"party animal\" the guy loved hunting, fishing, \"chasing tail\" and seemingly never grew up. A year ago August he was in a traffic accident and during his 2 week stay at the hospital they tossed all sorts of tests at him in attempts to get a \"complete picture\" of what might be ailing him. Since he was ~60yo at the time one of those tests was a PSA test. The result of the PSA test was rather shocking to everyone - over 1200. While he had no UTS or other indication of PC when he was well enough they gave him the standard barrage of tests that most of us go through. The good news was his Gleason score was low, biopsy/scans showed only partial involvement of one lobe of his prostate however contrasting that the scans showed PC from the top of his head to his feet plus bone and liver invasion. I talked to him at length about it last March/April and while he'd recently took early retirement (and switched to SSD/Medicare) he was upbeat that he had \"slow growing kind\" and the planned ADT+Chemo would keep him enjoying the outdoors for years to come. While I personally questioned his upbeat prognosis (based on my own research) I kept my unprofessional opinions to myself and kept in mind that every case is somewhat different and who really knows how things might pan out. While modern life has moved much communication with old time friends to texts, email and Facebook, actual phone calls are somewhat rare these days. Nobody wants to get \"the call\". A dozen or more of us got it, dropped whatever we were doing and collected at a hospital. It seems that Dennis had gotten the Flu and since the PC was in his bone marrow he had little or no immune system to fight it. They had already given him 1/2 dozen units of blood and at the point of us getting \"the call\" the staff was merely helping him hold on until his daughter arrived from out of state to see him for the last time. Its debatable if he knew of any of our being there. His whole family was there at his side and many/most of his friends had stopped by to see him that day. Dennis passed away Saturday 1hr after his daughters arrival. May he RIP.",

      "Content": "Thanks for the kind words everyone, this hits close to home as he was 1 of 4 people (including myself) I've known that over the last 5yrs got diagnosed with PC, 50% are no longer with us. This case surely flies in the face of the industry attempts to move away from early detection - had he been tested 20 or even 10yrs ago he still may be with us. I believe that it also highlights that \"slow growing\" cancer can be just as deadly as the more aggressive types. Since his actual prostate only had \"spots\" on one lobe, he had no UTS or other troubling symptoms until the cancer reached enough bone to cause discomfort and in the end pain. The PC may of been growing in him for decades. While very few cases (arguably less than 5% or less than 1% depending on your statistic source) are initially diagnosed at S4 and even less with distant mets+bone+organ involvement, my guess is that \"Flu\" will be listed as the cause of death, further muddling the PC survival statistics. IMHO: if anyone is planing a colonoscopy, they ought to get a DRA and PSA test at the same time. Why test for ONE type of cancer while ignoring another type that is much more common?",

The health care system I'm signed up with has a pharmacy and a nurses station (along with lots of other departments).

As far as duration of getting the shots I'm understanding it is dependent on what the shots are being used for. Some patients may have them prescribed for 1yr or less while others (such as myself) may get them pretty much forever or until they stop having benefit (and/or stop working).",
