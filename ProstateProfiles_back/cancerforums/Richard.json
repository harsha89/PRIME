      "Content": "I am 63 years old. My PSA was 2.8 in 1998. It has risen steadily to 20.6 in Jan. 2006. I have had 6 biopsies, the most recent in Oct. 2005. No cancer has been found and no suspicious cells. My PSA rose from 11.5 in Mar. 2005 to 20.6 in Jan. 2006. I have no symptoms, and no other reason for the rise in PSA has been identified. I am very worried, but uncertain how to proceed. My urologist has suggested an endo-rectal MRI procedure. Has anyone else experienced such a high PSA with no cancer found after six biopsies? Also, has anyone found the endo-rectal MRI procedure useful in finding cancer that was not found by biopsy? Any other relevant information is welcome. Thank you.",
