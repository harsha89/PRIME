      "Content": "Howdy: First of all, this is a great forum. I have been following it for several months and have found it to be a great source of excellent information as well as inspirational. I am scheduled to have da vinci surgury in August, and have a question regardig exercising after surgery. I have always been something of a fitness fanatic, adhering to a rigorous fitness routine for manhy years. I am anxious to get back into the swing of things as quickly after the surgury as possible. i will start to walk as much as possible of course, but wanted to get others opinion on strengthining exercises. I have used exercise cables (bands) for years and have found them to be a great alternative to weights (either free weights or machines). The bands come in various levels of resistence, as low as the equlivant of 10 lbs. on up to 100lbs. i have thought that I might purchase a set of light resistant cables (10-20 lbs) and start doing some upper body exercises to maintain muscle tone and some level of fitness while recuperating from the surgery. Does anyone have any experience and/or thoughts on this? I would appreciate your feedback.",
