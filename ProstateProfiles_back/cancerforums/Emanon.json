      "Content": "Hello, I am new to the forum but have been around the PC world for awhile (10+ years in watchful waiting). Well, my wait is over\u0085.time for treatment. My indicators are now saying it is time. I am trying to educate myself with the most up to date info before making a final decision. What is the most up to date, and relevant info available? Modern sources I have found that are helping my decision for which treatment are: 1. 10 Year Outcome after Monitoring, Surgery, or Radiotherapy for Localized Prostate Cancer. New England Journal of Medicine, Oct 13, 2016 2. Patient-Reported Outcomes after Monitoring, Surgery, or Radiotherapy for Prostate Cancer. New England Journal of Medicine, Oct 13, 2016 3. Harvard Medical School 2016 Annual on Report Prostate Diseases 4. Walsh\u0092s \u0093Guide to Surviving Prostate Cancer\u0094 is helping me refresh my knowlage. I am reading the older one now (2001 print) but just ordered the 2012 version from Amazon. I don\u0092t mind reading older stuff if it is still relevant, but I am in particular looking for current sources of information on treatments and outcomes. Items 1 and 2 were referenced at my initial visit with an Oncologist, and definitely changed my opinion for the better on the radiation option. The (older) Walsh book makes a convincing case (for my situation) on Surgery. What literature would you recommend? Thank you in advance....",

      "Content": "Thank you! I guess I am blessed to have a great surgeon who I trust to do RP if I go that way (he was/is my watchful waiting Dr for the past decade). He does about 150 RP surgeries per year (laparoscopic). And last month I met an Oncologist from the local very large modern hospital, and I was happy with his answers on the state of the art EBR equipment. So I guess I am \"locked and loaded\" when I make a decison. Today I downloaded about a dozen articles from my 24 hr subscription to New England Journal of Medicine. Not sure I was worth the time with the exception of the few I already mentioned. But the more I learn the more I will be confident in making a treatment decision. I checked Amazon for the latest Walsh edition book. I think I will get the kindle version. About a dozen prostate books are available on kindle at about $10 per. Again, looking for direction on what I should read/study. Lots out there. I did get a BIG Surprise (good surprise) when I read the reviews on Amazon. Some people have really taken time to review the books and link it to their personal situation. Kind of weird that Amazon reviews of Prostate books is where I gave gained some small, but important insite. Yeah, really weird now that I think about it some more.",
