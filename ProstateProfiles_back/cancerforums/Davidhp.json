      "Content": "I just had the open surgery to remove my prostate and four lymph nodes on August 21st, my gleason was a 3+3 = 6. I had a postive biopsy for one core. I got the post surgery pathology report today and there were no indications that the cancer spread out of my prostate so it looks like the surgeon got all the cancer. I don't have the experience of many of the posters here, but I know I am happy that I had the surgery as prostate cancer took my father and both my first cousins. It is too early for me to tell if I have the negative side effects possible with the surgery, but I can tell you this, getting rid of the cancer was my priority and I will be alive to deal with any consequences and I will deal with those if necessary, but I will be alive.",

He said at age 60 it would be expected for me to live another 20 years and that radiation can cause cancer about 15 years out from the treatment so I decided to have the surgery and I had it on August 21st the old fashioned way - open surgery since my surgeon had done over 1,000 open prostatectomies. I got the post op pathology report today and my cancer was confined to prostate so I am basically cured and that is what I was looking for in my treatment. I agree that you need to get an experienced surgeon or radiologist and I would ask the radiologist of his opinion about possible cancer from radiation treatment for a younger man.",
