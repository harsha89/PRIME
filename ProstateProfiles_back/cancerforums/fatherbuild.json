      "Content": "Given the prevalence of prostate cancer in the modern world, I am operating under the presumption that the situation my father now faces has already taken place. My hope is that someone is willing to offer him their experience with prostate cancer and the post surgery realities. He has been an independent, hard-working, self-sufficient man all of his life. I know the loss of independence and the fear of what he now faces are affecting him in ways I can't understand. If there is understanding to be had in all of this, then I would ask that you speak up and offer your words and experiences. Any information, references, or points of contact for financial aid are also appreciated, but secondary to putting some of his fears to rest. The story so far: He was diagnosed with prostate cancer approximately 60 days ago. According to the various numbers and indexes it was an aggressive strain in its early stages and had not yet spread to the lymph nodes or surrounding tissues. We are all hoping he caught it in time. He had a robot assisted radical laparoscopic prostatectomy 6 days ago where they completely removed the prostate, surrounding tissue, and lymph nodes. Dr. Rodney Davis at UAMS, Little Rock, Arkansas decided shortly before the procedure that due to its aggressiveness he would remove all he could while he was in there. We haven't got the pathology results from the removed pieces yet. He is recovering well enough, but he is concerned about the swelling of his testicles and ankles, as well as pain in the bottom of his feet that he describes as feeling as though he was stepping on rocks through his shoes. He can walk on the balls of his feet without much pain and he is making every effort to move around and do what he can to heal, however his symptoms are worrying him right now. The testicular swelling and foot pain are making him nervous. We already called the doctor's office and updated them and they tell him that everyone heals differently and their bodies recover as they will, I get that. All he needs is to hear from someone who maybe had a similar experience. Again, any links or other sources of information are appreciated. Or anywhere else I might pose this question looking for answers. Thank you.",
