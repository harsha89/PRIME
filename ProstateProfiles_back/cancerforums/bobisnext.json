      "Content": "Seems like cialis is not working much anymore. I purchase it from northwest pharmacy, and it used to work better than it does now. I have usually taken one 20 mg early evening and another before bedtime, hoping ill be hard in the morning, but getting less and less results. I do have a few drinks before bedtime. I also take cymbalta daily for depression, and a sleep aid since I cannot fall asleep on my own. any advice from post brachytherapy patients? (I was told that having brachytherapy was less less invasive and less chance of ED. (All my yearly exams have shown a constant reduction of PSA, from 1.9 to .5 or less) Im about ready to see my doctor about injection drugs. any advice would be appreciated! Thanks bob",

      "Content": "Hi to all: FYI I have been taking cymbalta for depression for 10 years. Never had ED issues that I could connect with it until lately. For the past year, I have had increasing ED issues that even Cialis was not able to conquer. (I had brachytherapy in 2010, and cialis used to work for me until the last 6 months or so.) Up until last month, I was not able to get hard even taking 3 cialis 20 mg over the course of 6-8 hours. I even went so far as to get a script for the penile injection meds at that time. The penile inject meds work fine (not as painful as I thought it would be) but still could not have an orgasm. So I decided to go off Cymbalta for a week, and it all came back! (hard ons in the morning, with little or no cialis, and was able to orgasm). So no more cymbalta for me! (or very rarely) bob",

      "Content": "Hi: I had brachytherapy* 4 years ago. However, the cialis is working less and less. (I normally take 1 20 mg pill in the evening and then 1 more before bed. Sometimes I'm \"UP\" in the morning but never for long.) I usually have a few drinks with my girlfriend in the evening. In addition, I take Cymbalta for depression and a sleep aid to sleep since I cannot fall asleep on my own. I'm thinking about investigating injection drugs since I am not going to give up trying to F--K! Anyone else with similar issues? Any advice would be well appreciated. Thanks! bob PS: PSA has gone from 1.9 to less than .5 over the last 4 years, and I have my annual checkup in 2 weeks. (Had T2A, 2 out of 12 samples positive, 5% and 8%. Gleason was 3+3)",
