      "Content": "Hi guys i am new to this forum. I am about 28 days post surgery. I am getting through nights with just pads very little leakage. Mornings are ok but afternoons i struggle it almost like someone flicks a switch at 12:30 and i start to really have leakages when i move. Am walking in afternoons for 45mins which is uncomfortable but i want to maintain fitness. I find i suffer burning pain in my penis during these walks with leakage even with an empty bladder. I am just over a UTI be alert to pain when passing urine and act quickly if you feel it. My frustration is that i dont seem to have seen any improvement in my incontinence over the last ten days.
