      "Content": "Just a little humor this morning. I am almost six weeks post op. Down to only a slight dribble, so I am progressing with the continence problem. I own a couple of kilts ( it is a heritage thing). Just had a thought this morning how much more convient it might have been to wear a kilt when I had wear that catheter for two weeks. Just wondering if anyone had tried that or maybe an idea to try it?",

It seems that I have a steady dribble. I know it is a process, so I will keagle and hang in there. I am so happy to have the cath out that I can actually stand the dribble. I am wondering if having the catheter in for 2 weeks might make it a little more difficult the muscles to tighten up quickly? Any thoughts?",

If the urethra has not healed well enough it would have to re-inserted in the OR. So I guess I'm waiting another week with this \"wonderful\" attachment. Just a minor inconvenience but I sure am tired of it.",
