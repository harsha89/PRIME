      "Content": "I was also wondering if anyone had experienced what I thought was described as a 'focused biopsy'? My specialist said something like: it's 12mm in 30 mm so we can't really miss it. Am paraphrasing. But when you look at the results of the last biopsy - they sampled all sectors and the only real variation seemed to be the depth/length of the cores - up to 20mm. I was kinda expecting around 4 cores in 1 section only - not 12 all around. Is this just my misunderstanding? Glenn",

Each time the approach has been - we'll find it soon. This biopsy was prompted by psa around 16. An mri - my second - showed a 12mm lesion which 'will be easy to sample ' - but 2 cores show ASAP - again - and nothing else I have yet to go back for the follow up appointment but the surgeon was suggesting likely removal prior and I am now left wondering myself what a sensible next step might be?
