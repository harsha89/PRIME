      "Content": "Hi, my 1st post, hope it is ok. My doctor said my PSA was 6.5 and free psa 14 , so sent me for the biopsy last friday. I was given 3 Levaquin to take for the biopsy. Anyhow took it easy over weekend with some fever,etc. But Sunday night my fever got up to 101.5 , Monday I called the Uroligist and they gave me 4 more Levaquin for Mon. to Thurs. My temp went to 103.3 Mon. after taking the 1st pill at noon. Got fever down after talking with the Uroligist. GOOD NEWS Tues. my biopsy results all negative. Just wondering if this has happened to anyone , Thank you for reading. Edit: i need add I'm 60 years old had no symtoms prior to biopsy, now I wonder what caused the elevated Psa",
