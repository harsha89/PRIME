      "Content": "Originally Posted by Fairwind Chances are, you have a UTI, not PC so get ready for a run of antibiotics before any biopsies.. Your urologist should do a DRE and if that's abnormal, THEN a biopsy for sure..But yeah,PSA 23, that may be more than what an infection could produce.... Thank you for your reply. It s now 7:41 am and I am off to the hospital shortly. Just looked the doctors test request. He is requesting: ultrasonography upper abdomen, lower obdomen, whole abdomen and general X-ray of chest. The good thing is that I will get all the results of the above within 2 to 3 hours and I have an appointment to see my Doctor at 2:00pm. You said it is probably UTI not PC, but is it possible the PSA number jumped from 4.9 to 23 in less than a year?",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by akai Jkjude, which hospital are you using? You need to see a urologist. Why are they doing another scan and X-ray? You need to ask all these questions, start by being an informed consumer. Whatever you do, do not panick before you know what is going on. Take notes if you need to. Come back and keep us updated. Akai Bangkok Hospital Pattaya here in Pattaya. My first scan was last year. Went to see my doctor again yesterday after I found out my PSA was 23, so I guess my doctor just want to make sure before he refers me to a uruologist. Will see my doctor in three hours and I have my results on hand: no stones or tumors showing although prostate is enlarged not sure what the size numbers are. yesterday he did mention seeing a urologist. The nice thing about here in Thailand is they are very good hospitals and today I had an X-ray and Ultrasound, had all my results in hand and was heading home in just one hour. Total cost about $125.00. All this just walking in without an appointment. Most likely I will be seeing a urologist tomorrow morning. Will keep you informed.",

      "Content": "I will turn 51 next month, Asian man living in Thailand. Last year (august 2011) I had a PSA test done, result 6.0. My doctor then asked for a prostate scan and X-ray which shows a slight prostate enlargement. Two month later another PSA test was done and the number came down to 4.9, my doctor suggested I should see a urologist, but I got very busy and never went to see one. Several weeks ago I started to urinate more often than usual and felt some discomfort as well as lower back and some abdominal pain. This morning I dared myself to see my doctor and had another PSA test done. To my surprised this time the numbers came back very high: 23. My doctor told me not to panick and scheduled for another scan and X-ray. It is now 5:15am and I have been up since 2:00am. My test is today at 8:00am at a local reputable hospital. I shall receive the results the same day and have my doctor review it. I am worried .",
