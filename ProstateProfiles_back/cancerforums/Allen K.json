I am 62 years old, no symptoms. I have it scheduled for next week, will be done in his office with local. I would appreciate any thoughts from the forum. Thanks.",

      "Content": "Thanks so much for the helpful advice. I have a relatively large teaching hospital nearby that performs the MRI/fused TRUS biopsies. I am scheduled with my URO for a TRUS this Tuesday, but am seriously considering calling the University Medical Center to inquire. Man, so much to consider, I do not have a URO there, but have a recommendation for a good one. Perhaps it would be prudent to cancel/reschedule the current biopsy and consult with the University center regarding availability and timing. If I do nothing, then it is TRUS Tuesday at 1 pm. On the other hand, my current Urologist has good instinct, just not access to latest technology. Again, appreciate the thoughts.",

Question, delay current TRUS scheduled for Tuesday and consult with University, or go ahead with TRUS? I have all the info, decision rests with me. I may call the University tomorrow am, see how long they take for a consult and a biopsy appt.",
