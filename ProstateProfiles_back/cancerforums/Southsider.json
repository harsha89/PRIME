Sort of like when I was selling dress shirts and neckties in a department store. The price on the tag for a necktie might be $65, but 90% of the time there is a sale for at least 30-40% off and sometimes more, and the customer gets another 20% off for using their credit card.

Sort of like when I was selling dress shirts and neckties in a department store. The price on the tag for a necktie might be $65, but 90% of the time there is a sale for at least 30-40% off and sometimes more, and the customer gets another 20% off for using their credit card.

My PSA has been up and down, the last one was 3.5 this month, it was 4.2 in November 2013. The first urologist I saw was anxious to do robotic surgery, I slow walked it a bit when it seemed like I was ripping food from his children's mouths by declining it and saw another urologist last spring. The UPMC doc said he was cool with surgery if I wanted it, but I could also be active surveillance. As a devout procrastinator with a wee cancer, I thought it was a better move. Anyhoo, when I had the biopsy last January, no drugs were offered and none were asked for. It was a tad annoying, but not terribly long and less annoying than the dentist, less than 15 minutes. The UPMC guy told me he'll give me valium before the procedure. Are there different ways of doing prostate biopsy that will make this next one a lot worse than what I did last year? Should I turn down the medication, I've tolerated benzies pretty well in the past but I don't like being overmedicated particularly in the morning when this is coming down.",

We are worried but are putting our faith that we will tackle whatever comes head on. No one can really tell you at this point in time if the husband has cancer or not, that's what the biopsy is for. Its only suspicious at this point in time. He's really young to be a prostate cancer patient, although it is possible. The good news is that even if he has cancer, which is by no means certain, his PSA score is only modestly elevated and that would indicate that it is very unlikely to have spread and a cure would be possible.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by DjinTonic I would file this under Fridge Lightbulb Questions. In any case worrying is useless: you're fine (until you're not)! Or, as A.E. Newman said \"What, me worry?\" PC is a disease which is prevalent among an older population that often already has one foot in the grave. I remember driving my dad out to the urology office about 19 years ago for a PC appointment. He was 80 at that point and one of the young uns out there. If you combine that with fact that PC is often a slow mover, deferring treatment can often be a wise strategy. I met a man in a support group who was diagnosed at age 68 with Gleason 7 cancer and a PSA of 6. He turned around on his trip to the hospital to get brachytherapy and went back home. 15 years later, his PSA is 30 but he looks fine for a man in his 80's. Did he do the right thing? Who can say, his story isn't over.",

Can current imaging technology get clear image of prostate cancer and prostate with their clear \u201cboundary\u201d? I have the question because I never get exact size of my prostate cancer. What technology can measure exact size of the prostate cancer? Prostate cancer is usual many tumors, not just a single mass. That's why the standard treatments, radical prostatectomy and radiation protocols seek to remove or treat the entire organ. And that's one of the challenges that researchers are working on, focal therapies which will just treat and kill the tumor- which would theoretically mean less side effects for the patients.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by DjinTonic I would file this under Fridge Lightbulb Questions. In any case worrying is useless: you're fine (until you're not)! Or, as A.E. Newman said \"What, me worry?\" PC is a disease which is prevalent among an older population that often already has one foot in the grave. I remember driving my dad out to the urology office about 19 years ago for a PC appointment. He was 80 at that point and one of the young uns out there. If you combine that with fact that PC is often a slow mover, deferring treatment can often be a wise strategy. I met a man in a support group who was diagnosed at age 68 with Gleason 7 cancer and a PSA of 6. He turned around on his trip to the hospital to get brachytherapy and went back home. 15 years later, his PSA is 30 but he looks fine for a man in his 80's. Did he do the right thing? Who can say, his story isn't over.",

      "Content": "I suspect your doctor will say you just have chronic prostatitis. Prostatitis can be very difficult to eradicate, and many men suffer with it for many years. The facts that your PSA level is sensitive to antibiotics, and you have had higher than normal amounts of white blood cells and pus in your urine all seems indicative of infection. Prostate cancer is quite rare for someone in their 30's, only 1 in 10,000 men get it at such a tender age. Most men actually diagnosed with pc are asymptomatic when they get the word, a high PSA test and/or a positive DRE is the sign. Prostate cancer symptoms usually only start to appear when the disease is more advanced- which would indicate a PSA score a lot higher than what you're showing.",

Prostate cancer cells can be tricky to diagnose, and a lot of patients ask for a 2nd opinion on the slides, it costs about $250. Did you ask the surgeon how much experience he has? As I'm sure you know, radical prostatectomy- whether done with robotic assistance or through open surgery, is one of the most challenging operations out there.",

That's your future, I wouldn't worry about it.

Zero cub after radiation SR is a curative treatment, they don't perform it unless there is a pretty good chance it will work. Even if it doesn't, you stand a good chance of living for many, many years. Many prostate cancers are slow If it gets to the point that the cancer becomes hormone resistant, there are other new chemo and immunological treatments that can be done. The man playing the \"lennie brisco\" character from the Law & Order series played his entire run on the series under hormone treatment for pc before it became resistant and died. Considering you are about 70, under the worse case scenario you should probably be able to make it to 90 before you have to worry about hormone resistant pc, by that time you'll probably be dead of something else.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by ddvh The Dr. recommends skull biopsy and will notify us further on how to proceed. Initially, Dr. gave 3 options, surgery, outside radiation or seed radiation, any suggestions? (Sorry, I don't know all the terminology yet) How likely is it that PC can spread to the skull? If so, what treatment would it be? He has an appt. tomorrow with the radiation doctor/center to discuss options, but I think it will be really basic due to the uncertainty of the skull spread. Does anyone suggest getting a second opinion? If so, any recommendations in the ATL area? Your father really needs the full workup on this. Yes, PC can indeed spread to the skull, but his PSA score (although quite elevated) doesn't seem quite high enough as pc usually spreads to adjacently before it spreads to such a distance location. The skull lesion could easily indicate a co-morbidity, something else that isn't pc related. Wait until the biopsy comes back, and the doctors weigh in, it sounds like your father has a complex medical condition or set of conditions",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by ddvh The Dr. recommends skull biopsy and will notify us further on how to proceed. Initially, Dr. gave 3 options, surgery, outside radiation or seed radiation, any suggestions? (Sorry, I don't know all the terminology yet) How likely is it that PC can spread to the skull? If so, what treatment would it be? He has an appt. tomorrow with the radiation doctor/center to discuss options, but I think it will be really basic due to the uncertainty of the skull spread. Does anyone suggest getting a second opinion? If so, any recommendations in the ATL area? Your father really needs the full workup on this. Yes, PC can indeed spread to the skull, but his PSA score (although quite elevated) doesn't seem quite high enough as pc usually spreads to adjacently before it spreads to such a distance location. The skull lesion could easily indicate a co-morbidity, something else that isn't pc related. Wait until the biopsy comes back, and the doctors weigh in, it sounds like your father has a complex medical condition or set of conditions",

If the money isn't a factor with your stepdad, he should decide which of these two oncologists he has the most faith in their judgment regarding this.

Even though you got a bad score, it doesn't necessarily mean anything as you are significantly underneath the age bracket for the test.

A \u201crule out\u201d test, ExoDx Prostate (IntelliScore) is designed to more accurately predict whether a patient presenting for an initial biopsy does not have high-grade prostate cancer and, thus, could potentially avoid an initial biopsy and, instead, continue to be monitored. \"",

Zero cub after radiation SR is a curative treatment, they don't perform it unless there is a pretty good chance it will work.

Many prostate cancers are slow If it gets to the point that the cancer becomes hormone resistant, there are other new chemo and immunological treatments that can be done. The man playing the \"lennie brisco\" character from the Law & Order series played his entire run on the series under hormone treatment for pc before it became resistant and died. Considering you are about 70, under the worse case scenario you should probably be able to make it to 90 before you have to worry about hormone resistant pc, by that time you'll probably be dead of something else.",

Looking at these forums there seem to be more posts about RP then other forms, I have tried a couple times to find data but unsuccessful. Denis When I had my first consultation after being diagnosed 4 years ago, the doctor told me 70% of the patients go for surgery, 20% for radiation and 10% for surveillance. Intuitively, it sounds right. Urologists are the ones who did the biopsy and delivered the news to the patient. They get the first word in the discussion and they are surgeons by trade who believe in surgery. Second, the value of the stock Intuitive Surgical- the inventor and builder of the Davinci surgical suite- has been on a steady climb for years, hospitals are definitely buying the equipment and they want to use it. Radical prostatectomy is one of the most popular robotic surgeries out there.",

Sounds like a reasonable plan. There isn't usually a rush to act on this, and you usually can't anyhow. They have to wait at least 6 weeks after the biopsy for surgery anyhow. The next step is to hear what they have to tell you about the biopsy, and then, if you do have cancer, you can decide what response you need.",

      "Content": "The key statistic that you really need to look at with a surgeon is his experienced. If you have surgery, you want someone with at least 300-400 surgeries or more under their belt. Radical Prostatectomy , whether done in open fashion or with the robot, is one of the most technically challenging surgeries ordinarily done. And there is a learning curve. As far as the individual surgeon's rate of complications/cures, that's less important. In a group practice, the top surgeons often get the most difficult cases to work on. And those cases are often harder to get good results on.",

Radical Prostatectomy , whether done in open fashion or with the robot, is one of the most technically challenging surgeries ordinarily done. And there is a learning curve. As far as the individual surgeon's rate of complications/cures, that's less important. In a group practice, the top surgeons often get the most difficult cases to work on. And those cases are often harder to get good results on.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by FrankB Thanks for the special treatment! What confounds the urologist is that the DRE was so normal and that I have no symptoms at all. With a PSA that high, he would expect burning, pain, difficulty urinating, etc. but I have none of that. As I mentioned, I only found this while checking on cholesterol and glucose! My last PSA was ten years ago and that was a 1.3. To add to this, I take finesteride for hair and from what I've read that can falsely bring down a reading, so it might otherwise be even higher? A PSA score of 28 is often asymptomatic. There have been folks with scores in thousands that have walked around, presumably for years, never knowing about it or suspecting a high PSA score or cancer until they had a test. The scale is \"ng\" which is very , very wee. Finesteride does reduce PSA scores, a dosage of 5 mg given for BPH reduces it by about half. Although I think they usually give less for hair growth.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by Sw1218 when i told him i have a history of colon cancer in my family, he recommended if i decide to choose radiation, i should first have a colonoscopy and a genetics test to see if i have that gene. what are your thoughts on that, PCa brothers? I have not heard exactly that, but it is true that PC patients who do radiation treatment get a screening colonoscopy every 5 years, instead of 10 years usually recommended. The radiation guys do the best they can, but there will always been some radiation exposure to the lower digestive tract with prostate irradiation, and that does increase the chances of those cancers.",

I hope you aren't shy, you'll probably be operated in a \"stadium type\" OR so a lot of residents and medical students can see. This is something new and even some experienced surgeons will be in the stands figuring this is something they've got to see.",

It does save the patients time, they can complete cyberknifing within just 5 sessions instead of 40 or so, but it does have its own perils. If you think you want to do it, you'd probably want to be especially sure the doctor is really on the ball, as the radiation is a lot more powerful, and its not that much past experimental.",

      "Content": "Its really difficult to say. Its a statistically fact that African American men are diagnosed with pc more often than white guys. However, attributing it to their ethnicity is a real jump. I'd think we'd have to look at what the occurrence of PC is among blacks in other countries, take a look at black men who were raised by white people and compare them to the overall results before jumping to any conclusions. They tell me that asian men have a very low PC rate in Asia- but if they move here, they end up with a rate comparable to the rest of us. My guess is that it is more diet related than genetic.",

Once the surgeon removes it, it get wrapped up and shipped to the path lab to be sliced and diced. Your doctor will have a better idea of your gleason score , positive or negative margins, amount of disease, etc., once he sees the report on your total prostate.",

This is something new and even some experienced surgeons will be in the stands figuring this is something they've got to see.",

Generally speaking for AS, a G7 case isn't really considered to be that appropriate unless you are of advanced age or have other co-morbidities that make it more likely you'll pass of something else within 10 years or so. Of course, everyone's case is different, I'm not a medical professional so you'll definitely want to hear from the pecker checker in New York before you commit to what to do.",

I know if they found something the first time it didn't just go away but I am leaning towards another biopsy but if it turns out two in a row show nothing I am not sure if I should keep getting them.

Its a lot less invasive that the urologist shoving a cutting instrument into your keister for a biopsy, so its also a lot less likely to have side effects.

Any thoughts? thanks- dave That sounds like a pretty modest rate of increase. A 2nd biopsy is certainly a prudent course of action. PSA isn't specific to cancer, you know. Infections, age, BPH can cause PSA to rise.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by mamadeesix Is there any other reason for suspicious areas on an MRI than cancer? Dee Sure there are. MRI are interpreted, and there is plenty of room for discussion and different results. The good point with your husband is that his PSA score hasn't been moving for the last several years. That's good, even if he haas cancer, its likely to be a less aggressive strain",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by firemana However, he has a fairly low PSA of 2.28. My questions are: 1. even if the tumor grade is indeed aggressive (I am seeking a second opinion on the biopsy right now), does the low PSA value usually indicate bone metastasis has not happened yet? (or the other way round, that bone metastasis usually would cause a higher PSA?) Prostate cells create PSA, which is detected by the test. Bone metastasis are prostate cells that have spread to the bones, they create PSA. A high PSA score would indicate that the patient has a lot more prostate cells, and advanced cancer is a possible explanation that should be explored. A low PSA would indicate the opposite, and if your father had a less aggressive cancer, the doctors would have probably dispensed with the bone scan altogether. All in all, the low PSA doesn't guarantee anything 100%, but is a very hopeful sign.",

My question is : can my father choose another radiology clinic That really depends on your father's insurance coverage and whether he is able and willing to foot more of the bill if he switches to someone that might be \"out of network\". But of course, he can switch doctors for any reason or no reason. If your dad lives way out in the boonies, it can be a real hassle I'm sure as standard radiation treatment can require like 6 weeks of daily visits. I might be worthwhile to see if SBRT or \"cyber knife\" treatment is appropriate or available to him. That really reduces the number of visits to about half a dozen and could reduce the travel time and expense for him.",

A saturation biopsy is pretty much a major operation, you have to be put under for it. What do you think the saturation biopsy can tell you? I don't know, I'd ask the doctor. An MRI might point out something in you plumbing that's causing a rise in PSA and your cancer really is indolent. I'm not a doctor, by all means hear what he says.

A lot of infections are non-bacterial and aren't affected by antibiotics like cipro. I think your doctor is doing the right thing by you.

From the perspective of other surgery suitability, did your uro have you see a cardio doc? get a physical? meet with an anesthesiologist? Thanks! The steps taken to see if the cancer has already spread varies from patient to patient- depending on their PSA levels and gleason score. When I was assessed for a radical prostatectomy, I asked (my mum had a pet scan after she was diagnosed with lung ca) about scanning. The surgeon said it wasn't necessary in my case with my numbers. It will be different with your father The cardio tests aren't really to determine \"suitability\" for surgery, but are mostly for the anesthesiologist. I guess if the pre-surgery physical indicated really serious co-morbidities, it could preclude surgery entirely, but that's really not its purpose.",

Its not elevated, and a rise of 15% over 2 1/2 years isn't alarming at all. PSA isn't a test specific to Prostate Cancer, or even to the prostate. Many women have measurable PSA levels. Yes, at his age, he should probably get a physical every year. Stay on top of him, but this particular thing isn't a problem at this point in time.",

I\u2019m just so scared, sad and just losing sleep over this. Thank you all and wish you all the best. There are statistical compilations called the \"Partin tables\", which can give you an idea of whether or not the disease has spread- based upon other cases in the past. But you have to know the numbers. Prostate cancer moves pretty slowly, so it might not have spread and \"aggressive\" is sort of a flexible, subjective adjective so it really doesn't say anything definitive. The doctor may have used the term \"aggressive\" to try and light a fire under a reluctant patient that he really wants to get into treatment.",

I believe he has had a few tests to confirm the PSA levels, and I believe the biopsy is what he is having this week. As far as I'm aware, my family doesn't have a history of PC. Thank's for the reassurance. It may sound counterintuitive, but the fact that he has had urinary systems may be a positive one as far as cancer. It could be an alternative explanation for the high PSA numbers, which aren't particular to cancer (with men who haven't actually been treated for PC).",

PSA can increase or decrease due to infections, prostatitis, sexual activity, strenuous exercise and I'm sure there are other reasons. The use of the PSA in cancer screening merely gives a clinician an idea as to whether or not further steps should be taken to actually identify and diagnose PC. A movement of your PSA from 2.56 to 2.16 isn't likely to be that significant at all",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by Pratoman Yesterday\u2019s blood draw came back at .068. Just for context, my first detectable PSA first was in January 2017, which was 2 years post op and at that point it was .02. That was followed by .033, .033 (again), .046, .060, and now today\u2019s .068 (this last one was 2 1/2 months since last test, before that it was always 3-3 1/2 months. Now I have appointment with RO on Tuesday, who is going to tell me time to act, then August 3rd with surgeon Uro, who says don\u2019t do anything till .2, based on my pathology, unless velocity starts to ramp up. RO probably holds more weight with me at this point, but I am going to try and have them talk to each other. Try to relax, you have a lot of reason to be positive here. Your PSA score is still considerably under 0.1, you have a top flight surgeon who isn't that excited about it, your pathology report after surgery was fine, your genome report says its low risk. Hear out both doctors, make your best decision, and don't look back.",

      "Content": "A 20 fold increase in PSA score over a single year seems a lot more likely to be caused by an infection or other trauma to the urinary system than prostate cancer. Just because you had a negative DRE and no symptoms doesn't mean you don't have an infection. The urologist will probably order another PSA test and maybe give you a course of cipro to take first. If your PSA is still elevated, maybe an MRI, maybe go straight to a biopsy. Remember that the PSA test doesn't necessarily mean cancer, except for men who have already received treatment for prostate cancer",

Urologists are surgeons by trade, they believe in surgery and its livelihood. A lot to be said for surgery, particularly if you are still in your youth (under 60 in the world of prostate cancer) Radiation comes in different varieties , external beam and brachytherapy. Usually advised for guys over 70. Active surveillance is keeping an eye on your pc, delaying treatment. Probably not advisable for you unless you are over 80 or have co-morbidities that make really unlikely you will make it another 10 years.",

The book says that salvage radiation is considerably less successful once the PSA gets past 0.5. If the goal is a cure, this may be the patient's last chance. Of course, this guy also has a lot of co-morbidities, the question is how long does he have to live anyhow? Does he have long enough to have the PC come back and kill him or not?",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by FeatherBoy Hi stephenb, With a PSA record such as yours and the slow doubling time, I seriously tend to wonder why your RO is proposing aggressive treatment at this time. The book says that salvage radiation is considerably less successful once the PSA gets past 0.5. If the goal is a cure, this may be the patient's last chance. Of course, this guy also has a lot of co-morbidities, the question is how long does he have to live anyhow? Does he have long enough to have the PC come back and kill him or not?",

      "Content": "You might have cancer, but your urinary systems actually make a case that you might have other reasons for your disturbingly elevated PSA score. Most prostate cancers are asymptomatic at an early stage. Being fat, riding around all day in a car, can't be good for your urinary system, but neither are a cause for cancer. Prostate infections can cause PSA scores to rise, ditto for VD like gonorrhea or chlamydia can cause both your urinary symptoms as well as the PSA score. Good luck on your doctor visit, keep a positive attitude. There is a decent chance that you don't have cancer at all, and if you do, there is a good chance that the cancer is very curable.",

You are taking a LOT more than the recommended dose which will almost definitely reduce your PSA. Saw Palmetto is frequently used for symptoms of BPH, not Pca. You would do well to stop using 'natural alternatives' There is nothing out there that will do anything for Pca. I think even the recommended dosages of supplements can affect the PSA level, not just excessive dosages. At the very least, let the doctor know what you are on, so he can try and interpret the PSA numbers that you do generate. I agree that saw palmetto won't do anything for pc, but it could help other symptoms of bph that he might be suffering from.",

The OP's situation does call for attention, but I don't think waiting a couple of weeks is going to be a problem. The doctor's advice \"no *more* surveillance\" would indicate that there were previous positive biopsies, and the patient may have been AS for several years. Sometimes people forget, but most of the country is a couple of hours or more away from major medical centers, not everyone can see a couple of medical centers from their home as I can here.",

Thanks, Djin The price on this kind of test is really flexible.

      "Content": "Originally Posted by WifeinWorry I know its not so much what level the PSA is as to how much it jumps in a short period of time, correct? So if its 2.4 one month and next month jumps to 3.1, do they consider this alarming? So every month since maybe 5 months ago it has increased, but this one was the biggest jump. How do we consider what difference in numbers needs attention? The meaning of a jump in PSA is really variable, depending on whether its sustained, the patient is in or out of treatment and what treatment they have received, whether someone has even been diagnosed. If a doctor ordered the PSA tests, he's probably the best person to ask about its significance in your husbands case",

The OP's situation does call for attention, but I don't think waiting a couple of weeks is going to be a problem. The doctor's advice \"no *more* surveillance\" would indicate that there were previous positive biopsies, and the patient may have been AS for several years. Sometimes people forget, but most of the country is a couple of hours or more away from major medical centers, not everyone can see a couple of medical centers from their home as I can here.",

I can't tell anyone else what to do, but I made the decision to slow walk it, saw another urologist with a major medical center (UPMC) and have been on AS since. The key of course is to be actively surveilled, and you definitely should look to have another biopsy next year.

Thanks, Djin The price on this kind of test is really flexible. The company would like to get more, and they do need to get more from some of their patients to cover their costs in developing the protocol.

Focal therapies are pretty new in regards to prostate cancer, the doctors who devised the treatment can answer your question in regards to this. The problem with focal therapy- as opposed to treating the entire prostate as RT and surgery do- is making sure they take out all of the cancer. PC is usually not one tumor, but several small tumors. Being able to see all the tumors is the problem they face, so they can aim the laser and get it all. I guess you are indeed a \"candidate\" for the treatment, at least until the doctor doing it tells you otherwise.",

I can't tell anyone else what to do, but I made the decision to slow walk it, saw another urologist with a major medical center (UPMC) and have been on AS since. The key of course is to be actively surveilled, and you definitely should look to have another biopsy next year.

      "Content": "There are rare prostate cancers which do not produce PSA, and I guess is \"possible\" he could have it. But they are very rare, so try not to be worried about it, and listen to the biopsy results with a positive attitude expecting that the situation will be none too serious and in any event, something that can be treated or resolved on its own. BPH is very common, especially among older men, that's why you can't watch TV for more than 5 minutes without seeing a flomax ad. Its a natural process, the prostate grows over the years regardless of whether the man has pc or not. The prostate for a 20 yo man is the size of a walnut, for a 40 yo- a golf ball, for a 60 yo- a lemon, for a man of 80- a softball. BPH can be managed, I'm sure it will in your father's case.",

As far as taking medicine to pee, lots of men have that. Turn on the radio or TV for 30 minutes, you'll see at least a couple of ads for flomax or viagra or herbal supplements to get your plumbing in order. You aren't alone.",

      "Content": "Back pain can be caused by a lot of things, and so can urinary problems. But I really would doubt it would be prostate cancer. PC is quite uncommon for men of your age. Further, an ordinary prostate cancer would be creating a lot more than 1 ng of PSA if it was large enough to cause urinary and bone symptoms. The only way it would be possible for prostate cancer symptoms and such a low PSA is if you had a rare version of prostate cancer. It would be a real double rarity both because of your young age as well as a rare cancer, for PC to be your problem. I guess it would be technically possible, but very, very unlikely.",

I assume they can copy the slides and send out? Ron_G mentioned that G9 with low PSAs will need quick action, that make me even more anxious to get things rolling asap...

      "Content": "I think your doctor is giving you pretty sound advice. Only a biopsy can diagnose PC, an MRI might point out specific areas of concern in your prostate but can't say if you actually have cancer. Your PSA score is elevated and a cause of concern, and you could have PC, but it probably isn't the cause of your symptoms. Prostatitis is a difficult and frustrating problem, often recurs, and is often resistant to antibiotics, and can raise PSA. But it isn't cancer.",

I think they don't know, that's why they are doing the biopsy. But it would seem very unlikely indeed for it to be prostate cancer, as his PSA and gleason score really aren't indicative of metastatic disease. Its probably not cancer of any kind, but they'd like to be as sure as they can, especially before subjecting dad to curative treatments for prostate cancer.",

Im having pain all over body that has gotten worse all started in the last 8 month's I never met anyone that young with prostate cancer. Its certainly \"possible\" that someone could get PC in their 20's, and medical history does list a handful of men who actually did. But it is exceedingly rare. The average age for a Prostate Cancer diagnosis is 66. There are plenty of diseases that can cause the symptoms you describe. If its bothering you, go to a doctor and get checked out.",

Is he too old for surgery or is radiation a viable option? Thanks so much for your advice. Prostate cancer is usually indicated by a steady rise in PSA, not big fluctuations. No, he's not too old for surgery at all. But radiation is usually considered just a curative as surgery, if the biopsy is positive.",

      "Content": "in spite of the fact that you were positive for G6 prostate cancer in 20% of one core, your doctor feels ok with just doing AS at this point in time. That's certainly a legitimate opinion, even though there is a chance that somewhere down the line - maybe not that far down the line- you'll need treatment. If you are dissatisfied with this treatment plan as you seem, then you really need to get a 2nd opinion on this. The first urologist I went to was anxious to operate with a similar enough biopsy report. Personally, I would put a lot of weight to the opinion advising you to defer surgery. Urologists are surgeons by trade, and the radical prostatectomy is their bread and butter. They believe in surgery and have faith in their ability to perform it and believe it can help their patients. An opinion that you receive that is contrary to the doctor's mindset and philosophy as well as financial benefit, is one that should be taken very seriously. You should definitely look to make an appointment with another expert, based on your biopsy report, you certainly have time to do that.",

Is he too old for surgery or is radiation a viable option? Thanks so much for your advice. Prostate cancer is usually indicated by a steady rise in PSA, not big fluctuations. No, he's not too old for surgery at all. But radiation is usually considered just a curative as surgery, if the biopsy is positive.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by Sw1218 it seems to me as if he's still monitoring for cancer and not treating the inflammation which may bring down the PSA. why does my psa keep elevating? i'm glad it's not a 9 and i'm MOST HAPPY it's not cancer, but i feel if he treats the prostatitis or inflammation, then maybe my psa'll go down. i take saw palmetto 320mg. my symptoms are not unbearable, but i would feel much better if we could find a better way to bring down my psa. what are your thoughts? You said \"symptoms are not unbearable\", the question is what are your symptoms? An elevated PSA score is a sign, not a symptom at all. If that's what you are counting as a symptom, you are doing all you can. The doctor can give you antibiotics if he suspects bacterial prostatitis (that will reduce PSA score), or give you proscar or flomax if you have bph. Proscar will definitely reduce PSA scores, usually by half.",

Doctor recommended active surveillance. PSA in July, four months later, was 3.1. I was surprised by this, expecting it to be the same or higher, but not lower. He gave an explanation that I didn't totally understand. Anyone have experience with this occurrence, or knowledge of it? Thank you. (BTW, I like my doctor a lot; he is excellent). PSA isn't specifically a test for cancer, except in patients that have already had definitive treatment like prostatectomy or radiation. PSA can go up and down for various reasons unrelated to cancer, even if you have cancer. I had a PSA at 4.2 in Nov 13, 4.5 in August 14, 3.5 in February this year and this month 3.6.

The urologist is not to concerned, will test in 3 months. What do you guys think? Sounds like your doctor is fairly concerned, scheduling your PSA in 3 months instead of 6 months. PSA tests do fluctuate, figuring out the nadir of your PSA is a little bit different with radiation treatments as opposed to surgery patients that go for the \"Zero\" reading. Seems like a reasonable plan on the part of the doctor to see if your latest reading is a bit of an outlier and not indicative of cancer returning and progressing, before prescribing another round of radiation.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by TLDinMD Wow, what a process. I didn\u2019t realize how long it took from diagnosis to actually starting treatment. We met with the RO this week and the best course of treatment for my Dad is external radiation and hormone injections. He will get his first injection in January, wait one month then have gold markers placed in the prostate, 2 weeks later get CT scan and the little tattoo markers, then 2 weeks later start radiation. Holy hell! So we are talking end of March before he starts radiation. That's a known protocol, to give ADT in advance of the radiation treatment. Its called \"neoadjuvent hormone therapy\" and some patients have received this order of treatment for a number of years. The idea I think is to reduce the size of the prostate, which can make the radiation more effective, although you should certainly ask the doctor prescribing it for the reasons and details. Prostate Cancer is a marathon, most patients stick around a lot longer than folks with other cancers. It seems to be moving right along",

The gleason scores, and whether or not the margins are positive are the things they look at. If you get upgraded, its a probably. Otherwise, they'll probably just wait a few months, and use your PSA tests to determine if its needed.",

My Primary doctor thinks I may have a severe prostatitis, but has not done any exams on me for this, and suggested I go see a Urologist. I have an appointment with a Urologist tomorrow to do the rectal exam. . Prostate Cancer is quite rare for young guys and prostatitis is pretty common, I can see where your pcp would tilt a lot more in that direction. The worrying and anxiety is what's really killing you right now, maybe the doctor will give you some Miltowns when you go in tomorrow. You will not get a diagnosis of PC tomorrow, you know. Only a biopsy can make the diagnosis, if the urologist thinks PC is a possibility, you'll have to come back in a couple of weeks and it will probably be another week before the pathology report comes down. You have to get it together, this is going to take a little time.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by RAD1964 He has not been scheduled for a bone scan or any other follow-up test, including genetic, as his urologist does not think it necessary (his words). This puzzles me, as I have since learned that scans and genetic tests are imperative. My bottom line question is: how much time do we have to make a decision on treatment? Any thoughts you can share with me about time frames would be most appreciated. Thanks so much, CPG Due to fact that your husband's PSA score is only moderately elevated and the biopsy shows that he is an intermediate risk, the urologist probably thinks a bone scan is pointless. The husband's numbers make it very unlikely that there are metastases and even less likely that any could be detected by the test. PC is most usually slow growing. Usually the fastest they will operate on is 8 weeks after the biopsy- waiting for the prostate to settle down after that abuse. A Gleason score of 7 usually means treatment, especially for a such a young man. But I think you definitely have time to get additional opinions and look to make a decision several months down the line. If you decide on AS, you can always change your mind you know",

From all the sad stories I've read about awful side effects on these forums, avoiding treatment appears priceless. i was addressing the issue from the ins companies' point of view, side effects aren't their problem money is. i agree there is a lot to be said 4 avoiding treatments if u can",

Making a long story short after a biopsy(2 week's ago) my Gleason scores are three 6's and one 7. I decided AS was the right thing for me. My doctor did send my specimen out for Polaris testing . Maybe that'll change things. So, after all that I guess I'm here for support, guidance, or whatever. Thanks all for taking the time to read this. \"Its your prostate, your decision\", as Hall of Fame catcher Joe Torre likes to say on the radio. But most doctors would not recommend AS for someone as young as yourself and in good shape, with Gleason 7 cancer. I don't know about Polaris testing, but genome testing is a rapidly developing field, and that sounds like a good idea.",

That's clearly the problem with focal therapy, but one which improved imaging and more research into biological markers for disease will address over time. Proving the efficacy of FT is another problem. Giving FT to patients with medium to high risk disease could mean missing the boat as far as a cure for them, particularly as treating the whole prostate is proven effective. Giving FT to low risk patients might not prove a thing, even if its successful- as it may be an indolent disease not in need of being cured.",

( Radiation equipment and protocols have improved over the years, and they are more able to target the prostate with the beams. However, both radiation and surgery have similar side effects profiles, the difference is that you get the side effects up front with surgery and pay them more later with radiation. Since your husband is so young, the common wisdom is that surgery is usually more recommended. Older guys and guys in bad health- comorbidities- are recommended for radiation as they don't have as long to live to get all of the delayed action side effects.",

Biopsies sometimes do miss \"hot spots\" in the prostate with higher grade cancer. We know that because when men have radical prostatectomies they ship the organ to the pathology lab and a sizable percentage come back with Gleason Upgrades. Having repeated biopsies reduces the chances that hot spots will be missed. Prostate cancer generally moves pretty slowly, and you have a low PSA and a well differentiated Gleason grade, there is no reason to panic yet.",

This puzzles me, as I have since learned that scans and genetic tests are imperative. My bottom line question is: how much time do we have to make a decision on treatment? Any thoughts you can share with me about time frames would be most appreciated. Thanks so much, CPG Due to fact that your husband's PSA score is only moderately elevated and the biopsy shows that he is an intermediate risk, the urologist probably thinks a bone scan is pointless. The husband's numbers make it very unlikely that there are metastases and even less likely that any could be detected by the test. PC is most usually slow growing. Usually the fastest they will operate on is 8 weeks after the biopsy- waiting for the prostate to settle down after that abuse. A Gleason score of 7 usually means treatment, especially for a such a young man. But I think you definitely have time to get additional opinions and look to make a decision several months down the line. If you decide on AS, you can always change your mind you know",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by RAD1964 He has not been scheduled for a bone scan or any other follow-up test, including genetic, as his urologist does not think it necessary (his words). This puzzles me, as I have since learned that scans and genetic tests are imperative. My bottom line question is: how much time do we have to make a decision on treatment? Any thoughts you can share with me about time frames would be most appreciated. Thanks so much, CPG Due to fact that your husband's PSA score is only moderately elevated and the biopsy shows that he is an intermediate risk, the urologist probably thinks a bone scan is pointless. The husband's numbers make it very unlikely that there are metastases and even less likely that any could be detected by the test. PC is most usually slow growing. Usually the fastest they will operate on is 8 weeks after the biopsy- waiting for the prostate to settle down after that abuse. A Gleason score of 7 usually means treatment, especially for a such a young man. But I think you definitely have time to get additional opinions and look to make a decision several months down the line. If you decide on AS, you can always change your mind you know",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by Another I have a question. Radiation is suppose to kill the cancer cells, because they are by nature weaker cells, and spare the healthy cells. What stops the radiate prostate from continuing to produce cancer cells? In radiation treatment for prostate cancer, the whole prostate is treated- not just the tumor cells. The goal of the radiologists is to target the treatment just on that organ, and to avoid having it hit other organs and structures nearby.",

It isn't a very long procedure, they don't have mirrors in the room so you can't see them doing it, and I had it 3 times no problem and I turned down the valium. Getting serious anesthesia does increase the risk, they don't want you getting a bad reaction. If I were you, I'd think about just getting it done. Will they give you a valium instead of propofol without this special screening?",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by Scott Howard I go to the bathroom mostly one time a night but sometimes twice. I have noticed that I go more often lately and it is more urgent. The big jump in PSA is what really concerns me. I have read that prostatitis could elevate the PSA so I have my fingers crossed. Anyway thanks for letting me air my concerns. After reading many posts I see there are many knowledgeable and caring people on this forum. Oh, I have a very caring and helpful wife to help me through anything that comes our way. She tells me not to get to worried until we get more information. Scott It may seem counterintuitive but the fact that you have prostate symptoms is actually a good omen that the rise in PSA scores is caused by prostatitis or BPH instead of cancer. Most prostate cancers don't cause symptoms until later, and prostatitis is perfectly capable of raising your PSA score. Try not to worry about it, there is a good chance that you don't have PC at all, and if you were to have it, there is an excellent chance you'll have a curative case.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by RAD1964 He has not been scheduled for a bone scan or any other follow-up test, including genetic, as his urologist does not think it necessary (his words). This puzzles me, as I have since learned that scans and genetic tests are imperative. My bottom line question is: how much time do we have to make a decision on treatment? Any thoughts you can share with me about time frames would be most appreciated. Thanks so much, CPG Due to fact that your husband's PSA score is only moderately elevated and the biopsy shows that he is an intermediate risk, the urologist probably thinks a bone scan is pointless. The husband's numbers make it very unlikely that there are metastases and even less likely that any could be detected by the test. PC is most usually slow growing. Usually the fastest they will operate on is 8 weeks after the biopsy- waiting for the prostate to settle down after that abuse. A Gleason score of 7 usually means treatment, especially for a such a young man. But I think you definitely have time to get additional opinions and look to make a decision several months down the line. If you decide on AS, you can always change your mind you know",

Although the date of the article was 2/19/15, the period studied was 2004-2007. The use of robotic surgery in the last 8 years -- AFTER this study was completed in 2007 -- has exploded in popularity. I would be interested in more up-to-date stats which, I feel certain, will show robotic surgery as the most utilized primary treatment now. The survey statistics were for all pc patients. A large number of patients are older or suffer from comorbidities who aren't recommended for surgery. Further, a good proportion of patients already have cancer at diagnosis which has spread and surgery isn't curative and usually not recommended. If there was a breakdown of stats and just those patients who were 65 or under and there was no likely spread of disease, they would be different.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by doubleH Hello forum, I was diagnosed with prostate cancer last October. In the biopsy, 2 of 12 cores were positive. The highest Gleason score was 3 + 3. Overall prostatic tissue involvement was 1.7%. The stage is T1c. Now the month before the biopsy, my PSA was 7.4. But in December, my PSA went up to 12.9. What could this mean? Does this mean that it is very likely that the biopsy in October missed a larger/more serious lesion? Anything is \"possible\" of course, and your doctor will be following up with you on this I'm sure. But it isn't time to panic at all. PSA isn't specific to prostate cancer for men who haven't been treated for it. It could have just as easily been caused by an infection or other irritation to the prostate- as sometimes happens when you have a prostate biopsy. 12 is a pretty high score, but not so high it couldn't be caused by something other than aggressive cancer.",

My Primary doctor thinks I may have a severe prostatitis, but has not done any exams on me for this, and suggested I go see a Urologist. I have an appointment with a Urologist tomorrow to do the rectal exam. . Prostate Cancer is quite rare for young guys and prostatitis is pretty common, I can see where your pcp would tilt a lot more in that direction. The worrying and anxiety is what's really killing you right now, maybe the doctor will give you some Miltowns when you go in tomorrow. You will not get a diagnosis of PC tomorrow, you know. Only a biopsy can make the diagnosis, if the urologist thinks PC is a possibility, you'll have to come back in a couple of weeks and it will probably be another week before the pathology report comes down. You have to get it together, this is going to take a little time.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by jjadus Hi, My PSA is a 4 and my urologist wants to do a ultrasound guided prostate biopsy. I have been diagnosed with carcinoma in situ in my bladder and a digital rectal exam revealed a bump on my prostate about a month ago. Did a series of 6 BCG treatments and a follow-up of 3 BCG treatments 2 months ago. Also had a TURP and cytology 3 months ago. So I'm wondering if a ultrasound guided prostate biopsy is necessary at this time or is the safe to wait to see if the PSA levels are reduced. Thanks Joe All of the cytoscopes, BCG treatments and TURP, sounds like it could easily raise your PSA- and its really only slightly elevated for a man in his 70's. Needless to say, ask your doctor on this, but it would seem like the biopsy can wait. Because of your bladder condition, maybe its really needed right away, I wouldn't know. Give the doc a call right away, so he can fill your slot with another contestant, if you can put it off.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by SamPJ We have PSA test tomorrow. Is this stage IV? Is it curable? What are the next steps for us? Stage IV prostate cancer is not curable, but is definitely treatable with hormone therapy and new chemo agents coming out. Until there is a biopsy, its premature to say that it is prostate cancer. From your description, it doesn't sound that typical for PC. Usually prostate cancer presents as many multiple tumors, not a single large mass like your father has. In your dad's immediate future , a biopsy and bone scans are like right ahead. Ordinarily, stage IV Prostate cancer metastasizes to the bones.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by jjadus Hi, My PSA is a 4 and my urologist wants to do a ultrasound guided prostate biopsy. I have been diagnosed with carcinoma in situ in my bladder and a digital rectal exam revealed a bump on my prostate about a month ago. Did a series of 6 BCG treatments and a follow-up of 3 BCG treatments 2 months ago. Also had a TURP and cytology 3 months ago. So I'm wondering if a ultrasound guided prostate biopsy is necessary at this time or is the safe to wait to see if the PSA levels are reduced. Thanks Joe All of the cytoscopes, BCG treatments and TURP, sounds like it could easily raise your PSA- and its really only slightly elevated for a man in his 70's. Needless to say, ask your doctor on this, but it would seem like the biopsy can wait. Because of your bladder condition, maybe its really needed right away, I wouldn't know. Give the doc a call right away, so he can fill your slot with another contestant, if you can put it off.",

That's clearly the problem with focal therapy, but one which improved imaging and more research into biological markers for disease will address over time. Proving the efficacy of FT is another problem. Giving FT to patients with medium to high risk disease could mean missing the boat as far as a cure for them, particularly as treating the whole prostate is proven effective. Giving FT to low risk patients might not prove a thing, even if its successful- as it may be an indolent disease not in need of being cured.",

Gleason 9 cancer is definitely curable.

The main thing now is that they will probably line him up with radiation treatments as soon as he is healed from the surgery, and be aggressive with this.

      "Content": "PSA stands for \"prostate specific antigen\", its a chemical that is released by only prostate cells. The test was originally designed for men who have already had prostatectomy. For those guys, the test should indicate a goose egg, they have no prostate, thus no prostate cells to create PSA. If they got a score , it means that cancerous prostate cells are creating PSA. The use of PSA for screening came afterwards. If you get a high or rapidly increasing score, the matter needs to be checked out further. BPH, prostatitis, other injury or trauma to the urinary tract can cause PSA scores to rise, sometimes dramatically. The idea of a screening PSA test result is to check it out if it looks out of sorts. Only a biopsy can definitlvely diagnose Prostate Cancer",

( Radiation equipment and protocols have improved over the years, and they are more able to target the prostate with the beams. However, both radiation and surgery have similar side effects profiles, the difference is that you get the side effects up front with surgery and pay them more later with radiation. Since your husband is so young, the common wisdom is that surgery is usually more recommended. Older guys and guys in bad health- comorbidities- are recommended for radiation as they don't have as long to live to get all of the delayed action side effects.",

      "Content": "PSA stands for \"prostate specific antigen\", its a chemical that is released by only prostate cells. The test was originally designed for men who have already had prostatectomy. For those guys, the test should indicate a goose egg, they have no prostate, thus no prostate cells to create PSA. If they got a score , it means that cancerous prostate cells are creating PSA. The use of PSA for screening came afterwards. If you get a high or rapidly increasing score, the matter needs to be checked out further. BPH, prostatitis, other injury or trauma to the urinary tract can cause PSA scores to rise, sometimes dramatically. The idea of a screening PSA test result is to check it out if it looks out of sorts. Only a biopsy can definitlvely diagnose Prostate Cancer",

      "Content": "Active Surveillance and deferring treatment is certainly a possibility in your situation. But the key is to still follow up, with PSA testing and additional biopsies. Biopsies sometimes do miss \"hot spots\" in the prostate with higher grade cancer. We know that because when men have radical prostatectomies they ship the organ to the pathology lab and a sizable percentage come back with Gleason Upgrades. Having repeated biopsies reduces the chances that hot spots will be missed. Prostate cancer generally moves pretty slowly, and you have a low PSA and a well differentiated Gleason grade, there is no reason to panic yet.",

This is taken directly from the diagnostic sheet. A. Prostate, Right Lateral Apex, Core Biopsy - Adenocarcinoma of the Prostate, Gleason Score 4+3=7, involving one of one core (90%, 12MM) - Intraductal Spread of Invasive Carcinoma \"intraductal\" carcinoma is a bit more difficult of a problem than the usual kinds of PC. Being at a top flight academic medical center is a positivity as they've see it before, as opposed to smaller, community hospital or limited practices. Personally, I have a lot of confidence in UPMC, but by all means seek a second opinion. Sounds like he has co-morbidities affecting him as well as pc.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by Scott Howard I go to the bathroom mostly one time a night but sometimes twice. I have noticed that I go more often lately and it is more urgent. The big jump in PSA is what really concerns me. I have read that prostatitis could elevate the PSA so I have my fingers crossed. Anyway thanks for letting me air my concerns. After reading many posts I see there are many knowledgeable and caring people on this forum. Oh, I have a very caring and helpful wife to help me through anything that comes our way. She tells me not to get to worried until we get more information. Scott It may seem counterintuitive but the fact that you have prostate symptoms is actually a good omen that the rise in PSA scores is caused by prostatitis or BPH instead of cancer. Most prostate cancers don't cause symptoms until later, and prostatitis is perfectly capable of raising your PSA score. Try not to worry about it, there is a good chance that you don't have PC at all, and if you were to have it, there is an excellent chance you'll have a curative case.",

I know that the Gleason score is on the very high end which isn't good, but I'm confused by the PSA level. With the PSA being on the lower end is there some hope that this could still be localized? Or doesn't that matter with such a high Gleason score? There is definitely a lot of hope that the disease is organ confined, according to the Partin tables , it is most likely still contained. http://urology.jhu.edu/support/partinTables.php",

This is taken directly from the diagnostic sheet. A. Prostate, Right Lateral Apex, Core Biopsy - Adenocarcinoma of the Prostate, Gleason Score 4+3=7, involving one of one core (90%, 12MM) - Intraductal Spread of Invasive Carcinoma \"intraductal\" carcinoma is a bit more difficult of a problem than the usual kinds of PC. Being at a top flight academic medical center is a positivity as they've see it before, as opposed to smaller, community hospital or limited practices. Personally, I have a lot of confidence in UPMC, but by all means seek a second opinion. Sounds like he has co-morbidities affecting him as well as pc.",

I would be interested in more up-to-date stats which, I feel certain, will show robotic surgery as the most utilized primary treatment now. The survey statistics were for all pc patients. A large number of patients are older or suffer from comorbidities who aren't recommended for surgery. Further, a good proportion of patients already have cancer at diagnosis which has spread and surgery isn't curative and usually not recommended. If there was a breakdown of stats and just those patients who were 65 or under and there was no likely spread of disease, they would be different.",

Does this mean that it is very likely that the biopsy in October missed a larger/more serious lesion? Anything is \"possible\" of course, and your doctor will be following up with you on this I'm sure. But it isn't time to panic at all. PSA isn't specific to prostate cancer for men who haven't been treated for it. It could have just as easily been caused by an infection or other irritation to the prostate- as sometimes happens when you have a prostate biopsy. 12 is a pretty high score, but not so high it couldn't be caused by something other than aggressive cancer.",

Does that sound right? Now that you've had prostatectomy , the hope is that he got it all before it could spread, If the PSA number starts going back up, they may try a course of salvage radiation. If that doesn't work, it means you have metastatic disease which can be controlled but not cured.",

If you did happen to have pc, tumors large enough to cause symptoms would create a lot more PSA than a reading of 2.5. There is no connection between the two. Hemorrhoids and edema in the legs are not typical symptoms of PC. I am not a doctor, but due to your age, its a lot more likely that your elevated PSA is due to prostatitis than cancer. The PSA is not a specific test for cancer, except for those men who have already had treatment for prostate cancer.",

The assistant takes the blood pressure, the doctor comes in and examines the patient including DRE if appropriate, the doctors lets the assistant know what blood tests were needed, and they come back in for the blood draw. Doing the DRE *after* the blood draw would force a change in protocol.",

If anyone has any advice or can give me more information on the realities of aggressive prostate cancer, I would appreciate it. I'm just at a loss. Thank you. There is plenty of hope. Gleason 9 cancer is definitely curable. The fact that they gave him a radical prostatectomy means the doctor believed the cancer is confined to the prostate and the fact that the lymph nodes are negative is a point of positivity. The main thing now is that they will probably line him up with radiation treatments as soon as he is healed from the surgery, and be aggressive with this. It is definitely higher risk, but it can also be cured.",

You're PSA score is really .006, that's what the lab said a couple of times, no reason to doubt them. It seems like the treatment that you were given in 2017- Salvage RT and adjuvant ADT- is designed to hopefully cure you. ADT treatment definitely does suppress PSA scores. Once he takes you off of ADT, your PSA score will probably rise somewhat from its current levels. Not that high if you are cured, but somewhat.

      "Content": "Originally Posted by MK44 Hi all. I am going to share my story so far here, and ask if anyone else has experienced similar things (as a younger person or otherwise). Any advice would be appreciated. Earlier this week I called the surgery and was told that everything was normal, there would be no further action needed, and I could visit again in the future if there were any more problems. I asked for a print of the results, which I wanted to keep as a record. However my heart sunk a bit when I saw that PSA was 3.7, which I know to be fairly unusual for someone of my age. It seems the theoretical cut off is 4 for PSA, and my GP has acted in line with that. I have a background in healthcare and I recognised that the other tests were indeed quite normal. Obviously the worry is that my symptoms, which continue as of today, plus the PSA score, indicates an more serious unwanted problem. I know that my fathers PSA reached 7-8 just before he was diagnosed. Then again I also know that I am not a man of 66.... Anyone else have experience approaching doctors in this sort of situation? I had a few episodes of prostatitis as a youngun and it isn't pleasant. You should note a few things. The PSA test is not particular to cancer, infections, enlarged prostates can cause an elevated score too. PC is exceedingly rare among guys of your age. Further, prostate cancer in its early stage is almost always completely asymptomatic. Your PSA score is elevated, but only modestly. A prostate tumor big enough to actually cause symptoms would almost certainly create a lot more PSA than a 3.7 reading would indicate. I think the doctors are giving you very reasonable advice",

I guess I'm OK for now but those atypical cells still concern me. Your numbers look good, 4.2 PSA isn't even considered elevated for a man of your age, and a healthy enough Free PSA score.

      "Content": "Originally Posted by John1966 I My first thought is to seek a biopsy ASAP and then treat aggressively. Is there a downside to haveing a biopsy? Or more than one over a course of time? And does all treatment lead to impotence? . There sure are downsides to having a biopsy, there is definitely a possibility of a serious infection and some patients really find them painful ( although I didn't) PSA scores are not specific to prostate cancer, prostatitis or other irritation to the urinary tract can cause the score to rise as well. The conservative approach of doing another PSA test a couple of months down the line has a lot to be said for it. That being said, with a PSA score over 4, if you have good insurance, you should be able to find a urologist to do the biopsy. But a lot of people have health anxiety, and a biopsy might actually fuel that. False negatives are possible, additional tests, worrying about the pathology reports. If you really have health anxiety, a biopsy could make it worse",

The only way they can really know how large your prostate tumors are is to cut it out and slice and dice it. Prostate cancer is a slow mover, and your PSA is only modestly elevated. No one can say for sure how long you have to work, but you certainly would seem to have time to get a 2nd opinion and maybe see a radiation man for that possible treatment plan. Prostatectomy is one of the most technically challenging surgeries commonly done for surgeons-whether done robotically or open, you will definitely want to chat with the surgeon next week about his experience. You'll want someone with at least hundreds of these operations under their belt if not thousands.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by MK44 Hi all. I am going to share my story so far here, and ask if anyone else has experienced similar things (as a younger person or otherwise). Any advice would be appreciated. Earlier this week I called the surgery and was told that everything was normal, there would be no further action needed, and I could visit again in the future if there were any more problems. I asked for a print of the results, which I wanted to keep as a record. However my heart sunk a bit when I saw that PSA was 3.7, which I know to be fairly unusual for someone of my age. It seems the theoretical cut off is 4 for PSA, and my GP has acted in line with that. I have a background in healthcare and I recognised that the other tests were indeed quite normal. Obviously the worry is that my symptoms, which continue as of today, plus the PSA score, indicates an more serious unwanted problem. I know that my fathers PSA reached 7-8 just before he was diagnosed. Then again I also know that I am not a man of 66.... Anyone else have experience approaching doctors in this sort of situation? I had a few episodes of prostatitis as a youngun and it isn't pleasant. You should note a few things. The PSA test is not particular to cancer, infections, enlarged prostates can cause an elevated score too. PC is exceedingly rare among guys of your age. Further, prostate cancer in its early stage is almost always completely asymptomatic. Your PSA score is elevated, but only modestly. A prostate tumor big enough to actually cause symptoms would almost certainly create a lot more PSA than a 3.7 reading would indicate. I think the doctors are giving you very reasonable advice",

Theoretically, if all of your cancer is removed with the surgery, it shouldn't be a problem. But they really can't be that certain. Suppose just a small amount of cancer escaped the prostate. It might stay indolent indefinitely for the rest of your life and not be a problem. But if fed testosterone, it might grow and cause problems perhaps even enough to kill you dead.

The established prostate protocols-radiation and surgery- involve treating the whole prostate, protocols like Dr. Sperling's are pretty new and not entirely proven. The problem with focal treatment is the problem with imaging. Very difficult to really get a clear pics that will distinguish diseased from healthy parts of the prostate. There isn't usually just 1 prostate tumor, but a dozen or more small ones is typical. Focal treatment might work, but it isn't a proven treatment plan yet",

Theoretically, if all of your cancer is removed with the surgery, it shouldn't be a problem. But they really can't be that certain. Suppose just a small amount of cancer escaped the prostate. It might stay indolent indefinitely for the rest of your life and not be a problem. But if fed testosterone, it might grow and cause problems perhaps even enough to kill you dead. In the future, I think that research will provide more info on this, but right now, its better to be safe.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by 35coupe I know this question has been asked thousand times but are any of you taking a supplement that you think is helping with your prostate. Like saw palmetto, etc. Now if you do a search you will find a thread where I was taking a pomegranate pill but later read that that could rise the PSA number so I stopped. Now, I have not been diagnosed with PC yet but I probably have it based on a biopsy that I had which found atypical cell and a PSA of 5.9. I will be 74 in June. So are there any magic pills out there. The problem with taking supplements is they might really change your PSA scores without changing any underlying disease, making these tests less useful to the physician. It could be like taking the \"check engine\" light bulb out of your dashboard on your car. Not really unhealthful per se, but it could possibly delay an early warning to a bad report. If you do decide to take a supplement, at least make a record and tell your doctor exactly what you are doing on that end.",

I assumed it was a UC flare (I have Ulcerative Colitis), I started smoking cigarettes again and the symptoms went away in two days. Less than a week after the symptoms subsided I had a blood draw. PSA was 14.4!!! I am scared $hitless and my follow up with my Dr isnt for another two weeks (he's away for vacation). Could I have prostatitis? Hope you're feeling better. But remember that any kind of traumatic event to your lower regions can cause a rise in the PSA score. Riding a bicycle,sexual relations, biopsies and other medical procedures, as well as infections can cause a rise. The non-urinary ailments you have dealt with seem to be the most like reason for your spike instead of prostate cancer.",

However, I fully expected the result to be negative. What can I say, I'm a cup half full kind of guy. I don't think I would have gone back to the urologist. I was first referred to the urologist at age 51, several years before that because my PSA was at 3 after an increase. The doctor did not do a biopsy, but instead rescheduled me for 6 months and a new PSA test. After I got the PSA results and saw they were a 2, I cancelled the urology appointment. I didn't have a problem getting a biopsy, I am cool with a certain amount of testing, I wouldn't have continued on without a positive test result.",

Its really uncertain at this point in time whether he will even need salvage RT, PSA scores are fluctuating for him. But Salvage RT is prescribed to cure, to mop up after RP, and effect a permanent cure. If this treatment is prescribed for him, that will be the realistic goal, and you have to think positive, the doctors presumably know what they are doing. But even if salvage RT is prescribed and doesn't work, doesn't mean that he doesn't have many more years. There are ways to manage Stage 4 PC that can extend people's lives for many years. Particularly in your father's case, where his PSA looks like its really rising slowly, it would seem more likely that if he dies within 5 years or 15, it will be from something other than PC.",

His PSA level is only moderately elevated, and the pathology report on his biopsy shows only an intermediate risk and not any atypical kinds of prostate cancer. With that profile of prostate cancer, there is really very little chance of anything appearing on a bone scan or pet scan. A cancer big enough to cause pain and to have metastasized, would almost undoubtably create a lot more PSA.",

When I was in my late 30's, early 40's, I had burning urination and I was given antibiotics like Proloprim, and penicillin. I don't know if it worked, but my symptoms went away. Some people suffer more, and some people have asymptomatic prostatitis as well. If your biopsy is negative, that's good. But unless they can push your PSA score down with antibiotics, they will be really interested in doing another biopsy or at least an MRI, even with a negative biopsy. A TRUS biopsy has maybe a 30% chance of a false negative.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by Firemedic54 My Urologist has suggested Davinci surgery as really the only option. I understand the Gleason of 6 is a favorable dx. I also believe a 3+3 is in my favor. How do they come up with the 3+3 as opposed to a 4+2?. Prostate cancer cells are graded from 1 to 5, depending on how irregular and aggressive they seem to the pathologist. 3+3 means that the 1st and 2nd most common patterns of cancer cells were both graded as \"3\"'s. 3 is effectively the lowest grade that they assign in the modern era, so 3+3 would indicate a lower risk diagnosis. I don't think that 4+2 is a diagnosis that's given by many doctors, but \"4\" indicates a moderately aggressive disease with at least some of the cells in your prostate and would make it a significantly risker disease situation. You should definitely get a second opinion on your diagnosis as well as the pathology report. Urologists are surgeons by trade, they are naturally more inclined to believe in and recommend surgery.",

      "Content": "Sounds like an excessive delay for biopsy results. The first biopsy I had, it took 2 weeks but they shipped off the samples to a path lab in Irving Texas (from Pittsburgh). It took less than a week for my 2 subsequent biopsies as the pathology lab was in the same building as the test.

      "Content": "Originally Posted by Firemedic54 My Urologist has suggested Davinci surgery as really the only option. I understand the Gleason of 6 is a favorable dx. I also believe a 3+3 is in my favor. How do they come up with the 3+3 as opposed to a 4+2?. Prostate cancer cells are graded from 1 to 5, depending on how irregular and aggressive they seem to the pathologist. 3+3 means that the 1st and 2nd most common patterns of cancer cells were both graded as \"3\"'s. 3 is effectively the lowest grade that they assign in the modern era, so 3+3 would indicate a lower risk diagnosis. I don't think that 4+2 is a diagnosis that's given by many doctors, but \"4\" indicates a moderately aggressive disease with at least some of the cells in your prostate and would make it a significantly risker disease situation. You should definitely get a second opinion on your diagnosis as well as the pathology report. Urologists are surgeons by trade, they are naturally more inclined to believe in and recommend surgery.",

      "Content": "This is a matter of dispute among the learned scholars of the urology profession- whether to commence hormone treatments immediately or how long to wait. Dr. Patrick Walsh covers this dispute in his book, and suggests that some cancers aren't growing that fast, and that results are no worse among patients who wait for ADT than those who get it immediately. There are other doctors that apparently disagree with Walsh on this. \"So far, there has been no convincing scientific evidence to prove that early hormonal therapy prolongs life. In chapter 10, we talked about the Johns Hopkins study that followed men who had an elevated PSA level after radical prostatectomy. We found that, on average, it took eight years for these men to develop metastases in the bones. We also developed a means of predicting when metastases may show up, using the Gleason score on the radical prostatectomy specimen (whether it was more or less than , the time after radical prostatectomy when the PSA level first increased (whether it was more or less than two years), and how long it took for the PSA level to double (whether it was more or less than ten months). Using this information, a man can quickly determine his risk of developing metastatic disease. In one of the most common scenarios, a man with Gleason 7 disease who developed a PSA level elevation more than two years after surgery who had a PSA doubling time longer than ten months had an 82 percent likelihood of being metastasis-free at seven years. On the other hand, if the PSA had gone up within the first two years and the PSA doubling time was less than ten months, then the likelihood of freedom from metastatic disease at seven years would be only 15 percent. This information can tell men how long it will be before they actually need hormones - if they ever do. Why should they subject themselves to these serious side effects if they don't have to, and if there is no convincing scientific reason to do so? Whether a man is treated with hormonal therapy immediately, as soon as the diagnosis of advanced disease is made, or his doctor waits until the man has signs of progression and then begins treatment, we believe - and study after study proves-that survival is exactly the same. There is no compelling evidence that any kind of hormonal therapy works better earlier than later, when a man begins experiencing symptoms such as urinary obstruction or has a positive bane scan. And yet, it's highly unlikely that a man who is symptom-free (also called asymptomatic) is going to feel any better once he has been deprived of his normal hormones. Again, the cancer cells that ultimately prove fatal in prostate cancer are the hormone-insensitive cells. They keep right on growing, unaffected by hormonal therapy. To these cells, whether hormonal therapy comes earlier or later does not matter. For an asymptomatic man, early hormonal therapy means going from feeling fine and normal to experiencing hot flashes; loss of libido and the ability to have an erection; weight gain; changes in muscle mass, skin, and hair growth; and the subtle changes in personality that accompany the loss of male hormones. As we discussed earlier, the long-term effects of hormonal therapy can include osteoporosis, loss of bone density, leaving bones more brittle and easy to break and decreases in mental acuity. What's the point of going through this early when, ultimately, you could achieve exactly the same benefit if you wait to start hormonal therapy until there is evidence of disease progression? The idea of early hormonal therapy appeals to many men because it's doing something rather than nothing. Many doctors, too, promote a proactive approach, telling their patients that this will delay progression of the disease. Actually, it takes a lot of time for a doctor to convince a man not to start early hormonal therapy - and unfortunately, many doctors don't have very much time to spend with their patients. If you want to attack the cancer aggressively, don't pin all your hopes on hormones. Instead, read the section below on non hormonal approaches, and consider enrolling yourself in a clinical trial - there are many - aimed at killing the cancer cells that hormonal therapy can't touch\".",

When I was in my late 30's, early 40's, I had burning urination and I was given antibiotics like Proloprim, and penicillin. I don't know if it worked, but my symptoms went away. Some people suffer more, and some people have asymptomatic prostatitis as well. If your biopsy is negative, that's good.

What's the point of going through this early when, ultimately, you could achieve exactly the same benefit if you wait to start hormonal therapy until there is evidence of disease progression? The idea of early hormonal therapy appeals to many men because it's doing something rather than nothing. Many doctors, too, promote a proactive approach, telling their patients that this will delay progression of the disease. Actually, it takes a lot of time for a doctor to convince a man not to start early hormonal therapy - and unfortunately, many doctors don't have very much time to spend with their patients. If you want to attack the cancer aggressively, don't pin all your hopes on hormones. Instead, read the section below on non hormonal approaches, and consider enrolling yourself in a clinical trial - there are many - aimed at killing the cancer cells that hormonal therapy can't touch\".",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by Lostcause My doctors have told me my prostate cancer has spread to my bones. Specifically my sternum, ribs, lower lumbar region and left femur. They refuse to tell me how grim my prognosis is. Instead I get this \"I've had many patients live for years even though it has spread to their bones\". Are the just giving me BS. You can not only live for many years, you can many productive years in spite of having metastatic prostate cancer. The man who played Briscoe on the Law and Order program did almost his entire stint on that program with stage 4 pc. Most people respond to effective treatments for the disease, the only question is how long will the treatments be effective. [REFERENCE TO ANOTHER PC FORUM DELETED PER FORUM RULES] IN PARAPHRASE TO WHAT WAS SAID -- There are a lot of people that are living with pc for very long periods of time",
