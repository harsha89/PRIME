      "Content": "Originally Posted by Michael F Since you are 10 years post RP, it is not very likely that recurrence is underway. Except in the case of exceptions. Months after two leading oncologists told me I may be cured (8 yrs post-RRP w/PSA < 0.100 and doubling time > 30 months) because PSA curves seldom change significantly, my PSA took off like a Saturn V rocket. Same lab, same test equipment and protocol, but 8 quarterly PSAs in a row now show a straight line on semilog paper @ PSA DT = 3.5 months. IOW, within one quarter my PSA DT jumped from 2.5 years (implicating mets by the age of 150 or so) to 100 days (mets in 2016). CRAP! That's next year! I had to change some plans, including tests, treatment options, timing, and ... you know ... my real life outside this cancer \"stuff\". Originally Posted by Michael F if the all PSAs were done with the same assay, there is NO statistical, clinical or analytical difference between 0.01 and 0.004 ng/ml! Both are considered to be \"0\" Period. The End! I agree, but the use of ultrasensitive tests is an individual call, IMO. I LIKED mine because they ultimately gave me useful warning when my tumor behavior (PSA slope) suddenly changed, well before it hit the magic 0.100. It's not for worriers, but many of us pragmatic engineers put such data to use if it looks valid, and my very smooth plots looked more like useful data than random noise AFTER topping about 0.060. OTOH, my ultrasensitive tests bounced around below about 0.080 for many years, so I concur that <0.002, 0.020, and 0.060 in random order all meant the same thing: squat. Well, I'm still not worried, because that does no good, but I AM sitting bolt upright, paying attention, tweaking long-range plans, and getting another c-11 choline PET/CT scan as soon as my PSA hits 4.0, which my plot showed months ago to be due about next Tuesday. My points : \u0095 US PSA testing might be at least reassuring, maybe even useful in some cases ... \u0095 but not for people inclined to worry about it. \u0095 While not the norm, PSA plots/DT/Velocity can change very dramatically even a decade after our prostate leaves the building ... \u0095 and even that may or may not be cause for concern. For those 8 years, my PSA would increase up to 30-fold (< 0.002 to 0.060) and back to <0.002, with or without interim steps, apparently meaninglessly. Even after topping 0.200 -- indisputable recurrence by definition -- my DT stayed ~ 30 months and still increasing (a GOOD thing) as my PSA dropped back to 0.100 ... no threat whatsoever at nine years post-op. \"Nice knowin' ya, Doc; thanks for curing me.\" Then Ignition and Liftoff, followed by \"Seattle, We have a problem.\" Never stop watching this beast. It may hibernate for many years, but it NEVER dies. However, 0.010 is not going to wake it up; it merely rolled over in its sleep. I.P. Freely",

      "Content": "I've read scores of highly researched nutrition books and dozens more peer reviewed studies, and have asked several renowned oncologists about nutrition vs prostate cancer. I can find no proof that diet makes anywhere NEAR as much difference in the length or quality of cancer patients' lives as one of the best \"medicines\" known: exercise. As for a vegetarian diet, I am not a believer. It is very difficult to get all the fats and especially proteins we need just from plants, and humans thrive without ANY carbohydrates in their lives. The Inuit were and are extremely healthy living only on blubber as long as no one introduces them to sugar, flour, rice, etc (i..e., various forms of sugar). Two things that feed cancer are choline and sugar, but eliminating both of those altogether is all but impossible on any rational diet. Those mice whose tumors shrank to zero on a low-carb diet got NO carbs at all, just fat and protein. I stopped eating at our local GREAT Indian restaurant when I stopped eating starchy vegetables to reduce my carb intake, but that's for other reasons than cancer. Anecdotally, I've experimented with quarters during which I added or subtracted one food or another according to all the rumors. Many other health issues and markers improved very dramatically on Atkins' low-NET-carb approach to eating (very heavy on colorful vegetables but also heavy on healthy fats, including saturated fats), but my PSA continues to climb on a very straight line, as my oncologists expected.
