      "Content": "Just diagnosed with Prostate Cancer. My PSA was 4.8 on 9/16/14, on 12/12/14 biopsy 12 samples. 12/30/14 I received the call - Prostate Cancer. I had an appointment for 12/31/14 at 9:00 AM, but he just had to tell me at 7:00 the night before. 3 of the specimens were cancerous, all 3 were 3+3=6, 1 had 3% and 2 had 10% cancerous cells in the sample. They said mine was not enlarged, and I actually went to the Urologist to have mine shaved, as I had urinary and ED issues. (I am also type 2 diabetic). Dr. said we would talk after biopsy, which kind of was a surprise, as I thought I was fine, and the shaving procedure was all I needed - jokes on me! Anyway, it seems like mine is minimal, but I have an appointment with a Radiologist Oncologist this Friday, and an appointment with a surgeon on February 2nd. The more I research, the more confused I get. by the way, I am 61, will be 62 in February, and still work full time (45 - 50 hours a week - my company). Any suggestions?",
