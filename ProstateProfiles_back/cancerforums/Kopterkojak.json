      "Content": "It started with minimal nocturnal urine flow leading to Nightly Tamosulin(Urimax)BPH.4.Along the road a DRE,PSA's etc.In 2016 Biopsy was clear with PSA 19. 2018 PSA 64 Biopsy Gleason 3+4, post op 4+4. Jr does not salute and Diapers fashionable. MRI Pelvis & Bone scan were clear but post op cells on membrane hence Hormone injections for 2 yrs 3 monthly and 37 days radiation. Presently analysing why Jr could not stand up to the occasion and why did the immune system break down. In the scientific approach of starving the cancer a range of foods is mentioned.This is in tune with Jindal Naturopathy pointing at improper digestion leading to toxins.Howevever Aging is a factor.Lifestyle,BMI, pollution etc?? So Elp me Gawd! Regards KOJAK (YouTube.com/kopterkojak/soldier-LA Taxi Live)",
