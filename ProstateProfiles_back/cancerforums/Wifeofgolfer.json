      "Content": "lJames....My husband was going to request being sedated because his brother had been through painful biopsies. Turned out because his MRI revealed the lesions in the anterior portion of his prostate, it was done out patient with similar sedation that you'd have with a colonoscopy. They said it was due to access to this area would be more painful. If this hadn't been offered, we would have asked for this type of sedation. I'm not sure about the insurance coverage portion, but his sedation was covered by our insurance. I believe that we live in a time when painful medical procedures should be made as comfortable as possible. My husband did well with everything except he couldn't urinate so we had to hang around longer until he could \"go\" before we could go home. Knowing that everything was going to pain free which was a huge relief for him and me! It's worth asking! Good luck!",

      "Content": "Well my husband has arrived on the good side! Things have been doing pretty well. He is battling the normal constipation but making progress. I am because he has had this weird pain for the last few days. Nothing horrible, but annoying and unrelenting. It began under his ribs on the right side and was there for two days. It gradually left but now he is complaining about pain in his left shoulder. Could this be from the all the gas he had pumped into him for the procedure? I haven't read about this happening to others this many days out. Catheter out tomorrow. He is looking forward to not being tied to that anymore. Pathology report to follow. Thank you all. I cannot say how comforting it has been to take this journey with such great knowledge and support! The next leg of recovery begins tomorrow!",

      "Content": "Thank you for the article Djin! I shared it with my husband. Seems this was somewhat common in that study so funny how it isn\u2019t talked about as a side effect post RALP. I\u2019m praying Golfer improves as time goes on, but will be asking about possibilities to help restore that part of his sex life. This side effect was not expected. Rmo.....your situation seems to be more talked about. I\u2019m sorry you are struggling with side effects as well. It seems we all walk this post RALP walk differently. Gary....Its true we are not out far from surgery. I\u2019ve been telling my husband he needs to be patient and see what his surgeon says. Another....Great advice....strengthening his pelvic floor makes sense. We discussed the \u201cbrain\u201d part as well. He feels he isn\u2019t anxious. We knew going in that part of our marriage could/would change. Overall we feel our intimacy is better.",

      "Content": "Hi there I\u0092ve been back recently reading and catching up with the forum. Life has been moving welll since Golfer\u0092s RALP in January. Our first PSA following his surgery is scheduled the end of the month. We pray we will be added to the \u0093zero club\u0094 at that time. We will be talking to our surgeon as well. We have some questions and I wanted to seek the experts here for information first. Golfer has had a great recovery with no incontinence , full erections (with 20 mg of sildenafil), and the golf course is open! We know we are fortunate in so many areas, but the one place that has not been great is my husband\u0092s orgasim. He knew it would be different, but it is very weak. He is disappointed as he is thankful for a healthy erection but is this what his sex life will be? He never had a problem prior to surgery. I haven\u0092t read much about this on the forum. Most things I\u0092ve read say orgasm can be achieved without erection and many have better orgasm after RALP. What about returned erections with minimal orgasm? Any insight if we can expect this will improve or suggestions from others who have had this issue is appreciated.. Thank you in advance for sharing this personal part of recovery",

As the day progressed, his urine stream slowly seized up. My 11:30 pm his was in tremendous pain when trying to urinate with minimal output. We eventually had to go back to Rochester in the middle of the night to the ER. Miraculously as we waited for the urologist, he was able to \"go\" again. We headed home with hopes it had passed only to get 2 hours of sleep and turn around to head back to Mayo as it happened again.

My husbands prostate was large and growing up into his bladder so they think it is just not working yet as it is traumatized. Has any one else suffered from urine retention and then was fine after the extended catheter time? My husband hated the catheter, but would rather have it again to prevent the pain of urinating and not being able to \"go\" without having to force his stream ( more like dribbling) to start.

      "Content": "The golfer had his catheter removed this morning and we have returned home. I am sure my husbands over all mood, hope of recovery, and comfort have increased greatly. He is having urinary urgency but no leaking at this time. He is wearing Depends \"just in case\". The pains under his rib cage and shoulder were gas related and improving. ( Thank you to those who responded to my post on his painnhere) Sleeping has been difficult because he likes to sleep on his side and that hurts his incisions . Golfer has had no blood in the urine, but is still struggling to get his bowels moving normally. Stool softener, all bran, prunes, prune juice , and bran muffins are regulars in his diet these days. He has been walking around the house a lot and looks forward to getting outside but the temps here are heading below zero for the next week. Pathology report: Diagnosis Adenocarcinoma (Gleason pattern 3+3, grade group 1) involving the left posterior inferior and mid, left anterior mid, right anterior mid,right anterior mid and right post superior aspects of the prostate. The tumor is confined to the prostate without involvement of extraprostatic soft tissue or seminal vesicles. The left posterior and and anterior apex margins are abutting tumor. Synoptic report Prostate size: 5.3 x 4.7 x 4.4 cm Primary Gleason pattern: 3 Secondary Gleason pattern : 3 Tertiary Gleason pattern: n/a Total Gleason Score : 6 Tumor Quantitation: 1.5 x 1.0 x 0.7 EPE -, BNI - SVI-, SM abutted by invasive carcinoma,limited extension, (less than 3 mm) Primary Tumor: pT2 I'm not sure exactly if the SM would be considered positive in those areas where the tumor abutted them. We talked to the Resident urologist and he said the tumor came very close. We are suppose to return for a PSA in 3 mo and another post op eval. He said there was nothing surprising or concerning. We were very glad that there were no changes to his Gleason score. Now moving to the next part of the journey ....urinary function!",

      "Content": "The 2nd catheter was removed today. We didn't see a Dr., but the nurse said urine retention and the need for a 2nd catheter only happens to about 2% of patients following prostatectomy. Our Dr. said it usually happens with younger men and within 24-48 hours of catheter removal. We were nervous that we would have a repeat of that painful, sleepless night last week. It was awful! We are now experiencing a deep freeze in MN with -60 windchills tonight and tomorrow, so driving 60 minutes back to Rochester ER tonight was a scary thought. Things seem to be fine this time and we both are relaxing tonight. My husband knew things were MUCH different right away this time. His \"stream\" this time was like he was 35 years younger and after the 1st catheter removal he was disappointed with his \"whimpy stream\" that quickly became dribbling . Right now he is urinating intentionally every 2 hours but he doesn't seem to have urgency issues. He is nervous about trying to hold it very long as he is worried about leaking. So far continence is very good. A few drips . I'm glad to here you both are doing better with no repeats of painful urine retention. Busby, I think I've read other post about FB having to urinate often too. It seems like everything with healing is a process in this journey.",

Just when I was confident that my husband had turned a corner, a complication came and set him back. Yesterday after his catheter was removed, things were gong smoothly. As the day progressed, his urine stream slowly seized up. My 11:30 pm his was in tremendous pain when trying to urinate with minimal output. We eventually had to go back to Rochester in the middle of the night to the ER. Miraculously as we waited for the urologist, he was able to \"go\" again. We headed home with hopes it had passed only to get 2 hours of sleep and turn around to head back to Mayo as it happened again. A new catheter was placed until next Tuesday when they will try again to remove it and he can urinate on his own. My husbands prostate was large and growing up into his bladder so they think it is just not working yet as it is traumatized. Has any one else suffered from urine retention and then was fine after the extended catheter time? My husband hated the catheter, but would rather have it again to prevent the pain of urinating and not being able to \"go\" without having to force his stream ( more like dribbling) to start. What will change things in a few days. Praying the bladder will cooperate next week. We do not need another repeat of this part of the journey. My poor husband has been so tough. It makes me sad to see him go through more pain.",

Glad to hear your husband has improvement in that area. Looks like he really is on the mend now! Hey Busby. He is urinating about every one to two hours. Of course it depends on how much fluids. They told him to stay away from caffeine, carbonated beverages, and alcohol for a while. He got up 2 times to pee last night. He doesn\u0092t sleep well either. I think he is awake most mornings by 4am and finds it hard to sleep in bed all night for some reason. He then goes to the recliner. Does this seem similar to your experience?",

It is also is painful when he urinates but not generally painful over all. We will call his surgeons office tomorrow. I'm thinking this is not normal and am wondering how concerned I should be.",

We are leaning toward a robotic prostectomy but we will see if we feel that way after our appointment. I apologize if there is another post on this, but I wanted to ask the experts here.....What questions would/ should we ask the Urologist/ Surgeon at Mayo? We know that he has done over 3000 and his PA ( she has been our primary since we consulted with Mayo almost 2 years ago) said she would have him do the surgery on her husband if he ever needed it. She said it is not because they work together, but because she sees his patients outcomes. There is so much to take in. Thank you for any advice. Stacie",

One problem that has developed is that my husband is having difficulty urinating tonight. When he does, his stream is just a trickle. It was fine after his catheter was removed today. It is also is painful when he urinates but not generally painful over all. We will call his surgeons office tomorrow. I'm thinking this is not normal and am wondering how concerned I should be.",

      "Content": "The golfer had his catheter removed this morning and we have returned home. I am sure my husbands over all mood, hope of recovery, and comfort have increased greatly. He is having urinary urgency but no leaking at this time. He is wearing Depends \"just in case\". The pains under his rib cage and shoulder were gas related and improving. ( Thank you to those who responded to my post on his painnhere) Sleeping has been difficult because he likes to sleep on his side and that hurts his incisions . Golfer has had no blood in the urine, but is still struggling to get his bowels moving normally. Stool softener, all bran, prunes, prune juice , and bran muffins are regulars in his diet these days. He has been walking around the house a lot and looks forward to getting outside but the temps here are heading below zero for the next week. Pathology report: Diagnosis Adenocarcinoma (Gleason pattern 3+3, grade group 1) involving the left posterior inferior and mid, left anterior mid, right anterior mid,right anterior mid and right post superior aspects of the prostate. The tumor is confined to the prostate without involvement of extraprostatic soft tissue or seminal vesicles. The left posterior and and anterior apex margins are abutting tumor. Synoptic report Prostate size: 5.3 x 4.7 x 4.4 cm Primary Gleason pattern: 3 Secondary Gleason pattern : 3 Tertiary Gleason pattern: n/a Total Gleason Score : 6 Tumor Quantitation: 1.5 x 1.0 x 0.7 EPE -, BNI - SVI-, SM abutted by invasive carcinoma,limited extension, (less than 3 mm) Primary Tumor: pT2 I'm not sure exactly if the SM would be considered positive in those areas where the tumor abutted them. We talked to the Resident urologist and he said the tumor came very close. We are suppose to return for a PSA in 3 mo and another post op eval. He said there was nothing surprising or concerning. We were very glad that there were no changes to his Gleason score. Now moving to the next part of the journey ....urinary function!",

We are leaning toward a robotic prostectomy but we will see if we feel that way after our appointment. I apologize if there is another post on this, but I wanted to ask the experts here.....What questions would/ should we ask the Urologist/ Surgeon at Mayo? We know that he has done over 3000 and his PA ( she has been our primary since we consulted with Mayo almost 2 years ago) said she would have him do the surgery on her husband if he ever needed it. She said it is not because they work together, but because she sees his patients outcomes. There is so much to take in. Thank you for any advice. Stacie",

      "Content": "The 2nd catheter was removed today. We didn't see a Dr., but the nurse said urine retention and the need for a 2nd catheter only happens to about 2% of patients following prostatectomy. Our Dr. said it usually happens with younger men and within 24-48 hours of catheter removal. We were nervous that we would have a repeat of that painful, sleepless night last week. It was awful! We are now experiencing a deep freeze in MN with -60 windchills tonight and tomorrow, so driving 60 minutes back to Rochester ER tonight was a scary thought. Things seem to be fine this time and we both are relaxing tonight. My husband knew things were MUCH different right away this time. His \"stream\" this time was like he was 35 years younger and after the 1st catheter removal he was disappointed with his \"whimpy stream\" that quickly became dribbling . Right now he is urinating intentionally every 2 hours but he doesn't seem to have urgency issues. He is nervous about trying to hold it very long as he is worried about leaking. So far continence is very good. A few drips . I'm glad to here you both are doing better with no repeats of painful urine retention. Busby, I think I've read other post about FB having to urinate often too. It seems like everything with healing is a process in this journey.",

      "Content": "Sw... My husband had this type of biopsy (targeted/ guided) based on this type of MRI. He also had some areas graded as PR-RADS 3 and 4 This lead to the decision to proceed with a biopsy. His lesions where noted in the anterior prostate so it was done with sedation due to accessibility which could be more difficult and painful. He did well and recovered well from it except had a problem urinating before they would let us go home. Sedation was similar to that done with a colonoscopy and done outpatient . We were told that the targeted biopsy focuses on those areas and also does additional areas throughout the entire prostate so it helps getting a more accurate biopsy. Nothing is fool proof but this makes sure those areas are sampled. You will do great. If there is something concerning you will find out what it is or is not.",

But as you get more information and facts, it gets better. The support here is so valuable as you already know. If it turns out you need TX, your young age can be on your side. There is a lot of waiting and it is brutal. I said on another post, it feels like life hit \"the pause button.\" We've been on the journey for years...no cancer DX until recently. It's good you are on top of it. MF and Gary.....thank you for the encouragement.....as much as we feel ready and optimistic....I'm not certain we will sleep well tonight. We will be back with pathology report and possible questions. Best wishes and thoughts to all here on the journey!",

      "Content": "Sw... My husband had this type of biopsy (targeted/ guided) based on this type of MRI. He also had some areas graded as PR-RADS 3 and 4 This lead to the decision to proceed with a biopsy. His lesions where noted in the anterior prostate so it was done with sedation due to accessibility which could be more difficult and painful. He did well and recovered well from it except had a problem urinating before they would let us go home. Sedation was similar to that done with a colonoscopy and done outpatient . We were told that the targeted biopsy focuses on those areas and also does additional areas throughout the entire prostate so it helps getting a more accurate biopsy. Nothing is fool proof but this makes sure those areas are sampled. You will do great. If there is something concerning you will find out what it is or is not.",
