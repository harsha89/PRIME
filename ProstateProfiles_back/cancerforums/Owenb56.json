      "Content": "Hi all, Just got my biopsy results back and have already conferred with the Doctor. My PSA levels have been 4.0 or higher since I was about 40. Usual treatment was antibiotics which would lower the PSA levels to 3.0 or so. Last three years would be 5.0 to 5.4. This year was 5.4 and the antibiotics lowered it to 4.8 Family history, Grandfather Prostate cancer at 75, Uncle Prostate cancer at 63 radiation and seems to be in remission. Other family members with Melanoma and one with lung cancer. FINAL DIAGNOSIS A. Prostate, right apex, needle core biopsies: Benign prostatic tissue. B. Prostate, right mid, needle core biopsies: Benign prostatic tissue. C. Prostate, right base, needle core biopsies: Prostatic adenocarcinoma (estimated Gleason score 3+4=7), involving two of two needle cores (each focus less than 1 mm). D. Prostate, left apex, needle core biopsies: Benign prostate tissue. E. Prostate, left mid, needle core biopsies: Benign prostatic tissue. F. Prostate, left base, needle core biopsies: Benign prostatic tissue. According to the Doctor this was found very early and is probably contained in the prostate. (He felt 98% sure) I have three options, Do nothing and just monitor my PSA levels, (not leaning toward this) Robotic Surgery ( not sure if it's DaVinci) but I am being treated at the Mayo Clinic here in Phoenix, third option is radiation. Based on what I am seeing it looks like many folks have had pretty good results with the surgery. I am concerned that opting for radiation first seems to remove the possibility of surgery later if a recurrence happens. The Doctor also felt very certain that he would be able to spare all the nerve bundles since the margins would be unnecessary in the surrounding tissues. I'm grateful for the early diagnosis but would sure like some opinions. Thanks in advance. Owen",

      "Content": "Hi All, So I was diagnosed in September with Gleason 3+4 at Mayo in Phoenix. Had Johns Hopkins (Dr Epstein) provide a second opinion. There were 2 cores that each contained cancer cells although each was less than 1CM in size. Followed up with a MRI which showed zero indications of any cancer activity. My PSA has been high since I was 45. (I'll be 62 this summer) Never above 5.7 and was 5.3 in Sept and 5.4 last week. I am active and in good health otherwise. Initially we made the decision that AS was appropriate but we are getting what I feel is pressured from the Surgeon at Mayo (Dr. Castle) to undergo surgery. Be going back in for another Biopsy on May 2nd. Just wondering if there is anyone else out there in the same situation and what prompted their choice for AS or surgery. Thanks in advance for any replies.",
