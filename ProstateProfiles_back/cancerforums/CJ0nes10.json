    "Content": "Wondering if I could get a bit of advice here. I\u0092m 32 years old, and for A little while now I\u0092ve been having some issues. Usually only at night when getting ready for bed, I\u0092ll frel like I have to go to the bathroom, and when I go it\u0092s only a few drops. This happens 2-3 times while I\u0092m in bed and relaxing and waiting to actually fall asleep. Recently, when going to the bathroom, it\u0092s been taking a while to start a flow, as well as sometimes it\u0092ll be a weak flow. Most shocking though, is I recently wet the bed. This, after I got up 2-3 times before actually falling asleep and doing the normal \u0091I gotta pee, but it\u0092s barely anything\u0092 routine. Now, I\u0092m an active guy. I lift weights 3-4 days a week, but as well... I don\u0092t necessarily have a strict and clean diet. Also, my right testicle has been bothersome recently, but I don\u0092t think it\u0092s swollen or anything. Any advice or thoughts at all would be greatly appreciated. I\u0092m not one to worry about something unless there\u0092s something to worry about, but the bed wetting thing is what drove me to ask for thoughts.",
