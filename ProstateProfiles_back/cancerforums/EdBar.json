    "Content": "Just be sure to continue to monitor your PSA ans see your urologist regularly. I had similar symptoms, rising PSA, some urinary symptoms and had two 12 core negative biopsies two years apart, the 2nd showed some inflamation so I was convinced I had prostatitis and my urologist tended to think so too. I got away from seeing the urologist happy to think that it wasn't PCa and got away from having any more unpleasant biopsies. 3-4 years later I started to experience lower back pain and more urinary symptoms so back to the urologist and another biopsy and whamo - I was diagnosed with a Gleason 9, Stage 4, metastatic PCa. Needless to say stay on top of this just to be safe. Hopefully it is just AIP. Ed",
