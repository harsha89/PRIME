      "Content": "Hello everyone, Found this forum about a week ago. Great info. I haven't done the forum posting thing much in the past however, I thought I would give it go today. As the title says I have my Da Vinci surgery scheduled for tomorrow. A little anxious, but feeling ok. The surgeon doing the procedure is very highly rated and considered one of the best in the area, if not the country. It's being done at one of the top university medical centers in the country. They've been excellent in preparing me for the process and I feel fortunate that I'm able to have my surgery done there. I've been reading about post surgery experiences on this forum and it's been very helpful in preparing for what and what not to expect. Between this forum and what the hospital staff is sure to tell me before my release, I should be in pretty good shape making it through a good recovery. Thank you.",
