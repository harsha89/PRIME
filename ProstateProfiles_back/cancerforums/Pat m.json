Re \"Appreciate any advice.\" We are not qualified to give medical advice but we will openly share out experiences with Prostate Cancer (PC) and offer suggestions and opinions. Re \"I asked about an MRI but it'll put treatment off for a couple of months.\" A couple of points: - Most MDs will not initiate treatment for about 7 weeks following biopsy to allow a very angry prostate gland to calm down. - Gleason (4+5) PC is very high risk - It appears that you and your MD have determined that surgery is the best treatment. Suggestions: - Do not put off treatment any longer than absolutely necessary - Immediately schedule an appointment(s) for 2nd Opinion(s) - Purchase a copy of one of the leading PC books like: Guide to Surviving Prostate Cancer by Patrick Walsh, MD and read it! - You want to be treated by an expert MD who specializes in treating high risk PC (such an MD will be treating at least 3 - 5 new cases per week) - Keep a list of questions and write down the answers. - While there is a high likelihood (> 40%) that radiation may be needed after surgery. There is also the possibility that your PC is fully contained within the capsule of the prostate gland and surgery results in 100% cure. 2 Questions: 1. What City, State are you located? There may be other Forum Brothers from there and can offer suggestions 2. Was your previous PSA (=2) drawn 1 year ago or 2 years ago. (At age 52 I had annual physicals but my MD only tested my PSA every 2 years) Keep asking questions and keep us updated. Stay optimistic! MF Hi Michael, thanks for the info. I'm in San Francisco ca. Been in construction for 30 years. I had the biopsy April 17th. Surgery set for June 1st I think you're right on the psa, that was 2 years prior",
