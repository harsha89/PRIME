I am looking to see if anyone has had their surgery done through any of the Advocate Hospitals or Loyola University and have a doctor they trust. I hear great things about Loyola University Medical Center and hoping there is a highly rated Urologist there that I can trust to perform the surgery, but also exploring all the options in the Advocate Network of Hospitals.",

Dr. suggested testing my PSA Level in my blood. Results came back PSA Level: 8.6. He then suggested an ultrasound and a referral to a Urologist. Ultrasound came back that the Prostate was not enlarged and organs looked OK (Does this rule out BPH?). Appointment with Urologist is scheduled for 1/21. What are my next steps?
