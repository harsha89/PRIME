    "Content": "Hello to all. I'm new, but will always try to be succinct and to the point. I had brachytherapy 13 years ago, and I have felt fine. A recent PSA revealed a jump from a 0.019 to a 4.5, which, I believe, is serious. Has anyone gone through this before? I'm going for a biopsy next week, and, while the biopsy doesn't frighten me at all, the thought that the cancer has returned does. Any insights, suggestions, etc? They are all welcome. Thank you for your time, and I look forward to hearing from you.",
