      "Content": "Grappler - wow... your experience sounds like the best it could ever get! I am trying to tame my expectations for the radiation option -- I don't meet with the radiation oncologist for another week. Time could not be moving more slowly in that regard. I have read so many pros and cons of surgery versus radiation. Both options appear to be equal in their ability to produce positive outcomes. I am hoping that Brachytherapy is deemed appropriate for my situation. Otherwise I might be back at the drawing board once again. I just want to get on with it at this point. The waiting is excruciating! Thanks for the feedback -- I really appreciate your thoughts and experiences.",
