      "Content": "Is it possible to accurately calculate PSA doubling time with an ultrasensitive assay at very low PSA levels? For example, my PSA level was at 0.028 in April 2013 and went to 0.055 in October 2014 with tests given every 2-3 months apart. Given that information, is it 18 months? Or is the standard assay more reliable at calculating PSA doubling time? I had RP August 2012 only negatives on path was 3+4 gleason positive margin at apex .Should i go ahead with salvage radiation now at such a low level and risk overtreatment or wait un BCR ( 0.2 AND RISING ) is evident ? PLEASE HELP !",
