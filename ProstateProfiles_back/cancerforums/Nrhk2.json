This week has gone a bit better since the chemo started. Taking it a day at a time. He's so weak that he doesn't have much urine control, probably due to weak pelvic floor muscles too, all his muscles have weaned a lot. Taking it a day at a time. And still hoping for a miracle. Thanks for your notes and resources you shared. I appreciate it.",

      "Content": "Hello there, I had to create a new profile since I couldn't recover the password for the old one (nrhk). I thank you in advance for reading this long post and helping me with my question. My dad had a 172 PSA in October 2015, and was diagnosed with Stage 4 Prostate Cancer with extensive bone metastates. He is in Delhi, India and has been undergoing treatment since then. This is his history: Prior History: Dec '12 - diagnosed with BPH (Benign Prostate Hyperplasia) and prostate enlargement and underwent HOLEP (laser) surgery. Was not advised by doctor to check PSA regularly after that, and the next time we checked PSA was when the back pain symptoms showed up in 2015 and the doctor advised getting a PSA done after the rectal exam. Treatment: Surgery - Subcapsular Orchiectomy (Nov 2015) \u2022 No pain \u2022 PSA down to 5 Received 8 cycles of chemo therapy (Taxotere/Docetaxel) - from Nov 2015 to Apr 2016 \u2022 Pain in control with medication (Crocin/Dolo 650) \u2022 Stable disease with rising PSA (but still under 172 - PSA was down to 23) Hormone Therapy - Abiraterone Acetate - from May 2016 to Oct 2016 \u2022 Pain in control with medication (Crocin/Dolo 650) \u2022 Stable disease with rising PSA (climbed up to 46) Recurrent UTI and Prostatitis - from Aug 2016 to Oct 2016 Resumed chemotherapy - 2 more cycles (Taxotere/Docetaxel) - from Oct 2016 to Nov 2016 - for a total of 10 chemotherapy sessions \u2022 Pain resumed while on hormone therapy, so switched to chemo \u2022 Extreme fatigue caused complete lack of activity with chemo and UTI and severe muscle wasting \u2022 Continued pain \u2022 Rising PSA - went up to 176, almost at Oct 2015 levels Lu PSMA therapy - Dec 2016 \u2022 Since October 2016 bone scan, evidence of disease progression \u2022 Pain partially in control with Tramadol 2x/day \u2022 Better for about 2 weeks, now pain started again - increasing to Tramadol 3x/day Surgery - Cystoscopy with Urethra stricture (Dec 2016) This week - PSA was 213, so rising again So now, he continues to feel very weak, and has some pain despite being on Tramadol and Dolo 650 3 times a day. He has a lot of muscle wasting, cachexia which makes walking very hard since he cant get up and doesn't have strength. We force him to walk and undergo physical therapy for some strength, but its a struggle. The oncologist saw him today and said the disease is progressing and started him on oral chemo - Endoxin. My question is this -- the doctor told me today he has months at best, probably not weeks, but things aren't working anymore. How does it progress from here - what symptoms should we expect so we can mentally prepare ourselves? Thanks K, daughter of nrhk",

      "Content": "After being diagnosed in October 2015 with Stage 4 Metastatic Prostate Cancer with a Gleasson score of 8 and a PSA of 172, dad finally passed away on June 9 peacefully while having his lunch. He had been through 12 docetaxel chemos, orchiectomy, abiraterone, carboplatin chemo, and was getting weaker by the day. He couldn't walk staring in Jan and then slowly got completely bed ridden, and the pain got unbearable and we put him on Fentanyl 50mcg patches in March. His breathing was getting harder and finally two days ago, he passed away. I have many regrets - may be we should have stopped chemo earlier, may be I shouldn't have said all those things to him before he was diagnosed, a feeling that while the fentanyl gave him relief, it probably finally took his life too....he suffered a lot, and changed from being a very high energy jovial person to this depressed and dependent individual- I am glad his suffering is over. I am glad I got him with me to the US last year for a month to spend the summer and that at that point, he was still walking and we were able to visit NYC together. And I am so thankful to my mom who fought as hard as him and harder than him the last few months doing everything in her power. Thank you to this forum and the people here for educating me, being on this journey with us, and being a selfless resource for folks whose lives get uprooted by the havoc of cancer.",
