      "Content": "Hi Mike..I had my surgery on the 20th also...and will have my catheter removed on the 28th also (in what's suppose to be the coldest morning of the year..20 below zero! Ugh). As Fran said, the first shower and bowel movement were quite emotional. How long were you in the hospital? I was released late on the 21st, so I was only in one night. Even though they gave the ok to release me that day, I almost didn't want to go! I was very depressed the evening of the 21st at the hospital before I left. I had much trouble bending to put on my shoes. The nurses assistant had to put on my shoes and tie them for me! Seriously! The pain in my belly was awful (even with the pain meds). But I knew I couldn't stay another night. I knew I had to start healing on my own. I finally had my first bowel movement on Friday. Albeit they were both diarrhea. Had my first normal bowel movement yesterday. I was prescribed Lidocaine for the tip of my penis which I was applying with my fingers until I realized there was an applicator in the bottom of the box...lol. There is still some discomfort and pain down there when I walk or sit. Ya, I almost was thinking about cutting a hole in my sweat pants to route the catheter through to take off my pants, but I was able to get it through without cutting. It took me several minutes to figure which way and how to route it..lol. I know, I'm so dumb! LOL. I hate hate hate the catheter I'll take the incontinence over this stupid tube! However,I may regret saying that Hope all your soreness goes away! Hopefully, better things will be in store for us on Tuesday when our catheters are removed! Take Care, Vern",

      "Content": "Hey Mike! Nice to hear that things are going well. Yes! I agree...kudos to the docs!! My surgeon did a great job and would recommend him to anyone! I would say I have about less than half the superglue left. It was a good week at work. Didn't feel really tired. Worked in the office...avoided the forklifts or lifting. I feel like I did pre-surgery except the stomach area is still a bit tender...but improving! It's interesting how many here have said their doctors have stressed the walking after surgery. Neither my urologist/surgeon or primary care physician said anything about having to do walking. They both emphasized the kegels and plenty of rest..that's it! Take Care, Vern",

      "Content": "Hey Everyone! I went back to work today 3 weeks post surgery! My goal was 4 weeks...so I'm ahead of that. My doctor has me on a progression of 4 hours work today..working my way up to 8 hours by Friday. I have a lifting restriction for a few weeks, so my work is confined to the office for awhile. Felt good at work today and probably could have done a full 8 hours, but I guess I don't want to push it. I haven't had much leakage problems since surgery and today I just had a few small leaks. Only wearing the thin shields. I am doing the kegel excercises...they ARE important and DO help! My stomach area still hurts just a bit, but only when I bend or stretch. The incisions are even starting to heal nicely. Well, that's about it! I'm very happy with the way things are progressing. Hope it stays that way. Take Care, Vern",

      "Content": "I had my first PSA test in 1999 when I was 39...and it was 0.6. It remained steady for years and actually didn't go over 1.0 until 2008 (my signature below has my PSA history). So, I guess I wouldn't be too concerned with your number right now. But I have a good doctor who continually monitored my PSA through the years. So, it's important that you get it checked yearly, especially since your father had PC. As lancepeace said, get your \"free PSA\" checked! I guess it's good to have it at 20 or higher. Even though my regular PSA was only a 2.5 (at 54 years old), my free PSA was 11 and that was one of the things that triggered a red flag to my doctor. So, there are other things besides regular PSA that your doctor needs to monitor. Take Care and keep us posted. Vern",

      "Content": "Hi...I am 54 and was just recently diagnosed with prostate cancer. I would like to first review my PSA history and such. I tend to get a bit detailed, so please have patience as you read through, thanks PSA Jan. 1999 (.6) Jan. 2002 (.6) April 2006 [.8] April 2008 (1.3) Dec. 2008 (1.0) Oct. 2009 (1.0) Oct. 2010 (1.2) Nov. 2012 (2.0) Aug. 2013 (2.5) As you can see, the rise in PSA between Nov. 2012 and Aug. 2013 isn't very substantial...and also isn't what one, I guess would call a high PSA number (2.5). However, my doctor still was concerned by this because my free PSA during this time is 11%...and I also have a very low testosterone level. My doctor advised I get a biopsy done and referred me to a specific urologist. After researching and educating myself online, I was rather surprised he would suggest a biopsy considering the numbers. I've had this doctor since 1999 and he's very much into preventive care, so I trust him and got the biopsy done on October 18, 2013. After the biopsy, the urologist even seemed confident that there wouldn't be anything wrong based on the information my doctor gave him and the exam he gave me a week before the biopsy. Well, 5 days after the biopsy I received a call from the urologist who said that of the 12 samples taken...3 had what he called small amounts of cancer...and that it wasn't just some insignificant finding. It was enough to warrant treatment. Here's info on the 3 cancerous samples (Note: all 3 cancerous samples were found on the extreme right side of the prostate) .Prostate tissue, right lateral base, needle core biopsy: Invasive prostatic adenocarcinoma Gleason Score 3+4 = 7/10 involving 60% of the core (one of one core involved) Negative for lymphatic vascular space or perineural invasion .Prostate tissue, right lateral mid, needle core biopsy Invasive prostatic adenocarcinoma Gleason Score 3+3 = 6/10 involving 10% of the core (one of one core involved) Negative for lymphatic vascular space or perineural invasion .Prostate tissue, right apex, needle core biopsy Invasive prostatic adenocarcinoma Gleason Score 3+4 = 7/10 involving 50% of the core (one of one core involved) Negative for lymphatic vascular space or perineural invasion Stage: T2a The urologist discussed possible treatments...but it basically comes down to radiation treatments or surgery. I never liked the idea of radiation...I don't know, it's just me..can't really give a good reason why I don't like it...but I just don't. My urologist (who is also the surgeon) has his reasons for not liking radiation treatment. He gave me a reason, but I couldn't remember what it was. However, he did give me a brochure of a radiation specialist who I can speak with in case I decide to go in that direction. My regular doctor is also not a fan of radiation treatment. So, I guess that makes three of us! This makes my decision to possibly have surgery easier, I guess. I haven't yet set a date for surgery. I asked the urologist/surgeon if I can at least enjoy the holidays and have the surgery after New Year and he said that would actually be just fine! Since I had the biopsy in mid October, the earliest I could have the surgery would be early to mid December anyway. Just an FYI, this guy has done over 1,500 of the daVinci surgery's and he seems like a confident person. Thank you for taking time to read through my mini-novel...lol. I very much appreciate it.

I asked the urologist/surgeon if I can at least enjoy the holidays and have the surgery after New Year and he said that would actually be just fine! Since I had the biopsy in mid October, the earliest I could have the surgery would be early to mid December anyway. Just an FYI, this guy has done over 1,500 of the daVinci surgery's and he seems like a confident person. Thank you for taking time to read through my mini-novel...lol. I very much appreciate it. Feel free to chime in on anything I have mentioned. That's why I joined this forum because people here seem to know their stuff and I value your feedback Take Care",
