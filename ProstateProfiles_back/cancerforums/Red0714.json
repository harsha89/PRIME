    "Content": "I'm a 52 year old who had the Da Vinci procedure 13 months ago. I am using a vacuum pump for therapy; tried viagra and the shots and they don't work well for me. My question is has anyone else experienced an area in the erect penis that doesn't respond to the pump. Using the pump, the head and the first few inches from the base of the penis are as they were before the procedure but an approximate 2 inch area just below the head of the penis doesn't enlarge like the rest. The doctor says it's nerve damage but is vague on when it might go away. Please let me know if anyone else has experienced a similar problem",
