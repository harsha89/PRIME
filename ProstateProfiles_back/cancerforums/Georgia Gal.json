      "Content": "PDV, I really love reading your posts, esp. this whole thread. Very encouraging! We are 5 days post-RALP and feeling like the catheter is a special form of torture. I feel like if it weren't for the catheter, my husband would be doing pretty well. Wednesday (when the catheter comes out) can't come soon enough. It's super-encouraging to read how well you are doing so soon after surgery. And sex three weeks post-surgery - wow, that's awesome. I won't count on that, but it's reassuring to know that it happens for some. Good luck with the start of school on Monday. Hope you keep feeling great!",

      "Content": "For a place I never wanted to have to visit (i.e., cancer forum), I'm so happy to have found you people. I've been lurking here for the past 10 days, trying to learn everything I can since my husband's cancer diagnosis two weeks ago. I have already found this forum to be immensely helpful; now I want to connect, to introduce myself, and to find (and offer) support. My husband, age 61, was diagnosed mid-June after a biopsy was positive for 2 out of 12 cores, Gleason 7 (one core was 3+4, the other was 4+3 - I didn't realize that each core could have its own Gleason, but that's what we were told). DRE had been negative. His PSA had risen from 4.5 to 5.5. From the reading I've done (I bought Dr. Walsh's book after reading that recommendation multiple times on this forum), I think this makes him T1c. The urologist referred to his cancer as intermediate risk (I assume because of the Gleason score). He had a consult with the radiologist this past Wednesday, and learned that there is also perineural invasion; I read up about that in Dr. Walsh's book and understand that means there's a chance it has spread beyond the capsule. We have our consult with the urologist this coming Monday. Based on his phone conversation with my husband, we know that the decision about course of action will be up to us - we both feel strongly that surgery will be the way to go. The radiologist indicated to my husband that the only reason not to do surgery would be if we were afraid of the risk involved in surgery, which we are not. My husband's cardiologist has already cleared him for surgery (husband had a massive heart attack in 2001 at the age of 47 - had been a smoker, a poor eater, and was diagnosed with type 2 diabetes in the hospital after the heart attack - he's done a good job taking care of himself since then and has had no further heart issues; he weighs 40 pounds less and controls his diabetes with diet, exercise, and oral medication, he had already quit smoking before the heart attack happened). The radiologist spoke extremely highly of the surgeon we're consulting with (at University of Michigan). We are hopeful that we can schedule surgery for sometime next month. We haven't told our children yet (he has two grown children, and we have twin 11 year-old sons), or really anyone else except for my parents (with whom I'm very close; my mother is a survivor of aggressive malignant melanoma). We plan to start telling family, friends, and people at work after the consult on Monday. I'd love any advice on anything we should ask the surgeon, or things we should be aware of before our meeting Monday morning. I should add - I'm 44 and the whole issue of ED is a concern for both of us. It's something we've already had to deal with, thanks to diabetes; he's been on Cialis for a few years with good results. My primary concern of course is dealing with the cancer (and I realize that, given perineural invasion, we might not have the nerve-sparing option, though Dr. Walsh has some optimistic things to say about that). But assuming we can get the cancer out completely, my concern after that is about ED. I've spent some time reading the ED thread here, which is helpful and hopeful. But I'll take any more encouragement and hope about that issue as well! My husband is not someone who ever posts on online forums, so you won't see him around here. But he's already grateful for the answers and reassurance I've found here. So - thank you!",

      "Content": "For a place I never wanted to have to visit (i.e., cancer forum), I'm so happy to have found you people. I've been lurking here for the past 10 days, trying to learn everything I can since my husband's cancer diagnosis two weeks ago. I have already found this forum to be immensely helpful; now I want to connect, to introduce myself, and to find (and offer) support. My husband, age 61, was diagnosed mid-June after a biopsy was positive for 2 out of 12 cores, Gleason 7 (one core was 3+4, the other was 4+3 - I didn't realize that each core could have its own Gleason, but that's what we were told). DRE had been negative. His PSA had risen from 4.5 to 5.5. From the reading I've done (I bought Dr. Walsh's book after reading that recommendation multiple times on this forum), I think this makes him T1c. The urologist referred to his cancer as intermediate risk (I assume because of the Gleason score). He had a consult with the radiologist this past Wednesday, and learned that there is also perineural invasion; I read up about that in Dr. Walsh's book and understand that means there's a chance it has spread beyond the capsule. We have our consult with the urologist this coming Monday. Based on his phone conversation with my husband, we know that the decision about course of action will be up to us - we both feel strongly that surgery will be the way to go. The radiologist indicated to my husband that the only reason not to do surgery would be if we were afraid of the risk involved in surgery, which we are not. My husband's cardiologist has already cleared him for surgery (husband had a massive heart attack in 2001 at the age of 47 - had been a smoker, a poor eater, and was diagnosed with type 2 diabetes in the hospital after the heart attack - he's done a good job taking care of himself since then and has had no further heart issues; he weighs 40 pounds less and controls his diabetes with diet, exercise, and oral medication, he had already quit smoking before the heart attack happened). The radiologist spoke extremely highly of the surgeon we're consulting with (at University of Michigan). We are hopeful that we can schedule surgery for sometime next month. We haven't told our children yet (he has two grown children, and we have twin 11 year-old sons), or really anyone else except for my parents (with whom I'm very close; my mother is a survivor of aggressive malignant melanoma). We plan to start telling family, friends, and people at work after the consult on Monday. I'd love any advice on anything we should ask the surgeon, or things we should be aware of before our meeting Monday morning. I should add - I'm 44 and the whole issue of ED is a concern for both of us. It's something we've already had to deal with, thanks to diabetes; he's been on Cialis for a few years with good results. My primary concern of course is dealing with the cancer (and I realize that, given perineural invasion, we might not have the nerve-sparing option, though Dr. Walsh has some optimistic things to say about that). But assuming we can get the cancer out completely, my concern after that is about ED. I've spent some time reading the ED thread here, which is helpful and hopeful. But I'll take any more encouragement and hope about that issue as well! My husband is not someone who ever posts on online forums, so you won't see him around here. But he's already grateful for the answers and reassurance I've found here. So - thank you!",

      "Content": "Thank you all SO much for your replies. I so appreciate the reassurance as well as the good information and suggestions. I've read your comments to my husband, and he's appreciative as well! Our huge preference is to go with surgery - my husband just wants to get the cancer out of his body, immediately, and I want to know the extent of what we're dealing with. hms03049 - I really appreciate what you've said about how post-surgery the pathologist will have a 99% clarity of where things stand. This is exactly the kind of reassurance we need right now. My biggest fear is that the cancer has gone beyond the prostate (though I'm hopeful that the PSA numbers indicate otherwise). I want the pathologist and surgeon to be able to tell us that they got it all. The radiologist told us that, if he were in my husband's position, and if he could choose any surgeon in the world to do his prostatectomy, he would pick the one we have. Sounds good to me! But I will also try to find out how many surgeries he's done and anything else I can find about his reputation. I am so glad to have this place to come for insight and reassurance. It's been very strange to have this huge, scary, confusing news and not be able to talk to anyone about it (my husband wanted to have a clear picture of what we were going to do before telling family and friends - so we're waiting till after the surgical consult on Monday). From the reading I've done, prostate surgery is far more complex than I'd ever realized. It helps to connect with this community, where you understand all the numbers and variations and what they mean. So - thank you!
