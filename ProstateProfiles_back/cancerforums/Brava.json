      "Content": "Wilde, dayum. What a decision. Your surgeon has a good point. Exercise is so important. It could be a bigger factor if keeping you cancer free than the raditaion, and a lot less harmful. The challenge is the surgery. I had both hips resurfaced which is a little more complex than total hip replacement. Nevertheless, the recovery was a doosie and something I dont want to go thoruhg again any time soon. If you are in pain, I would say go ahead a do the hip surgery. I know there is a lot to think about. You are young man, stay active and healthy. Brava",

      "Content": "Thanks to everyone for sharing of information and support. I went through hip replacement surgery a few years ago and a forum similar to this made all the difference. I hope is does the same here. I am a 51 year old African-Americam male who was recently diagnosed with PC. My Gleason score is a 3+4=7 with 2 of 2 cores invovled, tumor measures 1.9 cm in length; 50% of tissue involved in tumor. My PSAs were 1/15: 4.17, 4/15:3.32, and 11/15: 4.35. I am undergoing a second reading of my biospy with a noted pathologist a Johns Hopkins to confirm the 3+4=7 (thank God I got decent health insurance which I didnt at time of hip replacementrs). If confirmed, I think I will move forward with Robotic Surgery. If not, Active Surveliance will be my choice. I just got engaged and I'm very concerend about ED and quality of life. Here's the rub, My surgeon wanted to do a MRI in order to try to preserve more nerve tissue to reduce impact of ED. However, my metal hips will distort the image making the MRI moot. Has anyone else faced this situation? Advice? Thanks, Brava,",
