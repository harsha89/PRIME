We're waiting for MRI to see if the cancer is growing in the bladder neck or if its the median lobe pushed up into the bladder. I'm hoping to meet others with T4 to compare treatment strategies. I'm wondering about neoadjuvant chemo or ADT. Thanks!",

      "Content": "Hi Michael, Thank you so much for your very encouraging comments. I wonder if there is any other diagnosis a person can have that requires such important decision making? First we had a GP that didn't believe in screening, then when she finally did a PSA because my husband was symptomatic, she didn't make an urgent referral. Seems she didn't realize that PSA of 28 and 7% free ratio indicated a high risk of PCa. The next bump in the road was from the local urologist. I asked him about the TRUS u/s report that stated a suspicious extension into the bladder. He shrugged, and said he'd cut wide margins. My instincts told me to look further. At the biggest cancer centre, we first saw a Rad. Onc who listened to my concerns. She reviewed the scans and was also suspicious. She raised the case at the multi-D tumour board meeting. Half the group thought it was nothing. When we went in for the cystoscopy, the doc told us \"We'll probably find nothing and if there is something suspicious, he'll have to come back for a sedated biopsy.\" Based on the obvious cancer we saw, no biopsy seems to be necessary. I understand that 95% of bladder neck PCa relates to transition zone cancer which tends to egress into the bladder rather than the SV or LN. If they can get negative margins then there is some hope of a few years before biochemical recurrence. I've seen the many studies that report on \"very high risk\" PCa and I know it's not a good outcome. One other small hope is that several urologists who examined my husband have reported that his prostate is very mobile and called it a \"T2\". We can't change what is, we can only hope to manage it in the very best way possible. Not sure what patients would do without support groups like this. Thank you again!",

      "Content": "Thank you. You are quite right about finding the right surgeon. I'm in Canada and second opinions don't come too easily. Our urologist is clearly very bright but I'm beginning to realize that that doesn't mean he has a lot of experience in very high risk RPs. We'll have to be forthright and ask. Are there urologists in the US who are known to be especially skilled at very high risk cases? We can always sell our house. It would be worth it to know that we have the best there could be.",

We saw very visible cancer growth around the bladder neck on the screen. Urologist said he thinks there is sufficient margin from ureteral openings to cut out. I can't find information on this. Is surgery the best option? Rad Onc supports decision for surgery. Thank you. Husband's #: PSA 28, GS 4+5, all cores +, age 59. CT and bone scan clear.",
