      "Content": "Hi all, I've been a lurker here for quite awhile, and greatly appreciate all the information this forum has to offer. I have not been diagnosed with PCa (and I hope to be able to say that for a long, long time), but my stepfather passed away from PCa a couple of years ago, and going through that process has made me all too \"aware\" of PCa. Anyhow, on to my question. I'm 42 years old, and had my first PSA test in Nov. '06. PSA was 1.0 at that time. Shortly thereafter, I developed what I believe (and my urologist believe) was non-bacterial prostatitis. Symptoms were discomfort/burning after urination, feeling like I needed to urinate when I didn't really have to, and some dripping after urinating. We tried the usual anti-biotics with no effect. Eventually the symptoms mostly went away, though I do still tend to drip a couple of drops a few minutes after urinating. In January '07, I had another PSA test done in the midst of my prostatitis attack. Value was 0.9. I then had my annual physical this past week (Feb 200, with my first PSA test in 13 months, and the value was up to 1.2. My family doctor is not at all concerned about this, but a .3 jump in a year seems somewhat alarming to me. That's really the main impetus behind this post: does anybody have any input on whether I should/shouldn't be concerned about this? I generally tried to behave myself before the test. The blood draw was done 80+ hours after my most recent ejaculation. I do ride an exercise bike this time of year, but it's a recumbent with pretty much a standard chair type of seat, so I don't know if that would have caused the value to nudge upward. Basically I'm concerned that this .3 spike in a year means something. I'm trying to decide if I wait another 12 months for my annual PSA test, or if I shouldn't schedule something in a couple of months just to see if there's a trend here that could be caught early. By the way, I should mention I have been researching this on the net. I know many of the guidelines for PSA velocity suggest a rate > .75 is a problem, but in some of the more recent articles I've read many seem to be advocating additional tests if the rate is .4 or more for younger patients. In my mind .3 isn't far from .4, thus the concern. Thanks very much for your help!",

A couple of follow-on questions for anyone who can offer an opinion: 1) I went from a 1.0 to a 0.9, then to a 1.2. Is the velocity always measured against the last value, (which would be a difference of .3), the highest previous value (which would be a difference of .2), or something else? 2) Any thoughts on how I long I need to wait for another test? I'm assuming another test in a week would come back pretty much the same. What's the minimum time between tests for the results to still be meaningful? 3) Finally, does anyone have a uro recommendation in the Chicago area? Nothing in particular wrong with the guy I'm seeing now, but I feel like I'd like someone with more experience in these types of issues.",
