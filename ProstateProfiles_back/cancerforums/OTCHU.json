I had blood in my urine as well but nothing on rectal exam. Maybe you have just inflammation on your prostate ... again, wait for your PSA level and come back here to talk about it, ok ? Take care",

      "Content": "Hello everybody Maybe some people did read my case few weeks ago but here are the data: I am 41 years old. PC detected in October 2012 Gleason 7: < = 5% After 2 opinions just to be sure, I decided to have the prostate remove I am going to have a radical perineal prostatectomy (RPP) at the CTCA (Cancer treatment center of America) at Philly the 8th January. Doctor Sloane will do the surgery. The CTCA is wonderful and I recommend it to everybody. Hes going to try to do the nerves sparing but not sure at 100% that will be possible (depend if the cancer will be in this area or not). I am very very very nervous right now. Still can not believe that does happen to me at 41 years old. But will take the best of what will happen from now. I will keep you posted guys .... good luck to everybody",

      "Content": "ok its been 9 days since the surgery .... The surgeon said that everything did go well. He was able to save the nerves both sides. YEahhhhhhhhh The recovery is pretty hard specially because the surgery was a RPP. But that was my choice. I was very comfortable with the surgeon and preferred to have a hard time of recovery with good outcome than fast recovery with doubts of outcome. The hardest time is to sit down ... That 's going to take a while to feel better but I just need to be patience ... if u guys have some tips about recovery from RPP .... I am going to the hospital tomorrow to take out my catheter ... finally !!! this thing is annoying and painful sometime too. The surgeon told me that I should have the result of my prostate in about 2 weeks (surprise bc usually that take just 1 week). So, so far so good .... It's strange to say that but yes, I am living without prostate now and hopefully I will be able to say in few days, living without PC !",

      "Content": "I had a RPP last week (open surgery between the testicules and the rectum). I did choose this kind of surgery because I think that the surgeon has better feeling (with his fingers) to control the cut. He did save all the nerves and it was very important to me (I am 41 years old). Bad side of the RPP, its painful. 9 days after, I still have a hard time to sit down. Only the time will make the recovery better.",

      "Content": "Just take the positive attitude ! My case is very similar to yours. Gleason 7 and cancer was only inside the capsule. Both nerves saved. I had my surgery 4 weeks ago. Just start to work on my winner last week with the vaccum pump and 5mg cialis daily. So far .... not a lot ... maybe a little move last week during the night. But I am positive specially when I did reach orgasm last week. Yeah I can tell you, your sex life is not over .... I am 41 years old and I will not give up lol how old are you ? I did notice too that at the beginning, my penis was smaller ..... about 1 inch smaller or maybe more. I don't know if because the recovery time or what but since I do use the vaccum pump, he is almost back to his original size .... so don't be scare if that does happen to you ... that should come back with time and/or vaccum pump. Take care and like everybody say: welcome to the another side and be positive !",
