It's like the black hole of knowledge, so much knowledge, is such a small place, that even light can't escape it's gravitation pull! So I'm going to use his book as my primary source. (keeping in mind his obvious favor towards surgery) So to the point, looking at the Partin & Han tables, trying to get some idea where I might stand here's what I'm seeing. (They are pretty clear except the numbers in ()s, any help on that would be nice.) It is a combo of 3 pieces of info that make up the estimate of where one stands. The DRE, PSA, Gleason. OK, to my case. I am aware that only a biopsy can give any indication of Gleason. The DR did a DRE. I was clear w/ him that I wanted to know right then what he was feeling. I am aware that DRs do not want to scare there clients without cause but I wanted to know. Not knowing is the more of 2 evils for me. He said that he may have found a little firmness but was dismissive, implying he was not so concerned. Question: Dr W says either the DRE was non-palpable w psa high , palpable on less than 1/2 on 1 lobe, palpable on more than 1/2 of one lobe or on both lobes. ?? Ya reckon the dr might have been less than forth coming. Just a guess I know, but I am wondering just how clear a DRE is. \"maybe a little firmness\"??? But this is a side issue. The real issue is this, as I mentioned in my first post I am an avid MNT biker. Tend to be a little on the extreme side. (it's a personality thing) What I did not mention is that I was having additional seat issues. Had a rash that was flaring up. (1-3hrs riding a day does things!) To compensate I was sitting on my seat kinda funny which in hind sight was not so wise. I am convinced I was putting substantial additional, bouncing, pressure on my perineum. I explained this to both my primary and uro drs. (Bear with me guys, gettin' to da point) My primary did a PCA--18.7 SCAR--EEE! My uro did another, 8 days later, with little riding and no sex. 11.4. Disappointing, as we both hoped it would be lower. He also did a fPSA, 9.5% (not good) OK, so here is the ???? There was a 40% drop in 8 days, pretty big I think. Not trying to get out of a biopsy, not considering the fPSA but I am thinking that I do not have a reliable PSA and really need some kind of base line in order to make treatment decisions. Once a biopsy is done PSAs take awhile to stabilize also so I am considering delaying the biopsy. I dread the thought of delaying as not knowing is the worst! I know this is a question I have to bring to my Dr but was wondering if any of you have any comments. Is my logic off?(personal experience goes a long way) thanks, jerry",

      "Content": "Don't mean to be redundant. OK So my primary did a PSA because of urinary probs. Suspected the cause was my some what extreme biking habits. PSA 18.7 Uro in 8 days, backed off the bike. PSA11+ a 7 point drop. When he suggested a biopsy I asked about the drop in PSA and if it might not continue. His response was that I could wait another 6 weeks but if the high PSA was from inflammation my fPSA (9%+) should not be so low. SO, question is, anyone know if anything OTHER than cancer would cause a low fPSA read? Also, I know PSA# flux some but 7points!? By the way, wasn't clear--biopsy the 19th of this month. Also, have a good bike seat!",

      "Content": "Hey guys, I can think of a million things I would like to be doing right now, joining this forum is not even one of them. My quick story: I'm an avid mountain biker, ride daily and am in the best shape I've ever been in as an adult. Last summer I had a little bout with what turns out to be my prostate. Had some trouble tinkling, a bit of discomfort and stream issues. Figured it had to do with the fact I spent between 1 and 3 hrs a day on a seat the size of a banana. (reasonable) Thought about going to the Dr but it quickly resolved itself. The trouble returned a couple of weeks ago but much worse. Made an appointment. By the time I went it was already resolving itself once again. Dr ordered a PSA. Couple of days later he contacted me. PSA 18.7 Made app. with urologist. Did DRE and new PSA. He did not seem too concerned. Said he felt what might be a little firmness but expected the prob was the biking. PSA came back 11.4, fPSA 9.5% Biopsy the 19th. Been googling and got a copy of Dr Walsh's book. (Already owe y'all one for that) Well, as you know more about this subject than I, you know what I mean by \"not looking good\" PSA north of 10, fPSA south of 10. You all are aware of how I'm feeling right now. Total game changer. Not really looking for sympathy, just wanting to introduce myself. jerry",
