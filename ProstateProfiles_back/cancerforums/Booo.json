      "Content": "G) Gleason 3+3 was 10% in the first report. I think they sent everything they had. They sent 38 slides. 3 of each but 4 of G & H. The first pathologist also stained G & H so they may be why there was an extra slide of those. Not sure about a 3rd opinion because I too think it would be hard to beat Hopkins. And we also had to pay on our own for the Hopkins because the Dr would not fill out the paper work..said it was not needed (the paper work ) Looking for a new Dr. I am hoping to is good news for husband and not just another biopsy...but ya got to be sure about this stuff.",
