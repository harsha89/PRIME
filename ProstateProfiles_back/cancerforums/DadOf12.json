      "Content": "Originally Posted by WifeinWorry Would there be any reason why a PSA blood work results be different from one lab than the other? curious... WifeinWorry, Different labs use different \"assays\"; which is a fancy term for how they measure the PSA, and what is the lower limit of their equipment. The old standard assay only measured as low as 0.1. Anything under that was considered undetectable. Then they came out with a more sensitive assay (which mine is) that measures down to 0.06. Anything below that was considered undetectable. Then they came out with the ultra-sensitive assay; which can measure down to 0.01. If your lab uses a particular assay, and then you switch to another lab which uses a different assay, you cannot be sure that you are measuring apples to apples. The underlying method of measuring the PSA could actually be different between assays. If you do switch to another lab which uses a different assay; they suggest 3 PSA tests with the new one before you can be sure that the measurements are accurate. Hope that helps, Bob",

In regards to your question, I did find this site: http://meetinglibrary.asco.org/content/129472-144 which is an Abstract dealing with ASAP, which was presented at a Prostate Cancer annual meeting. Here is the relevant information: Conclusions: Our results demonstrate that a limited number of patients (37.5%) with an initial diagnosis of ASAP went on to develop prostate cancer if they had a repeat biopsy within 2.5 years. Of the 37.5% who progressed, 76.3% developed low risk prostate cancer defined by D\u0092amico criteria. Significantly, no patients developed high risk disease following an initial diagnosis of ASAP. Based on this information we recommend that an ASAP diagnosis be managed with active surveillance. This would include PSA and DRE at 4-6 month intervals followed by a repeat biopsy at one year. So, it sounds like there is a low possibility (just over one third of patients) indicating a chance of low-risk PCa, and a very slight indicator of medium-risk PCa. So, your uro's recommendation sounds reasonable. Hopefully, you will stay out of The Club. -Bob",

And mine didn't just show the cancer pushing against the wall; it had broken out. But my surgeon was aggressive in his cutting, and I had negative surgical margins - that is a good thing. That was 2 years ago next week. So, even with worse final numbers than your hubby, I have gone 2 years in the Zero Club. No PSA has been detected. I still get a PSA test every 4 months, because of my numbers; but it has become much less stressful than the first year. So hang on to your hope. There is life after surgery, even if the final pathology turned out worse than you expected it to. Keep us posted, and I agree that more info from the final pathology report would be helpful. -Bob",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by masbirdies Thanks everyone! I feel well prepared now. Results tomorrow, I'll be sure to report the findings masbirdies, Look at the pathology report very closely. And remember that there are no dumb questions! If you don't understand a term, ask! I second the idea of getting a copy of the report, if they don't give you one. It took me a couple of reads, after I got home, before I noticed the terms \"extensive perineural and angiolymphatic invasion identified\". I knew what perineural invasion was; but I had no clue what angiolymphatic invasion meant. FYI, it means that they found cancer cells in the blood vessels of the prostate; which means it had ample opportunity to get out; hence my rising PSA 3 years later. The next visit I asked my uro what that meant, and he enlightened me. That brings up another point; don't think that you can only ask questions at the time he goes over it. If you are looking at it later, and you have a question, ask it at your next visit. If your uro is like mine, he is glad to answer any questions. But if I don't ask, he has no way of knowing that I don't understand something. Good luck on the report! -Bob",

      "Content": "Hello Dshinnick, Other than that little bit of G7(3+4), it looks like a very good path report. I think the \"one possible lymph node\" comment comes from the nature of lymph nodes. As my doctor explained it to me, lymph nodes are not these easily identifiable discrete objects. They are not always easy to identify from surrounding tissue. The pathologist uses that kind of terminology to basically CYA. They assume that it is a lymph node, because that's what it was labelled as when removed. They examine the tissue and look for any cancer cells. Obviously, nothing was found in it; or they would have mentioned it. Congrats on a very good path report! -Bob",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by tmack1 Can anyone shed light on the meaning of the \"less than one high power field\" used in both the 'margins' explanation and the extraprostatic extension explanation?? tmack1 I found this here:http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1502366 Extraprostatic Extension Because the prostate lacks a discrete capsule, the term \u201cextraprostatic extension\u201d has replaced \u201ccapsular penetration\u201d to describe tumor that has extended out of the prostate into periprostatic soft tissue. In some cases, because of the desmoplastic response, it can be difficult to judge whether the tumor has extended out of the gland or is within the fibrous tissue of the prostate. This can be resolved by looking at the adjacent edge of the prostate on scanning magnification to see whether the normal rounded contour of the gland has been altered by a protuberance corresponding to extension of tumor into the periprostatic tissue. In palpable cancers (T2), extraprostatic extension preferentially occurs posteriorly and posterolaterally by perineural invasion. In transition zone cancers found in stage T1b and some T1c tumors, extraprostatic extension occurs anteriorly, usually by direct stromal invasion without prominent perineural invasion. Dr. Epstein designates cases in which only a few glands are seen outside the prostate as \u201cfocal\u201d (less than one high-power field on no more than two sections), whereas cases with more extensive extraprostatic spread are designated \u201cestablished extraprostatic extension.\u201d Other methods of quantifying the extent of extraprostatic extension based on the depth of penetration, the width of penetration, or the length multiplied by the width do not correlate with progression. So, it sounds like your pathology report is saying it was not much of an extension. That means it IS good news! Hope that helps. Bob",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by Bravehardon Sorry to hear that news Dad. In my opinion you should consult an oncologist specializing in prostate cancer. A year after RALPH my PSA began climbing. At 0.17 I met with an oncologist and elected to go with salvage radiation. I had 33 rounds with zero side affects after almost 2 years. My Gleason was 7 (3+4) Good Luck Allen Thanks, Allen. The med-onc we consulted with does specialize in PCa, so I am pretty confident in her assessment. I just wanted to hear what others had to say who have been where I am now. As far as SRT side-effects, my biggest concern is aggravating incontinence. My surgeon cut very aggressively during my surgery, because he could see, once he got in there that the cancer had escaped. I have total ED, since he did not spare the nerves. After 3 years, I still have some very mild incontinence - I wear an ultralite pad every day just for the occasion dribble. Some of my reading indicated the SRT could make that worse. How about fatigue - did you experience any of that? That is another prominent SE I have read about with SRT. Thanks for your input! -Bob",

      "Content": "Well; it appears that the Beast is back, and I will soon have to seek other treatment. April was 3 years since my RALP. Until January, I had been undetectable - < 0.06. In January, and again in March, it was 0.08. In June, it was 0.11. I visited a medical oncologist last week and she said it does appear to be the beginnings of BCR. She wants me to get my next PSA in September, to see if they can get a better handle on velocity. She suggested SRT after I get the new PSA number, even though most of my numbers suggest it is not local. She said I had a 20-30% chance of still obtaining a cure, if it is local. As you can see by my stats; and acknowledged by the med-onc; the only thing that suggests local recurrence is the somewhat slow rise in the PSA. My Gleason score, stage, negative margins, and time to recurrence suggest that it is distant. While it would be great to still have a shot at a cure; the possibility of side-effects with the SRT does not thrill me, especially if it wouldn't do any good with a distant recurrence. Has anyone here faced similar stats? Did you go with the SRT, and did it work? I am still undecided. At least I have until September to make a decision. Do you think it would be helpful to talk to a rad-onc, and get their thoughts? My first inclination is that a rad-onc would just say to get the SRT. Thanks, Bob",

I just like to be as sure as possible; and I have always found very helpful information on this forum from those who have gone before me in this journey. Thanks for the advice.

      "Content": "Originally Posted by Bravehardon Sorry to hear that news Dad. In my opinion you should consult an oncologist specializing in prostate cancer. A year after RALPH my PSA began climbing. At 0.17 I met with an oncologist and elected to go with salvage radiation. I had 33 rounds with zero side affects after almost 2 years. My Gleason was 7 (3+4) Good Luck Allen Thanks, Allen. The med-onc we consulted with does specialize in PCa, so I am pretty confident in her assessment. I just wanted to hear what others had to say who have been where I am now. As far as SRT side-effects, my biggest concern is aggravating incontinence. My surgeon cut very aggressively during my surgery, because he could see, once he got in there that the cancer had escaped. I have total ED, since he did not spare the nerves. After 3 years, I still have some very mild incontinence - I wear an ultralite pad every day just for the occasion dribble. Some of my reading indicated the SRT could make that worse. How about fatigue - did you experience any of that? That is another prominent SE I have read about with SRT. Thanks for your input! -Bob",
