I'm a year behind you on the surgery, so you've that much more time to build frustration. I also leak like an inner city fire hydrant in the summer, so take this advice as you will. You might try compression rings and see if they help. You'll have to find a balance between effectiveness and comfort. (Hint: Start large and work your way down, and double up before moving to the next smaller size. To wit; try a 9, then 8, then before moving to a 7, try the 8 and 9 together.)",

You are a month my senior in the PCa world and a decade my junior by the calendar, so take this as you will. To help avoid your ED depression, do these 3 things. 1. Buck it up yourself. Find any reason that you can that today is possibly the best day of your life. This can be something fleeting such as a beautiful sunrise or the smell of your first (and probably only) cup of coffee of the day. For other more meaningful things, when you look at your wife, reflect on the great times you've had together, then realize that she's still there with you. If you have children, do the same. Lastly, take the time to make everyone who you encounter today feel good about the interactions they had with you. Try to curtail the normal bitching you'd do in a day. The fucker that cut you off in traffic? He didn't cut you off, you chose to let him in. 2. Make emotional love to your wife. Each and every day, make it one of your tasks to full on seduce your wife. Realize that she's seen all of your old tricks. (Some of which will still work.) Learn new ways to convince her she is making the right choice by choosing you, over all others, yet again. Take her out for a nice ($$$) dinner, or cook a nice one up at home. It's probably pretty damn cold in Northern Illinois right now. (Wait a minute, wrong line of new thinking, replace 'pretty damn cold' in that last sentence with 'delightfully brisk'.) Go for a nature walk. If she's into it, hold her hand when you walk. Remember, the goal here is to make your wife fall in love with you each day. The goal is not to keep the status quo, but to build new, stronger bonds between you two. 3. Get physically intimate, in both a non-sexual way and a sexual way. a. This builds on #2 above, but now you're touching. Every day, you had better be touching your wife. You're not aiming to have sex. That's not the end game. Full body hugs are great. If appropriate, kiss her on the neck and tell her you love her. Notice her perfume? She put that on for you, comment on it. When's the last time you brushed your wife's hair? Make sure to take your time. When done brushing, lightly massage her face with your fingertips. Hot oil massages are nice. While keeping it non-sexual is difficult, it can be done. Don't avoid touching her lady bits, just remember that this is supposed to be a full body massage, and not an excuse to grope. Avoid using water soluble oils/lubes, as they dry and get tacky too fast. You'll need to follow the massage with an equally pleasant shower/bath. (If while you were buying the massage stuff, you thought to add some bath soaps, a couple of big fluffy towels, a luxurious bath robe, possibly slippers, her favorite wine and some chocolates, then you can quit reading now, you've graduated.) b. Sex. Going to avoid the details here, there's another website that's more appropriate for this. Surprisingly, not many couples have actually had an honest discussion about what they enjoy and don't enjoy. Get this out of the way. After the discussions about your fantasies, and etc., It's adult show and tell and answer time. You go first. Get cleaned up, get your pads if you still have incontinence issues, draw the curtains, and get naked. (It's a good idea to let your wife know what you're intending to do before hand.) Tell your wife everything she's ever wanted to know about your body. Explain what you feel when she does X to you. Show her where and how to touch you. Be frank, open and honest about it. When it's her turn, be sure to ask questions. Lots & lots of questions. If you are like most couples, you are generally the initiator. Have your wife pick up some of that. One way to help you and your worries about ED, is to have your wife initiate sex with you. It demonstrates that your wife desires you and is sexually interested in you. That will probably relieve a lot or your angst about ED. If you can't have erections, there's other types of sex you can have. We also added toys for each of us to our play. (PM me and I will tell you which ones. Both are *very* effective, and can produce an orgasm in just a few minutes.) Anyway, this discussion has gone on long enough that it's bordering on making me uncomfortable about posting it here.

You are a month my senior in the PCa world and a decade my junior by the calendar, so take this as you will. To help avoid your ED depression, do these 3 things. 1. Buck it up yourself. Find any reason that you can that today is possibly the best day of your life. This can be something fleeting such as a beautiful sunrise or the smell of your first (and probably only) cup of coffee of the day. For other more meaningful things, when you look at your wife, reflect on the great times you've had together, then realize that she's still there with you. If you have children, do the same. Lastly, take the time to make everyone who you encounter today feel good about the interactions they had with you. Try to curtail the normal bitching you'd do in a day. The fucker that cut you off in traffic? He didn't cut you off, you chose to let him in. 2. Make emotional love to your wife. Each and every day, make it one of your tasks to full on seduce your wife. Realize that she's seen all of your old tricks. (Some of which will still work.) Learn new ways to convince her she is making the right choice by choosing you, over all others, yet again. Take her out for a nice ($$$) dinner, or cook a nice one up at home. It's probably pretty damn cold in Northern Illinois right now. (Wait a minute, wrong line of new thinking, replace 'pretty damn cold' in that last sentence with 'delightfully brisk'.) Go for a nature walk. If she's into it, hold her hand when you walk. Remember, the goal here is to make your wife fall in love with you each day. The goal is not to keep the status quo, but to build new, stronger bonds between you two. 3. Get physically intimate, in both a non-sexual way and a sexual way. a. This builds on #2 above, but now you're touching. Every day, you had better be touching your wife. You're not aiming to have sex. That's not the end game. Full body hugs are great. If appropriate, kiss her on the neck and tell her you love her. Notice her perfume? She put that on for you, comment on it. When's the last time you brushed your wife's hair? Make sure to take your time. When done brushing, lightly massage her face with your fingertips. Hot oil massages are nice. While keeping it non-sexual is difficult, it can be done. Don't avoid touching her lady bits, just remember that this is supposed to be a full body massage, and not an excuse to grope. Avoid using water soluble oils/lubes, as they dry and get tacky too fast. You'll need to follow the massage with an equally pleasant shower/bath. (If while you were buying the massage stuff, you thought to add some bath soaps, a couple of big fluffy towels, a luxurious bath robe, possibly slippers, her favorite wine and some chocolates, then you can quit reading now, you've graduated.) b. Sex. Going to avoid the details here, there's another website that's more appropriate for this. Surprisingly, not many couples have actually had an honest discussion about what they enjoy and don't enjoy. Get this out of the way. After the discussions about your fantasies, and etc., It's adult show and tell and answer time. You go first. Get cleaned up, get your pads if you still have incontinence issues, draw the curtains, and get naked. (It's a good idea to let your wife know what you're intending to do before hand.) Tell your wife everything she's ever wanted to know about your body. Explain what you feel when she does X to you. Show her where and how to touch you. Be frank, open and honest about it. When it's her turn, be sure to ask questions. Lots & lots of questions. If you are like most couples, you are generally the initiator. Have your wife pick up some of that. One way to help you and your worries about ED, is to have your wife initiate sex with you. It demonstrates that your wife desires you and is sexually interested in you. That will probably relieve a lot or your angst about ED. If you can't have erections, there's other types of sex you can have. We also added toys for each of us to our play. (PM me and I will tell you which ones. Both are *very* effective, and can produce an orgasm in just a few minutes.) Anyway, this discussion has gone on long enough that it's bordering on making me uncomfortable about posting it here. Chuck: If I need to edit anything down, please let me know and I'll do it. --Mike",

      "Content": "Started kegels multiple times a day, 2 months prior to surgery. 2 months after surgery, I cut back to the mayo method as posted in the sticky. For the past 3 months, I'm back to multiple times a day. I walked prior to surgery, usually between 5 - 10 miles a day in moderate hilly country. I was walking the halls of the hospital the day and most of the night after surgery. After surgery I upped the walking to 10 - 15 miles a day, sometimes quite a bit further. (Have you ever walked off a few of your toe nails? I hadn't either until this fall.) I started physical therapy a few months ago. Insurance approved 30 sessions. The first 18 sessions were local and all of them involved riding a NuStep for 10 minutes, then a series of exercises aimed at improving my 'core' muscles. (Planks: facedown, faceup, sideways, on the floor, on a ball. Isolating adductor/abductor muscles against tension. Abdominal work, etc.) I stepped up and down wooden blocks. Anything the three therapists could think of to strengthen my core. They added in doing a kegel before each repetition, then during the exercises. I bought identical devices that I was using at PT for home use, except for the NuStep, for that I now have a gym membership. I use them daily. I have a strong core. Quoting RobLee: I can crack walnuts with my ass. The last 12 sessions were with a physical therapist in the next city over, one who actually possesses a certification for pelvic floor rehab. Where we also worked the core muscles, this time with the addition of a bio-feedback device glued to my butt and the treadmill replacing the NuStep. The bio-feedback device confirms that I am indeed contracting the right muscles, the lights indicating the strength is there, also I have no problem relaxing the muscles. Interestingly, with the device, I did find that while stepping backward, or doing other things that take you out of your normal comfort zone cause me to lose focus on my kegel contraction momentarily. For the last few sessions, we've switched to stretching out the pelvic floor muscles. This involves two yoga poses and a couple of minor exercises, foregoing the core building except for when I am at the PT's office so that she can observe the bio-feedback readings. Also added in to the regimen was scar tissue release. Think tummy rubs, really deep tummy rubs, which start right above your pubis bone. Lastly was diet change. Lost anything that was on a list as a bladder irritant. Who knew a banana irritated anything? I am 11 months post surgery and leak like a sieve whenever I'm standing. As Consult1 stated, this is the leaky urine that you do not even feel until it has exited your body. I can easily hold back, 400 ml or more of urine with kegel power alone until I get to the bathroom. It's the insidious leakage that you don't know about until there's not a damn thing you can do about it. My urologist does not think I am a good candidate for collagen injections and states that a urethral sling might help but, he thinks that I'm either going to eventually solve this myself or be headed for the artificial sphincter. On a side note, and possibly a contributing issue; the surgeon remarked that when he and his assistant were inserting the arms of the robot, they had a dickens of a time due to the surgical planes not being where they should have been. Apparently previous damage to my pelvic area had distorted things quite enough that it was confusing to a seasoned surgeon. (Wrecks and such what not as a child and an adult.)",

Quoting RobLee: I can crack walnuts with my ass. The last 12 sessions were with a physical therapist in the next city over, one who actually possesses a certification for pelvic floor rehab. Where we also worked the core muscles, this time with the addition of a bio-feedback device glued to my butt and the treadmill replacing the NuStep. The bio-feedback device confirms that I am indeed contracting the right muscles, the lights indicating the strength is there, also I have no problem relaxing the muscles. Interestingly, with the device, I did find that while stepping backward, or doing other things that take you out of your normal comfort zone cause me to lose focus on my kegel contraction momentarily. For the last few sessions, we've switched to stretching out the pelvic floor muscles. This involves two yoga poses and a couple of minor exercises, foregoing the core building except for when I am at the PT's office so that she can observe the bio-feedback readings. Also added in to the regimen was scar tissue release. Think tummy rubs, really deep tummy rubs, which start right above your pubis bone. Lastly was diet change. Lost anything that was on a list as a bladder irritant. Who knew a banana irritated anything? I am 11 months post surgery and leak like a sieve whenever I'm standing. As Consult1 stated, this is the leaky urine that you do not even feel until it has exited your body. I can easily hold back, 400 ml or more of urine with kegel power alone until I get to the bathroom. It's the insidious leakage that you don't know about until there's not a damn thing you can do about it. My urologist does not think I am a good candidate for collagen injections and states that a urethral sling might help but, he thinks that I'm either going to eventually solve this myself or be headed for the artificial sphincter. On a side note, and possibly a contributing issue; the surgeon remarked that when he and his assistant were inserting the arms of the robot, they had a dickens of a time due to the surgical planes not being where they should have been. Apparently previous damage to my pelvic area had distorted things quite enough that it was confusing to a seasoned surgeon. (Wrecks and such what not as a child and an adult.)",

      "Content": "Started kegels multiple times a day, 2 months prior to surgery. 2 months after surgery, I cut back to the mayo method as posted in the sticky. For the past 3 months, I'm back to multiple times a day. I walked prior to surgery, usually between 5 - 10 miles a day in moderate hilly country. I was walking the halls of the hospital the day and most of the night after surgery. After surgery I upped the walking to 10 - 15 miles a day, sometimes quite a bit further. (Have you ever walked off a few of your toe nails? I hadn't either until this fall.) I started physical therapy a few months ago. Insurance approved 30 sessions. The first 18 sessions were local and all of them involved riding a NuStep for 10 minutes, then a series of exercises aimed at improving my 'core' muscles. (Planks: facedown, faceup, sideways, on the floor, on a ball. Isolating adductor/abductor muscles against tension. Abdominal work, etc.) I stepped up and down wooden blocks.

      "Content": "I'm currently taking PT for my incontinence issue. (New definition of 'Wet Willy'.) The therapist has put me on the biofeedback machine (STR-10) which helps show me how my pelvic floor muscles are performing with the kegels. This has been enormously helpful the three times I have tried it. Monday I'm due to try out an electrical stimulator device. (Ride 'em cowboy!) This will probably be the STM-10 device. With a prescription I can rent/buy the devices, but since my insurance is quite lame, it might be better economically if I can buy the used machines. (Not the probe or patches, though.) I understand that E-Stim shows no improvement over manual kegels after 8 weeks, but I'd sure like to give it a try. PM me, if you have a used device to sell for a reasonable price. --Mike",

If you're comfortable with doing so you can swap out the bed bag with a leg bag and use the straps on your calf, then it's simply lift the lid, aim away from your sock and let fly. Then close valve, dab with toilet paper and go back out 'normal like'. This allows you to wear loose fitting normal trousers. Also, if you have a canvas shopping bag, they are good to make your bag a little more incognito if you don't go with the sweat pants. Also, you might want a robe unless you trust the hospital gown to stay tied while you're walking around the hospital. --Mike",

      "Content": "Drake-- There will be a regimen to follow: Basically you'll create vacuum to enlarge your penis, hold the vacuum for a while then repeat the process. Usually, 15 to 30 mins. Caveats: If you're still incontinent, you'll have to watch the urine levels in the tube. Avoid getting urine in the pump. If need be, buy a water based VED. Lube the tube before use, otherwise the skin will stick to the side of the tube and get quite painful. Don't overdo the pressure. The pump is stronger than you think and can rupture things. Pump as long as it's comfortable. If it gets painful, you're overdoing it and need to back the pressure off. --Mike",

I think you accept slight rounding errors. I'm stoked and ready to become a member of this 'Zero Club'. I know I joined the PCa club not too long ago, but I would much prefer to be in this shiny new club. The only negative I know about that having me join the club is I'm apt to dribble a tad on the floors, unless I've had coffee, in which case it's quite a bit more than a tad. I will volunteer to carry a mop and bucket while on the premises though. I await your responses. PS; No more hazing. That PCa club had some pretty brutal hazing to it. Thanks in advance! --Mike",

      "Content": "Dear Members of the Zero Club, I received my first PSA results today after having Da Vinci surgery in January. The results are 'PSA <0.01'. I think you accept slight rounding errors. I'm stoked and ready to become a member of this 'Zero Club'. I know I joined the PCa club not too long ago, but I would much prefer to be in this shiny new club. The only negative I know about that having me join the club is I'm apt to dribble a tad on the floors, unless I've had coffee, in which case it's quite a bit more than a tad. I will volunteer to carry a mop and bucket while on the premises though. I await your responses. PS; No more hazing. That PCa club had some pretty brutal hazing to it. Thanks in advance! --Mike",

      "Content": "Sawdust-- The VED elongates and fills your penis via vacuum. If you're considering one there are two main types. Wet and Dry. You take the wet type into the shower with you. It gets filled with water, then yourself. If you're still rather incontinent, this is the way to go as it's used to working wet anyway. I do NOT have the wet type. If you go with the dry, you're also going to need to lube the tube. If you don't, your penis will bind on the side of the tube and painfully make some rather interesting shapes. This also brings up something else, whatever you get, make sure it has an EMERGENCY RELEASE BUTTON. Side note: Remember the good ol' magic trick that involved a peeled boiled egg getting sucked, virtually unscathed, into an old fashioned milk bottle by the vacuum left by cooling air from an extinguished match? When the VED is substituting for the bottle and one of your testicles becomes the substitute for the egg, this is one of the reasons for the emergency release button. In addition to therapy, you can use the VED to inflate your penis enough to get you a semi woody for penetration. Once inflated, you put a retention ring to hold the blood in your penis and then you have a stuffable penis for awhile. Note: Due to the fact that the blood brought back into the penis is held there by a retention ring, your penis will be get cool and be slightly discolored. The Viberect is a vibrator for men. I have NOT used the viberect. What it does is vibrate your penis at a specified frequency and is supposed to help you orgasm. In combination with the ED drugs you've been prescribed, it should tirelessly provide the stimulus your penis needs in order for the drugs to do their job of getting the blood there. Since you're taking Cialis this is an anytime thing. I do use a different toy to help in the orgasm department. That toy vibrates a pad that you locate near or on your frenulum. It is waterproof, you can just drop it in your pullups. As others have noted here on these boards, your new 'Orgasm 2.0' will be rather different than before. I find mine (with the toy) to be MUCH more intense that what I had prior to the prostatectomy. You can involve your significant other with either of these devices. They can help you with the VED, or they can use the vibrator on or with you. I bought my wife a toy at the same time I bought mine. Fair is fair, right? Using them on each other usually works well and has the desired results. Left to our own devices, (Heh!), the toys usually run less than two minutes. If you have an interest you can PM me and I will tell you brand names on the VED and toys we use, otherwise I'll not advertise. --Mike",

      "Content": "Mark-- I have an air type pump. I bought it prior to surgery in anticipation of needing it. I have NOT used the water based pumps. As Highlander said, it can be somewhat painful, usually that is the result of getting a bit too aggressive on the pump. From everything I had read, the best results seemed to come from the air based pumps by men using them in one or two 30 minutes sessions. Surprisingly you will need lube to use an air pump. Without lube, little Mark will have a tendency to get firmly stuck on the side of the tube, while the rest keeps inflating. This is another source of pain, and also brings up the reason for having an emergency release button on the device. Another source of pain is when one or both of your nuts attempt to join the fun. Again, the emergency release button is important. Your device should provide a shield to help mitigate this and to generally help in providing a seal. Whatever pump you get (if any), you're going to need to get a compression ring onto the base of your penis. As Highlander stated, deflation happens quickly. The pump I got came with a set of compression rings, numbered 3 (smallest) to 9. They all look small, you'll have a tendency to go bigger than you need. Trial and error here. Remember that once you manage to stuff it in, a vagina, being a pretty strong muscle, is actively going to be undoing your inflation bit. Smaller compression ring. The pump I have has a twist mechanism to slide a ring off the tube and onto your penis. In fact it can handle two rings at the same time. So, prior to surgery, while I did have some partial ED I found a 7 ring worked well. After surgery notes: I can get some time in the saddle so to speak, but apparently I'm still working on the appropriate ring size now with complete ED. The 7 ring was a complete and literal let down. Second and very important note, incontinence is a bitch and doesn't add much to the awkward romantic settings that we try and set up. But an important note none the less. With an air pump, the pump is not expecting to handle liquid. If you still have control issues like me, you're going to get to experience a wet pump anyway, it just won't be water. You'll have to keep the pump pointed up to keep the urine from entering the pump while maintaining suction. Remember, at some point you're going to want to impress you're partner with what you're going to pull out of that tube? You had better make your way to the bathroom before breaking the vacuum connection, if not, you'd both better be into water sports. To wrap this up, if you are not getting erections any other way, do use a pump, it will help to stretch your penis. Keep in mind that you can stretch your penis by hand. If you go the pump route, be prepared to have a few failures for various reasons first. --Mike",

You should be able to achieve orgasms now. It's more difficult without an erection but it should be manageable manually or with a little help from electronics. The Viberect, can be prescribed by your Dr. This gizmo uses vibrations to stimulate you to orgasm. I DO NOT OWN NOR HAVE I TRIED THE VIBERECT. Another device is an egg shaped gizmo that you lay your penis in and it then stimulates your frenulum vigorously and brings you to orgasm. Works on an erect or flaccid penis. I DO HAVE THIS. PM me for the name if interested. Then there's the manual method that most of us mastered as teenagers. You can use a pump to help give yourself a little more to work with or not. I find the restriction rings used to keep the erection dampen the feeling from my penis which requires a little faster stimulation by hand. In any event, while waiting for things to get back to normal, you can have orgasms. They will most likely be absolutely dry orgasms and they will be different. In my case, they are far more intense and have a longer duration. Good luck. --Mike",

      "Content": "Jagle-- As Chuck mentioned, the procedure takes about 15 mins for the 12 core biopsy. The process: You'll be given a prescription for an antibiotic that you'll take before and after the biopsy. You'll undress and get in a gown. Then you'll most likely lay on your side (some men are on their back in stirrups), with your butt almost off the table, knees drawn up towards your chest. Your doctor at this point may numb your anus. If you want this done, make sure you ask the Dr to do so, before your appointment so they can have it ready. (Also, you could ask for a calming pill of sorts.) The Dr will then insert a really, really, really, well lubed probe up your rectum. The probe will stay there the entire time. The Dr will move drugs and cores in and out through the probe. The probe has ultra sound and the Dr will use this to find your prostate. You'll get a shot or two of lidocaine to your rectum. If you haven't had any other pain meds, you'll feel this. Not near as intense as a shot to the back of the mouth at the dentists, but more like a little sting. You'll get several shots of lidocaine to your prostate. Again not painful per se, but you will feel this. The Dr will then (assuming a standard 12 core biopsy) pull a 3 row, 4 column grid of core samples from your prostate. For each core, you'll likely feel some pressure for about 1-2 seconds as the needle is inserted, then you'll hear a loud snap as the core is pulled. In my case, I felt each core as the needle was inserted. To me is was sharp, but bearable. My wife says that my eyes went wide each time. After the biopsy, you'll be seated upright and given a chance to clean up. If you bring a light weight feminine pad that will help keep your underwear from getting messy. (Or just make judicious use of the Dr's paper towels. You'll wait a week to get your biopsy results. Your urine might show blood for a bit. Mine was a very light pinkish color the day of the biopsy, not noticeable after that. Your ejaculate will show blood for a bit also. Lets just say you'll have full sympathy, if you don't already, for the fairer sex's monthly issues. Mine cleared up in less than a week with daily ejaculations. In any event, as far as pain goes, the biopsy will probably not be the worst thing you'll have felt. Probably not in the top ten. --Mike",

      "Content": "BeIll-- Welcome to the forum. Glad you found us. The first thing you'll want to do is get a physical copy of your biopsy pathology report. It will list the details about each core sample. Where on the prostate the core was taken, how long the sample was; and on your 7's, whether it was a 3+4=7 or a 4+3=7. You'll also want to look at the sticky towards the top of this forum regarding how to edit/update your forum signature. Then you can put the info about family history, PSA/DRE tests and pathology into a signature and not be asked about it. They say that things slow down here on the weekends, but there will be several very well read people coming along with some questions and excellent advice. --Mike",

      "Content": "Jagle-- As Chuck mentioned, the procedure takes about 15 mins for the 12 core biopsy. The process: You'll be given a prescription for an antibiotic that you'll take before and after the biopsy. You'll undress and get in a gown. Then you'll most likely lay on your side (some men are on their back in stirrups), with your butt almost off the table, knees drawn up towards your chest. Your doctor at this point may numb your anus. If you want this done, make sure you ask the Dr to do so, before your appointment so they can have it ready. (Also, you could ask for a calming pill of sorts.) The Dr will then insert a really, really, really, well lubed probe up your rectum. The probe will stay there the entire time. The Dr will move drugs and cores in and out through the probe. The probe has ultra sound and the Dr will use this to find your prostate. You'll get a shot or two of lidocaine to your rectum. If you haven't had any other pain meds, you'll feel this. Not near as intense as a shot to the back of the mouth at the dentists, but more like a little sting. You'll get several shots of lidocaine to your prostate. Again not painful per se, but you will feel this. The Dr will then (assuming a standard 12 core biopsy) pull a 3 row, 4 column grid of core samples from your prostate. For each core, you'll likely feel some pressure for about 1-2 seconds as the needle is inserted, then you'll hear a loud snap as the core is pulled. In my case, I felt each core as the needle was inserted. To me is was sharp, but bearable. My wife says that my eyes went wide each time. After the biopsy, you'll be seated upright and given a chance to clean up. If you bring a light weight feminine pad that will help keep your underwear from getting messy.

And yet...here I am, a neophyte, joining the club. I am sure I will have questions. Still wrapping my head around the whole PC thing. I'm glad to have some knowledgeable people that I can ask questions when I have them. From what I've seen, you guys (and gals) have been forthright and frank in your answers, and have managed to build a very supportive community here. I have DaVinci surgery scheduled for early January. So until then, I'll be practicing Kegels and learning more. Just thought I'd officially say \"Hi.\". I also understand that since I'm now in this club, I should be aspiring to become a member in good standing of the \"Zero Club\"? Does my signature need to have anything added or deleted? --Mike",

Other sites make the case that Vasoline, due to being petroleum based, can damage the catheter. In one study, the effects of 4 different lubes were tried on Foley catheters over the period of 5 days. Each lube was tested with 20 catheters each. At the end of 5 days, there were 20 catheter balloon ruptures, all of them involved the catheters where the Vasoline was used.",

      "Content": "I saw a highly recommended urologist locally (E David Crawford). He ordered a urine test called Select MDX. The result of that test was VERY LOW RISK. It said I indicate a 98% probability that I have PC with a Gleason greater than 7 and 99% for Gleason greater than 8. This all seems like very good news. My follow up is next Wed. Chris, something is off on your statement. You say VERY LOW RISK, which would be good, then you say \"I indicate a 98% probability that I have PC with a Gleason greater than 7 and 99% for Gleason greater than 8\" which would be bad. Did you mean less than Gleason 7 or 8?",

Each lube was tested with 20 catheters each. At the end of 5 days, there were 20 catheter balloon ruptures, all of them involved the catheters where the Vasoline was used.",

      "Content": "Jagle-- As Chuck mentioned, the procedure takes about 15 mins for the 12 core biopsy. The process: You'll be given a prescription for an antibiotic that you'll take before and after the biopsy. You'll undress and get in a gown. Then you'll most likely lay on your side (some men are on their back in stirrups), with your butt almost off the table, knees drawn up towards your chest. Your doctor at this point may numb your anus. If you want this done, make sure you ask the Dr to do so, before your appointment so they can have it ready. (Also, you could ask for a calming pill of sorts.) The Dr will then insert a really, really, really, well lubed probe up your rectum. The probe will stay there the entire time. The Dr will move drugs and cores in and out through the probe. The probe has ultra sound and the Dr will use this to find your prostate. You'll get a shot or two of lidocaine to your rectum. If you haven't had any other pain meds, you'll feel this. Not near as intense as a shot to the back of the mouth at the dentists, but more like a little sting. You'll get several shots of lidocaine to your prostate. Again not painful per se, but you will feel this. The Dr will then (assuming a standard 12 core biopsy) pull a 3 row, 4 column grid of core samples from your prostate. For each core, you'll likely feel some pressure for about 1-2 seconds as the needle is inserted, then you'll hear a loud snap as the core is pulled. In my case, I felt each core as the needle was inserted. To me is was sharp, but bearable. My wife says that my eyes went wide each time. After the biopsy, you'll be seated upright and given a chance to clean up. If you bring a light weight feminine pad that will help keep your underwear from getting messy. (Or just make judicious use of the Dr's paper towels. You'll wait a week to get your biopsy results. Your urine might show blood for a bit. Mine was a very light pinkish color the day of the biopsy, not noticeable after that. Your ejaculate will show blood for a bit also. Lets just say you'll have full sympathy, if you don't already, for the fairer sex's monthly issues. Mine cleared up in less than a week with daily ejaculations. In any event, as far as pain goes, the biopsy will probably not be the worst thing you'll have felt. Probably not in the top ten. --Mike",
