    "Content": "I have stage 3 prostate cancer and finished 45 radiaiton treatments last Oct. My doc has me taking Lupron shots every 90 days with the last one scheduled for March of 2015. I have a few questions I would like to ask this forum. After I started taking the shots my legs started hurting when sitting or laying down. The pain is mostly in my calfs and my skin is sensitive to the touch. Has anyone else experienced this? I was on my wifes insurance last year and most of the cost was covered. I had to change insurance in Jan. Blue Cross has an existing conditions clause that will not cover the shots until Oct of 2014. The bill for my February shot was $ 4,428, I thought that was very high but have not been able to find out very much. Have any of you guys had to pay for the shot out of pocket? Thanks",
