      "Content": "When I was initially diagnosed in June 2011, my PSA was 25.3 and a Gleason of 9. I had Brachy in Nov. 2011 followed by EBRT. My PSA went to zero until Aug. 2013 when it went up to .2. three months later it was .4 and three months after that it was 1.2. At that point, my doctor said I had biochemical recurrence. So I started taking Lupron again in Feb of this year and my PSA is once again at zero. A bone scan in Feb showed two small bone mets, so I'm definitely having a recurrence. So far the Lupron is keeping my PSA at zero.",
