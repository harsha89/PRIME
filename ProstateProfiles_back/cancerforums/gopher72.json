Despite being semi-religious about doctor recommended daily kegel exercises, I continue to experience a healthy release of urine during sex. This after draining my bladder before sex. I experience very little dripping during the day. But I wonder if any of you has found an answer to this problem. Thank you.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by HighlanderCFH Hi there, gopher, Welcome to the forum. About half of prostatectomy patients have this problem after surgery, including myself. But it is usually only temporary as part of the healing process and goes away. I would think that yours should be cleared up by now, although I also wonder how many kegel exercises you are doing? My instructions from Mayo Clinic were to just do a total of SEVEN REPS per day -- and that too many reps can actually weaken the muscles. Let's see what others say..... Thanks to you and those who responded. Sounds like this is just something to live with. Not that big a deal compared to keeping this cancer in sleep mode.",
