    "Content": "ok if life hasn't put enough in my plate. I have Huntington's disease. Then they came up and told me that i have type 2 diabetes. Now comes my psa fun. Last year my PSA score was 4.3. a year later it went up to 8.5. so Doctor wanted to redo test in 6 weeks. well six weeks is up and test results are not any better. went up another 5 points to 13.5. I have learnt that my brother also has Prostate cancer. sounds like I might be on the higher risk of getting it. what are some of your thoughts. I go for biopsy next Wednesday doing it under IV sedation. I have a real fear of needles and this would be the best way for my to hold still and get it done right",
