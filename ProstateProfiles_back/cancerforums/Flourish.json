    "Content": "My husband had brachytherapy 2 years ago for prostate cancer. Thankfully his cancer has been treated and I am so incredibly grateful he has made a recovery from such a horrible, scary and silent disease. The thing is, he has very much changed. The warm, caring, touching + loving man I married has literally disappeared. The specialtist told us his job is to keep him alive, but no one prepared us for these incredible personality and life changes. I am assuming it has many faucets, the physical, emotional and hormonal changes. I feel totally lost and have spoken to my husband about this and he also has found the transition to have been extremely difficult. Treatment is done and you are pushed out to deal with it all on your own but are not offered any form of support or clear knowledge as to what or why this has happened? My question is, how does ones marriage survive and thrive? It\u2019s like living with someone you don\u2019t know.",
