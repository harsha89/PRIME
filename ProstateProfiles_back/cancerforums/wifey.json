Sorry if this has been posted already but I'm on my phone and it's hard to trawl through. Also a heartfelt thanks to all the \"cancer boys\". Your advice has been invaluable to me and him by proxy",

He did go to the ER last month when it was insanely swollen. They didn't find any clots and didn't offer and treatment suggestions or ideas to treat it. I'm trying to find a lymphedema specialist for him now. He's pretty miserable about it.",

      "Content": "Just in case it's any help to you chaps. Viagra and cialis aren't covered under our insurance. After a lengthy talk with my insurance company (UHC), they told me that they have a contracted rate with CVS whereby it's still not covered but it's a hell of a lot cheaper. I did have to push for this and the initial answers were \"no it's not covered\". Sure enough I filled the RX yesterday and with his pain meds, bactrim, stool softener and cialis it only came to $75. So if you're having issues I highly recommend you talk to your insurance company about the contracted rate and which pharmacy they have it with. Hope this helped.",

      "Content": "We live in MA. My husband has just turned 60. He has no actual symptoms. His father had prostate cancer and his primary care doc found a ridge during his annual exam. It was the same urologist who did the biopsy. He's had an MRI and then an Atermis biopsy. I'm getting a copy of the MRI sent to me. Whilst we're not discounting HIFU or indeed any other treatment, the doc we saw who is apparently well known didn't exactly had a good bedside manner.",

      "Content": "This is where I get confused. Initially the doc we saw said it was Gleason 7 with 3+4 and then he said it was 3+3 then he said it was mainly 3+3 with some 3+4. I'd taken a note book in to take notes but he was glaring daggers at me and I was so stunned by everything that I didn't take notes. I've spoken to Mass General and they will see him. I'm getting as much of his lab work as I can and Mass General said 3 docs review it all and we'll meet with them. I think it's a radiation oncologist, a urologist oncologist and one other. My husband is understandably very down about it all so I'm setting up the appointments for him and doing as much research as I can so we go in with as full an understanding as we can. I'm trying to encourage him to come on these forums so he can read positive as well as realistic reviews from people like you who have been through it",

      "Content": "My husband just had his prostatectomy yesterday. They let me into recovery almost as soon as he came round and he was complaining of \"I'VE GOT TO PEE NOW\" which they said was pretty common and would wear off within 24 hours. He's home now and that sensation has lessened but his cath is causing him a lot of discomfort. He says it's a burning sensation and it makes him really hard to get comfortable for more than a couple of minutes. I know it's early days but is there anything I can do to make him more comfortable? His day bag was filling up really quickly so we put the night bag on instead so he doesn't have to keep getting up to empty it.",

I think he has a decently high pain threshold. He was in a bad accident in the army and has a load of metal in his feet and wrists so is used to chronic pain. If it stays like this I'll call his doc.",
