      "Content": "Hi Guy, When I investigated the Pittsburgh area for SBRT I had a hard time finding RO's using SBRT for PCa. They had the equipment; but, I had no luck finding anyone using it for PCa. The standard of care in our area for beam radiation is IMRT. We traveled to the Cleveland Clinic for treatment. My Dr. there said it was his opinion that SBRT would replace IMRT in the relatively near future. My experience was terrific. No pain, no long recovery, short treatment, no pads, no ED, no fatigue just the expected reduction in ejaculate. So far...so good. Traveling 2 1/2 hours each way for treatments was very much worth it for us.",

      "Content": "Denis, I've followed your posts on this as well as another forum and know and understand your commitment to learning as much about this disease as possible and an additional commitment to helping others. No one can tell you what treatment you should select since that's a very personal decision and everyone's situation and values is different. The best treatment would be what's best for you. As far as determining that I can only share my story and how I made my decision. If it doesn't help you it might help others following this thread. No matter what choice you make I would encourage everyone to learn as much as possible about their disease and seek out the very best practitioners they can find. After several years of rising PSA my family Dr. said it was time to see a Urologist. I asked what to expect from that visit and he said to expect a DRE and a probably biopsy. That's exactly what happened. Following the biopsy I got that phone call from my Urologist saying three of the twelve samples were positive with low volume Gleason 6. During the four weeks between that phone call and my follow-up visit with the Urologist I set about learning as much as possible about a disease I previously knew little about. My Urologist spent a lot of time going over the biopsy results, Partin Tables, statistics etc. and said if I elected to be treated he could remove the prostate or do Brachytherapy. With my newly acquired information I had a ton of questions including the different radiation options. He could answer some and others he confessed that I probably had more knowledge than he did. He suggested I consult with a Radiation Oncologist about the various beam radiation options since he was not familiar with them. He also said that my cancer was slow growing and that I had plenty of time to make an informed decision. I first looked at surgery to remove this cancer from my body; however, on deeper investigation I was very concerned about the relatively high rate of incontinence, ED, and a recovery time measured in months and the statistics that showed for a low risk guy like myself the cure rate was no higher than radiation. The quality of life issues were a real concern. Although I was 69 yo. I was in good health, despite three total joint replacements (arthritis) and remain very active. Pads, pills, pumps, injections, etc. caused us to quickly rule out surgery even though it had a significant advantage of knowing exactly how much cancer was present from the post operative pathology. The Partin Tables for my situation suggested that my cancer was fully contained so that advantage become much less important to us. Our local community hospital does Brachytherapy and I could do that with my Urologist in our home town. We live about an hour from Pittsburgh and although we have a lot of hospitals some associated with Universities the standard of care was IMRT with approximately 40-45 fractions (treatments). I had investigated SBRT (five fractions); however, I could not find anyone in Western PA using their SBRT equipment to treat PCa. I did find that Cleveland Clinic (CCF) offered all of the radiation options that I was interested in. Unfortunately CCF was 'out of network' for our insurance. We were able to work with our insurance and get an exemption for a consult with CCF. Following a more than two hour consult with a couple of Dr.'s and staff we came to the conclusion that I was an excellent candidate for SBRT. A lot of that two hours was spent discussing active surveillance. However, my three joint replacements would have been placed at unnecessary risk from the repeated biopsies necessary under AS. My treatment was very easy. We had a total of eight trips including one for the consult, one for the placement of the markers necessary to precisely guide the radiation, the third one for the imaging and simulation and then visits four though eight for the actual radiation treatments lasting less than ten minutes each. In addition to the loss of ejaculate I did have some mild burning on urination that lasted about a week or ten days. That resolved on its own with medication. I was able to maintain my active gym life including spinning classes (stationary bicycle) etc. throughout treatment. I drove the two and one half hour trips each way to Cleveland without any problems. Although it might not be for everyone, I'm very happy with my treatment choice. Statistics suggest that I have the same chance for a complete cure as if I had BT, IMRT, or surgery and five fractions verses forty five was a bonus.",

      "Content": "Hi Owen, I'm glad that you caught this early and that all indications are that the cancer is contained. After meeting with my Urolgist on the first appt. following diagnosis I thought removal was my best option. I also heard the part where they say once you have radiation you can no longer have surgery. Upon further investigation I found that was misleading. If your cancer returns following surgery it's almost certain you'll have radiation. If your cancer returns following radiation you will have the same radiation. I would focus on success rather than failure. Continue to learn, and question everything. You can only make the best decision after exploring all the options. The most challenging aspect of this disease for low and intermediate risk guys is that all the treatment options are available and they each carry different risks. You want to get this right. Good luck on the journey and take your time. I'm glad I didn't jump at the first treatment offered.",

      "Content": "Hi Owen, I'm glad that you caught this early and that all indications are that the cancer is contained. After meeting with my Urolgist on the first appt. following diagnosis I thought removal was my best option. I also heard the part where they say once you have radiation you can no longer have surgery. Upon further investigation I found that was misleading. If your cancer returns following surgery it's almost certain you'll have radiation. If your cancer returns following radiation you will have the same radiation. I would focus on success rather than failure. Continue to learn, and question everything. You can only make the best decision after exploring all the options. The most challenging aspect of this disease for low and intermediate risk guys is that all the treatment options are available and they each carry different risks. You want to get this right. Good luck on the journey and take your time. I'm glad I didn't jump at the first treatment offered.",

I'm not very familiar with the genetic testing; but, your PSA and Bx suggests the PCa is still fully contained and that radiation would be equally effective as surgery for a complete cure.

      "Content": "Hi Darius, You have already received a lot of excellent advice that I hope you follow. As others have already pointed out bias do exist and I'd like to add mine with some explanation. I believe a lot of guys have confidence in their Urologist and he is the person most likely making the diagnosis. I know that was my situation and my first reaction to hearing you have cancer was to cut it out and get rid of it immediately. Fortunately I had four weeks from the time I got the phone call until my sit down with my Urologist to learn as much as possible about something I had little knowledge prior to. That time period proved to be a blessing. When we sat down to discuss my options I already had a ton of questions regarding the numerous treatment options. The surgery option seeming initially pretty clear and promising until I realized that \"cutting it out\" was not like simply removing your appendix. It is an extremely difficult operation to perform well and doing it open or with robotic assistance makes very little difference. The skill of the surgical team is all important. When I looked at the side effect statistics the quality of life issues were frightening. On forums like this one I found so much of the discussion centered around the side effects of surgery that I knew I had to investigate other options. As stated earlier the cure rate for most treated men is equal for both surgery and radiation. The radiation options were more numerous and harder to understand initially. Every treatment has potential side effects but the radiation options seemed to be easier to handle especially when I investigated the newer more sophisticated deliver systems. The SBRT treatment I eventually decided on has sub millimeter accuracy and I was able to be treated with 5 very easy sessions. I was fortunate to have almost no side effects with only some mild burning on urinating that resolved on it's own in about ten days without medication. These newer treatments are guided like smart bombs and not like the carpet bombing of old types. An important consideration was the radiation could be delivered precisely around the margins of the prostate while sparing the function of the organs nearby. I would encourage you to keep investigating to find what is in your best interest. Possibly even AS is still an option for you once you more fully understand the extent of your cancer. A followup biopsy could help swing in your favor. I did not have any urinary or GI problems prior to treatment. If I had urinary issues due to prostate size or other issues possibly that would have tilted my decision in another direction. What ever your decision I would urge you to seek out the very best practitioners you can find. Good luck and keep us posted.",

      "Content": "Hi Darius, You have already received a lot of excellent advice that I hope you follow. As others have already pointed out bias do exist and I'd like to add mine with some explanation. I believe a lot of guys have confidence in their Urologist and he is the person most likely making the diagnosis. I know that was my situation and my first reaction to hearing you have cancer was to cut it out and get rid of it immediately. Fortunately I had four weeks from the time I got the phone call until my sit down with my Urologist to learn as much as possible about something I had little knowledge prior to. That time period proved to be a blessing. When we sat down to discuss my options I already had a ton of questions regarding the numerous treatment options. The surgery option seeming initially pretty clear and promising until I realized that \"cutting it out\" was not like simply removing your appendix. It is an extremely difficult operation to perform well and doing it open or with robotic assistance makes very little difference. The skill of the surgical team is all important. When I looked at the side effect statistics the quality of life issues were frightening. On forums like this one I found so much of the discussion centered around the side effects of surgery that I knew I had to investigate other options. As stated earlier the cure rate for most treated men is equal for both surgery and radiation. The radiation options were more numerous and harder to understand initially. Every treatment has potential side effects but the radiation options seemed to be easier to handle especially when I investigated the newer more sophisticated deliver systems. The SBRT treatment I eventually decided on has sub millimeter accuracy and I was able to be treated with 5 very easy sessions. I was fortunate to have almost no side effects with only some mild burning on urinating that resolved on it's own in about ten days without medication. These newer treatments are guided like smart bombs and not like the carpet bombing of old types. An important consideration was the radiation could be delivered precisely around the margins of the prostate while sparing the function of the organs nearby. I would encourage you to keep investigating to find what is in your best interest. Possibly even AS is still an option for you once you more fully understand the extent of your cancer. A followup biopsy could help swing in your favor. I did not have any urinary or GI problems prior to treatment. If I had urinary issues due to prostate size or other issues possibly that would have tilted my decision in another direction.

      "Content": "There are far more LINAC's capable of delivering SBRT (hypofractionated beam radiation) than there are Radiation Oncologists using that equipment for SBRT to treat PCa. The reasons for that sometimes have little to do with the effectiveness of the SBRT treatment itself. Sometimes it's simply how slowly newer forms of treatment become accepted; and, sometimes economics becomes the driver. Our insurance companies and Medicare reimburse RO's based on the number of radiation (fractions) delivered. With standard IMRT you typically are given 40-45 fractions (hyperfractionated) lower rate doses. With SBRT typically only five higher dose fractions are delivered. With SBRT the fractions have to be delivered more precisely and the RO's and their entire team (Radiation technitions, dosimitrists, PA's, etc.) have to be more skilled. As a result our medical providers maybe reluctant to adopt a newer treatment that pays less and requires more skill even if the results and convenience are better for the patient. I'm not sure how to fix the system. In my case I did point out to my insurance provider that My treatment choice saved them money. Possibly we need a better reimbursement system that pays a premium for outstanding results?",

I would focus on what practitioner within my system performs their specialty best. MUSC appears to offer SBRT for prostate cancer. If they do it well it can be one of the most effective ways of treating this disease. For me it was five easy treatments plus simulation and marker placement. I traveled a couple hours each way for treatment and had almost zero side effects. If you have any concerns about the skill of your surgeon I certainly would fully investigate RT options.",

I'm not an expert but my experience with my biopsy was that it was much easier than I expected and it would not have kept me from driving 9 hours three days post. That said why not reschedule to reduce any concern. The only way to diagnose PCa is a biopsy. I think either the Dr. misspoke or was misinterpreted. There are other causes for an increase in PSA besides PCa so don't get ahead of yourselves. And even if the biopsy is positive for most men the challenge is deciding how best to weigh through all of the options. All the statistics are still in your favor.",

      "Content": "Hi Liz, Please don't panic. From the limited information posted it appears your Dad's cancer most likely is one that is very, very slow growing. The best thing to do right now is to learn as much as possible and along with Dad's help take charge. One of the most challenging aspects of this disease is there are so many treatment options to consider. Although they all have pretty much an equal chance for a complete cure they each have pluses and minuses regarding treatment and quality of life side effects. I encourage you to study an learn about each as well as consult with the best practitioners in each field. This forum and others like it are a good starting point. Don't be afraid to ask questions It's the best way to learn. Some of the information out there can be a little biased. Most likely your Urologist is a surgeon who knows a great deal about that treatment; however, he probably has little experience with radiation options including the most up to date ones. Similarly a Radiation Oncologist knows little about surgery. I encourage you to consult with both. Your Dad's choices should be based on what's important to him and his unique personal and medical situation. If you post your location members reading your post might have specific recomendations. Feel free to message me if you think I can be of any help.",

      "Content": "SHARP is Sloan's spin on SBRT. Although the acronym maybe different based on equipment the hypofrationated treatment is pretty much the same. I'm approximately your hubby's age and I was treated at Cleveland Clinic where the call it SBRT. This treatment is overtaking other forms of radiation in a lot of men based on it's effectiveness, the shorter treatment times and usually with fewer side effects. Your very fortunate to have Sloan Kettering for treatment. With SHARP and Sloan Kettering I can't imagine having anyone be critical of that choice. SBRT is delivered much more accurately than older forms of beam radiation. With this treatment you also can have the margins (area outside but near the prostate) treated in case the cancer is in the process of spreading from the prostate gland. I found my treatment experience amazing. You do have to have markers placed in the prostate to guide the radiation delivery. It's a simple procedure that I found easier than the biopsy. You also have planning day with a lot of scans on a table similar to the treatment table. The five treatments are the easiest part. I had almost zero side effects during and following treatment. I had some very mild burning on urinating that lasted 7-10 days. It was so minor it did not require medication and resolved on it's own. I only point it out since that's all there was. When I look at this and other forums I find so many men having far worse issues with other treatments. SBRT may not be the best choice for every situation; however, if Sloan Kettering has recommended it for you I say go for it. Good luck and keep us posted.",

      "Content": "SHARP is Sloan's spin on SBRT. Although the acronym maybe different based on equipment the hypofrationated treatment is pretty much the same. I'm approximately your hubby's age and I was treated at Cleveland Clinic where the call it SBRT. This treatment is overtaking other forms of radiation in a lot of men based on it's effectiveness, the shorter treatment times and usually with fewer side effects. Your very fortunate to have Sloan Kettering for treatment. With SHARP and Sloan Kettering I can't imagine having anyone be critical of that choice. SBRT is delivered much more accurately than older forms of beam radiation. With this treatment you also can have the margins (area outside but near the prostate) treated in case the cancer is in the process of spreading from the prostate gland. I found my treatment experience amazing. You do have to have markers placed in the prostate to guide the radiation delivery. It's a simple procedure that I found easier than the biopsy. You also have planning day with a lot of scans on a table similar to the treatment table. The five treatments are the easiest part. I had almost zero side effects during and following treatment. I had some very mild burning on urinating that lasted 7-10 days. It was so minor it did not require medication and resolved on it's own. I only point it out since that's all there was. When I look at this and other forums I find so many men having far worse issues with other treatments. SBRT may not be the best choice for every situation; however, if Sloan Kettering has recommended it for you I say go for it. Good luck and keep us posted.",

      "Content": "Danny, I found my marker placement even easier than the biopsy; however, each physician may have different protocols. Some prefer a perineal approach and others transrectal (TRUS) like the Bx. Mine was TRUS with some kind of local numbing agent given. I felt almost nothing except the pressure of the US wand. I did have some staining of my ejaculate. Can't offer anything on the perineal method. My SBRT was delivered using a Varian Edge machine and that part (5 fractions) of the experience was a piece of cake. My only side effect was some mild burning on urinating that started after the third fraction and lasted about seven or ten days. It was very mild and resolved on it's own without medication. I only even point it out since it was all the negative I can find through my treatment. I was able to drive the two and half hours each way to treatment without issue as well as maintain my normal active life style including my exercise program at the YMCA. I hope your experience turns out as well as mine. Feel free to message me if you have additional questions and I'll also continue to monitor this thread. Keep us posted on your progress.",
