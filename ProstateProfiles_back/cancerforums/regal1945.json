      "Content": "Originally Posted by dannydee The following are my side effects of the Davinci surgery: 1. Episodes of fast heartbeat which required two trips to the emergency room. Heart beating as fast as 180 BPM. These episodes finaly stopped 3 months after surgery. They were indeed scary. They lasted up to 1 and 1/2 hours. 2. Penis end pain which took roughly 3 months to subside. 3. Very serious groin pain which may require more surgery. I will be seeing a pain physician specialist this week. My guess is that I have a damaged or compressed nerve in the groin due to either scarring or stiching in the operation. It's just a guess, keeping in mind that my lymph glands were removed during surgery. This groin pain is so serious that it incapacitates me. I can only walk short distances without pain, and I can not exercise at all. Other than that, my PSA is now zero and I have excellent continance, and excellent sexual function. I am greatful to be alive. After reading hundreds of these kind of posts, why in the world does 80% of the folks do the surgery when there are other options? Some of these butchers (docs) cannot even carve the Thanksgiving turkey far from a human beings. but they are just as good of salesman for thir products than a car salesman lol!",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by Fairwind I wonder how much a surgeon gets paid, on average, to do an RP in the U.S.? Somehow, I get the feeling cancer is a MAJOR industry and spoils get divvied up according to carefully developed protocols.. If cancer were cured tomorrow, it would create a depression in the medical community...Oncology is where the big money is... They must get paid a lot the way they try scaring a person into surgery rite away when there are just as good alterantives.",
