I had a lump in my groin that turned out to be nothing, but, prompted my Health Care Provider to test my PSA. I am 49 years young... It came back at 14.7. A trip to a urologist and a new PSA score of 9.8 earned my prostate biopsy which revealed a tumor in the left side, Gleason score of 3+4=7! My bone scan came back negative with Just a small area in my lung that they have believe is just fluid that has just been biopsied. As I await those results, I am in talks with a surgeon to have my prostate removed in September. I am SO fortunate to have had that PSA checked when they did! My journey is not over, but at least I have a great opportunity to proceed successfully! I will keep updating as I go on, but I really want to spread the word about guys getting checked and not being so scared to do so. The thought of having a prostate biopsy terrified! I\u0092ll admit, the procedure itself was uncomfortable, but nothing like my imagination and fear made it to be! It was like a DRE with a few extra pinches. My mindset is positive. I have been blessed with the ability to turn fear and panic into determination. After this has all passed, I intend to inform as many people as I can about this disease! The ages of newly diagnosed are becoming younger and younger! Guys, please! Go get checked!",

To any guys reading this that are worried or scared of getting checked or going thru a prostate biopsy, I\u0092m here to tell you that you are not alone, but I\u0092m also here to let you know that the biopsy is not so bad! I am in the same boat as everyone here. We are all fighters. The way I see it now, is the more tools you have with you while you endure the fight, the better of you will be. The PSA, the DRE, and the biopsy are all excellent tools to help us. I will start another thread detailing my experience with the biopsy to hopefully calm fears and panic...
