      "Content": "Hello again, I forgot to mention one thing that I feel is very important for you. Given the age of your dad, I hope his doctor has recommended that you and if you have any brothers start PSA testing already today. When I got diagnosed with Prostate Cancer at the age of 47, my urologist told me to contact my dad and my brothers and make sure all of them started regular PSA testing (every 6 months here in Sweden) He said due to my young age they were all now in a higher risk group for getting PC. That advice helped save my younger brother from developing spred PC outside his prostate. He was able to have his prostate removed in time, before it could spred to other parts of his body. Today, 5 years later, he is still cancer-free! Prevental healthcare helped so much. So don't forget about you or your brothers while helping your dad get through this.",

      "Content": "And once more, welcome to this forum. I hope you will find the wealth of information present here for your reading. There are so many variations of cases here, from men in their 40's up to those in there 80's. Some will have slow growth of their cancer with low gleason score while others will have rapid spreading, gleason score or 8-10. I think you will get the best help by finding threads which mirror your dad's situtation. And remember, stay positive and get informed. Information can help decrease your uncertainy and worring. Being around loved ones, family and friends can give both you and your dad an extra boost of strength and happiness when you're going to need it most. I was 47 yrs. old when diagnosed and I think the support of my wife and 3 children helped me more than anything else to get through those first few months. I hope you can find all the help you need here in this forum to make your journey against this desease as easy as possible. Good luck to you and your dad.",

      "Content": "Back in November 2007 I broke my neck in a low speed (5 mi/hr) fender bender. The orthopedic doctors started an investigation as to what caused the weakening of my vertebrea. They found 7 large cancerous tumors in my neck vertebrea alone. Biopsi of a 3/4 inch lump by my coller bone revealed it was a prostate cancer tumor. Sent me to the urologist and oncologist. January 2008, all 8 shots in my prostate had cancer with a gleason scale of 9, later reinforced with a PSA of 3,280. Bone scan (skelett scintigrafi in Swedish) revealed +120 bone metastaser. After radiation treatment to help decrease my pain and decrease the risk of becoming paralized my hormonal treatment started to fail in January 2009. Still on the same \"chemical castration\" today.....procren depo injection. But back in April 2009 when my PSA was doubling every 6 weeks I decided to try and see if the Cayennepeppar cure might prolong my life alittle longer than the 3 months the oncologist predicted. I had found the study done by UCLA on my own and didn't have anything else related to it to go on. I bought Cayennepeppar capsules and started taking 1 cap./day for 5 days. Then I increased my daily dose with 1 cap/day every 5th day until I got up to 8 cap/day at which time I had to break off the cure due to cramping of my intestines. I ate loads of yoghurt when I took the Cayennepeppar capsules to help protect my stomach! After this \"Cayennepeppar cure\" my PSA dropped and stayed at 1.7 for 1/2 year. (My oncologist thought this was a lab error! and made me retake the blood tests again!) I didn't tell my oncologist about my pepper test. In the fall of 2009 I retook the Cayennepeppar capsules cure again to see what would happen. After the second \"pepper cure\" my PSA dropped from 1.7 to <0.05. My PSA has stayed at <0.05 even to this day (November 2014). I don't know if it was a combination of the hormonal treatment and the capsaicin together or if I just plain and simple had a peppar sensitive prostate cancer just like some prostate cancers are very hormonal sensitive.... I don't know. But I sure am glad I tried to do the capsaicin cure. I do think it is because of this that my PSA has been and stayed at <0.05 for the past 5 years!! As said by my urologist, it's either that, otherwise it must be \"an unexplainable medical miracle\" in his own words. I hope that even though this thread was from 2 years ago, chrisz might see this comment. If it takes awhile for me to re-respond to further comments, it's because I got hit REAL HARD by a second type of cancer: Leukemia ALL Ph+ (Philadelphia syndrom) And believe me this fight has been 100 times more difficult.....but never give up!",
