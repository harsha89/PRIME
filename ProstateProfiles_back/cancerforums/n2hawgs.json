He said he would love to do the surgery but did not feel there would be a good outcome in the long run(due to high Gleason scores) I had only 6 cores all contained cancer and 4 were totally involved. So, I am opting for IMRT and hormone therapy. I also asked to have my slides reviewed by another pathologist. I reviewed your posts and really appreciate the detailed information. I would love to have that prostate out but there is a great chance something will be left behind. I'll meet with an oncology radiologist on 1-27-14. Thanks!!!",
