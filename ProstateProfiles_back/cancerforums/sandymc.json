      "Content": "Dear Everyone, not sure if this has been discussed previously, but i can't seem to find the same thread here. So.. Last year, around june/july, my dad was diagnosed with prostate cancer, Metastatic (M1) and Gleason Score of 10 and PSA 20. I believe that's the fastest growing kind of cancer. Having been struggled with Peeing problem.. On November 2012, he got green light laser treatment, then Vasectomy on following month and radiotherapy the next month. He has been taking 50mg Casodex treatment. Life was enjoyable for him, no pee problem, no buttock soreness, until last week, the PSA tests shown that the PSA suddenly increased to 9 (it was around 0-1 for the last 6 months). And just in a week, my dad starts feeling the buttock soreness and pain. We came back to doctor and USG scan showed that the Prostate has been growing again and he suggested my dad to increase the Casodex dose into 150mg. My dad situation is worrying me so much, he doesnt feel at ease with his buttock soreness and pain. I have several question: 1. Is my dad on the right track of treatment? are there any better solution? 2. How to kill his buttock soreness and pain, i know radiation theraphy can reduce the pain, but my dad has done it before, can it be redone to get the same curing effect? 3. Life expectancy.. i hate to ask this question and learn the answer, but my curiosity kicks in. WebMD says that one third patient with metastatic cancer will survive for 5 years.. what do you say? 4. What should i do next when 150mg casodex no longer retain PSA level? thanks! highly appreciate all the answer",

      "Content": "Hi Fairwind and lancepeace, thank you sooo much for all the support and reply My dad had that castration (what i meant by vasectomy) 7 months ago. While also taking casodex 50mg everyday, his PSA level was kept below 1 until last week, the blood test discover that his PSA raised to 9, the month before, his PSA was 1. (is it supposed to be that fast?). The result freaked me out as i read that castration can keep PSA level and cancer growth for 2 years. Now the doctor suggested my dad to take 150mg casodex. i've checked zytiga and provenge, both are very expensive. Although my dad can afford it, i'm sure he'd rather die for something that expensive (though i'll always make sure he got the best treatment possible) My dad drink juice of mangosteen and boiled tomato (for its lycopene) in regular basis. I know that pomegranade generally increase immune system and my dad's diet has always contain food rich in ip6. it's known that doctor at my country aren't that good (some people die due to malpractice ), but even if i bring my dad to singapore, the treatment will probably the same. regarding the pain, my dad had that spot radiation theraphy 7 months ago, is it safe/wise to do it again? doctor doesn't tell anything about it. just to sum up if i miss any step of treatment on typical metastatic prostate cancer: 1. Hormone Therapy 2. Castration 3. more hormone theraphy, if it fails 4. Chemotheraphy, if it fails 5. xtandi, zytiga, provenge and etc.. yet if it fails 6. what next? thanks!",
