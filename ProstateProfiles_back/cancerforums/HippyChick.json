      "Content": "Hi Didee, I work for Urology as a medical secretary and in my experience some people just have high PSA and the consultants themselves can't explain it either so they just let it go but keep an eye on the levels and do the occasional cystoscopy and CT scan but don't worry too much as sometimes it's just unexplained. Sometimes they say to give an 'urgent' message just because there might be a UTI or there is something they want to double check. It isn't always urgent in the same sense. I hope your husband will be fine but please don't worry too much too soon because high PSA levels are sometimes just high for no reason that anyone knows and they do all the scans and all the blood tests, but the person just never gets diagnosed with a malignancy and they stay healthy apart from the unexplained high PSA. Keeeping everything crossed for you. Please let us know how it goes. x",
