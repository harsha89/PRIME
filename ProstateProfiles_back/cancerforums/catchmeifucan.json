      "Content": "Thanks to the forum, I am well educated and trying to stay ahead of this battle. My father age 65 (lives in India) was diagnosed stage IV prostate cancer in 2010 with bone and liver mets. Since then he had a surgery (sub capsular orchiectomy in 2010) and 3 different chemo treatments. His latest chemo was 18 weekly sections. Thus far he completed 13 of 18 and the latest PSA was 6.2 (Aug 2012). The bone mets were stable from last scanning in Mar 2010. In between chemos he was on Estramustine and Nizoral - Ketoconazole. These worked only for short time. I realize in near future he needs other alternatives like Zytiga and MDV3100. Zytiga is very expensive for me to order from online Canadian pharmacies. MDV3100 is yet to be released into market. I called J&J Patient Assistance Program if the program is available in India and the answer is NO. As per J&J, \"The patient has to be in US and under doctor supervision.\" I am willing to pay modest amount. Stealing is not an option unless it will completely cure him. Thank you for reading the post and comments.",
