He is to go back in 6 weeks for another check. Does this happen? -- Where the pathology is really bad, but the PSA is 0.00? We appreciate any feedback. Thank you.",

Fred is not tuned in to medical issues and I read a lot so things make more sense. He doesn't mind me being there and often calls me in after a while anyway so I can answer questions for him as things are often a blur for him. Thanks again to everyone. The next appointment is tomorrow at 2:00 and I'm assuming Fred will get his first post psa test. It will be good to know what we are dealing with.",

      "Content": "I just want to say hello. I know very little compared to the experienced posters here -- and they will be very helpful and supportive to you. My husband was diagnosed back in October, surgery late November. He's doing good right now though there are still some concerns. They are watching him closely which is comforting. The one thing I do know is that the outlook is much better than I originally convinced myself it was. I want to mention also that I learned it's hard not to jump to conclusions after reading online information. I want all the information I can get so I'm careful to vet the sites but I have to remember when I see a fact that scares me it might be completely different information when I learn something else that changes the meaning. I don't know if any of this makes sense but my heart went out to you so wanted to say hello. Keep us posted and check in often. It helps! Marie",

I'm reading online articles that appear to say that ductal cancer is worse than other cancers. When should they give me a CT scan or other type test for spread of cancer? I'm grateful that my first PSA after surgery is 0 but still worried. Thanks for any help. Fred",

If I can get several more zeros under my belt, I'll feel a lot better. But if the number goes up, I'll do whatever is necessary. I appreciate your being willing to give your opinion. It helps. I'll keep you updated. My next PSA test is March 8. Fred",

      "Content": "Hello, My name is Marie, wife of Fred. I hope you don't mind a woman lurking around. I'm the typist in the family. I've found this forum to be the most helpful of all the research I've done, and the most supportive. So thank you all so much for that. I think it will be easier if I just type the pathology reports and would ask for any feedback you may have -- maybe tell us what we can expect in the near future. First report dated 10/11/12 (8 samples taken): Right prostate lobe, core biopsy, adenocarcinoma, gleason 3+4, involving 10% of the aggregate right side biopsy volume. 3 cores positive for tumor. (ICD-9:185) Left prostate lobe, core biopsy, adenocarcinoma, gleason 3+3, involving less than 5% of the aggregate left side biopsy volume. 2 cores positive for tumor. (ICD-9:185) Post surgery report 11/30/12: Sections show extensive mixed pattern adenocarcinoma (Gleasons 4+4) present in all four quadrants of the prostate. The tumor is comprised primarily of acinar-type glands that exhibit a gleasons 4+3 pattern. Some areas of ductal adenocarcinoma (Gleasons's 4+4) are also identified. Adenocarcinoma is seen focally at the apex margin and focally on the right capsular margin. Tumor is fairly extensively present at the bladder neck margins. Seminal vesicles are negative. Lymphovascular invasion and perineural invasion is not identified. I didn't go into the follow up visit but Fred said the Dr. was very disappointed because everything looked clean during surgery. He said the cancer is more aggressive than first thought and Fred may be looking at radiation. It's possible the doctor said more but he can't remember. We go on the 13th for a PSA test. Fred wanted the nerve sparing surgery. Though 71, he was very concerned about losing urine control and also the erection problems. He says he just wants to be like he's always been. I can understand that. But now with what we know, I just want him to be with me for a long time to come. Any thoughts would be greatly appreciated.",
