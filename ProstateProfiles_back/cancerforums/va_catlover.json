      "Content": "Thank you for your reply. It helps to hear it from someone who's been there. I don't necessarily trust my husband's doctor. Yes, we will get a copy of the path report when we go back for follow-up a week from today. I was very surprised to get any kind of call today because she told us that the path report would be available Friday at the earliest. Can you explain to me briefly what the perinueral involvement means? Also, my husband's PSA was 11.1. I too had lymph node involvement. That's usually what puts us in the Stage III category for BC.",

      "Content": "My husband had his procedure this past Thursday, March 27th. The catheter will be left in until Monday, April 7th. The procedure itself took longer than expected for various reasons and one additional incision. Doctor told him he should be off work for 4 weeks. The short-term disability insurance co called today and said that their protocol for time off for this procedure would have him return on Monday, April 14th. That's not going to give very much time to get over the incontinence from the catheter! We are very upset and wondering if we will have to let him be off of work for 1-2 additional weeks without pay in order to properly recuperate. How long did it take you to recuperate and return to a computer desk job with 1 hour commute each way? Thanks.",

      "Content": "My husband, age 59, has just completed radical prostectomy by DaVinci robot. His biopsy results showed Gleason 7 (3+4) with cancer to some extent in 10 out of 16 cores. Some pathology results from last week's surgery came back today. Surgeon says that he is a T3a. I see that means that cancer has come out of the prostate gland. She keeps referring to something called perineural invasion. She said that there was Gleason 7 in 15% of the gland, but it sounds like they are either stopping without investigating the whole gland or that these are preliminary results. She said that there were good margins and everything was gotten out. She told him that this is a very good outcome/prognosis. All he will have to do is come back for periodic PSA's. I'm not understanding this at all. I'm a Stage IIIc breast cancer survivor of 2.5 years. It's my understanding that this is Stage III prostate cancer for my husband. I think I would definitely want him to go through the staging studies like I did--the CT and bone scans. I think he should get a second opinion on further treatment like radiation. Of course I could be trying to look at this apples to apples with my cancer. And of course with having had 2 cancers in our marriage in 2.5 years, I'm emotionally drained, brain is not working well, and I'm exhausted. Can anyone please tell me what they think of this information, what questions to ask of the doctor when we see her for catheter removal next Monday, etc.? It would be such a tremendous help. Thank you.",
