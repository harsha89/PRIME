    "Content": "Is there any one in the forum who has lost both penile nerves? Three years back I had RP. Both the nerves had to be removed to avoid spread of cancer. I do not want another surgery for penile implant at 75 years. Will any one share under such circumstances the experience of self stimulation of flaccid penis to have orgasm. I can achieve orgasm but at the end one gets a feeling it is incomplete.",
