      "Content": "Hello Everyone I know my chances of prostate cancer for my age are slim. I wanted to know the proper protocol that Dr's should be following. Here is my background I have been on TRT for eight years now. I messed around with steroids when I was in my 20's and permanently messed up my testosterone levels. I moved six months ago and started working with a new Urologist for my TRT. Last week when I went in for my checkup (which is every three months) he reviewed my labs from my previous appointment. He told me my PSA was a 4. We took blood that day, and he asked me to call him on Friday to check the results. We didn't get into the specifics, and I left the appointment. I have a newborn daughter, and I haven't been sleeping much and was exhausted during my appointment. It was not until I was in the parking lot that it clicked in my head that a four was high for my age and the possible problems that can come with it. On Friday I called into the Dr's office, and he told me my PSA was not a 4 and it was a 2.75 on the new lab. He is telling me he never said it was a 4. I am pretty sure I heard him correctly, but I have barely slept with the arrival of my daughter. I was also a little annoyed that my labs are not being reviewed when they come into the Dr. He is discussing the results three months later on my follow-up appointment. I went back and reviewed my PSA from some other labs I had on file, and in 2015 my PSA was a 1.75. After relaying this information to my Dr, he said we should have you in for a biopsy right away. After doing some research while in between appointments with the Dr. I noticed that ejaculating could impact the test results. The day of both appointments I had sex probably an hour before they took blood. The urologist said it would not affect my results and cause a 2.75 in my PSA. I am huge on second opinions. Is moving me right into a biopsy the typical standard of care? I appreciate any replies and valuable information you guys provide",

      "Content": "Hi Everyone I have a question. This Dr that wanted me to get the biopsy had 3 different blood labs on file for me since April of 2017. I have been asking for copies and they finally arrived today Psa 2.76 in 4/2017 Psa 2 in 6/2017 Psa 2.51 in 9/17 I am curious why he didn't mention to me that it went down to a 2. Is that normal for it to come back down and go back up?",
