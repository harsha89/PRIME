But why would there even be results pertaining to the colon on a prostate biopsy? Maybe the doctor didn't go deep enough with the cores on the left side and only got colon tissue? Also is the presence of colonic mucosa and squamous mucosa a good thing, or is it the beginning of something that could turn bad?",

So if that's the case from your replies, then I got a half ass biopsy. Now that could make me really pissed off! Could someone please answer my other question about the colonic mucosa and squamous mucosa. Do we all have those mucosa's there, or could they be a sign that could lead to problems down the road? I sure appreciate your replies! Thankyou! Ski",

Prostate, right side, biopsy: ADENOCARCINOMA, Gleason 3+3, involving 1 of 6 cores (<5% of tissue) Prostate left side, biopsy: -Benign prostatic tissue -Benign colonic mucosa and squamous mucosa.
