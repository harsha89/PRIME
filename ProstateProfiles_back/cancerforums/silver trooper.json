    "Content": "I am 61 years old and my PSA has risen steadily for as long as I can remember. When I see other members speak of an elevated PSA of 4-5, I try to remember when I last saw a PSA at that level and it has been at LEAST ten years, probably much more. My current PSA is around 28 and has been over 20 for the last two to four years. I have had an exam every six months since 1993 as that is when I had a testicle removed due to testicular cancer. My urologist says the prostate feels perfectly normal, three regular biopsies since 2009 have all been completely negative (36 samples), and I recently had an extensive MRI which was also negative. I am scheduled for a saturation biopsy on Wednesday. Anyone else out there have or had a PSA that high with no detected cancer (yet)?",
