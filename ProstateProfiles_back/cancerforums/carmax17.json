      "Content": "Hello Everyone. Great to have a forum where we can share our experiences. Six months ago I had a MRI. Found no suspicious areas. It was negative. My doctor claims now a days MRI is about 90% accurate My PSA was 14.02 back than. Prior to that a year before it was 12.00 so its been slowly increasing, so my doctor scheduled another PSA blood test in six months. Six months later I now have my results but this time my doctor ordered PSA-Total and PSA-Free. Beside the PSA ratio is says not informative. but below provide some standard stuff Free PSA/Total PSA Ratio Reference Range Total <4: Prostate cancer unlikely and Free is not informative. Total >10: Prostate cancer likely and Free is not informative. Total >=4 and <=10: If Free/Total ratio >0.27, chance of prostate cancer is about 10%. If ratio is <0.17, chance of prostate cancer is about 50%. My PSA total is 16.00. My PSA-Free is 2.21. ug/L How do I calculate the PSA Ratio ? Is there some formula to use. ? Obviously looks my results are worsening but still wondering what to make of it because my previous two tests were PSA only. Is it not important to calculate the PSA-Ratio ? Too see how that plays into it. ? I do have an appointment with my doctor next week but as many as you know its an anxious nervous time so any input would be appreciated. Thanks in advance for help.

      "Content": "Hello Everyone. Great to have a forum where we can share our experiences. Six months ago I had a MRI. Found no suspicious areas. It was negative. My doctor claims now a days MRI is about 90% accurate My PSA was 14.02 back than. Prior to that a year before it was 12.00 so its been slowly increasing, so my doctor scheduled another PSA blood test in six months. Six months later I now have my results but this time my doctor ordered PSA-Total and PSA-Free. Beside the PSA ratio is says not informative. but below provide some standard stuff Free PSA/Total PSA Ratio Reference Range Total <4: Prostate cancer unlikely and Free is not informative. Total >10: Prostate cancer likely and Free is not informative. Total >=4 and <=10: If Free/Total ratio >0.27, chance of prostate cancer is about 10%. If ratio is <0.17, chance of prostate cancer is about 50%. My PSA total is 16.00. My PSA-Free is 2.21. ug/L How do I calculate the PSA Ratio ? Is there some formula to use. ? Obviously looks my results are worsening but still wondering what to make of it because my previous two tests were PSA only. Is it not important to calculate the PSA-Ratio ? Too see how that plays into it. ? I do have an appointment with my doctor next week but as many as you know its an anxious nervous time so any input would be appreciated. Thanks in advance for help.

      "Content": "Hello Everyone. Great to have a forum where we can share our experiences. Six months ago I had a MRI. Found no suspicious areas. It was negative. My doctor claims now a days MRI is about 90% accurate My PSA was 14.02 back than. Prior to that a year before it was 12.00 so its been slowly increasing, so my doctor scheduled another PSA blood test in six months. Six months later I now have my results but this time my doctor ordered PSA-Total and PSA-Free. Beside the PSA ratio is says not informative. but below provide some standard stuff Free PSA/Total PSA Ratio Reference Range Total <4: Prostate cancer unlikely and Free is not informative. Total >10: Prostate cancer likely and Free is not informative. Total >=4 and <=10: If Free/Total ratio >0.27, chance of prostate cancer is about 10%. If ratio is <0.17, chance of prostate cancer is about 50%. My PSA total is 16.00. My PSA-Free is 2.21. ug/L How do I calculate the PSA Ratio ? Is there some formula to use. ? Obviously looks my results are worsening but still wondering what to make of it because my previous two tests were PSA only. Is it not important to calculate the PSA-Ratio ? Too see how that plays into it. ? I do have an appointment with my doctor next week but as many as you know its an anxious nervous time so any input would be appreciated. Thanks in advance for help.

      "Content": "Originally Posted by ASAdvocate Your free psa is 13.8. But, fpsa is not validated for use when the psa is over 10. Do you have a history of bph or prostatitis? Have you had a PHI, 4K Score, or PCA3 tests? I don't understand why your doctor is not pursuing this more aggressively. No I don't have a history nor have those tests. My urologist did a DRE which was negative and ordered the MRI. I only discovered this recently and met with my urologist once. I can only assume since the MRI came back clean he decided to monitor it for another six months and gave me meds to see if my prostate shrunk. I assume now he will order a biopsy since its gone up. So the 13.8 free PSA means nothing than because my PSA is over 10 ? carmax17",
