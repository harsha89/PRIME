    "Content": "Still hoping I made the right decision. I couldn't do surgery due to heart issues.. Also they are staying away from HT for same reason. Still wondering on the active surveillance.. . My doc suggested that active surveillance was a option. But due to the 3+4's being 50%of the core he recommended against it. I am nervous because I still have side effects from the biopsy after a month with frequency/and flow. Although I found out if I walk a mile or so on a day it will calm down.. So tomorrow I go in for dry run and start the 40 treatments on Thursday. I am to young for this stuff. HAHA 63.. Hoping I don't have side effects..",
