      "Content": "Originally Posted by OldTiredSailor How do I now teach myself to not wake up in the middle of the night wondering and pondering \"what if?\" and to not wander off during the day into a mental fog of \"what if?\" How do I live with what appears to be a future of uncertainty and ambiguity regarding prostate health and prognosis? Interesting dilemma. I guess, that, simply put, life itself is ultimately out of our control. We did not choose our conception, our DNA, our birth and innumerable other factors. All of that was done for us. Would we have objected had we known? Our culture obsesses with the future - one which may never arrive. Our end is coming and there is no accurate way of knowing or even of predicting. We are given 24 hours at a time, yet we live in the instant moment, never being entirely certain of what the next moment will bring. Personally, before tomorrow can be a problem, I have to wake up tomorrow.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by Jim215 po18guy: You, more than anyone, know the ins and outs related to trials. The OP talks of difficulty with ADT but are there no conventional treatments available prior to going to trials? Aren't trials normally utilized after all other mainstream methodologies have been tried? Jim (Forgive my wordiness - prednisone at work) As with everything else cancer, it all depends. If a patient has co-morbidities that limit standard therapy, then other routes such as clinical trials must be sought out. Trials seek both to reduce toxicity and increase effectiveness. Participating in a clinical trial is both a selfish and selfless thing to do at the same time. Of course the patient wants a benefit, a \"cure\", but trials also advance the frontiers of science and allow the patient to receive advanced drugs 2-3 years ahead of the general public. There is not a drug on the market that has not been subjected to the clinical trial process - which is good, as the trial produces data relating to safety, efficacy, and applicability to various sub-types of cancer. With trials, timing can be everything. It might be that a promising trial opens up just as standard treatments fail, or the disease relapses. Such a trial saved my life, and it is edifying to read of others now receiving the drug in its approved form. Contrast this to Germany, where with certain cancers you are automatically sent to clinical trial - and for that reason, there are larger cohorts there. Regarding standard therapy, there is also the patient preference of maintaining his current lifestyle/sexual function as closely as possible - the risk being that this can lead to a less effective therapy. Treatments with a known efficacy and limited (\"acceptable\") toxicity or side effects are normally the first choice. However, some patients simply won't have it. Doctor/patient communication is vital, and while a certain treatment might be the best, doctor cannot always convince the patient to receive it. I come from a tiny cubby hole in the lymphoma world, and I do not hear all that much about ADT in prostate. There must be a reason that the OP's friend chose that route - disease location/grade/spread etc. We also do not know if that was primary, consolidation or salvage therapy in his case. As the OP fills in the missing information, it may become clearer why the ADT was chosen, or if that was even the primary therapy. Chemotherapy lives forever under the burden of its bad reputation, as well as rumors and plain old myths. We see those questions regularly.",

      "Content": "Sorry to hear of this, but good that you are aware of it and are addressing it. I have not had PCa, but a possibility in your case is Trazodone. It is a well proven anti-anxiety/anti-depressant drug that also helps with insomnia. It was prescribed to me to help me sleep, as I have been on high dose steroids for over two years. Anyway, here's something else: it helps with urine flow and in some cases, produces a Cialis-like effect. Could be a two-fer. It is a \"clean drug\" meaining that it has a good toxicity profile, and is available generic, so the cost is low. Worth asking about.",

      "Content": "A word of explanation: My journey, as with all, has been absolutely unique. In that regard, my experience has been that I was paired with a hematologist who not only did not mind being challenged, actually invited it, rising to the occasion. It is fact that the majority of doctors do not like to be challenged, asked questions for which they may not have an immediate answer, or being directed toward a certain therapy. Some of the doctors with whom I have consulted visibly bristled at the idea of a pro-active patient. One needs to have a good feel for their doctor - since it is doctor's practice and personality - but our life that is involved. Many (not all) are unaccustomed to an informed patient, and anything perceived as a challenge my be of-putting. I was blessed in that regard, inasmuch as I have been actively involved, even encouraged to be, in the decision-making process. His operative mode is that he cannot know everything, and all paths are worth investigating.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by Jim215 po18guy: You, more than anyone, know the ins and outs related to trials. The OP talks of difficulty with ADT but are there no conventional treatments available prior to going to trials? Aren't trials normally utilized after all other mainstream methodologies have been tried? Jim (Forgive my wordiness - prednisone at work) As with everything else cancer, it all depends. If a patient has co-morbidities that limit standard therapy, then other routes such as clinical trials must be sought out. Trials seek both to reduce toxicity and increase effectiveness. Participating in a clinical trial is both a selfish and selfless thing to do at the same time. Of course the patient wants a benefit, a \"cure\", but trials also advance the frontiers of science and allow the patient to receive advanced drugs 2-3 years ahead of the general public. There is not a drug on the market that has not been subjected to the clinical trial process - which is good, as the trial produces data relating to safety, efficacy, and applicability to various sub-types of cancer. With trials, timing can be everything. It might be that a promising trial opens up just as standard treatments fail, or the disease relapses. Such a trial saved my life, and it is edifying to read of others now receiving the drug in its approved form. Contrast this to Germany, where with certain cancers you are automatically sent to clinical trial - and for that reason, there are larger cohorts there. Regarding standard therapy, there is also the patient preference of maintaining his current lifestyle/sexual function as closely as possible - the risk being that this can lead to a less effective therapy. Treatments with a known efficacy and limited (\"acceptable\") toxicity or side effects are normally the first choice. However, some patients simply won't have it. Doctor/patient communication is vital, and while a certain treatment might be the best, doctor cannot always convince the patient to receive it. I come from a tiny cubby hole in the lymphoma world, and I do not hear all that much about ADT in prostate. There must be a reason that the OP's friend chose that route - disease location/grade/spread etc. We also do not know if that was primary, consolidation or salvage therapy in his case. As the OP fills in the missing information, it may become clearer why the ADT was chosen, or if that was even the primary therapy. Chemotherapy lives forever under the burden of its bad reputation, as well as rumors and plain old myths. We see those questions regularly.",

      "Content": "A word of explanation: My journey, as with all, has been absolutely unique. In that regard, my experience has been that I was paired with a hematologist who not only did not mind being challenged, actually invited it, rising to the occasion. It is fact that the majority of doctors do not like to be challenged, asked questions for which they may not have an immediate answer, or being directed toward a certain therapy. Some of the doctors with whom I have consulted visibly bristled at the idea of a pro-active patient. One needs to have a good feel for their doctor - since it is doctor's practice and personality - but our life that is involved. Many (not all) are unaccustomed to an informed patient, and anything perceived as a challenge my be of-putting. I was blessed in that regard, inasmuch as I have been actively involved, even encouraged to be, in the decision-making process.

      "Content": "Originally Posted by Jim215 po18guy: You, more than anyone, know the ins and outs related to trials. The OP talks of difficulty with ADT but are there no conventional treatments available prior to going to trials? Aren't trials normally utilized after all other mainstream methodologies have been tried? Jim (Forgive my wordiness - prednisone at work) As with everything else cancer, it all depends. If a patient has co-morbidities that limit standard therapy, then other routes such as clinical trials must be sought out. Trials seek both to reduce toxicity and increase effectiveness. Participating in a clinical trial is both a selfish and selfless thing to do at the same time. Of course the patient wants a benefit, a \"cure\", but trials also advance the frontiers of science and allow the patient to receive advanced drugs 2-3 years ahead of the general public. There is not a drug on the market that has not been subjected to the clinical trial process - which is good, as the trial produces data relating to safety, efficacy, and applicability to various sub-types of cancer. With trials, timing can be everything. It might be that a promising trial opens up just as standard treatments fail, or the disease relapses. Such a trial saved my life, and it is edifying to read of others now receiving the drug in its approved form. Contrast this to Germany, where with certain cancers you are automatically sent to clinical trial - and for that reason, there are larger cohorts there. Regarding standard therapy, there is also the patient preference of maintaining his current lifestyle/sexual function as closely as possible - the risk being that this can lead to a less effective therapy. Treatments with a known efficacy and limited (\"acceptable\") toxicity or side effects are normally the first choice. However, some patients simply won't have it. Doctor/patient communication is vital, and while a certain treatment might be the best, doctor cannot always convince the patient to receive it. I come from a tiny cubby hole in the lymphoma world, and I do not hear all that much about ADT in prostate. There must be a reason that the OP's friend chose that route - disease location/grade/spread etc. We also do not know if that was primary, consolidation or salvage therapy in his case. As the OP fills in the missing information, it may become clearer why the ADT was chosen, or if that was even the primary therapy. Chemotherapy lives forever under the burden of its bad reputation, as well as rumors and plain old myths. We see those questions regularly.",

It is a well proven anti-anxiety/anti-depressant drug that also helps with insomnia. It was prescribed to me to help me sleep, as I have been on high dose steroids for over two years. Anyway, here's something else: it helps with urine flow and in some cases, produces a Cialis-like effect. Could be a two-fer. It is a \"clean drug\" meaining that it has a good toxicity profile, and is available generic, so the cost is low. Worth asking about.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by Jim215 po18guy: You, more than anyone, know the ins and outs related to trials. The OP talks of difficulty with ADT but are there no conventional treatments available prior to going to trials? Aren't trials normally utilized after all other mainstream methodologies have been tried? Jim (Forgive my wordiness - prednisone at work) As with everything else cancer, it all depends. If a patient has co-morbidities that limit standard therapy, then other routes such as clinical trials must be sought out. Trials seek both to reduce toxicity and increase effectiveness. Participating in a clinical trial is both a selfish and selfless thing to do at the same time. Of course the patient wants a benefit, a \"cure\", but trials also advance the frontiers of science and allow the patient to receive advanced drugs 2-3 years ahead of the general public. There is not a drug on the market that has not been subjected to the clinical trial process - which is good, as the trial produces data relating to safety, efficacy, and applicability to various sub-types of cancer. With trials, timing can be everything. It might be that a promising trial opens up just as standard treatments fail, or the disease relapses. Such a trial saved my life, and it is edifying to read of others now receiving the drug in its approved form. Contrast this to Germany, where with certain cancers you are automatically sent to clinical trial - and for that reason, there are larger cohorts there. Regarding standard therapy, there is also the patient preference of maintaining his current lifestyle/sexual function as closely as possible - the risk being that this can lead to a less effective therapy. Treatments with a known efficacy and limited (\"acceptable\") toxicity or side effects are normally the first choice. However, some patients simply won't have it. Doctor/patient communication is vital, and while a certain treatment might be the best, doctor cannot always convince the patient to receive it. I come from a tiny cubby hole in the lymphoma world, and I do not hear all that much about ADT in prostate. There must be a reason that the OP's friend chose that route - disease location/grade/spread etc. We also do not know if that was primary, consolidation or salvage therapy in his case. As the OP fills in the missing information, it may become clearer why the ADT was chosen, or if that was even the primary therapy. Chemotherapy lives forever under the burden of its bad reputation, as well as rumors and plain old myths. We see those questions regularly.",

      "Content": "PSA levels are adjusted for age. According to this article, your level is fine for your age. Remember that a percentage of prostate cancer occurs in men with \"normal\" PSA levels. PSA, by itself, does not determine anything. It is a potential indicator. Many men with very high PSAs never develop prostate cancer. Is there some reason, other than your father's cancer, why you have been monitored for so long?",

      "Content": "Sorry to hear of this. An awful lot depends on your dad's general health. Remember that any chemotherapy given will be carefully adjusted to account for his weight, age and general health. As well, if one drug does not work, there are always alternatives. Since 2008, I have received a total of seventeen chemotherapy drugs and I am still here - it was for a different cancer, however. If I was in his situation, I would search for a clinical trial, as they offer promising new cutting-edge drugs which are not available to the public. I participated in two trials. Medical science is advanced by patients being wiling to participate in clinical trials. If the trial is not effective, he can always withdraw from it and revert back to the original plan. Search for trials here: www.clinicaltrials.gov Just type \"Metastatic Prostate Cancer\" into the search box and numerous possibilities will come up.",

Since the future is guaranteed to exactly no one, we find things in the 'right here and now' to appreciate. No matter the cancer, I look at sick children, paralyzed people of all ages, disabilities of every type - I cannot feel as though I have been cheated. I had about a 50/50 chance of seeing my first Christmas after diagnosis. Two months ago, a doctor told me that I probably had a 0.5% chance of being here today. This will be my tenth Christmas after diagnosis. We have much to be thankful for.",

I don't think that any malignancy would behave like that. But, a different antibiotic might be needed as we are breeding smarter bacteria as this world goes on. Right now, worry is sapping your resolve. I would say that of course you have another fight in you - you receive the strength if you ask for it, but you may not have to fight at all. Think of it this way: if you fell into a river, would you just sink to the bottom, or would you struggle back to the surface? I do not see cancer as bigger than life. Rather, I see it as part of life, and one which poses a certain threat, but also a challenge. Yes, there are days when I'm just tired of it all, but that feeling passes and I am convinced that I have another fight left in me. Looking around at those I love, how could I give up?",

What does your father think of all this? That is important, as it remains his life. If he wants help, then I would gather as much of his medical history as possible and contact a prostate cancer specialist at a National Cancer Institute designated cancer center for advice. In that link, you may find such a center that is closest to you. All the best to you and your dad.",

      "Content": "Remember that the standard for radiologists is the perfect human body as depicted on the wall chart in every doctor's office. Any deviation, however slight, causes their alarm to sound. I have had them caution me about CT focal points on my prostate, only to have the all clear sounded from both my primary physician as well as from a colorectal surgeon. As well, they always mention the hyperplasia, even though it is the rare man indeed who does not experience this past age 50 or so. But, prostate cancer is one of the \"big four\" cancers and so I would guess that it merits the attention. I do not recall a single mention of my thymus in CT reports, even though it has atrophied substantially (as it does in all post-pubescent humans). Not much thymus cancer to worry about, I suppose.",

      "Content": "Not a PC patient, but from your signature: \"Pathology: Bladder neck (microscopic) and seminal vesicle involvement + large volume of PC, clear margins\" If this was renal cell carcinoma, or pancreatic cancer, would proton beam radiation then sound reasonable? Considering that the threshold of detection is something on the order of one million cancer cells, scanning, DREs and each and every other method of detection can miss a whole lot of cancer. You have personal experience, hopes and desires which may conflict with the effects of treatment. I would give much credence to the opinions of those who encounter this daily as part of their career - and who know the long-term results.",

And, those results only have meaning if they were done using the same protocol at the same laboratory. For perspective, due to BPH (yes, the prostate is still there) my PSA was just checked at age 65 and it is 100 times what your dad's is. I don't even think about it. However, your posts have a very unifying theme: anxiety over all of this. Lots of anxiety, reviewing the wording you have used and the effects all of this has had on you. You say that you see fear in dad. I mean this absolutely honestly: I think he is, in part, reflecting your fear. If you are even a part-time caregiver, what are you doing for yourself? Don't let it go on to the point at which you go thud on the floor and spend an overnighter in hospital, as DW did a few years ago. Get some help with that anxiety, whether it be counseling, medication or some other means. I mean this most sincerely.",

      "Content": "No doubt that PSA plays a crucial part. But the almost fanatical scrutiny that we see being applied to, for but one example, a .01 difference in testing - means that: 1) there needs to be a lot more education about what those tests mean (and do not mean), 2) it must be the same test protocol by the same lab and, 3) .01 AYKM? Next to undetectable and within standard deviation. There is no point for men to stress or obsess over tiny increments. Whole numbers being quite another thing. I will reserve comment on what this tells us about men and their prioritization of sexual function, aside from cancer. My jaundiced eye reminds me that men are constantly (and rightly) accused of not being communicative. But, just let them suspect cancer \"down there\" and they won't shut up! Man to man here, but also slightly tongue-in-cheek.",

To date: 1 cancer, relapse, second relapse/mutation into 2 cancers, then 3 cancers simultaneously, 20 chemotherapy/GVHD drugs in 11 regimens (4 of them at least twice), 5 salvage regimens, 4 clinical trials, 5 post-transplant immuno-suppressant/modulatory drugs, the equivalent of 1,000 years of background radiation from 40+ CT series scans and about 24 PET scans. Both lymphoid and myeloid malignancies lend a certain symmetry to the hematological journey. Believing in the redemptive value of suffering makes all the difference.",

      "Content": "Conspiracy theorists are everywhere, from the Kennedy Assassination to black helicopters to gas prices. To indulge oneself in such is to embrace the relentlessly negative - you clearly see this. Nothing but bitterness comes from it. Ask you wife how green juice cures any cancer. Buy her a copy of The Emperor Of All Maladies which is a \"biography\" of cancer - since it is a living entity. Look at the effort, blood sweat and tears that have gone into the fight. To allege that all of this is a massive cover-up is completely unrealistic, if not immature or frankly, somewhat paranoid. We are incredibly complex creatures - by far the most complex and least understood on this planet. We possess this unrealistic desire for a perfect life and the dichotomy that we observe in reality can cause stress, anger and bitterness as life seems to be a cruel joke. Based on my world view, I have embraced my suffering, and am seeking to actually enjoy it, as for me, it has meaning beyond the realm of this earth. Our ability to deal with this is heavily dependent upon what we believe or do not believe. Here is a doctor/researcher oriented video on the difficulties of T-Cell Lymphomas. Give it a brief watch and maybe ask her to watch with you. Look at the extreme depth of knowledge and the desire to control or eliminate these rare lymphomas. The jargon is very technical, but shows the profound efforts made by medical science in the effort to spare human life. These researchers hate cancer and live in the micro-cellular world in man's best attempt to eradicate it.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by RobLee Thanks, but first off I gotta say (and I'm sure you'll fix it) the video link is wrong... the text is correct if you copy and paste, but clicking on the link brings up a reply window. Interesting video. I enjoyed watching it as I have a deep appreciation for the seriousness and difficulty of the fight against cancer. I'm afraid if I show it to my wife the best I can hope is that it might make her feel fortunate to not have T-cell lymphoma. Worst case, well, she is one who feels that everything can be remedied with herbs and prayers, diet and exercise, essential oils, Reiki... I've seen it all. I have ordered the book and hope (and pray) that she will read it and maybe take it to heart. It says there is a Ken Burns documentary... I am slightly dyslexic and choose audio books if possible (it takes me forever to compose a post or reply here). Thanks for the reply and the links. I'm trying to work thru this. Odd forum quirk! I embedded the link and it works now. As to the video, there are others that apply to every kind of cancer - not just lymphomas. I hope that the book will show her that cancer is as old as mankind - it details 3000 year old mummies in the Peruvian high plains that were found to have died of various tumors! A couple of points: 1) a 100% organic paleo diet did not prevent cancer, and 2) the use of natural herbs and other remedies did not cure it. As to \"natural remedies\" and \"alternative\" treatments, my dad flew to Mexico and received Laetrile in 1979. He died at least as quickly as he would have otherwise, and probably more quickly since he had to delay/interrupt standard therapy to do that. www.quackwatch.com is an excellent resource that debunks all of the hucksters out there who want your money in exchange for the false hope of a \"cure.\" There are no cures and I see no herbal or natural medicine survivors on Dr. Phil or any other show. I think her detour into conspiracy theories may be a defense mechanism which is her way of dealing with her own mortality. She strongly desires to triumph over her disease, and sees that so many other areas of human activity have been mastered. Thus, a cure must exist; someone must know it, but for some inexplicable reason, she cannot have it! Well, billionaire Paul Allen (ex Microsoft) has now had both Hodgkin's and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, and no one would \"sell\" him the cure! Ditto for an endless litany of famous and über-rich celebs. As to natural cures, Steve Jobs had pancreatic cancer of a less aggressive type. He delayed treatment for months as he sought the alternative/new age treatment. From the Wiki: \"Despite his diagnosis, Jobs resisted his doctors' recommendations for medical intervention for nine months, instead relying on a pseudo-medicine diet to try natural healing to thwart the disease. According to Harvard researcher Ramzi Amri, his choice of alternative treatment \"led to an unnecessarily early death\" My hematologist states that, of all medical research and the trillions of dollars spent, the most common killers such as heart disease, diabetes, cancer and many other more common illnesses (the common cold!) have not been cured. Only infection has been controlled. My impression is that you wife is on a psychological as much as a medical journey, and is not considering the caretaker - you - and the stress and burnout you are suffering. When we marry, we seem to hear only the \"better\", \"richer\" and \"health\" and not the \"worse\", \"poorer\" and \"sickness\" in our vows. It might be shock therapy, but she should read this thread.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by RobLee Thanks, but first off I gotta say (and I'm sure you'll fix it) the video link is wrong... the text is correct if you copy and paste, but clicking on the link brings up a reply window. Interesting video. I enjoyed watching it as I have a deep appreciation for the seriousness and difficulty of the fight against cancer. I'm afraid if I show it to my wife the best I can hope is that it might make her feel fortunate to not have T-cell lymphoma. Worst case, well, she is one who feels that everything can be remedied with herbs and prayers, diet and exercise, essential oils, Reiki... I've seen it all. I have ordered the book and hope (and pray) that she will read it and maybe take it to heart. It says there is a Ken Burns documentary... I am slightly dyslexic and choose audio books if possible (it takes me forever to compose a post or reply here). Thanks for the reply and the links. I'm trying to work thru this. Odd forum quirk! I embedded the link and it works now. As to the video, there are others that apply to every kind of cancer - not just lymphomas. I hope that the book will show her that cancer is as old as mankind - it details 3000 year old mummies in the Peruvian high plains that were found to have died of various tumors! A couple of points: 1) a 100% organic paleo diet did not prevent cancer, and 2) the use of natural herbs and other remedies did not cure it. As to \"natural remedies\" and \"alternative\" treatments, my dad flew to Mexico and received Laetrile in 1979. He died at least as quickly as he would have otherwise, and probably more quickly since he had to delay/interrupt standard therapy to do that. www.quackwatch.com is an excellent resource that debunks all of the hucksters out there who want your money in exchange for the false hope of a \"cure.\" There are no cures and I see no herbal or natural medicine survivors on Dr. Phil or any other show. I think her detour into conspiracy theories may be a defense mechanism which is her way of dealing with her own mortality. She strongly desires to triumph over her disease, and sees that so many other areas of human activity have been mastered. Thus, a cure must exist; someone must know it, but for some inexplicable reason, she cannot have it! Well, billionaire Paul Allen (ex Microsoft) has now had both Hodgkin's and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, and no one would \"sell\" him the cure! Ditto for an endless litany of famous and über-rich celebs. As to natural cures, Steve Jobs had pancreatic cancer of a less aggressive type. He delayed treatment for months as he sought the alternative/new age treatment. From the Wiki: \"Despite his diagnosis, Jobs resisted his doctors' recommendations for medical intervention for nine months, instead relying on a pseudo-medicine diet to try natural healing to thwart the disease. According to Harvard researcher Ramzi Amri, his choice of alternative treatment \"led to an unnecessarily early death\" My hematologist states that, of all medical research and the trillions of dollars spent, the most common killers such as heart disease, diabetes, cancer and many other more common illnesses (the common cold!) have not been cured. Only infection has been controlled. My impression is that you wife is on a psychological as much as a medical journey, and is not considering the caretaker - you - and the stress and burnout you are suffering. When we marry, we seem to hear only the \"better\", \"richer\" and \"health\" and not the \"worse\", \"poorer\" and \"sickness\" in our vows. It might be shock therapy, but she should read this thread.",

      "Content": "Conspiracy theorists are everywhere, from the Kennedy Assassination to black helicopters to gas prices. To indulge oneself in such is to embrace the relentlessly negative - you clearly see this. Nothing but bitterness comes from it. Ask you wife how green juice cures any cancer. Buy her a copy of The Emperor Of All Maladies which is a \"biography\" of cancer - since it is a living entity. Look at the effort, blood sweat and tears that have gone into the fight. To allege that all of this is a massive cover-up is completely unrealistic, if not immature or frankly, somewhat paranoid. We are incredibly complex creatures - by far the most complex and least understood on this planet. We possess this unrealistic desire for a perfect life and the dichotomy that we observe in reality can cause stress, anger and bitterness as life seems to be a cruel joke. Based on my world view, I have embraced my suffering, and am seeking to actually enjoy it, as for me, it has meaning beyond the realm of this earth. Our ability to deal with this is heavily dependent upon what we believe or do not believe. Here is a doctor/researcher oriented video on the difficulties of T-Cell Lymphomas. Give it a brief watch and maybe ask her to watch with you. Look at the extreme depth of knowledge and the desire to control or eliminate these rare lymphomas. The jargon is very technical, but shows the profound efforts made by medical science in the effort to spare human life. These researchers hate cancer and live in the micro-cellular world in man's best attempt to eradicate it.",

      "Content": "Conspiracy theorists are everywhere, from the Kennedy Assassination to black helicopters to gas prices. To indulge oneself in such is to embrace the relentlessly negative - you clearly see this. Nothing but bitterness comes from it. Ask you wife how green juice cures any cancer. Buy her a copy of The Emperor Of All Maladies which is a \"biography\" of cancer - since it is a living entity. Look at the effort, blood sweat and tears that have gone into the fight. To allege that all of this is a massive cover-up is completely unrealistic, if not immature or frankly, somewhat paranoid. We are incredibly complex creatures - by far the most complex and least understood on this planet. We possess this unrealistic desire for a perfect life and the dichotomy that we observe in reality can cause stress, anger and bitterness as life seems to be a cruel joke. Based on my world view, I have embraced my suffering, and am seeking to actually enjoy it, as for me, it has meaning beyond the realm of this earth. Our ability to deal with this is heavily dependent upon what we believe or do not believe. Here is a doctor/researcher oriented video on the difficulties of T-Cell Lymphomas. Give it a brief watch and maybe ask her to watch with you. Look at the extreme depth of knowledge and the desire to control or eliminate these rare lymphomas. The jargon is very technical, but shows the profound efforts made by medical science in the effort to spare human life. These researchers hate cancer and live in the micro-cellular world in man's best attempt to eradicate it.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by RobLee Thanks, but first off I gotta say (and I'm sure you'll fix it) the video link is wrong... the text is correct if you copy and paste, but clicking on the link brings up a reply window. Interesting video. I enjoyed watching it as I have a deep appreciation for the seriousness and difficulty of the fight against cancer. I'm afraid if I show it to my wife the best I can hope is that it might make her feel fortunate to not have T-cell lymphoma. Worst case, well, she is one who feels that everything can be remedied with herbs and prayers, diet and exercise, essential oils, Reiki... I've seen it all. I have ordered the book and hope (and pray) that she will read it and maybe take it to heart. It says there is a Ken Burns documentary... I am slightly dyslexic and choose audio books if possible (it takes me forever to compose a post or reply here). Thanks for the reply and the links. I'm trying to work thru this. Odd forum quirk! I embedded the link and it works now. As to the video, there are others that apply to every kind of cancer - not just lymphomas. I hope that the book will show her that cancer is as old as mankind - it details 3000 year old mummies in the Peruvian high plains that were found to have died of various tumors! A couple of points: 1) a 100% organic paleo diet did not prevent cancer, and 2) the use of natural herbs and other remedies did not cure it. As to \"natural remedies\" and \"alternative\" treatments, my dad flew to Mexico and received Laetrile in 1979. He died at least as quickly as he would have otherwise, and probably more quickly since he had to delay/interrupt standard therapy to do that. www.quackwatch.com is an excellent resource that debunks all of the hucksters out there who want your money in exchange for the false hope of a \"cure.\" There are no cures and I see no herbal or natural medicine survivors on Dr. Phil or any other show. I think her detour into conspiracy theories may be a defense mechanism which is her way of dealing with her own mortality. She strongly desires to triumph over her disease, and sees that so many other areas of human activity have been mastered. Thus, a cure must exist; someone must know it, but for some inexplicable reason, she cannot have it! Well, billionaire Paul Allen (ex Microsoft) has now had both Hodgkin's and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, and no one would \"sell\" him the cure! Ditto for an endless litany of famous and über-rich celebs. As to natural cures, Steve Jobs had pancreatic cancer of a less aggressive type. He delayed treatment for months as he sought the alternative/new age treatment. From the Wiki: \"Despite his diagnosis, Jobs resisted his doctors' recommendations for medical intervention for nine months, instead relying on a pseudo-medicine diet to try natural healing to thwart the disease. According to Harvard researcher Ramzi Amri, his choice of alternative treatment \"led to an unnecessarily early death\" My hematologist states that, of all medical research and the trillions of dollars spent, the most common killers such as heart disease, diabetes, cancer and many other more common illnesses (the common cold!) have not been cured. Only infection has been controlled. My impression is that you wife is on a psychological as much as a medical journey, and is not considering the caretaker - you - and the stress and burnout you are suffering. When we marry, we seem to hear only the \"better\", \"richer\" and \"health\" and not the \"worse\", \"poorer\" and \"sickness\" in our vows. It might be shock therapy, but she should read this thread.",

Point #1: For \"big pharma\" or any other real or imagined organization to attempt to copy, emulate or otherwise synthesize any natural substance is impractical if not impossible. First the cost would be the typical 2-5 billion dollars. Secondly, it would need to undergo the trials process. Who would willingly invest billions in a substance whose efficacy is unknown and is available in natural form? Point #2: I note here that you are alive - which bears out the study results. Remember that it pertained to survival and not prevention. Once diagnosed, I would be delighted in the news that a very common food would quite likely assist in survival. Point #3: You must be alive to have complaints.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by Magicmanjoejoe Hello all. Recently I went to the doctor for pain in the groin era. I went to a urologist and he almost dismissed it as nothing(much like my PCP) who said it was nothing. He almost dismissed it because of my age(I\u2019m 26, turning 27 this year) and said it\u2019s gas\u2019s probably causing the pain. I don\u2019t know what to think honestly but I\u2019m scared at the possibly of prostate cancer since my symptoms may match. Am I right for being concerned? Bear with me, as I am analyzing your choice of words and actions. Several problems here. Are doctors only competent if they agree with you? What if they are right and you do not have cancer? Are you prepared to deal with that? I'm not a betting man, but I'll bet that anxiety will simply drive you to suspect some other sinister condition. PSA does not diagnose prostate cancer. I hope that you will have or did have a DRE, which is unneeded, but might give you some reassurance. I have noted that there is an extremely fine line between being \"proactive\" regarding health and suffering from health anxiety. Please ponder that. Next doctor visit, please mention that others think you may suffer from some form of anxiety, since 1 in 5 do. At your age, you deserve to live in peace.",

      "Content": "Very sorry to hear this. Still, a clinical trial is an excellent opportunity. Though it was for lymphoma/transplant, I am now in my fourth clinical trial. Two for cancer and two for transplant rejection issues. One trial kept me in full response for 4 1/2 years, when I had been scheduled for palliative therapy. I hope here to encourage. Two relapses, one mutation into two sub-types, a third treatment-related bone marrow cancer, and we ran out of drugs to use. My prognosis was so abysmal that there is not a word to describe it. Yet, I have ten years into this. Since worry is negative and had no good purpose, better to make plans, no matter how sad those plans may seem. As I see it, it is better to have a plan which might not be needed than to be faced with a critical situation while lacking plans. If you can, turn that nervous worrying energy into positive planning. Research clinical trials, as even if he does not benefit, he will be helping those after him by advancing medical science. Give up worry. Don't give up hope.",

Someone convinced him to shoot heroin and that was that. Loss is a part of our lives that we do not like to deal with, but must. As to the future; as to long range plans, I think that British economist John Maynard Keynes said it best: \"In the long run, we're all dead.\" OK. As to cancer, President Reagan rather famously said \"I don't have cancer. Something in me has cancer and the doctors are going to remove it.\" A different take on the subject, but it worked.",

Your husband's difficulties might be exceptional and unanticipated, or may be relatively normal. Yet, the treatment team normally provides contact information for such cases. I would not expect doctor to answer, but rather a nurse or practitioner, as that is the normal routing of such concerns. I know that, in our case, a lot of what we were told simply flew over our heads in the confusion and complication of the entire situation. Do they have an after-care team? Since you are the care-giver, I have taken the liberty of moving your post tot he prostate cancer forum, where it will probably receive helpful replies.",

      "Content": "This is a single study and, in the grand scheme of things, is almost anecdotal in its findings regarding PCa. It was limited to 281 patients who had the most commonly occurring cancers: breast, colon, lung and prostate. From the abstract: \"We identified 281 patients with nonmetastatic breast, prostate, lung, or colorectal cancer\" My thinking is that the nature of localized prostate cancer skewed the numbers somewhat. It tends to advance slowly before becoming truly life-threatening - this point occurring perhaps near the end of the study. But, what happens thereafter? That infamous \"hockeystick\" graph may apply to the mortality rates of PCa, as it is not going to remain localized forever. Say you are diagnosed at age 45. Would you risk an unproven alternative claim for 10 years only to find out that, at age 55, you will be in a fight for your life? As a practical matter, try to find an insurance company that will even consider 'alternative medicine'. Last I checked, the alt sellers don't give it away.",

      "Content": "This is a single study and, in the grand scheme of things, is almost anecdotal in its findings regarding PCa. It was limited to 281 patients who had the most commonly occurring cancers: breast, colon, lung and prostate. From the abstract: \"We identified 281 patients with nonmetastatic breast, prostate, lung, or colorectal cancer\" My thinking is that the nature of localized prostate cancer skewed the numbers somewhat. It tends to advance slowly before becoming truly life-threatening - this point occurring perhaps near the end of the study. But, what happens thereafter? That infamous \"hockeystick\" graph may apply to the mortality rates of PCa, as it is not going to remain localized forever. Say you are diagnosed at age 45. Would you risk an unproven alternative claim for 10 years only to find out that, at age 55, you will be in a fight for your life? As a practical matter, try to find an insurance company that will even consider 'alternative medicine'. Last I checked, the alt sellers don't give it away.",

      "Content": "Many men with high PSA never develop cancer. Prostate cancer, as I recall, is often asymptomatic. That PSA reading \"could\" even be related to all of the inflammation/infection that has been in the area. And, we could be talking a chronic infection, since these obvious symptoms have occurred for several years. If your PSA reading had occurred say, during a routine physical exam (with no urinary symptoms), it would be perhaps more indicative of potential trouble. The DRE indicates nothing palpable, which should be a comfort. Please try to avoid over-thinking this, as very little is known at this point.

      "Content": "Originally Posted by Ray61 What am I missing here? Everything I have read indicates a 2.1 PSA in a 41 year old is considered a normal read. Not even sure why this would rate a second test let alone the threat of a biopsy. Maybe one of the other guys can enlighten me. Ray Ray, you are exactly right. My bad for failing to check the charts first. Shaney5944 your PSA is normal. You might consider consulting with a different urologist. PSA can rise due to infection or inflammation in the area and you have certainly had that, but your PSA level is still normal. If this does not comfort you, tell doctor that you have anxiety over this issue. I am closing this thread now and hoping that you never have need of posting here in the future.

      "Content": "Sorry to welcome you under these circumstances. I have moved this to the prostate cancer forum, since it is a specific diagnosis. Having said that, please be advised that naturopathy is NOT medicine - it is at most nutrition. If anything lowered your dad's PSA, it was the hormone therapy. The subsequent rise in PSA once again demonstrates that natural substances do not fight cancer, but only help nourish a body that is overwhelmed with cancer. My dad tried such and promptly died. There are many here with excellent advice and you will hear from them shortly.",

Best not to be freaked out about what is not cancer. If you cannot be, or are not comforted by the DRE and response to antibiotics, then do look into something like Cognitive Behavioral Therapy to calm your fears.

      "Content": "Lupron and Bicalutamide are not chemotherapy drugs. If I understand correctly (I'm a lymphoma guy), they are hormone antagonists, which have the ultimate effect of reducing the production of hormones which facilitate prostate cancer growth. They have side effects (as does aspirin), but I see no evidence that they interfere with the immune system, or directly attack human tissues, as most chemotherapy drugs do. Remember also that the doctors are not out to kill your father, but to save him by killing the cancer. They well know the dosages which are safe and appropriate, given your dad's overall health. Any adverse reaction he has can be controlled, or the drug reduced or eliminated, depending on how his treatment proceeds. As to chemotherapy worries, I was 10 years younger than your dad, but I received maximum doses of eight chemotherapy drugs in four months. I went on to receive 17 chemotherapy drugs total, and I am still alive, and happy to be so. The immediate concern with your dad is to kill or greatly slow down the cancer. And, if doctor is concerned, taking the treatment up a notch seems to be appropriate. Will it be easy? No, but cancer is harder.",

      "Content": "Lupron and Bicalutamide are not chemotherapy drugs. If I understand correctly (I'm a lymphoma guy), they are hormone antagonists, which have the ultimate effect of reducing the production of hormones which facilitate prostate cancer growth. They have side effects (as does aspirin), but I see no evidence that they interfere with the immune system, or directly attack human tissues, as most chemotherapy drugs do. Remember also that the doctors are not out to kill your father, but to save him by killing the cancer. They well know the dosages which are safe and appropriate, given your dad's overall health. Any adverse reaction he has can be controlled, or the drug reduced or eliminated, depending on how his treatment proceeds. As to chemotherapy worries, I was 10 years younger than your dad, but I received maximum doses of eight chemotherapy drugs in four months. I went on to receive 17 chemotherapy drugs total, and I am still alive, and happy to be so. The immediate concern with your dad is to kill or greatly slow down the cancer. And, if doctor is concerned, taking the treatment up a notch seems to be appropriate. Will it be easy? No, but cancer is harder.",

      "Content": "This is merely anecdotal, but I was prescribed Trazodone for insomnia. It is primarily an anti-depressant and anti-anxiety drug, but also has the effect of producing sleep. However, I found also that it produces the same desired effect as Flomax, apparently causing some muscle relaxation. My hematologist described it as a \"clean drug\" - one with few disadvantages in that it may be stopped and started without tapers, and that seems to be easy for the body to metabolize and eliminate. Dosage makes quite a difference in my case, so one may have to experiment a bit to find the ideal balance of effects. Compared to many others it is also quite affordable, being a long established drug.",

In any case, none of the meds discussed above are habit-forming. Quite right. Melatonin, Benadryl/other anti-histamines, Trazodone are all seemingly better choices than Flomax, as I see it. F.Y.I. for those who may not know, virtually all of the over-the-counter sleep aids are diphenhydramine hydrochloride - in other words, Benadryl anti-histamine.",

      "Content": "I you are in any sort of systemic/chemotherapeutic treatment, ask doctor first! Why? Various natural substances affect the liver's production of certain enzymes - enzymes which are critical in metabolizing the chemotherapy drugs. For example citrus fruits contain hydroxybergamottin, which reduces the liver's production of an enzyme known as CYP3A4. Grapefruit has a substantial amount of this, so must be avoided in those receiving certain drugs.",

      "Content": "If the cancer was somehow 100% confined to the prostate, and the prostate was 100% removed, there should be very little chance of recurrence - nothing being impossible in the absolute sense. A single cancer cell that has migrated to some other area of your body cannot be eradicated if it cannot be found. There is reason to believe that mutated, even malignant cells may go into a dormant state, only to be awakened by some unknown factor in the future. In this life, we never have any assurance that we are \"cancer free.\" No responsible person (neighbor, friend, doctor, scientist etc.) would tell you that. We can be assured only that there is no evidence of cancer (NED). At current levels of technology, the threshold of detection is on the order of one million cancer cells. In one sense, we are only \"cured\" of cancer if we expire of some other cause. Now, all of this, taken somewhat improperly, may lead us to a state of insecurity, but it does have one great advantage: that of reminding us daily of the blessing which each day of life is. As to PSA, testing must be done using the same protocol and by the same lab to have a hope of being comparable. Yet even then there are numerous variables. For all I know, there may be a substance in the body that is not PSA, but is similar enough to provoke an occasional false positive. While this may not be satisfying, the bottom line as I see it is to live each day and love each day - not a single one is guaranteed to any of us.",

      "Content": "These are always good signs that progress is being made. There is more hope today than at any time in human history. Still, we should temper our enthusiasm just a bit, and patiently wait, as it is a huge leap from mouse to man. Every single anticipated \"miracle\" drug that we cannot buy failed to make that leap. As well, the diversity of caner variations - even within a single type, is incredible, being based on our unique DNAs. For this very reason, there is no one treatment with a 100% response rate. Still, research is unrelenting, a good match for the nature of cancer. This will be one to watch with interest.",

      "Content": "Lupron and Bicalutamide are not chemotherapy drugs. If I understand correctly (I'm a lymphoma guy), they are hormone antagonists, which have the ultimate effect of reducing the production of hormones which facilitate prostate cancer growth. They have side effects (as does aspirin), but I see no evidence that they interfere with the immune system, or directly attack human tissues, as most chemotherapy drugs do. Remember also that the doctors are not out to kill your father, but to save him by killing the cancer. They well know the dosages which are safe and appropriate, given your dad's overall health. Any adverse reaction he has can be controlled, or the drug reduced or eliminated, depending on how his treatment proceeds. As to chemotherapy worries, I was 10 years younger than your dad, but I received maximum doses of eight chemotherapy drugs in four months. I went on to receive 17 chemotherapy drugs total, and I am still alive, and happy to be so. The immediate concern with your dad is to kill or greatly slow down the cancer. And, if doctor is concerned, taking the treatment up a notch seems to be appropriate. Will it be easy? No, but cancer is harder.",

If I understand correctly (I'm a lymphoma guy), they are hormone antagonists, which have the ultimate effect of reducing the production of hormones which facilitate prostate cancer growth. They have side effects (as does aspirin), but I see no evidence that they interfere with the immune system, or directly attack human tissues, as most chemotherapy drugs do. Remember also that the doctors are not out to kill your father, but to save him by killing the cancer. They well know the dosages which are safe and appropriate, given your dad's overall health. Any adverse reaction he has can be controlled, or the drug reduced or eliminated, depending on how his treatment proceeds. As to chemotherapy worries, I was 10 years younger than your dad, but I received maximum doses of eight chemotherapy drugs in four months. I went on to receive 17 chemotherapy drugs total, and I am still alive, and happy to be so. The immediate concern with your dad is to kill or greatly slow down the cancer. And, if doctor is concerned, taking the treatment up a notch seems to be appropriate. Will it be easy? No, but cancer is harder.",

The steroid taper continues. 01/18 Consented for Kadmon clinical trial. 03/18 Began 400mg daily of KD025, a rho-Associated Coiled-coil Kinase 2 Inhibitor (ROCK2). 09/18 Due to refractory GvHD, Extracorporeal Photopheresis halted after 15 months ue to lack of additional benefit. 10/18 I was withdrawn from the Kadmon KD025 clinical trial due to increasing fatigue/lack of benefit. 11/18 Began therapy with Ruxolitinib (Jakafi), a JAK 1&2 inhibitor class drug. Started at half-dose due to concerns with drug interactions. To date: 1 cancer, relapse, second relapse/mutation into 2 cancers, then 3 cancers simultaneously, 20 chemotherapy/GVHD drugs in 11 regimens (4 of them at least twice), 5 salvage regimens, 4 clinical trials, 5 post-transplant immuno-suppressant/modulatory drugs, the equivalent of 1,000 years of background radiation from 40+ CT series scans and about 24 PET scans.

      "Content": "This is merely anecdotal, but I was prescribed Trazodone for insomnia. It is primarily an anti-depressant and anti-anxiety drug, but also has the effect of producing sleep. However, I found also that it produces the same desired effect as Flomax, apparently causing some muscle relaxation. My hematologist described it as a \"clean drug\" - one with few disadvantages in that it may be stopped and started without tapers, and that seems to be easy for the body to metabolize and eliminate. Dosage makes quite a difference in my case, so one may have to experiment a bit to find the ideal balance of effects. Compared to many others it is also quite affordable, being a long established drug.",

      "Content": "Lupron and Bicalutamide are not chemotherapy drugs. If I understand correctly (I'm a lymphoma guy), they are hormone antagonists, which have the ultimate effect of reducing the production of hormones which facilitate prostate cancer growth. They have side effects (as does aspirin), but I see no evidence that they interfere with the immune system, or directly attack human tissues, as most chemotherapy drugs do. Remember also that the doctors are not out to kill your father, but to save him by killing the cancer. They well know the dosages which are safe and appropriate, given your dad's overall health. Any adverse reaction he has can be controlled, or the drug reduced or eliminated, depending on how his treatment proceeds. As to chemotherapy worries, I was 10 years younger than your dad, but I received maximum doses of eight chemotherapy drugs in four months. I went on to receive 17 chemotherapy drugs total, and I am still alive, and happy to be so. The immediate concern with your dad is to kill or greatly slow down the cancer. And, if doctor is concerned, taking the treatment up a notch seems to be appropriate. Will it be easy? No, but cancer is harder.",

Started at half-dose due to concerns with drug interactions. To date: 1 cancer, relapse, second relapse/mutation into 2 cancers, then 3 cancers simultaneously, 20 chemotherapy/GVHD drugs in 11 regimens (4 of them at least twice), 5 salvage regimens, 4 clinical trials, 5 post-transplant immuno-suppressant/modulatory drugs, the equivalent of 1,000 years of background radiation from 40+ CT series scans and about 24 PET scans. Both lymphoid and myeloid malignancies lend a certain symmetry to the hematological journey. Believing in the redemptive value of suffering makes all the difference.",

      "Content": "Lupron and Bicalutamide are not chemotherapy drugs. If I understand correctly (I'm a lymphoma guy), they are hormone antagonists, which have the ultimate effect of reducing the production of hormones which facilitate prostate cancer growth. They have side effects (as does aspirin), but I see no evidence that they interfere with the immune system, or directly attack human tissues, as most chemotherapy drugs do. Remember also that the doctors are not out to kill your father, but to save him by killing the cancer. They well know the dosages which are safe and appropriate, given your dad's overall health. Any adverse reaction he has can be controlled, or the drug reduced or eliminated, depending on how his treatment proceeds. As to chemotherapy worries, I was 10 years younger than your dad, but I received maximum doses of eight chemotherapy drugs in four months. I went on to receive 17 chemotherapy drugs total, and I am still alive, and happy to be so. The immediate concern with your dad is to kill or greatly slow down the cancer. And, if doctor is concerned, taking the treatment up a notch seems to be appropriate. Will it be easy? No, but cancer is harder.",

Started at half-dose due to concerns with drug interactions. To date: 1 cancer, relapse, second relapse/mutation into 2 cancers, then 3 cancers simultaneously, 20 chemotherapy/GVHD drugs in 11 regimens (4 of them at least twice), 5 salvage regimens, 4 clinical trials, 5 post-transplant immuno-suppressant/modulatory drugs, the equivalent of 1,000 years of background radiation from 40+ CT series scans and about 24 PET scans. Both lymphoid and myeloid malignancies lend a certain symmetry to the hematological journey. Believing in the redemptive value of suffering makes all the difference.",

It is known to be effective in many cases against non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma. I just entered the phase III trial of Alisertib for what appears to be an unknown sub-type of of AngioImmunoblastic T-Cell Lymphoma and after a single cycle, doctor can detect only one of perhaps 8-10 tumors that were palpable. So, yes, there is much hope.",

      "Content": "You've tried Tamsulosin (Flowmax)? I used it for a time, but discontinued it after I experienced some incontinence. That, however, may have been caused by a thickening of my bladder walls (probably due to chronic steroid use). In a similar vein, so to speak, my hematologist prescribed Trazodone for problems with insomnia. I found that it definitely helps with sleep. A welcome side effect in my case was improved flow and voiding. I was initially concerned, as it is primarily used as an anti-anxiety and anti-depression medication, but has those two beneficial side effects in my case. It is a relatively affordable \"clean drug\" and one may start and stop it at will. Just a thought, in case you want to discuss either drug with your doctor.",

There is no way of knowing at the time if your choice is correct. I would think that it is time to have a serious discussion about this with your oncologist, as anecdotal stories from the web will be conflicting and may serve only to further complicate the issue. I would consult with experts in both disciplines and make specific inquiries regarding the risks and benefits.",

If not, it would be great if the glitch is corrected. Seeing the url's themselves makes for a very messy appearance, as well as the need for users to copy and paste them instead of simply clicking.

And I've never heard \"Leg Tingling\" being a symptom of PC. Allen Right now, I have pain, numbness and tingling in my left arm and jaw. Heart attack? Nope. Enlarged lymph nodes impinging on nerves. Since your infection is in the groin, I think it is very likely that you have some enlarged groin lymph nodes. It is not a stretch to think that one of these is also impinging on a leg nerve that passes through the area.

And I've never heard \"Leg Tingling\" being a symptom of PC. Allen Right now, I have pain, numbness and tingling in my left arm and jaw. Heart attack? Nope. Enlarged lymph nodes impinging on nerves. Since your infection is in the groin, I think it is very likely that you have some enlarged groin lymph nodes. It is not a stretch to think that one of these is also impinging on a leg nerve that passes through the area.

Medical uses are as immune suppression, although one variety is being investigated for potential binding to glioma cells. There appears to be no reliable information regarding its medical effectiveness. As such, I am closing this thread to prevent misinformation or confusion.",

      "Content": "As to scar tissue in general, some bodies produce more of it than others. I have had two surgeries on my lumbar spine, for example. After the second surgery, the surgeon told me \"You had a lot of scar tissue - about the worst I've seen.\" And yes, that recovery took longer than the first, and left issues that persist to this day. Having said this, none of this is to be taken as if it will impact your specific case.",

As to his 90 year old father, cancer is far more complicated than that, being based on individual DNA. Your husband's DNA is substantially different from his dad's. His immune system is also substantially different. This PSA spike \"may\" indicate that the cancer is becoming more aggressive, or at least growing. Cancer is a living part of us and can adapt faster than we can. The fact that he has cancer indicates that it is growing faster than his immune system can kill it. A urologist who specializes in PC is a must. Now you might currently have the nicest, most amiable urologist on earth, but I would rather have a gruff specialist who would save my life than a nice guy who would gladly attend my funeral.",

It dropped within six months to extremely poor. Since that point it has dropped at least twice again, and I have picked up several potentially fatal conditions, mostly due to treatment. There is not a word in the English language to describe how abysmal my prognosis is. But, this all began over nine years ago. What I have learned is to enjoy each day, as tomorrow is guaranteed to absolutely no one. Fears about the future steal our todays from us - and today is all we possess.",

It is primarily and antidepressant with some anti-anxiety qualities, but it also can help with BPH and in some men, has a Cialis-like effect. I was prescribed it as it is a great sleep aid. It is a \"clean\" drug in that its side effects are usually mild and one can start or stop it without worry in most cases. It is cheap and well proven. For those who are anxious or somewhat depressed over the whole situation, it might cover several concerns. It may not be for you, but is worth asking about.",

Platelets climbing steadily, red cells follow. 09/21/15 Acute skin Graft versus Host Disease arrives. DEXA scan reveals Osteoporosis. 09/26/-11/03/15 Prednisone to control skin GvHD. 11/2015 Acute GvHD re-classified to Chronic Graft versus Host Disease. 05/2016 Tacrolimus stopped. Prednisone from 30-90mg daily tried. Sirolimus begun. Narrow-band UV-B therapy started, but discontinued for lack of response. One treatment of P-UVAreceived, but halted due to medication reaction. 09/16/16 Three skin punch biopsies. 11/04/16 GvHD clinical trial of Ofatumumab (Arzerra) + Prednisone + Methylprednisolone begun. 12/16 Type II Diabetes, Hypertension - both treatment-related. 05/17 Extracorporeal Photopheresis (ECP) begun in attempt to control chronic Graft-versus-Host-Disease (cGvHD. 8 year old Power Port removed and replaced with Vortex (Smart) Port for ECP. 05/2017 Chronic anemia (low hematocrit). Chronic kidney disease. Cataracts from radiation and steroids. 06/17 Trying various antibiotics in a search for tolerable prophylaxis. 08/17 Bone marrow biopsy reveals the presence of 2% cells with 20q Deletion Myelodysplastic Syndrome, considered to be Minimum Residual Disease. 12/17 Bone marrow biopsy reveals no abnormalities in the marrow - MDS eradicated. The steroid taper continues. 01/18 Consented for Kadmon clinical trial. 03/18 Began 400mg daily of KD025, a rho-Associated Coiled-coil Kinase 2 Inhibitor (ROCK2). 09/18 Due to refractory GvHD, Extracorporeal Photopheresis halted after 15 months ue to lack of additional benefit. 10/18 I was withdrawn from the Kadmon KD025 clinical trial due to increasing fatigue/lack of benefit. 11/18 Began therapy with Ruxolitinib (Jakafi), a JAK 1&2 inhibitor class drug. Started at half-dose due to concerns with drug interactions. To date: 1 cancer, relapse, second relapse/mutation into 2 cancers, then 3 cancers simultaneously, 20 chemotherapy/GVHD drugs in 11 regimens (4 of them at least twice), 5 salvage regimens, 4 clinical trials, 5 post-transplant immuno-suppressant/modulatory drugs, the equivalent of 1,000 years of background radiation from 40+ CT series scans and about 24 PET scans. Both lymphoid and myeloid malignancies lend a certain symmetry to the hematological journey. Believing in the redemptive value of suffering makes all the difference.",

      "Content": "A non-prostate specific drug that might be considered is Trazodone. It is primarily and antidepressant with some anti-anxiety qualities, but it also can help with BPH and in some men, has a Cialis-like effect. I was prescribed it as it is a great sleep aid. It is a \"clean\" drug in that its side effects are usually mild and one can start or stop it without worry in most cases. It is cheap and well proven. For those who are anxious or somewhat depressed over the whole situation, it might cover several concerns. It may not be for you, but is worth asking about.",
