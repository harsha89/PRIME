      "Content": "Hi I have been diagnosed as benign prostae for the last 4 years. Only once biopsy is done 2 or 3 years ago. 7 months ago docotr decided to go ahead with TURP surgery but 3 months later changed the idea to do the Biopsy for the second time but again 3 months later changed the idea to TURP. So preadmission is on 2nd Sept 13 and TURP surgery is 17th Sept 13. I am really confused as they keep changing. However i prefer to do a Biopsy again . but doctor says it will not help as once done 2 or 3 years ago is still valid. Is it ok only one Biopsy for the 4 years ? Or docotor should do another one biopsy before going ahead the TURP? Please advise ASAP. Thanke in advance",

      "Content": "I have been diagnosed with benign prostate since 2009 and only once biopsy is done with no cancer. I use to take drugs such as alpha blocker to reduce the size of the prostate gland but still my symptoms remain same. 7 months ago somewhere in february 2013 Doctor said that I have to go through the TURP . Then after 3 months they changed the idea and said they want to do a Biopsy again. When the time is getting close dodtor again says they have to the TURP saying biopsy no need as the previous biopsydone 2 or 3 years ago is OK. I am really confused now as they keep changing their decision. However i PREFER TO DO THE BIOPSY RATHER THAN THE turp! I need any body can help me what action i HAVE TO TKAE AS MY PREADMISSION CHECK UP IN ON 2ND sEPT 13 AND THE turp IS DUE ON 17TH sEPT 13. PLEASE ADVISE ASAP.",
