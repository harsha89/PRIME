    "Content": "I just started the IMRT treatment with the Varian RapidArc and a system called the Calypso. They call it GPS for the body. According to what I read, it is the most accurate system on the market today by some 50% since it happens in real time. The system \"pings\" the implanted \"beacons, and with any movement the machine stops. I have had 14 treatment sessions to date with 14 sessions to go. Zero side affects so far. The only side affect so far is from the hormone therapy with the hot flshes, which are not that frequent. I do know that most university's have the system, but they are limited in locations. My treatment is happening at Oregon Health and Sciences University, so quite a number of students attend the sessions. From start to finish it takes 15 minutes and I head back to work. Ron",
