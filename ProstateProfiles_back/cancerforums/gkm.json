      "Content": "Hello, I am 62 years old. I was recently diagnosed with PC with Gleason 6 (3+3) PSA 12.52. Should I go for surgery or radiation or can I choose Active Surveillance, too? I am in India and here doctors are suggesting for either surgery or radiation. But I would like to remain in active surveillance for next couple of months. Please share your opinion. GKM",

      "Content": "Hi all, Thank you very much for all your responses and opinions! My biopsy shows 3 out of 12 cores positive for malignancy. However, I don't know what percentage of cancer involvement in each core. The biopsy report doesn't mention them. I was told verbally by the urologist that my tumor stage is T2a, however the MRI report says, \"Prostate is normal in size\". All DRE also came as normal. I'll have these clarified from the urologist in my next visit. However, in two ultrasounds from 2 different labs, my prostate size came to be 45 cc and 54 cc within a span of 3 days. My MRI says, \"A small nodular lesion with heterogeneous enhancement on dynamic post CE scans and restricted diffusion within is seen in mid-gland region on the right. No extracapular disease is seen. Small un-involve bilateral inguinal and external illac nodes seen.\" Can anybody please tell me what this means?",
