      "Content": "Today we saw our neurologist and radiation doctor to talk about options. My husband prostate cancer has metastasized to his pelvic bone, tail bone. Dr was surprised that it is in his bone as PSA Level was 21 and he thought it would be in the surrounding area. He said he wouldn' t remove the prostate as it would be not be beneficial for my husband, radiation is out as my husbamd has Crohns and colitis and he feels that he could cause more damage, with the bowels. Our options are chemo and hormone therapy..... we see an onochologist next week. Dr hopes that this will kill the cancer , slow it down . Has anyone on the form done chemo and hormone tharpy, my husband is only 56 years old... advice",
