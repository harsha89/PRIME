      "Content": "I am around 8 weeks and am having a spurt once and a while. It seems like more than I had at first. But it is tolerable for now. I have been less than vigilant than most probably in remembering to do my kegels daily. I have noticed that being much more active than I was at first seems to cause more leaking to happen. At night I am fortunately staying dry. That was not the case at all a few weeks after the RP. In answer to your question I would think the decrease in flow means something is working in your favor.",

      "Content": "I am a newbie to this forum. I had an RARP on January 8th. All has gone fairly smoothly but I have noticed an increase in the amount of blood in my urine. At first I was having a very slight amount of blood that was adding a slight pinkish tinge to my urine. For the past few days blood has been appearing only at the end of flow and comes out very red and opaque. It doesn't mix into the urine but just pools at bottom of toilet. Has anyone had anything like this happen? I appreciate any insights anyone might have. Thanks.",
