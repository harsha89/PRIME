    "Content": "I had RP on 10/17/2016 with Gleason 6 and all 24 negative lymph nodes, after diagnosis in 4/2016 of Gleason 4+3, downgraded to 3+3 by Johns Hopkins second opinion. I had a Prolaris Test done afterwards with a score of 4.2 - more aggressive - 23% chance of biochemical recurrence in 10 years. I have had three quarterly post surgery psa tests: < .02, the <.01 (different lab), and finally .02 (a third lab). I know I need keep having the quarterly PSA testing. However, are there other tests that I can have done?",
