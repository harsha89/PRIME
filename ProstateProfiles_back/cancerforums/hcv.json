      "Content": "I had my surgery 4/24/12 and had nerve sparing. My program has included viagara, cialis, or levitra nightly but I use a 50mg of viagara (when using this ) nightly instead of 25mg. At 5 months I added injections of caverject twice a week. I pump three times a week. Your program is good and should include self stimulation. I would also do injections if no significant action by 5-6 months at the latest. FYI- unless you are very lucky this is not an overnite process and can be very discouraging. I am ten months in and have some partial erections in the morning with stimulation - nothing for sex. I have not really had sex since surgery. It has been very trying for me and my wife. I would encourage you to use the injections to restart your intimacy. My wife and I had a lot of tension with the whole injection process and I use them only for rehab. I think my depression after surgery set us back. Try to be compliant with rehab and be realistic and positive- this is where I went astray. Good Luck.",
