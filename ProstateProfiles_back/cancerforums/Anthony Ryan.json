      "Content": "Underwent robotic prostate removal in 2003. The surgeon \"had to harvest a nerve during the surgery\" which left me impotent. Cancer returned in bed tissue and was treated by radiation (35 sessions) in 2008. My PSA readings since have been next to nothing and have not increased. I am experiencing increasing problems with incontinence 1) going many times 2) dribbling before I can get to a toilet 3) leaking if I bend over at the waist. My question is: Does cancer returning to the bed tissue ever reach a far removed point where it no longer registers on the PSA scale? My previous doctors were in the USA but I now live in Thailand. Should I be worried or is the increasing incontinence a natural process of getting old? I am now 74 years old.",
