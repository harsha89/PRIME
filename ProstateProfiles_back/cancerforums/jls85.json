      "Content": "I'm fairly new to the forum and by no means an expert, but your situation is very similar to my significant other's. He was noted to have an elevated PSA (7, in his case) on a routine screening at the age of 37 - no symptoms at all, though he does have a family history of prostate cancer. He had a biopsy about six months later, as the PSA remained elevated and even climbed a bit on repeat tests, in spite of antibiotics. The biopsy at that time was negative, though his urologist cautioned him that false negatives are sadly not uncommon in early-stage disease. Everyone said, of course, that he was far too young for PCa to be at all likely - probably just prostatitis, or some other benign issue. His PSA continued to rise steadily over the next five years, and he finally had a saturation biopsy this past May - positive for cancer, Gleason score 7. He is 42 years old now, very young for PCa. We assume that the cancer was present five years ago and was simply missed on the biopsy, and had in fact likely been there for quite a while prior to that considering his initial PSA of 7. He is being treated now and we are hopeful that everything will turn out positively - but in retrospect, I think we both wish that we had taken things more seriously and pursued an answer five years ago. Your situation may turn out to be very different, of course! I sincerely hope so. But be careful of falling into the trap of assuming that it surely can't be cancer because of your age, and allowing a negative biopsy to give you a false sense of security. I've since learned that so called \"blind\" biopsies have a distressingly high incidence of false negatives. This may be where you need to start, but if it doesn't show anything, I would strongly urge you to pursue further testing - 3T MRI, possible saturation biopsy, etc. If needed, it may even be worth getting a second opinion from one of the top cancer centers on how to proceed if your initial biopsy is negative. I know that Duke, for example, prides itself on being able to find PCa if it's there - even if previous biopsies, etc. have been negative or inconclusive. My takeaway from our experience has been that if your PSA is suspiciously high for no good reason, even if you're quite young, cancer is very much on the table. Better to find it now, than later. Best wishes, and I hope you're able to get some answers.",

Unfortunately, the news was not as good as we had hoped - Gleason score was upgraded to 8 (3+5), with extracapsular extension and positive surgical margins on the anterior aspect.

We are still wrapping our heads around this news, since we had really hoped that the surgery would be curative - or at least, would buy him several years before any follow-up treatment might be needed. Any words of advice or encouragement would be welcome We are concerned about what kinds of side effects to expect with the radiation treatment, so any thoughts on that from those who have been there would be great. He's understandably very worried about long-term urinary continence, ED, etc. - especially since those things had just started to improve from surgery.

      "Content": "Hi all, This is my first post on this forum, so it's very nice to meet you all - although I certainly wish I didn't need to be here! My significant other (SO) was diagnosed with prostate cancer via saturation biopsy on June 2nd. Needless to say, we are scared and a bit overwhelmed - it seems that PCa is quite a complex disease, with lots of factors to consider and a multitude of treatment options. I will fill in all of the relevant details later on when I have his biopsy report and records on-hand to look at, but a brief summary of where we are right now: SO is 42 years old, very active and in great shape. Otherwise healthy. He has a history of markedly elevated PSA levels dating back to 2012 - PSA was around 10 the first time it was checked, as I recall, at the age of 37. A biopsy was done in the fall of 2012, which was negative. PSAs have continued to rise steadily but gradually since then, to a level of 19 in March of this year. The saturation biopsy was done last week, and came back positive in 2 of 22 cores - both Gleason score 7 (4+3). He had a contrast MRI done in March which included the prostate and pelvic region, which showed no evidence of any problems. DREs have been consistently normal, and still are. The urologist says that based on what we know right now, SO is staged as T1c and he believes that the cancer is confined to the prostate. My understanding of all this is that, although a Gleason score of 4+3 indicates a moderately aggressive cancer, we have a good chance of a cure if all goes well with treatment. I'm sure that we will have many questions over the next few weeks (thanks in advance for your patience!), but right now, the main one is this. Our urologist indicated that surgery would be highly recommended as the best option in SO's case. This does seem to be the most common approach that I have seen for PCa that is presumed to be localized, and I believe we understand the major \"pros\" of that approach - including post-op pathology analysis for a better picture of the situation, more options for secondary treatment later on if the cancer recurs, etc. The problem is, SO is vehemently opposed to surgery unless there are truly no other viable options. While I think that I would probably choose surgery if it were me, I do understand his reasons and believe that they are valid and well thought-out. Mainly, he is concerned about serious, possibly permanent side effects (incontinence, ED, etc.) that may severely impact his quality of life. These are crappy side effects to deal with at any age, but I can sympathize with the fact that they are especially hard to handle at 42. From our research, it seems that radiation and surgery have fairly comparable long-term \"cure\" rates for localized PCa in many cases. He is very interested in radiation therapy for his PCa, including a multi-modal approach with brachytherapy, IMRT, etc. if needed. We are meeting with a local radiation oncologist next week, and will also be seeking a second opinion at one of the major cancer treatment centers within the next few weeks, so hopefully they can shed some light on these options as well. But so far, everyone we have spoken to (both laypeople, and medical professionals) has said unequivocally that surgery is by far his best chance of a good long-term outcome. I would be very interested to hear from anyone here who chose radiation over surgery as a first-line treatment approach, including your reasons for the choice, how aggressive your cancer was, and what specific type of treatment plan was used. I would also love to know if you are happy with your decision, looking back, or if you ever wish you had chosen surgery instead. Any other general thoughts on radiation vs. surgery, especially in such a young patient, would also be very welcome.",

There are also some other concerns which are more surgery-specific, in his case, which would be avoided with radiation. We know that surgery may ultimately be the only realistic choice. But we would like to hear more about radiation as an alternative, assuming localized disease only - particularly for someone so young.",

      "Content": "Hi all, This is my first post on this forum, so it's very nice to meet you all - although I certainly wish I didn't need to be here! My significant other (SO) was diagnosed with prostate cancer via saturation biopsy on June 2nd. Needless to say, we are scared and a bit overwhelmed - it seems that PCa is quite a complex disease, with lots of factors to consider and a multitude of treatment options. I will fill in all of the relevant details later on when I have his biopsy report and records on-hand to look at, but a brief summary of where we are right now: SO is 42 years old, very active and in great shape. Otherwise healthy. He has a history of markedly elevated PSA levels dating back to 2012 - PSA was around 10 the first time it was checked, as I recall, at the age of 37. A biopsy was done in the fall of 2012, which was negative. PSAs have continued to rise steadily but gradually since then, to a level of 19 in March of this year. The saturation biopsy was done last week, and came back positive in 2 of 22 cores - both Gleason score 7 (4+3). He had a contrast MRI done in March which included the prostate and pelvic region, which showed no evidence of any problems. DREs have been consistently normal, and still are. The urologist says that based on what we know right now, SO is staged as T1c and he believes that the cancer is confined to the prostate. My understanding of all this is that, although a Gleason score of 4+3 indicates a moderately aggressive cancer, we have a good chance of a cure if all goes well with treatment. I'm sure that we will have many questions over the next few weeks (thanks in advance for your patience!), but right now, the main one is this. Our urologist indicated that surgery would be highly recommended as the best option in SO's case. This does seem to be the most common approach that I have seen for PCa that is presumed to be localized, and I believe we understand the major \"pros\" of that approach - including post-op pathology analysis for a better picture of the situation, more options for secondary treatment later on if the cancer recurs, etc. The problem is, SO is vehemently opposed to surgery unless there are truly no other viable options. While I think that I would probably choose surgery if it were me, I do understand his reasons and believe that they are valid and well thought-out. Mainly, he is concerned about serious, possibly permanent side effects (incontinence, ED, etc.) that may severely impact his quality of life. These are crappy side effects to deal with at any age, but I can sympathize with the fact that they are especially hard to handle at 42. From our research, it seems that radiation and surgery have fairly comparable long-term \"cure\" rates for localized PCa in many cases. He is very interested in radiation therapy for his PCa, including a multi-modal approach with brachytherapy, IMRT, etc. if needed. We are meeting with a local radiation oncologist next week, and will also be seeking a second opinion at one of the major cancer treatment centers within the next few weeks, so hopefully they can shed some light on these options as well. But so far, everyone we have spoken to (both laypeople, and medical professionals) has said unequivocally that surgery is by far his best chance of a good long-term outcome. I would be very interested to hear from anyone here who chose radiation over surgery as a first-line treatment approach, including your reasons for the choice, how aggressive your cancer was, and what specific type of treatment plan was used. I would also love to know if you are happy with your decision, looking back, or if you ever wish you had chosen surgery instead. Any other general thoughts on radiation vs. surgery, especially in such a young patient, would also be very welcome.",
