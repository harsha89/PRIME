      "Content": "Good luck to you!! My radiation was 3 months post-op. Basically radiation became a \"job\". 9 weeks almost,at 5 days a week. The whole \"drain, fill and hold\" became a routine. I had continence from the pull of the catheter after surgery. So I did a 3 month wait for healing and then radiation. I was allowed to wear sweat pants instead of a gown change. I came , took off my shoes (wore socks) put them keys, and phone in locker and went in . Nice to wear what ever kept me warm and comfortable. My PSA is moving . You are correct with HT. About the only route to keep it under control for some time hopefully. Hard to have had breast cancer 12 years ago, and now this. Did genetic testing and oddly enough nothing was abnormal. Thankfully I haven't passed this to my kids and grandkids. Blessing there. Again thank you.",

      "Content": "Allen, Thank you for your help... Yes i had surgery, never had a \"real\" zero on PSA. Waited the shortest time (3 months) to heal from that. Then the PSA was making upward moves. Had .042 at the start of radiation . At the 25th session I asked if a PSA would be done? It was one of the Oncologists \"thoughts\" at the start of treatment. At 25 he said no and lets look after. He really was wondering when .080 was marked. I haven't shown a reduction and my worry is that now it's \"out\". If I am a 5-10 year guy want to know that also. Best regards to you and Chuck for some guidance.... Michael",

      "Content": "Good evening, This is my first question. Like many I'm trying to understand what is next? My stats are below and I don't know what to look for as far as the direction my cancer is taking me. I was diagnosed last March 2016. June DaVinci removal . Diagnosed as aggressive after my first biopsy from the Urologist. He had me to the Oncologist quickly and planed the surgery. Surgery was as successful as I hoped. PSA 0. PSA second .024 Third .042. With 3 months to \"recover\" Oncologist moved to radiation . I just completed that and now have a PSA of .080. Not the New Years celebration I hoped for. So I have never really gone to PSA zero since my first test after the prostate was removed. My next PSA will be the end of January 2017, meeting with the Oncologist first week of February for that review. Oncologist said at the .080 that we didn't \"hit\" where we need to be. Has anyone had this scenerio? What have you done? Definitely looks like I continue to have cancer. thank you...",
