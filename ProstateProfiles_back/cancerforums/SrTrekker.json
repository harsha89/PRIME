    "Content": "Murphy, I would seek out the major medical educational institutions that have a significant Urology practice. I would look for a surgeon that does both robotic and open surgery. if there is a chance that the cancer has moved beyond the prostate, open surgery may be better. If outside the prostate, it is good for the surgeon to feel the tissue to determine the likelihood of cancer in that tissue. The outcomes/recovery period should be similar to the robotic, according to Dr. Walsh's book. Here is a link to a Dr. Schaeffer clip on YouTube (a Johns Hopkins promo piece): Link removed per policy, and secondly, a general piece that covers several of the points: Link removed per policy I am almost two weeks out from surgery; just had my catheter removed yesterday. When I was diagnosed, I read Dr. Walsh's book - downloadable on to a Kindle. Living in No. VA, I was lucky that I could more easily travel to Johns Hopkins. Dr. Schaeffer is the surgeon who worked on me - an excellent fellow. I expected open surgery. He recommended robotic because of the low probability, among other reasons, that the cancer had not traveled beyond the prostate. The excellent pathology report proved him correct.",
