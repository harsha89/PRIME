      "Content": "After the PSA's and biopsies, CT scans ,etc reports of 3+ 3 Gleason scores (only 2 ) . I'm at the point where I need to DO SOMETHING ! I don't think I'm mentally wired to do the watchful waiting thing and have friends that had poor results with radiation treatments soooo..... I'm looking for personal experiences with Robotic RP surgeons in NW Indiana . The standard wisdom seems to be \" get your ass to U of C or North Western \" but I'd like to stay local if I'm not making a big medical mistake ! Any thoughts? Thanks, Roger",

      "Content": "Thanks to all for the great information ! To Mike's question , I'm REALLY not in any hurry to do the RP thing , just trying to get a good hold on all my options , but am I just putting off the inevitable by a year or so ? It would seem that maybe men with the 2 core Gleason at 6 frequently opt for the AS . I can't see doing a biopsy every year ... not because of any discomfort ( none with first two) but it always seems that there is real infection possibility. Still thinking ... next stop, Univ level opinion �� Thanks all",
