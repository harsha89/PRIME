      "Content": "Originally Posted by HighlanderCFH Not sure about that, Chris. But prostate infections DO put pretty good spikes into the PSA number. It really is VERY unlikely that such a short term spike would be caused by prostate cancer. It is far more likely to be prostatitis, something that can be cured with medicine. Good luck! Chuck I will look into this more Chuck, I had no idea about prostatitis and other things, thanks. I was able to talk to my dad and he seems a lot more relaxed about this whole thing (if it is or it's PC) then I am (Due of our family history with PC).",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by Michael F Hi Chris! 4 Questions: - Why did your father at age 70 have an Ultrasensitive PSA (so it appears) test? - Did his URO MD have any explanation as to why it was so low back in Feb? - At such a low level, why did he have his PSA repeated 6 months later? - Has he been previously treated for either PCa or other prostate issues? TY MF - He got the test with his GP haven't seen the URO yet - He went in for his yearly physical on Feb and they took his PSA along with other blood work. They repeated the whole test again (all blood work) because his blood sugar was a lot higher than normal (He has type 2 diabetes). So when the test results came back and his PSA level hiked the doctor said he wanted to repeat it. - His PSA levels have alway been that low...never above 1.0ng/mL - no he's never had any type of prostate issues",
