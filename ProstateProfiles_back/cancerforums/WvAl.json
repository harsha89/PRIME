      "Content": "Hello, I want to first thank everyone on this site for sharing their experiences with prostate cancer. I'm 50 years old and just had radical prostatectomy via DaVinci at John Hopkins, performed by Dr Schaeffer. I'm 5 days post op and experiencing blood from my penis, during bowel movements. I'm taking stool softener and have loose bowels, so I'm not straining much. I am a little concerned about this and wondering if anyone had similar experience. Thank you very much 50yo Gleason 6 May 2012, psa 4.1 Nov 2013, psa 6.1 Radical prostatectomy on 3/12/14 Dr Schaeffer, John Hopkins",
