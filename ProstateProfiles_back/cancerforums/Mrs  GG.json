      "Content": "Hi all, First off, a huge thank you to all contributors here for your insight, advice, tips and kindness. My husband was diagnosed in June and since then I have been coming here for much needed comfort and support. I'm sure you already know, but the information here is invaluable. A couple of things in particular: 1. Because of advice given here, my husband (who is a very fit and active 62) started a 30 day abs and core muscle routine to prepare for surgery. He thought he had \"super strong abs\", but he actually didn't...but he's getting there now. I believe strengthening these muscles will really help him in recovery. 2. He started doing Kegel exercises. In fact his doctor recommended he attend a pre-surgical Pelvic Floor Clinic, which he did, and learned he wasn't doing the Kegel's properly. The advice on this page helped there too! 3. Because he has PNI, the level of anxiety has been raised. But I understand better now about it, and am not totally panicked by it. (Still worried a lot, but not panicking!) 4. I've learned life goes on. A new chapter. A new ending....which will be many, many years from now. I hope I filled in my husband's bio background properly. If not...how do you do that?

      "Content": "Hi all, First the good news, my husband had RALP surgery 5 days ago. The doctor called yesterday and told us the initial pathology report looked really good!!!!! What a relief! We will hear all the details next week, but the doctor wanted to pass that on to us. BEST NEWS EVER! Here's my question. My husband experienced bladder spasms in the hospital post op. They gave him anti-spasm medication which did work, and sent him home with a daily dose of Ditropan (oxybutynin). He was doing fine until last night when he had a bladder spasm that he listed as \"10\" on the pain scale. It occurred just after his first \"real\" BM. Today, he has been experiencing the spasms fairly regularly, maybe every 4 hours or so with pain levels at about 7 or 8. From all I've read, this does not sound completely out of the ordinary, but I wonder if anyone has any helpful tips? He has been walking regularly, taking in lots of fluids, taking it easy. These spasms are just wiping him out. As always, thank you for your wonderful support! GG",

      "Content": "Okay, another question that is on my mind. I know bruising and swelling is to be expected after RALP around the testicles and penis. My husband doesn't have that (he is one week post surgery) but he is massively black and blue from his hip bone to his rib cage on his right side. Just the right side and it is wicked. Every color of the rainbow and it looks like he's been beaten with a baseball bat. We are wondering if this was from the straps from the operating table (but just on one side?) or perhaps the doctor took more tissue sample from this side causing more internal bleeding?? We're stumped and will ask the doc about it tomorrow during catheter removal. I haven't noticed any other comments about torso bruising. Anybody else have this? GG",

      "Content": "Here's perhaps a helpful answer that we heard from our surgeon in regard to bruising. He said that some surgeons give one or two shots of a blood thinner during surgery to help battle any potential blood clots. He said my husband received two on the left side. He also inserted two of the larger robotic ports on the left side, which were directly through muscle. Muscle bleeds and therefore blood pooled there, resulting in a large amount of bruising. Hope this helps others who are suddenly \"black belts\" (and not the karate kind!)",

      "Content": "My husband received his pathology reports and it is like we can breathe for the first time in three months! WOO HOO. I know we still have to wait for the PSA blood tests, but this was the news we were hoping and praying for. Final grade: 3=4=7 10% of prostate involved by tumor Cancer confined to prostatic capsule Seminal Vesicle invasion - negative Margins - negative Lymph-vascular invasion - negative Perineural invasion - present Grading: pT2c Distant metastasis - not applicable WHEW! Still smiling over this. In the event it helps others, he did experience a relatively rare setback (only 2%?). But by comparsion to the pathology report...a tiny hiccup. Here's what happened: He experience bad bladder spasms the entire time the catheter was in. Meds didn't give much relief. He had the catheter pulled and felt great! He was so proud of himself that he barely even had a dribble (warning sign!). By midnight he had extreme belly pain and spasms again. By morning we were advised by the surgeon to head to the Emergency department as it sounded like he had a distended bladder. However, when they did a bladder scan, his bladder was nearly empty. He had a leak and his belly was full and bloated with all the fluids. They reinserted the catheter (which brought relief) and kept him in the hospital two days. He will get the catheter out next week. He can already tell the difference that things feel \"right\" now. This time, after they pull the catheter they are going to make him pee before he leaves the office. What caused this? They don't know. Maybe a clot in the urethrea, maybe swelling, maybe a slight suture opening. Who knows. Like I said, compared to the good pathology report, this is a setback we can LIVE with! As always, thanks all. This forum is so important!! GG",
