      "Content": "Mr SubDenis: I see that your rather dour philosophical questioning has surfaced again. To put it bluntly: We are all dying. With each passing heartbeat, breath, blink of our eyes we are closer to the end. Since death is inevitable, we should chose to live life as fully as possible for as long as possible. I am sorry to read of another malady that you possess. I may be wrong but if you were a full career Navy submariner, then the malady that started at age 25 likely was not life threatening or career threatening. Again, you have had a most fortunate experience with prostate cancer. Many on this forum are far far less fortunate and can only wish that they had received your exact diagnosis. You did a highly commendable job researching all of the possible treatment options and settled on a treatment (HDR BT) that would work best for you - and it has! In 3 months your PSA has dropped more than 75%. At that rate, your upcoming PSA may be less than 0.1 As you say: \"let's choose living!\" Good luck with the next PSA. It'll be vanishing.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by ASAdvocate I\u2019m on a tour of Central Asia, and am now in Uzbekistan, where internet access appears to be unrestricted. Not so in Turkmenistan, where the Soviet-style government blocks \u201cunacceptable\u201d websites, even using VPN\u2019s. Such banned sites include Facebook, Yahoo, Google, AND cancerforums.net. Why is that??? They do play favorites, blocking foxnews and drudge, while allowing cnn and msnbc. But, those are political, and, while cancer treatment discussions can sometimes have the tone of politics, the blocking of the site is puzzling. Other, similar PCa forums are allowed. Well, now we know why we never see postings from Turkmenistan �� Hmmm........ Did you have internet access to interfere with American elections while there?",
