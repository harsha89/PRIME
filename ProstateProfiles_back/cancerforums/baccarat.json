      "Content": "Just took my dad to urologist today. He was on casodex from last Tuesday till this past Friday. (so 11 doses of 50 mg of casodex). Today urologist gave him a 1 month Lupron shot and told me that my dad could stop taking the casodex or just finish the remaining 20 something pills and no need to refill. Not sure casodex is the reason for this or nurses at hospital missed the vein and hit the nerve when drawing blood every 6 hrs, but my dads right index finger, middle finger and a little of the thumb feel numb. Despite the urologist telling me the only side effect of Lupron is hot flashes and loss of bone mass after 10 yrs, he never told me about Lupron flare up and nerve compression. Now i am very worried about my dad and what Lupron can do to him. Forgot to mention that he stopped taking Casodex on his own will 3 days before the Lupron shot so i don't know if that will add to any problems. Whoever has knowledge about this please share it with me..thanks in advance",

      "Content": "Ok here is the story. 6 yrs ago, my dad who was 85 yrs old did a psa test and it was 4. He did a roto rooter on prostate and tissue came back negative. In august of this year, he had a cystoscopy and another roto rooter of prostate and again the tissue came back negative. He never had a biopsy done from rectal however. In November, just 3 months after transurethra biopsy came back negative, my dad went to hospital with lower back pain which we thought was caused by shingles. They did a cat scan and found his reteroperineal lymph nodes swollen(4 cm) and an enlarged prostate and suspected prostate cancer that metastised to bones despite no masses found on bones. They wanted a psa test and bone scan done. Psa came in at 300. He also had a Hemorragic cyst on kidney which ruptured and required 6 pints of blood during this an entire ordeal, plus pneumonia, plus gi bleed from ulcer caused by Pylori bacteria. They put him on casodex and ordered a bone scan. My issues and questions are these-- How accurate are transurethra biposies? If my dad came back negative just 3 months ago, what are the odds that he really has prostate cancer metastized to bones? What else could cause reteroperineal lymph nodes to swell to 4 cm besides cancer? what else besides cancer could cause a psa test of 300? To note, my dad's lower back pain is almost completely gone since the rupture of the hemorragic cyst on kidney.",

      "Content": "They have not done the bone scan yet because insurance company will not cover it unless the test is warranted with hard core evidence that he has prostate cancer- aka tissue from prostate via rectal biopsy confirming cancer. I am taking my dad to Urologist tomorrow morning but i am a little nervous to let him do biopsy after the ordeal he went through last week( 6 pints of blood loss, fluid in lungs, pneumonia). I am worried about any blood loss as he is already anemic from last week. Not a single Cat Scan showed any masses(he has had 4 done in the last 2 months) but than again the cat scans were not done with the radioactive drink before hand. I do have 2 questions-- who is more reliable when it comes to analyzing cat scans-- the radiologist or a dr? Should i keep giving him Casodex until it is 100% proven that he has cancer? I can not reasonably justify giving my 91 yr old father a chemo pill without knowing with certainty he has cancer. Is it even possible that one can get a psa of over 300 with swollen retropertoneal lymph nodes(4cm) and it not being some type of cancer? Anyway, thanks much for your response my friend",
