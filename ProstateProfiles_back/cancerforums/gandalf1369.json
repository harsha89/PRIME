      "Content": "I was diagnosed with PC (Gleason 9) in July of 2018 and had DaVinci surgery at Johns Hopkins Hospital on 8/22/2019. Before the surgery a bone scan was negative as was a CT scan. Overall I am feeling pretty good and am handling the incontinence without too much of a problem. I have been reading the posts in this forum for several months now reading about the experiences of other cancer/surgery guys. I have been monitoring my PSA levels since the surgery and the latest results have prompted me to post my first message. On 11/1/2018 (about 2 months post surgery) Johns Hopkins tested my PSA and said it was \"undetectable\". On 11/28/2019 I had a general family physician check-up and had my PSA checked then also. That came back as 0.03 - which I assume would be considered undetectable also. On 03/12/2019 it was checked again with a result of 0.08. I discussed these results with my urologist and he has recommended that I talk to a radiologist and to start hormone therapy. Give the fact that the pathology from the surgery showed involvement of the lymph nodes (2 out of 27) I am very much leaning towards having both the radiation and hormone therapy done. Is there anything I should be asking the radiologist when I meet with him?? Any insights or suggestions would be extremely welcome. Thank you - Bob",

      "Content": "Hi Mike, A few answers to your questions: Age - 68 Location - West Virginia The urologist is NOT at Johns Hopkins. He is part of the West Virginia University Healthcare system. Also, the radiologist that I will be talking to is not associated with Johns Hopkins. Again, he is local to me and part of the West Virginia University system. I have spoken to a medical oncologist at Johns Hopkins that was referred by my original surgeon. That meeting took place in late November of 2018. During that visit the medical oncologist suggested that I wait and see if there was any changes in my PSA levels and then decide if radiation and/or hormone therapy was warranted. Both of the PSA tests with numerical values (the 0.03 and the 0.08 ) were done by the same lab although I am not sure of the exact methodology used. Thank you for your input and I'll be sure to ask the radiologist about the CT/PETR sans that you mentioned. As an afterthought - the reason that my urologist and possible radiologist are not affiliated with Johns Hopkins is simply a matter of convenience. Johns Hopkins is about a 2 hour drive from were I live in WV and if I am going to start radiation therapy I would prefer not driving that distance on a frequent (possibly daily) basis. Again, thanks for your insight . . . Bob",
