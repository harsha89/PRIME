For the past four sessions, I\u0092ve gone to my urologist\u0092s office to have a catheter removed. Then I\u0092ve gone to my morning radiation treatment, gone home, and seen how the day went. My prostate is still too swollen for me to pee without a cath. About mid-afternoon, I end up back at my urologist\u0092s office to get another catheter put in \u0096 and the nurse drains off an average of four hundred milliliters. All because my urologist hadn\u0092t confirmed with my radiation oncologist about the whole nuke-me with-a-catheter-in-place thing. Did I mention how painful pushing or pulling a catheter through a swollen prostate can be? I did, in my last posting here. The morals here are that first , you cannot ask too many stupid questions, and second, take charge of your own treatment.",

He also gave me a prescription for Ambien to put me to sleep at night (instead of waking five-plus times to try to pee). We\u2019re swapping that out for a prescription for Sonota.

      "Content": "Yesterday was a very disappointing day. Twenty days ago was my last session of IMRT. The only side effect I\u0092ve had is swollen prostate \u0096 to the point that I could not pee through it. That started about halfway through my forty treatments. I\u0092ve had a catheter ever since. About once a week we play a game. I go to my urologist\u0092s office (about five minutes away) and have the nurse pull it out. Damn, that hurts. Then we wait and see. Yesterday was a very disappointing day. We started in the morning. I made it to mid-afternoon when I was back to have the catheter put back in. Damn, that really hurt! I drained 520ml -- a new personal record. My initial research online says that this swelling could continue anywhere from two to six weeks after treatment. I\u0092m halfway there. To say that having the catheter hanging from my penis is uncomfortable is like saying a stick of dynamite is a firecracker. I walk more gingerly, I\u0092m limited to only a few positions to sleep, and heaven forbid I get sexually aroused! For now, I continue on the steady diet of two Rapaflo a day, six ibuprofen a day, and cranberry juice. My wife had me try some of her CBD oil, and her sister gave me some prostate health pills from AdvoCare. I wonder which of these is actually helping. I wonder which may be hurting.",

      "Content": "Sixteen treatments of forty left Proton radiation IMRT My treatments are fairly routine. The side effects are not. As we\u0092re irradiating an organ, it\u0092s reacting, irritated, becoming inflamed and swelling. Naturally. What\u0092s not expected is the extant to the swelling. My prostate has closed off my urethra. Last weekend was Mother\u0092s Day weekend. As is out tradition, we spent Sunday at Scarborough Renaissance Festival in Waxahachie, Texas, just south of Dallas. The days leading up to it, peeing had actually improved, and the day at the faire went well, although I visited every privy, often. The catheter\u0085 By Wednesday early morning, I had diarrhea, and peeing became more difficult. I skipped my treatment that morning. By Wednesday night, I hadn\u0092t produced urine for over eight hours, and my wife took me to the hospital ER. They took me for treatment very quickly. The first thing they did was put a catheter in me. THIS WAS THE MOST PAINFUL THING I\u0092VE EVER HAD. They heard me scream in the other treatments rooms. And they drained over half a litter. They also took blood. As it turned out, I did not have any infection. Save for the prostate pinching off my urethra, I\u0092m healthy. As my wife and I were getting ready to leave, my urologist came in. He\u0092d reviewed everything, but didn\u0092t make any changes. According to him, I could not have the catheter in during my radiation treatment, so he wanted me to come to his office at 7am the next day (Thursday) to have the catheter removed. THIS WAS THE SECOND MOST PAINFUL THING I\u0092VE EVER HAD. I don\u0092t understand how anyone can self-catheterize. I went to my radiation treatment that morning, and stayed home, hoping I\u0092d never have to be catheterized again. No such luck. I went back to my urologist\u0092s office Thursday afternoon to have a catheter put in again. The lanacane helped a little \u0096 very little. I screamed slightly less as it passed through my swollen prostate. I repeated the same process on Friday. While I\u0092d managed to squeeze out a few drops, but the time I got another catheter in that afternoon, another half-liter poured out. The kilt\u0085 I mentioned our day at a Renaissance faire. I\u0092m a big fan of wearing a kilt, and not just at the faires. In this case, with a tube hanging from my penis down the side of my leg, a kilt helps. By Friday afternoon, when I had a catheter put in again, I quizzed the nurse more. For my situation, I do not need a bag. Unless there\u0092s a reason to collect urine, there\u0092s no need for a bad, leg or otherwise. A simple cap on the end of the tube does fine. I feel the urge to pee as natural. It\u0092s like artificial peeing, bypassing a lot of the systems between the bladder and the toilet. Also, I taped the tube to my thigh during the night so it doesn\u0092t flop around and get caught while I try to sleep. Now, Saturday afternoon, I\u0092ve had a catheter in since yesterday afternoon. I slept okay last night. With just the tube hanging, it\u0092s almost manageable. I can pee, artificially, and it\u0092s weird. I have to remind myself that it\u0092s safe to drink. The hope is that I leave the catheter in all weekend. Monday morning I\u0092ll go to my urologist\u0092s office to have it removed \u0096 remember: I can\u0092t have a treatment with a catheter in place. Hopefully over this weekend, the meds and diet will have some effect on my swollen prostate. If not, I\u0092ll have to come up with something. I can hardly drive, let alone stay at the office throughout the day, and there\u0092d only so much work I can do from home. My radiology oncologist has had me double-down on the alpha blocker, taking it twice a day. He and my urologist both think that I\u0092m a \u0091one-percenter\u0092. I\u0092m the guy who\u0092s bound and determined to run the gamut of everything that could go badly with this treatment. My body seems to just sluff off what meds they give me. I\u0092ll probably give them a couple of white papers to publish. As for diet, I\u0092m drinking cranberry juice and snacking on dark chocolate covered almonds. My wife has also found a good smoothie recipe with turmeric. I post here not to influence anyone investigating what course of action to take, but to tell what my individual experiences are. As they say: your mileage may vary. We soldier on\u0085",

      "Content": "Yesterday was day one of forty. As this was my first treatment, I was to be there early. I changed into the scrub pants, leaving my pants and shoes in a locker, and waited in a small waiting room. One man was there for his last treatment. The tech went over a few things (mostly repeating herself). I laid out on the table and the machines started moving around me -- this was the freakiest part. This included x-rays to match up with the initial CT scan. Then the actual treatment. One of the parts rotated around me twice. This all took about ten minutes. Once this was done, the tech came back, reminded me what time the rest of my visit would happen. She also 'tattooed' small marks in the place of the temporary sharpie marks: a small needle to put freckle-like marks on my skin. (I've got tattoos; I wasn\u0092t impressed.) Back to the lockers to use the restroom! They want a full bladder each time. And I'm on Dulcolx and Gas-X, once a day, while I'm undergoing treatment. Relatively easy. At this point, I don't feel any different. Today was day two of forty. First, I\u0092ve been using a wrong term. I\u0092m not undergoing ERBT (external beam radiation therapy), but IMRT (intensity-modulated radiation therapy). The difference is subtle, but important. The worst part of this morning\u0092s visit was the traffic! I was forty-five minutes late. Fortunately, I wasn\u0092t the only late arrival. The staff shuffled the deck and managed to get me in. Procedures same as yesterday (and tomorrow, I'm sure, and the next day, too). The tech did remove the stickers from the temporary marks, now that I\u0092ve got tattoos, and I couldn\u0092t scrub them off in the shower this morning. And it\u0092s Wednesday, which is \u0091see the doctor day\u0092. After only two treatments, I had nothing to report. See ya\u0092 next Wednesday, doc. Tomorrow is my annual physical with my GP. I\u0092m sure we\u0092ll have lots to discuss.",

      "Content": "Day 14 of forty Proton radiation IMRT. Today is Friday. Last Wednesday was day 12 - another weekly \u0091visit with the doctor\u0092 day. I\u0092ve waited a couple of days to post an update in order to see what happens with the doctor\u0092s latest prescription. The treatments are routine now. All but boring. It\u0092s less than ten minutes on the slab. I\u0092m grumpy. I\u0092m grumpy because I\u0092m not getting enough sleep, and because my body is straining each time I try to pee. Meanwhile, I\u0092m getting one hekuva core workout. If you throw protons at an organ, that organ tends to get inflamed and may swell. As my urethra passes through my swollen prostate, it\u0092s constricted. Urinating is a real struggle right now. At first my doc had me add ibuprofen to my regimen. It\u0092s good for inflammation. But it\u0092s hardly touched this. Two days ago he added a prescription for alfuzosin, an alpha blocker, meant to relax the muscles around my bladder and prostate. After two doses, it\u0092s barely taken the edge off. The doc said I should see some results in as little as a couple of hours. WebMD says it may take one or two days. I\u0092m hoping it\u0092s something that\u0092ll build up in my system. One of the other men in the morning waiting room group \u0091graduated\u0092 today \u0096 his last treatment. He brought a fruit plate. When my graduation comes, I\u0092m planning on chocolate-iced doughnuts with sprinkles.",

      "Content": "Day twenty-eight of forty...? I say \u0091day twenty-eight\u0092. There seems to be some confusion at the doctor\u0092s office about exactly what day is my last. It doesn\u0092t help the calendar that I missed a treatment (because I couldn\u0092t pee) and that the office is closed for business on Memorial Day Monday. They should know. Life with a urinary catheter. Why don\u0092t I just self-cath? Simple: because the pain of pushing a swizzle straw through my overly-swollen prostate is prohibitive. They can leave this thing in safely for a month, but I\u0092m done in two and a half weeks. I walk a little funny, slowly, gingerly, and I avoid stairs. I can even drive my manual transmission car. I occasionally have a sting or a burn or a tug. It also feels like I don\u0092t have much a penis left. I\u0092m seriously considering a sex therapist, kinda\u0092 like a physical therapist after an injury. I did a bit of MacGyvering: The big collection bag they sent home with me had a valve on it to empty. I took that valve off the bag they sent home and stuck it on the end of the catheter, where there was just a plug. So much easier. Yesterday was the weekly \u0091visit with the doctor\u0092 day. I had it out with him. What\u0092s the better alpha-blocker? I have been on Alfuzosin for the past four weeks, and it\u0092s done nothing for me. Over a year ago, when I first met my urologist, he put me on an antibiotic and Rapaflo, treating this as prostatitis, just to eliminate that possibility. I hated it. I hated it because it worked on me, to the point that I could not ejaculate. I\u0092m a little past that relatively minor issue today. So I\u0092m back on Rapaflo. My radiology oncologist said,\u0092 why not?\u0092 He\u0092s still busy being astounded that I have such a swollen prostate and that\u0092s not acting as he expects. This morning as I drove away from the pharmacy, I seemed to recall that the Rapaflo made me a nauseous, too. Hmm -- I hadn\u0092t considered that. In the men\u0092s waiting room, fruit may be healthier, but doughnuts move faster.",

      "Content": "Day thirty-five of forty. Five more treatments to go. The downhill slide I\u0092m so ready for this to be done. It\u0092s not the treatments. They\u0092re a piece of cake: get up a little early, go to the hospital, drop my drawers, lay on the slab, get zapped, get a doughnut, go to work. Easy-peasy, kegal squeezy. No, it\u0092s the swelling. My prostate doesn\u0092t appreciate having protons tossed at it, so it responds by swelling up -- so much that it\u0092s cut off my urethra. A man\u0092s gotta pee, and I\u0092ve been doing that with a catheter for about three weeks. Just a week and a half left and I try to live a normal life, without a swizzle straw up my dinglehopper. Exit plan My urologist and I have an end game in mind. It\u0092ll be weird trying to walk and sleep and pee and be with my wife like a human again. I keep up with the ibuprofen and Rapaflo (alpha blocker), plus the turmeric smoothies and cranberry juice. The day after my last treatment I\u0092ll have the catheter pulled out, and we\u0092ll see how that goes. At worst, by the end of that day it\u0092ll go back in, and we play the game again the next day. At best, freedom! My wife had me pick a nightgown for her that first night back. I love my wife! The \u0091visit the doctor\u0092 days have been moved to Mondays. I\u0092ll see my radiation oncologist in a few days. He\u0092s on vacation this week \u0096 lucky SOB. It\u0092s a rum & Dr. Pepper evening. Iechyd da!",

He\u0092s on vacation next week, so the cath stays in for a little over a week this time. Maybe things will relax and open up. Maybe I\u0092ll really be able to celebrate the Fourth of July\u0085",

Umyeah. Meanwhle, insurance is being difficult about my Rapaflo prescription. Sure, my doc has prescribed it differently than usual. What of it? I\u0092ve got three pills left. My doc and I are of differing opinions as to how long I\u0092ll have problems urinating once treatments are done. He\u0092s warned me I could still be with a cath for a couple of more weeks. I don\u0092t think so\u0085 I mentioned a few posts ago that I\u0092d \u0091macgyvered\u0092 the catheter, putting a valve on it for easier use. Here\u0092s a tip: remember to close the valve before you go back to bed in the dead of the night. Your laundry will thank you.",

      "Content": "Day seven of forty. The treatments are fairly routine now. I\u0092m not a morning person, though, and I don\u0092t like leaving the bed so early (my lovely wife is there, after all). Two things I\u0092ve notice: one, peeing is a little more difficult, erratic, and less productive. Two: while I don\u0092t think I\u0092m feeling fatigue yet, I do have a general \u0091mellow\u0092 feeling, almost as if I didn\u0092t get a good night\u0092s sleep. Wednesdays are \u0091visit the doctor\u0092 day, when they weight me and check blood pressure and pulse (I have one, thanks), and just check into see how things are going. I mentioned the two issues to him. The peeing issue isn\u0092t uncommon. We\u0092re irritating an organ, after all, and some inflammation will happen. He\u0092s added ibuprofen to my regimen: two 200mg pills in the morning and two at night, for a total of 800mg, to help control the inflammation. That should take a couple of days to work. If it doesn\u0092t, he\u0092s got a prescription that will \u0096 a muscle relaxant. I should have asked him more about that point. Way back when, when I first saw my urologist, he tried treating this as prostatitis, with an antibiotic and a muscle relaxant. I hated the muscle relaxant. It relaxed EVERYTHING down there, which made an active sex life much less active. The mellow feeling: I get home from work and want a nap. I cannot do a full ninety minute tae kwon do class without stepping out to catch my breath. Last night was truly a dark and stormy night, so I know I didn\u0092t get enough sleep (I was busy trying to pee). However, the doctor thinks that it probably isn\u0092t related to the radiation treatments \u0096 not this early in the forty days. Remember: I got the markers inserted into my prostate, in preparation for these radiation treatments. I was a rarity. I beat the odds and got a major infection. E.coli. Five days in the hospital. While that was three weeks ago, my body is probably still recovering from that, and I should keep reminding myself of that. Continuing with the Dulcolax and GasX once a day, and vitamin D3, and add the ibuprofen. Otherwise, business as usual. I\u0092m waiting on the auto shop to call me back to tell my why my check engine light is on.",

      "Content": "Day thirty-one of forty After this morning, nine more treatments. (Yes, I\u0092m counting down!) One of the treatment machines was down today. Us guys were backed up in the waiting area. I didn\u0092t mind the forty-five minute wait. As I looked around the waiting area, I was struck by two thoughts: I'm so much younger than anyone here, and I'm now the most' tenured' in these treatments. The issue I\u0092ve been having with peeing isn\u0092t going away. My urologist, his nurse, and I have figured out that it\u0092s all in the prostate, swollen by the treatments. Everything else along my urinary track seems to be working just fine. Still, I\u0092ve had a catheter in full-time for the past two weeks. It\u0092s \u0091manageable\u0092. For the record, this problem trying to pee through a swollen prostate is the only problem I've had -- but it's a big problem. Another \u0091visit the doctor\u0092 day. Not much help there. My radiology oncologist suggested that maybe how full my bladder gets may be contributing to my problem. Maybe if I drink less, but more frequently, things might flow better. Meanwhile, I\u0092m on a steady diet of Rapaflo, ibuprofen, turmeric shakes, and cranberry juice. My radiology oncologist disappointed me in another way today, too. How can anyone who\u0092s lived in Dallas so long not know about Scarborough Renaissance Festival?",

      "Content": "FREEDOM\u0085.! My last IMRT session, of forty, was yesterday. Both my radiology oncology doctor and his nurse had warned, saying, \u0091well, you know it took a while for the swelling to start; it\u0092s liable to take some time for it to start to go down. You may have to have the catheter for a little longer\u0085\u0092 Oh yeah? Try one day longer! Early this morning I went to my urologist\u0092s office to play \u0091the game\u0092, where the nurse removes the catheter, and we see how the day goes. Worst case, I\u0092d go back in the afternoon and have it put back in. I took today off from work for this event. I went home and had a small glass of cranberry juice and a cup of coffee. And I waited. I also mowed the backyard. I peed. A little. Steady drops. Almost a stream. Lunchtime passes, and I\u0092m doing okay. Of course it stings and burns to pee: I\u0092ve had a swizzle straw up my dinglehopper for three weeks. But I\u0092m peeing. By mid-afternoon I get concerned that I'm not voiding enough. I\u0092m aware of my bladder, but I\u0092m not uncomfortable. It was getting late, and it was decision time. I went to my urologist\u0092s office. The nurse ultra-sounded my bladder to measure the volume. While it\u0092s got urine, it\u0092s less than half what\u0092s usually drained when I get catheterized. She called the doctor. He said he didn\u0092t want my catheterized, not for that small amount. I got rejected by my urologist! He happens to be the on-call doc tonight, so if all else fails he gets to be the one to put it back in. I don\u0092t think so! I\u0092ll struggle with low-flow before getting the cath again. After getting the catheter out this morning, the first thing my wife and I did was to confirm that I do not have ED. Never you mind how; MYOB!",

      "Content": "I had a quarterly PSA test last week. My favorite nurse called me this morning. My prostate continues to decline. My last session of IMRT (of forty sessions) was last June 8. A month later, my PSA was 2.22. In October it was 1.21. Today is at 0.72. I chose radiation after my wife and I did the research. From what we found, the success rate between da Vinci surgery and IMRT was all but the same, with similar risks of incontinence and erection. But to us, IMRT was much less invasive. It hasn\u0092t been without challenges. My little glad didn\u0092t take kindly to being irradiated. Halfway into my treatments my prostate responded by swelling up \u0096 so much so that I had to have a catheter just to empty my bladder. After about eight weeks of having a \u0091swizzle straw up my diglehopper\u0092, my urologist and I had had enough and took it up a notch. He stabbed me in the gut to put in a suprapubic catheter. This was to let things below my bladder relax and heal. That took about five weeks. That was pulled out in September. It\u0092s still a challenge to pee, but it\u0092s manageable. And I can still \u0091get it up\u0092, although the strength of my erection hasn\u0092t fully recovered. My wife and I are still enjoying a healthy, happy romp in bed when our busy lives allow.",

      "Content": "It\u0092s been an interesting couple of weeks. While I\u0092m thirty-nine days out from my last IMRT session, I\u0092ve had a catheter in for about six weeks now. The only side effect I\u0092ve had is a swollen prostate \u0096 to the point that I can\u0092t pee without the cath. The Fourth of July I spent at the side of my in-laws\u0092 pool while the rest of the family splashed and frolicked. Yes, I could\u0092ve gotten in the pool with the cath, but I don\u0092t like it being seen. The Wednesday after that, we played the game again, when I go to my urologist to have the catheter pulled out (ouch), and we see how the day goes. It didn\u0092t go well, and I was back there that afternoon to have the catheter put back in so I could pee (ouch!). However, this time the same nurse wasn\u0092t there. She\u0092d gotten called away to another office in the group. The nurse I got, and the other doctor (not my usual) didn\u0092t have a clue. I had a hard time relating my story to him since my bladder was close to bursting. This was actually a good thing. In effect, I suddenly got a second opinion. The other doctor ordered a contrast CT scan and took a urine sample to check for infection. He went ahead and put my on cypro for an antibiotic. The CT scan happened two days later. With the contrast, that was a weird experience. The tech there also took blood to culture. The results: for one, I have a swollen prostate (no Sierra-Hotel-India-Tango, Sherlock), but nothing else. No cyst or strange growths. Secondly, I have an infection. For this particular bug, cypro is the antibiotic of choice. I met with radiology oncologist (the doc in charge of killing my cancer with IMRT) last Tuesday. He was actually encouraged by both the CT scan and infection. The infection would easily explain why the prostate hasn\u0092t relaxed yet. I also had a blood draw there, for my first PSA post IMRT. He warned me that the infection would probably skew the PSA results. My PSA is 2.22. That\u0092s the lowest it\u0092s ever been recorded. He doesn\u0092t want to see me until next year. I\u0092ll see my regular urologist in October for another PSA. But I did see my urologist the next day (last Wednesday). We wanted to talk about this whole mess with him. Of the fifty-five doctors in this practice, he\u0092s consulted with three others, plus my radiology oncologist. I\u0092ve been quite the topic of conversation. Everyone\u0092s of the opinion that time is the best remedy for this swollen prostate. No need for TURP or other action \u0096 yet. If it doesn\u0092t clear up in a couple of weeks, I have to consider a super-pelvic catheter. I don\u0092t like that idea. Meanwhile, I\u0092ve been on cypro for almost two weeks, going after the infection that might be the source of the swollen prostate. And I\u0092ve had a curious development. How likely is it that I\u0092ll have urine leaking around the catheter if the prostate is still swollen\u0085? We play the game again next Wednesday, and although I\u0092ve been here before, I\u0092m cautiously optimistic\u0085.",

      "Content": "This morning I went to my urologist to have the three fiducials, three small gold bbs, inserted into my prostate. His office is in the professional building attached to a hospital. There are other tenants, including a breast cancer center. I suppose the breast cancer center is the major tenant in the building; why else would they have the first ten parking spaces reserved? Complete with pink wheel-stops. But really? I\u0092ve got cancer, too. Why don\u0092t I get special treatment? Complete with light blue wheel-stops? WTF? This morning\u0092s procedure when as expected: very uncomfortable. It\u0092s like passing three kidney stones while being anally probed.
