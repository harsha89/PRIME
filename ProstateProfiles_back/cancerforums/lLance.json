      "Content": "I am 4 months post surgery, and have had pains in my penis from the get-go. I just figured it was part of the recovery. When I pee it hurts in the head just as the stream stops. But the discomfort has increased to having a slight pain while walking around. I am going in to be checked for an Urinary Tract Infection, but I have no burning sensation. I am concerned about scare tissue etc. I have a call into my Urologist but haven't gotten a response as of yet. Any help. Tonight I have had a few beers and the pain is gone, and the stream is longer and stronger. Sometimes I get the urge to pee when I really don't have much to go, but when I go the stream is short and that is when it hurts. If it is a long stream I don't have any pain. Any thoughts? Lance Maybe I just need to stay drunk. LOL",

      "Content": "Thanks guy's. I went to my GP and he was convinced it was UTI, even said there was blood in my urine. But when the urine analysis came back it showed no infection. I have an appointment with my Urologist next Mon. My GP gave me some Pyridium to take and it gets rid of the pain and also turns your urine bright orange. The pain I have is an irritating pain right when my Sphincter closes. And at times I get a feeling like something is poking me inside like a slight pricking sensation. I'm wondering if it is a stitch that was supposed to dissolve, and didn't. Seems I read on here once of someone having that problem. Also am a little tender right down between my legs. Like when I sit in the saddle and get bumped up there it hurts a little. I forgot to add that the pain in the sphincter seems to happen more when I stand to pee. When sitting it seldom hurts. Will let you all know what the Urologist says. Lance",

They were supposed to send me instructions but didn't so I Google them & it recommended 15 reps. 3 times a day to start. So that is what I have been doing. I ride a Recumbent bike, but he said I have to stay off it for 3-4 weeks afterwards, even with Robotic surgery. Lance",

      "Content": "Hi poppygirl, Sorry to hear of all your problems, but that's what we are here for. First off, don't get too worried at this point. Doing a biopsy is just standard procedure if your PSA is elevated and the prostate is enlarged. The fact that the CT scan was neg. is a positive sign. Having a hard spot on the gland is what caught my Drs. attention, within 6 weeks I was in surgery, and I am looking forward to a long life. Take each day as it comes, get the biopsy and wait, (the hardest part) for the results and deal with them from there. If the results are positive, don't panic! It is scary stuff I have to admit, but you will get through it. His PSA numbers were not excessively high so that is a good sign. What you want to get from the Dr. when you get the results is what is called a Gleason score, and for example if it is a 7, it makes a difference if it is 3+4 or 4+3, and the stage. With that you will be able to get a lot of info. as to your best options. Also if it is positive I would highly recommend getting Dr. Walsh's book, Surviving Prostate Cancer, it is easy reading and will provide you with just about all you will ever need to know. Good Luck, Lance",

I was doing so good the last few days I have been having coffee in the morning, until today I really hadn't noticed much difference. Maybe I need to go back to tea in the AM. I am only using 1 pad a day and none at night, (until last night). Guess I shouldn't complain, all and all, I am mostly dry. Lance",

      "Content": "<.01 Great news WiseOldFool! Hang in there it does get better. Or at least it has with me. Leakage gets better with time, and don't be surprised if it bounces between good & bad for a while. I am 6 mos. post op. I have never needed a pad at night. But now I am down to wearing a thin Depends Shield in the day. I get a few leaks during the day, sometimes for no apparent reason, but mostly when simply blowing my nose or something dumb like that. In my case they did not spar the nerves, and according to my surgeon he was glad that he didn't attempt to. That being said, ED is a given. But if they sparred your nerves, don't give up hope. You have a good attitude about the whole deal, you'll do fine. I feel it was a bump in the road, and if no more intercourse is what I m dealt, well, so be it. I am still alive and having fun with whatever time Good Lord gives me. Sex was great! but there is a lot more to life than sex. And, there are still other sexual options besides intercourse. Wecome to the zero club, Good luck, & merry Christmas, Lance Good",

      "Content": "Haliday, Sorry you had to join our club, I agree with Otago, I wouldn't wait until next year. They normally make you wait 6-8 weeks after the biopsy before the surgery, so that everything has had a chance to heal. As for the side affects, most of us will tell you they aren't that bad. The main thing is to get the cancer out, the second is continence, (that will affect you more that sex), the third is sex, even if you did just get married. If they are unable to spar the nerves there are still plenty of options to have a gratifying sex life. Trust me I know because they were unable to save my nerves. Had they tried there was a good chance they would have left some cancer behind. Better limp that dead! But the orgasms are fantastic! Like my wife reminded me, half the population has orgasms without an erection. WOMEN! Good luck with your journey, Lance",

      "Content": "I am 8 weeks out today. Thee weeks after the catheter was removed I was dry. Then I went back to just wearing a light Depends Shield during the day. Last weekend went camping and rode our recumbent bikes 35 miles on Fri. & 29 miles on Sat. the 7 on Sun. I have never gotten sore from riding but this past weekend my groin area was tender and progressed to get down right sore. Then I noticed that I was leaking a lot & the urine burned slightly when dripping. Called the Urologist and she put me on Cipro. thinking that I have a urinary infection. The pain is subsiding after 2 days, still not sure if I damaged a muscle or something else. But I am leaking big time again. I had backed off on the Kegels thinking that I didn't want to over do them, but now am doing them a lot to try and get things under control again. As long as I am sitting or lying down I am fine, but as soon as I stand I can feel myself leaking. Also when I urinate, the stream comes out strong then when it stops it is abrupt and I get a slight pain inside the meatus. Any input would be welcome. I drink only decaf tea, so I don't think that should be the problem. But the leaking almost seems to be getting worse. Not sure what is normal at this point. Lance",

      "Content": "Haliday, Sorry you had to join our club, I agree with Otago, I wouldn't wait until next year. They normally make you wait 6-8 weeks after the biopsy before the surgery, so that everything has had a chance to heal. As for the side affects, most of us will tell you they aren't that bad. The main thing is to get the cancer out, the second is continence, (that will affect you more that sex), the third is sex, even if you did just get married. If they are unable to spar the nerves there are still plenty of options to have a gratifying sex life. Trust me I know because they were unable to save my nerves. Had they tried there was a good chance they would have left some cancer behind. Better limp that dead! But the orgasms are fantastic! Like my wife reminded me, half the population has orgasms without an erection. WOMEN! Good luck with your journey, Lance",

I am not going to try and sway you in your decision as to your plan of attack. Personally, I could never take the wait & see attitude. I can't imagine living my life with it hanging over my shoulder. In my research, I have found that the rate of success is equal between RRP & EBR. However, my uncle who is 2 yrs. older that me, was talked out of RRP by his Oncologist. The cancer came back last year after 5 years. He wanted to have it removed & was told by the Dr.s at University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, that they don't do that anymore as the results, and I quote \" would be Morbid & Daunting\". When I was diagnosed, I made the decision there & then to have it removed. I am 66,healthy, and plan on living to be a ripe old age. My surgery is scheduled for next Tue. with the \"Di Vinci\". I went with my intuition and didn't want to talk with anyone & have them change my mind. But, can't say that I'm not damned scared! Not about the surgery, but the outcome. That being said, this is a great forum, there are a lot of great guy's on it with great advice & knowledge, read a lot and learn all you can. I know I have! Myself, I have made my decision and won't have anyone else to blame if things don't work out as planned, and I won't look back. Remember we are all here for each other.

      "Content": "ddayglo, I had the same question a while back. It was pointed out to me that if the surgeon missed getting all of it, there by leaving a positive margin that some how he was a bad surgeon. But my surgeon said that when doing the surgery they can't tell good tissue from bad. I get the impression that it is good guess work and luck. If the margin comes back positive, it means that they found cancer cells at the surgical margins, and that it is very possible that more cancer cells are beyond the surgical cuts. Just my impression, Lance",

For the last year or so I was on Jalyn which dropped my PSA down to 1.1 & shrunk the Prostate. My Dr. thinks that because of the shrinkage is why the hard spot was felt & I got a biopsy. So for me, I look at it as almost an accident that it was found. So like Chuck said I would keep on top of it. Lance Wish me luck, heading down for my bone scan.",

      "Content": "Powderfinger, I'm sorry to hear of your plight, it has been rough, I can see. You fail to mention what your Gleason score is. That makes a big difference. Myself, I could not imagine taking the chance that it would come back. I chose surgery right from the start, and knowing the possible side affects was just part of the deal. After 4 months the incontinence is down to the point I don't worry about it. Since they could not spar my nerves the ED is a fact of life. However, even at 66 my wife and I had a good sex life and continue to. We need to do things a little differently, but the orgasms are better that ever and come April I may or may not have a penile implant. I have read great things about them. But my biggest concern is at 67 by then, do I want to endure the pain of another surgery. Haven't decided yet. My wife is happy with the way things are, so it is my choice. As for the surgery itself, it's a piece of cake. Very little pain and discomfort, just have to take it easy for about 6weeks. My problem with Radiation is that my uncle who is 2 years older than me wanted surgery and was talked out of it by the radiologist in 2007. So he had radiation. Last year in 2012 it came back and he wanted them to take it out. He was told that because of the scaring from the radiation that very few surgeons would attempt it. So he had to settle with Cryo., which shows hope but is not proven to work yet. So this is my only concern with radiation. If it fails it leaves you with few options. If you have it removed it is gone and unless it is very advanced, you have a very good chance of being done with it. Basically, the way I look at it is all the other choices are a crap shoot as to if it worked, because you just have to sit back and wait and see what happens. Remove it and you know it is gone. This is just my opinion and I know others have theirs. You will do what feels right for you. I would definitely suggest you get a copy of Dr. Welch's book \" Surviving Prostate Cancer\" and reading it. It is easy reading, but will tell you everything you need to know to make a good decision. Good luck! Lance",

      "Content": "Hi Bob, I am 6 months out and couldn't fel better. kayaked for 3 hrs. today and road 60 miles on my recumbent this past week. 40 one day 20 the other. That being said, after my surgery my instructions were to do nothing more than walking for 6 weeks, I was back on my bike after about 3, riding about 15 miles. Looking back I think it was not helping me with the incontinence, may have set me back a little. I don't remember being tired though. In fact I was amazed at how good I felt. But that is just me I tend to over do it after surgery's. For what it is worth, just hang in there. Things will get better, it just takes time. Some of us think we are in great shape because we work out regularly. Going to a gym vs. regular physical work and exercise do not compare. Sorry, don't get me wrong. I am not saying that working out at the gym. is not good. But lets face it sitting at a desk all day and going to the gym a couple hr.s a week does not compare to someone who is physically active from morning to night and does hard physical exercise on top of it.",

      "Content": "Omegaman, sorry you had to join our little club. In my opinion you are making the right choice in having it removed. At 50 you have a lot of years ahead of you and if radiation were to fail, ( you won't know until it comes back), most Drs. won't remove it at that point because of scarring and you have few choices left. I would highly recommend reading Dr. Walsh's book,\"Guild to Surviving Prostate Cancer\". One thing you will learn is that Drs. don't even know why we have a prostate. The other is that, that 3+4=7 may very well end up a 4+3=7 which is far worse. They won't know until the final path report after it is removed. I had non nerve sparing surgery and after meeting with the Dr. this past week he said it was a good thing because with the extent of the spreading he is afraid he would have missed some cancer right up against the nerves. And it isn't the end of the world, orgasms are like they were when I was young. Haven't been that way in years. At 10 weeks I am totally dry and back doing everything I did before.",

      "Content": "Omegaman, sorry you had to join our little club. In my opinion you are making the right choice in having it removed. At 50 you have a lot of years ahead of you and if radiation were to fail, ( you won't know until it comes back), most Drs. won't remove it at that point because of scarring and you have few choices left. I would highly recommend reading Dr. Walsh's book,\"Guild to Surviving Prostate Cancer\". One thing you will learn is that Drs. don't even know why we have a prostate. The other is that, that 3+4=7 may very well end up a 4+3=7 which is far worse. They won't know until the final path report after it is removed. I had non nerve sparing surgery and after meeting with the Dr. this past week he said it was a good thing because with the extent of the spreading he is afraid he would have missed some cancer right up against the nerves. And it isn't the end of the world, orgasms are like they were when I was young. Haven't been that way in years. At 10 weeks I am totally dry and back doing everything I did before.",

And as to the \"Nasty Side Affects' of surgery. I think most of us who have had it, will tell you that they are nothing that you can't deal with. Being alive and cancer free is far more important. Especially at the young age of 46, he has a lot of years ahead of him. Why take any chances with unproven procedures. Good luck, Lance",

      "Content": "wjw, LOL, Bladder control makes more sense. I didn't walk all that much during recovery. I find it harder to walk than ride. I walked a mile every day or so. I have an artificial right knee and Scoliosis, so riding my recumbent makes my back feel great. My bladder control never got that bad except for the first 2 days after the catheter was taken out. I can go through most days on 1 pad and nothing at night. I do get up about 3 times a night to empty my bladder, always afraid I'll leak if I don't. Hang in there it should get better. I was told to do 10 kegel's a day 10 times a day. That seemed to help, but then I kept reading where too many was bad, I backed off and started going down hill again. I am now doing 10 about 4 times a day.",

      "Content": "I am now 8 weeks out Flkjr and pretty much the same story. At 3 weeks post op I was dry for a while. It just takes time from what I am reading. But you described me to a tee. wjw, I was told to not do anything beyond walking for six weeks by the hospital. My Dr. said I could ride my bike since it was a recumbent, but he said not to over do it. He suggested maybe 5 miles. I was doing 12 miles at 3- 4 weeks and not having any problems. Last weekend I rode 35 on Fri. and 29 on Sat. When we got home I felt a little sore through my belly area and thought I might have over done it so I wanted to loosen up the muscles and went for a short 7 mile ride. Then I got real sore. I started noticing that I was getting a burning sensation a little when I pee'd and contacted the Dr. She put me on Cipro for 7 days, (will finish Sun.) The pain went away after a couple days, but it was painful enough that I could barely walk. Bottom line, we went for a 28 mile ride today and I feel great. Planning on doing another 30 Sun. I have never gotten sore, no matter how much I have ridden, so I think it was the Urinary Infection that was causing it. Do you ride a recumbent? If so the Dr. might let you ride. However, if you ride an up right bike, I doubt that he is going to want any pressure on your crotch area. I know if I sit on anything that puts pressure up the crack it is still uncomfortable. I ride a trike so I am pretty much lying down, no pressure on the surgical area at all. About the bowel problems, I have never heard of anyone having that! Not having a BM for a couple days after surgery is normal but to not have control is another thing, Are you talking Diarrhea? I would take some Imodium if that is the case. Glad to hear you are felling so good. I felt great once the catheter was out. Lance",

I have an artificial right knee and Scoliosis, so riding my recumbent makes my back feel great. My bladder control never got that bad except for the first 2 days after the catheter was taken out. I can go through most days on 1 pad and nothing at night. I do get up about 3 times a night to empty my bladder, always afraid I'll leak if I don't. Hang in there it should get better. I was told to do 10 kegel's a day 10 times a day. That seemed to help, but then I kept reading where too many was bad, I backed off and started going down hill again. I am now doing 10 about 4 times a day.",

However, 6 months post surgery, I am glad I had it done. Aside from a leak now & then when lifting something heavy, continence is fine. They were not able to spare my nerves so ED is a given.

The Dr. said in another month or so I could get a Penile Implant if I wanted. I have read up on them and seen some pretty good reviews and it seems most are pleased with the results. Especially the hydraulic types. Although I am having very good orgasm's, it would be nice to be able to try out my little fellow again. Is there anyone out there who can give me some 1st hand knowledge about them? I haven't seen them mentioned even from some who say they have had long term ED. Any feedback would be appreciated.

      "Content": "DTrom, Thanks for the reply. I was considering the hydraulic type with everything inside the body, considered the best from what I have read. I have read that the circumference is larger & it is the most natural. But you mention of the head not being firm makes sense, as the tubes don't reach the head. I hadn't thought of that. Something to consider. At 67 which I'll be by then, I am inclined to just live with what I have. Let's face it, at this age sex is not my primary goal in life as it was when I was younger. My wife say's she is happy with the way things are. Lance",

      "Content": "ddayglo, Just Kegals, (pretend you are trying to hold back a fart). I was getting conflicting messages. At my 1 week post op appointment I was told to do 10, 10 times a day and try to get to where I could hold them for 10 seconds. (By the way I was told to start them 2 weeks prior to the surgery). You can't do them with the cath. in. So I was doing them religiously. I didn't feel I was making too much progress at first. Then I remembered that Dr. Walsh said not to do too many or you will tire out the muscle and end up wetter. So the last few days I backed off from doing so many and bingo I got better within 2 or 3 days. The other thing was that Dr. Walsh said to always do them standing up and to stop & start your urine flow. Hell, all I was getting was dribbles there was no flow. I found them easier to do sitting on the toilet, as I have heard others say worked for them. So it must have been a combination of doing a lot to strengthen the muscle then backing off and letting it do it's thing. Lance",
