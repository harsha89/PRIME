However, while the MRI can detect areas of interest for a biopsy, it cannot, at this time, classify the grade of cancer. For example, I have a PIRADS 4 lesion. Sounds serious, right? But, it is almost all HGPIN, with less than 5 percent G3+3 cancer. FIVE biopsies to prove that! So, just keep going slow and accumulate the pathology data and knowledge that you need. You may want to add your birth year to your signature. Good luck.[/QUOTE I think this is to rule out immediate surgery. I will add DOB. He even mentioned an MRI biopsy if anything shows.
