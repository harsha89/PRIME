      "Content": "Thanks for the welcome, as well as the encouragement, I will post results tomorrow night, I think the benefit of the wait for me is the education. I have had time to gain knowledge and an understanding of the nature of this DX (see already using medical terms) and the need for me to ask the questions of my doctors, myself, and those close to me, while I'm still in the process of determining what choice the treatment will involve I am certain of one thing, I want to be as aggressive as my body will tolerate now to have the best outcome in the years offered afterward, I cannot speak to the otherside of treatment, but do hope my memory is good enough to remember I choose life first, quality of life second, and possibly I may have both. Each day I take a medicine that came with a long list of possible side effects, it works for me in the intended way and I have not had any adverse effects, so I hope this is true of some of the treatments I've been reading about. Again thanks to all who share their journey and knowledge gained. Ron",
