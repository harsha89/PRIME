      "Content": "Hi Folks First time posting here (visit often)...nevertheless I would like to hear from other guys with similar outcomes. Just got another PSA result today...<0.1 again. Finished my RT 5 months ago (37 sessions) and my PSA has been Undetectable for the past 8 months...it was undetectable before I started RT. I'm still on Zoladex (and will be for the next 2 1/2 years) & Enzalutamide (and will be for the next 6 months). It would be interesting to hear from other guys that went through HT+RT (remember I still have my Prostate) with similar Gleason and Original PSA..and your outcome. It is not to difficult to find other guys that are members of the \"Zero Club\"....but they all had their Prostate out. Regards ************* Age: 54 Diagnosed: Nov 2015 PSA: 15/11/2015 52.6 04/02/2016 24.0 08/03/2026 20.3 25/04/2016 1.6 09/05/2016 0.8 02/06/2016 0.3 20/07/2016 0.1 30/08/2016 <0.1 17/11/2016 <0.1 31/01/2017 <0.1 24/04/2017 <0.1 Gleason: 4+3 on 35% and 4+4 on 30% CT/Bone Scan/MRI: Localised...No Metastasis (T3aN0M0) HT: Started Jan 1st 2016...Zoladex and Xtandi (enzalutamide) RT: Scheduled for Sept 2016...ENDING 37 sessions November 22, 2016",
