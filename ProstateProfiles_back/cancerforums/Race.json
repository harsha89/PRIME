Here in UK we only have 2 hospitals with that facility (that we could have been referred to anyway but miles and miles away from where we live). No, surgeons still do open procedures. In my case, I had an experienced urologist perform an open procedure. The robotic (Da Vinci) method is increasingly common, and does yield quicker recovery, but it seems like the main factor in outcomes is the experience of the surgeon, no matter which procedure is used.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by Badger199 Are all prostatectomy's carried out robotically in USA?? Here in UK we only have 2 hospitals with that facility (that we could have been referred to anyway but miles and miles away from where we live). No, surgeons still do open procedures. In my case, I had an experienced urologist perform an open procedure. The robotic (Da Vinci) method is increasingly common, and does yield quicker recovery, but it seems like the main factor in outcomes is the experience of the surgeon, no matter which procedure is used.",

      "Content": "Badger199; Maybe my experience will help. About 2 months after my (open) RP, I noticed my flow getting weaker. Not nearly as bad as you describe, but my uro warned me about this. He said scar tissue could develop and choke things off. What he did was dilate my urethra using three successively larger catheters (using a local anesthetic). It did the trick and I have excellent flow now. I think it's important to have it done soon after you start healing, otherwise the scar tissue hardens.",

I have been using it for the last 4 months. My urologist did not recommend using more than twice a week. The dosage that works for me is about 0.10 cc. I have been slowly improving in the ED department. The pills (viagra or cialis) will work for me about half the time lately. I've had one successful intercourse with no help at all. Having the Trimix to go to is a real good thing. (But never double up with the pills).",

      "Content": "mickcee, I had nothing going on down there for about 3 months after my surgery. I was terrified. I had no results with Viagra or Cialis. I did have good results with the pump - so I don't see how you could not get that working. For me, it took some fiddling, which was annoying, but it got me to a satisfying place. I also had good results with Trimix injections. I'm now 14 months post-op, and getting better erections. About half the time, I can get things to work out on their own. The Viagra and Cialis are working for me. And I can go to the pump for backup if needed. What I'm saying is that I think castration is far too serious for you to consider. I have a friend in my support group that is going to get a penile prosthesis - you should at least consider that. As for me, my wife of 31 years had asked me for a divorce about 4 months prior to surgery - so no sex action there. But I have picked up a wonderful girlfriend who has helped me enormously through all of this. Hang in there.",

I know that's difficult, but I know of squeamish guys who have overcome this. One guy I know uses a spring-loaded device that is made for diabetics. He trained himself to get used to it by dry-firing it into his genital area while watching TV. In my experience, it's well worth it.",

I used the pump and trimix for about a year after surgery, then gave the pills another try. I was happy to find they worked for me (and continue to).",

My advice - tell your partner that you're getting tips from some of us that have been through this before, and get him to experiment. Getting to orgasm without an erection is a good place to start. I think you ought to get him talking to a urologist about pills, pump, or injections. A willingness to experiment, along with some patience is what it takes.

I (and most atheists I know) deal with struggles by recognizing the advances in medical science, in sharing feelings with their close friends and family, and taking some consolation in knowing that your troubles are not designed by some supernatural force. I am not familiar with Campbell, but I took a look at some of his YouTube lecture. Frankly, I did not see anything that related to the issue of dealing with cancer.

But of all the troubles with surgery (I had an open procedure), it does not rank high. The worst thing for me was the itching irritation that it caused at the end of my penis - which was relieved with a little astroglide to lubricate the thing. Changing the bag, and getting around was really not much of a problem for me. I took off work, but I did go out to visit friends and go for walks with it.",

From what I read the answer seems to be - maybe, and most likely it will, but not definitely. I ask because I wonder if this is a real concern for people making decisions. In particular, I'm curious if you're a fertile guy who chooses radiation. Afterward, do you still use contraception? This is not a personal issue for me (prostatectomy). But I'd like to understand it better for the people who ask me about it.",

And, mind you, I'm having a very happy life without incontinence or ED problems. For my money, I would have to be convinced that the probability of me having cancer (after treatment) is less than or equal to any other man walking around at my age. Then I might feel \"cured\".

The fact that I thought I could tolerate the surgery well, and that with the surgical option, I would have a fall-back of radiation treatment is what caused me to choose surgery. Also, I have heard that the side-effects from surgery (if any) tend to get better over time was important to me. As it turned out, I had an open retropubic procedure just over a year ago. I have no troubles with incontinence. I'm still affected with erectile problems, but each month I seem to get a little better. With help from pills and shots, I have a good sex life.",

My uro says that's fine. Most of what I've read seems to be a discussion about lab procedures/techniques as to how accurate PSA can be measured. I am more interested in the explanation for how I could have any PSA if my prostate is no longer with me. At what level does someone seek treatment, and if so, is there any other way to confirm/detect reoccurance of cancer before it's too late?",

With a prostate volume of 24 cm^3 and an avg of 2 cm of tissue in 12 cores, you have 0.55 % of the prostate. More like 1/180 rather than 1/1000. Still, a pretty small amount. This is the thing that troubles me most about the diagnosis and treatment vs. active surveillance dilemma.

With a prostate volume of 24 cm^3 and an avg of 2 cm of tissue in 12 cores, you have 0.55 % of the prostate. More like 1/180 rather than 1/1000. Still, a pretty small amount. This is the thing that troubles me most about the diagnosis and treatment vs. active surveillance dilemma. The biopsy is a sampling process, and I've never seen a good explanation of the probabilities.",

      "Content": "Well, it's been a year since my surgery, so I suppose I should give an update. I was diagnosed with PC in October 2011. At the time I was in the middle of a divorce from my wife of 31 years. I was devastated. My ex was kind enough to back off on the legal stuff 'till I got back on my feet. Somehow I got through all of that, and today I am a happy guy. My last PSA was 0.014, so I'm just keeping an eye on that with visits to the urologist twice a year. My side effects are manageable. In the continence department, I have very little trouble, only an occasional dribble when I drink alcohol, and sometimes when I start to get an erection. In the ED department, things have been slow to recover. I had some stirrings down there about 2 months post op, and it took about 6 months to get a workable erection without assistance, however, it was not reliable.. I have had success with viagra and cialis. I also have used trimix injections, and have a pump for backup. Now at 12 months, I still have those tools on hand, but am finding that I don't always need them. My sex life is pretty good. Better now with a new girlfriend than in the latter days of my marriage (pre-surgery). To those who are worried - I'd say that RP is not good for your sex life, but in my case, finding a new partner with a great attitude has overcome the bad side effects. Also, my urologist has given me good straight-talk advice and treatment. So, there you go. I'm still keeping an eye on things, and I do get concerned if I see the PSA creep up, but I'm here, and life goes on...",

She speaks Spanish, and is more familiar with Mexico, so we ventured into the tourist shops that had pharmacy, and found generic Viagra over the counter for about $4 / 100mg. Viagra around where I live has shot up to $38 / 100mg. At that cost, I can seriously afford a cruise to Mexico and stock up.",
