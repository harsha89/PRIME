I was on TRT for 12 years because I cannot produce Testosterone naturally. After being diagnosed with PC, and suffering Pulmonary emboli, all within a week in November, I obviously had to go off the TRT. I am effectively on ADT 1. I have been at castration level for almost 5 months now with 9 weeks of IMRT and my PSA has dropped from 4.5 to 1.6. The RO thinks that is good, but I was disappointed as I expected much lower number from effectively being on ADT. To me, this would suggest I have a notable amount of Androgen Independent cancer cells. I see plenty of information on the Internet where 3 months on ADT most men are at undetectable levels of PSA. My Testosterone the first week of December was 16, and 26 at the end of March. I don't see the medical Oncologist for a month for his opinion, but from my reading, I could have significant DHT as well. Any comments explaining why my PSA isn't lower would be appreciated.

My Oncologist ordered a Bone scan and all is clear. Since I am effectively on ADT, I am wondering if very low Testosterone could be causing this increasing pain. I see the Dr. in 10 days and Bone Density testing is suppose to be next on the list. Any comments would be appreciated, as the pain is getting very uncomfortable!",

      "Content": "Listen to the doctor team. I was diagnosed with prostate cancer and the next day was in the ER with multiple pulmonary emboli. Talk about a bad week! Spent 5 days in the hospital before I could go home and it has complicated my cancer treatment to no end. I can only do radiation until I have been on thinners for a year, and then some doctors won't do surgery, brachytherapy or any thing to risk another clot. Cancer increases one's chance of clots by 400%. Some cancers are worse than others, by prostate cancer is high on the list. Please get on thinners ASAP. Fifty percent of patients will die if you get a second pulmonary embolism.",

      "Content": "In my opinion the term EBRT is the only thing outdated. It is a very broad term covering old EBRT, 3D Conformal, IMRT-Intensity Modulated Radiation Therapy, IGRT- Image Guided IMRT, Proton, Cyberknife, and more. Of the IGRT-IMRT imaging options, they include ultrasound, X-ray, cone beam, fluoroscope, gold location implants, and radio implants. The goal of EBRT is to deliver the maximum radiation as measured in grays while doing no damage to adjacent organs. So the more accurately the beam is aimed and shaped, the better off you are. I am currently having IGRT using x-rays, and cone beam, moments before each treatment. I will receive 81 gy in 45 treatments. Depending on your stage, you may also want to do ADT for 2-3 months before starting treatment and continue it for several months afterwords. Why did I go IGRT at age 60? I have blood clots and the doctors ask me to seriously consider radiation. When I researched options, a notable percentage of surgery patients have to have radiation anyway, sampling my local support group. A note of warning, the EBRT nomograms are about useless because they lump the old treatments and stages together. The best IGRT approaches at 81 to 86.4 gy using the latest IGRT only nomograms, have results similar to surgery. But surgery is normally limited the lower grades of cancer that has not spread beyond the prostate capsule. Guess what the other patients get, yep radiation. IGRT at 81 to 86 gy, is a very good option with the latest pre-treatment imaging and prostate location equipment. Salvage therapy includes ADT and every evolving cryogenics. The latest cryogenics techniques, according to two of my Oncologists, are very successful.",

      "Content": "I have been lurking for a few months now, since my diagnosis, and decided to come out of hiding. I have learned a great deal from this forum and thank all of you for sharing your experiences. I have selected IMRT as my treatment, or rather it chose me, and I am comfortable with my decision as other treatments present significant risk. Because of recent multiple pulmonary embolisms, or PEs, where the cancer is considered a primary contributor, and now being on blood thinner, I have been highly discouraged from surgery, even if I wait 6 months to a year. My original Urologist is in a practice with 3 other Urologists, and they met to discuss my situation and agreed they do not wish to do surgery on me. Similarly, brachytherapy is out because of a large prostate, even if I shrink it, shrinking it will not clear my urinary retention problems according to the urologists, and BT will only make thing worse. Also TURP is not recommended for BT candidates and BT is still surgery, so my RO and my new urologist will not do BT on me. AS is out because of number of positive cores, and recent rise in PSA. Basically, all therapies requiring surgery are out. Also, my PCP also does not recommend any surgery and asked I seriously consider radiation and suspects I will remain on blood thinner for many years. Bottom line, my risk for additional PEs is high until the cancer is treated, but surgery requires me to come off blood thinners, dramatically increasing my risk of more PEs. I was told 50 percent of patients that have a second PE will die from the PE. I am scheduled to begin 9 weeks of IMRT starting January 2, 2012 and was wondering what success others have had with IMRT as their primary treatment? I am only 60 and the first person in my entire blood line to have any cancer, probably due my being on 12 years of Testosterone replacement therapy. To top this off, the average life expectancy in my family is about 91 years old. I would very much like to continue this family tradition. Because of the early diagnosis, I am encouraged by the available IMRT results data I can find and remain optimistic. Any information with IMRT or IGRT as a primary treatment would be most appreciated. Harding",
