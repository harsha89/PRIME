      "Content": "I have had metastised prostate cancer for 2 years now. I had 1 year of successful hormone therapy before PSA rose significantly and I had to start chemotherapy with Taxotere. I was told 9 or 12 sessions would be done. I had pretty severe reactions intially, but with Neulasta this improved greatly. I was then told 8 sessions would be OK. Then at the 8th session was asked if I would go to 9 which I agreed. Then at the 9th session I was told that I could go to 12 sessions. Though there was no medical evidence that 12 sessions would be better than 9 (the oncologists words), I could decide for myself to have the extra 3 sessions. I am quite confused now, and would appreciate any words of wisdom from anyone as to whether I should extend or not",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by lancepeace Sorry to hear about your situation. I'm no expert on chemo but have heard that it does not usally cure prostate cancer forever. Am guessing that additional treatments might help but don't think it matters that much. This website is a little old but has some good info: http://www.hrpca.org/ Good luck. Thanks for replying. While I know that chemotherapy is not a cure for me, it is supposed to give a period of peace when finished. I just do not know if further sessions would prolong that period or not. If there is no medical reason for prolonging, then I would like to 'get out of' chemo.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by sequoiaranger I am on Taxotere as we speak. My initial batch was to be six infusions, each three weeks apart. At the time of the first infusion, it was LIKELY that I would be given additional infusions beyond six. Each time my PSA has been checked, it has lowered, though the last one lowered only a slight bit, so I may be approaching \"nadir\" of effectiveness. I am slated for a total of ten. I am mostly through #7. I intend to keep with it as long as my PSA is dropping or \"level\", but if it starts to rise I will quit the debilitating chemo regimen and go on to something else. (Those \"something elses\" will be more desperate and \"Hail Mary\" solutions---trials of promising treatments). Sompared to when I first started taking the Taxotere, I am MUCH BETTER off pain-wise (as a result of zapping the cancer causing the bone pain). For some people, PSA measurements do not tell the story. For me they do. Has your onc suggested any way to tell if the chemo regimen has reduced your cancer?? Hi, thanks for your response. My oncologist offered the extra sessions, said there was no medical evidence that 3 more sessions would help, but that some people wanted to go as far as possible. My results so far have been very good...no new lesions, PSA going from 4.0 to currently .32. I have new scans this coming week, and if they continue to show good progress, then the pressure is to keep going with the chemo. I just am fed up with the debilitating chemo, and if there is no real difference between continuing and stopping, then I would like to stop. Sorry to be a moan, but just looking to see if anyone have positive experience about extending the number of sessions. The best of luck with your ongoing treatment.",

      "Content": "Just an update to where I am now. I stopped chemo after session 9 as the PSA results had bottomed out, and am in what I am told is a period of peace! I am now on Xgeva injection monthly along with Decapeptyl. I had a scan last month and the results are quite positive. My PSA has unexpectedly gome down even further (now .20 ), no new lesions, old lesions all reduced and one old lesion has disappeared. I feel blessed with great medical care, a loving family and tons of prayers being said for me by people from differing religious beliefs. Next bone scan in 3 months. Good luck to all on these boards and especially sequoiaranger.",
