Congratulations, and welcome to \"the other side.\" Like you, I experienced quite a lot of urine leakage where the catheter entered the penis. I contacted my surgeon and was advised that this is A normal occurrence with some men. I had to sit/lie on incontinence pads (Chux) so as not to wet my recliner or bed. When I went out of the house, I pulled on a pair of Depends briefs to catch the leakage. Fortunately, the catheter was out in a week. As for catheter care, I was instructed to clean my penis and the first couple inches of the catheter with soap and water only. I could use vaseline if necessary to alleviate soreness, but never had to. Antibiotic preparations are currently not recommended, even for wound care. I hope your path report is favorable.

Yes, I spent countless hours studying all the cells of the body in my histopathology rotation during my medical technology training, though I never worked in that area after graduation.

I seriously hope that's the last time I ever have the opportunity to look at my own cells! The PNI doesn't really concern me all that much. Assuming all the cancer cells are Gleason 3's, I think there won't be anything to worry about. As Chuck mentioned, and as Dr. Walsh states in his book, Gleason 3 cells can't survive outside the prostate. Just keeping my fingers crossed that there aren't any 4's or 5's in there,",

      "Content": "It's now day 13 post surgery and day 6 after catheter removal. The past three nights I've been mostly dry, but I still have little to no urinary control when I'm up and about during the day. Even when I try to tighten the pelvic floor muscles, I still can't hold the urine in. Does this sound normal at this point? (I do my Kegels religiously.) At night, when I get up to pee (about every three hours), when the flow stops, I can feel my bladder contracting, like it's trying to push out the last drop. However, when this happens, a few drops of light pink blood-tinged urine drips out. The same thing happens during a bowel movement. I've also noticed some dark colored pieces of what looks like scab material on three occasions, the latest just this morning. Does all of this sound normal? I'm assuming it's just the internal wounds healing, but seeing blood come out that particular body part can be rather disconcerting. I still have some very mild pain when trying to sit on any hard surface (not enough to take any sort of pain medication). When should I expect that to subside? And lastly, these wet pads and Depends briefs are causing some mild \"diaper rash.\" I wash with soap and water every time I change pads/briefs and apply a skin cream with aloe, which helps, but wondered if anyone has found anything better.",

It's now been two and a half years since my surgery and my PSA (done this past Thursday) is still undetectable. Other than the six month PSA testing and some lingering incontinence, the whole PC episode is just a distant memory.

Even though I was a medical professional and had been involved with hundreds of patients with every sort of disease known, this was ME, and all rational thought escaped me for a bit. But once the reality sank in, and logic and reasoning returned, it was pretty much clear sailing. And now, looking back on it, the whole thing was just a little \"bump in the road.\" I'm mostly back to my normal self (using my own definition of normal, of course.. LOL). As I mentioned, the only lingering annoyance is some incontinence, and I've not yet decided what to do about that. My surgeon suggests a mesh implant, but I\"m not sure I want to go through that. We shall see, but for now I just keep a light shield in my underwear to catch the dribbles. Could be a lot worse! Again, thanks. I'll check back in from time to time. Gary",

      "Content": "Still dripping some here. Aggravating to say the least. Dry at night, but still need a thin shield during the day. I keep thinking about going without any \"protection\" here at the house, but haven't tried it yet. Went to a car show last evening, too much standing and walking, overloaded the shield and came home with wet underwear. Fortunately didn't show through my jeans. Sigh. Maybe I'll get there someday.",

I wanted that cancerous thing out of my body permanently! While I could have had the surgery closer to home, my urologist recommended either Johns Hopkins or Cleveland Clinic. I'm located about equidistant from both, and elected to go to Cleveland. My surgeon was Dr. Andrew Stephenson, and he did a great job with both nerve bundles spared. I also live alone, and a friend agreed to accompany me to the hospital for the surgery and stay with me for a short while during recovery, which was completely uneventful. I usually think a second opinion is beneficial, though once I met with Dr. Stephenson I had complete confidence in him and didn't seek out any other opinions. I suspect I would have felt the same with a Johns Hopkins surgeon as well, knowing that they're among the best in the world. I think if I were in your position and so close to the Cleveland Clinic that I would at least get an opinion from a surgeon there.

I wanted that cancerous thing out of my body permanently! While I could have had the surgery closer to home, my urologist recommended either Johns Hopkins or Cleveland Clinic. I'm located about equidistant from both, and elected to go to Cleveland. My surgeon was Dr. Andrew Stephenson, and he did a great job with both nerve bundles spared. I also live alone, and a friend agreed to accompany me to the hospital for the surgery and stay with me for a short while during recovery, which was completely uneventful. I usually think a second opinion is beneficial, though once I met with Dr. Stephenson I had complete confidence in him and didn't seek out any other opinions. I suspect I would have felt the same with a Johns Hopkins surgeon as well, knowing that they're among the best in the world. I think if I were in your position and so close to the Cleveland Clinic that I would at least get an opinion from a surgeon there. Good luck, and keep us posted with your progress through this process.",

      "Content": "YBut it is what it is. Prior to seeing the report, my surgeon said that the cancer had advanced to the point of urethral resection, but he thinks that the cauterization at that point may have obliterated (his word) any remaining cancer cells. Here's what the path report says: A. Periprostatic fat, excision - Fibrovascular tissue negative for tumor. B. Bilateral pelvic lymph nodes, excision - Thirteen lymph nodes, negative for carcinoma (0/13). C. Prostate, radical prostatectomy - Adenocarcinoma of the prostate, Gleason 3+4=7 with extraprostatic extension. See synoptic report. - High-grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia. - Microscopic bladder neck invasion is identified. - Inked margin of resection is positive for tumor. - Seminal vesicles are negative for tumor. There's a note concerning the bladder neck invasion saying that microscopic bladder neck invasion is not the same as macroscopic invasion. I'll need to research this more. At this point, my surgeon only wants a PSA level at 6 weeks. I met with my urologist here at home yesterday, and he thought the path report was good. He didn't comment much on the bladder neck invasion. On a positive note, I had the JP drain and catheter removed. What a relief! The drain removal was rather painful, but the nurse was slow and gentle, and we made it though without further injury (to either of us). Catheter removal was a non-event, I barely felt it. Unfortunately, I have next to NO urinary control at this point, even with religiously doing Kegels since last April. Oh well, bring on the Depends. (I thought about sleeping in the bathtub last night, but clearer heads prevailed.) Now for the interesting thing: this morning while changing my Depend brief to a pad, I washed the area, and when I soaped up my penis, it suddenly more than doubled in size (and felt really good). I stopped immediately, as I was afraid I'd break something, but I wonder now how hard I could have made it had I continued? Seems strange for that to happen only 9 days after surgery. I think a new science project has just begun. On a general note, I'm mostly pain free, can do about anything I need to do (within limits), but still seem to get tired much more quickly that before. I suppose I'm just impatient.",

      "Content": "The same thing has happened to me on a few occasions. My surgery was in September, 2015, and to this day I remain somewhat incontinent. Puttering around the house I usually wear a Depends Shield and sometimes leak 10 to 20 ml of urine. Then there are days that I go all day without leaking more than a few drops. But, there have been times when I've totally wet my pants, having saturated a pad and continued to leak until my underwear and pants were wet. The most embarrassing episode was at a national car show, wearing short pants over jockey shorts and a Depends pad, when I noticed that the seat of my pants was soaked. I had to walk across the crowded show field to the hotel, through the lobby, and up to my room to change. I don't know how many people saw my wet pants, but, needless to say, I was mortified. The only thing that I can attribute the massive leakage to is a large sweet tea that I drank with my lunch an hour or so before the wetting accident. The few other times that this has happened were closer to home when I could quickly change into dry clothes, and those times I attribute it to drinking coffee or other caffeinated drinks. Now, having said that, I should mention that I consume two large mugs of coffee every morning, and there seems to be no effect from that. But, if I have coffee later in the day I risk increased leakage. The only explanation I have is that my pelvic floor muscles likely get tired as the day progresses and whatever protection I have against leakage earlier in the day is so diminished later in the day that I lose control. My latest episode was Christmas day, late in the afternoon, after visiting friends and having a caffeinated soft drink. When I got out of the car after arriving home the seat of my pants was wet. I think the leakage happened on the drive home, but it was still embarrassing. When I last discussed this issue with my surgeon he recommended the male sling to cure my problem. I'm still not sure I want to go through that, but at least I'm still considering it.",

      "Content": "Hi newporter, Yes, I was in the healthcare business, but after my training 40+ years ago, I had very little involvement with prostate cancers. I was actually comfortable with AS for a year or so, but my urologist was not. His position was that while most prostate cancers grow slowly, there are those few that are fast growing and no one can prodict who will be one of these unlucky guys. Also, the rate at which my PSA went up, the fact that the cancer is in both sides of the gland, and my age, he suggested treatment sooner than later. I have a followup appointment with him in July, so I suppose I have at least until then to make up my mind what to do and where and when to do it.",

It sure is different when you're the patient! I'm coming up on 6 weeks post surgery, and I must say that the actual surgery and short hospital stay was a piece of cake. The only pain medication I had was Tylenol, and I could have tolerated the low level of pain even without that. I was up walking within hours after surgery, which helped get my digestive system working again. (My surgeon doesn't like to discharge patients until they pass gas, and walking seemed to speed up the process.) The catheter was a nuisance, but tolerable. Getting that thing out a week later was cause for celebration! So, here's hoping that your experience is similar, and you're up and around quickly on the other side.

      "Content": "Well, here we go. I've been suspicious of PC for several months, and finally have my diagnosis: Gleason 6, both sides, transition zone negative. Having been trained in histopathology and microanatomy 40+ years ago in the same pathology department, (though I've never used those skills since) I was allowed to examine my own biopsy slides so that I could see for myself how serious this thing really is. (Not that I doubted the pathologist and urologist, I just like seeing things for myself). Anyway, being only 65 years old and in excellent health otherwise, and from a family of unusually long longevity (assuming they didn't walk out in front of a bus or assume the role of a human lightening rod), my urologist suggests either RALP or proton beam therapy. I'm currently leaning in favor of RALP. Even though we have a nationally ranked teaching hospital in town, they currently do not have a surgeon sufficiently experienced in DaVinci surgery. If I decide to have RALP, I've been advised to go to either Cleveland Clinic or Johns Hopkins. I've been reading the posts on this forum for a few weeks now and have learned a lot. Thanks to all who have posted, and as I go through this journey, I'll post my questions and progress as well.",

      "Content": "For quite some time prior to my prostatectomy I had pain/discomfort in the lower gut/rectal area that I thought might be from prostate cancer. My physician assured me that it was not prostate related, rather a benign syndrome that would cause no problem. He was also of the opinion that prostate cancer is painless (unless, as already mentioned, it has metastasized). Fast forward to post-surgery, and I still have that same pain/discomfort occasionally - so, obviously, not prostate related. For me, it only lasts a few minutes to a couple hours, and nothing I have ever done stops it, including NSAIDs. I've just learned to live with it and hope it doesn't get too bothersome.",

      "Content": "For quite some time prior to my prostatectomy I had pain/discomfort in the lower gut/rectal area that I thought might be from prostate cancer. My physician assured me that it was not prostate related, rather a benign syndrome that would cause no problem. He was also of the opinion that prostate cancer is painless (unless, as already mentioned, it has metastasized). Fast forward to post-surgery, and I still have that same pain/discomfort occasionally - so, obviously, not prostate related. For me, it only lasts a few minutes to a couple hours, and nothing I have ever done stops it, including NSAIDs. I've just learned to live with it and hope it doesn't get too bothersome.",

      "Content": "Today, Sept 9, is exactly one year since my robotic prostate surgery. As others have related, it's now just a memory, and not really a bad one. As of my last PSA I'm still in the zero club, though I'm due for another test toward the end of October. My ED subsided rather quickly, and as of several weeks ago I manage to get just as hard as I did prior to surgery (and no noticeable shortening as some have wondered about) . The most nagging problem was incontinence, but the past several weeks I've been mostly dry. I still can get a very small squirt if I lift something heavy in an awkward way, or if I have to stand in one place for a really long time, but other than that no problem. I still wear a thin shield most days, mostly for peace of mind, but usually don't wear one at night and have never had more than a small spot on my underwear in the morning (and that's a really rare occasion). So, if my PSA's remain undetectable, I'll be a happy camper with only a distant memory of the surgery and the post-op period of catheters, leaks, and other humorous follies. Life is grand!!",

If I have another day below 10 cc they will give me a CT scan to make sure the lymphocele is collapsed and then take the drain out.I have my fingers crossed. I hope they find that the lymphocele is gone and that drain can come out.",

It took a couple doses of Milk of Magnesia to kick-start the works, but the end result was quite pleasant. I'm still hating this catheter, and my JP tube is still draining about 200cc of serous fluid per day, but otherwise I feel good. I took a nice walk outside this afternoon which about wore me out, so I treated myself to yet another nap. (I am not a nap person, so I hope this doesn't become a habit.). Catheter scheduled to come out on Thursday, assuming the cystogram is OK. I hope they can take the JP drain out at the same time, but it's not looking good for that right now.",

      "Content": "I can't add much to what's already been said, but I can tell you that at 6 weeks I was still soaking maximum absorbency pads like crazy during the daytime (I was dry at night just a couple weeks after surgery). I took the advice of others on this forum and began weighing my pads and keeping a log of their weights. I kept daily and weekly logs and mostly compared week to week rather than day to day. I'm coming up on 6 months since my surgery, and I'm finally getting down to about 10 or so cc. per day now, and usually wear just one light pad during the day. I know how frustrating this is, but I'm convinced that I'll eventually be completely dry, and your husband likely will be too. On my last visit to my surgeon he told me to just keep doing my Kegels, three times a day, and not to obsess over the incontinence. Easier said than done! As for the ED, it can take quite some time for some men to overcome this. I was making some progress in that area at 8 weeks, and now at nearly 6 months I\"m about 90% back to my pre-surgery status, though erections don't happen nearly as fast or spontaneously as before. I can live with that.",

      "Content": "Today marked six weeks since my DaVinci surgery. Since my final staging was pT3a (extension to the point of urethral resection with negative seminal vesicles and negative lymph nodes), my surgeon at Cleveland Clinic (Dr. Andrew Stephenson) wanted me to have my first PSA at six weeks. So, today, I had it done, and the result was <0.1. Yayyyyyy!! To say I'm relieved would be an understatement! Now the big question is how long will this continue? On the incontinence front, I'm mostly dry at night and while sitting down, but leak quite a bit when standing, walking, sneezing, coughing, etc.. I do my Kegels religiously, and do see some improvement, but this is getting really, really irritating! As others have suggested, I began weighing my pads and entering the weights in grams (which also more or less translates into urine volume in ml) into a spreadsheet, then plotting a graph each day. It's easy to see how the volumes are decreasing over time, but I wish it would go faster!! (I'm not a particularly patient man.) ED is still an issue. I do manage to get to about 50-60% of my pre-surgical erection, but it's not really hard enough to please anyone but me. And it really does please me, with orgasms that are the most intense I've ever experienced in my entire life. And they go on and on and on! (If I'd known this would be one of the outcomes, I would have had the surgery a long time ago!) Of course, getting accustomed to no semen being ejaculated took a while to get used to, but the intensity of the orgasms makes me forget all about that. I do experience a fair amount of urine leakage during foreplay, but no loss of urine during orgasm, which is a good thing! That's it for now. So far so good.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by Lilguy Anyone care to offer their post op experiences? Thanks all. Welcome to the other side!! My robotic surgery was three months ago, and I've nearly forgotten all about it. The worse thing, which you've already survived, was the catheter. What a relief it was to get rid of that thing! I did have a little blood in my urine for a couple weeks, but I knew to expect this and it eventually went away. I think most of the bleeding is from the resection of the urethra, which will continue to heal for some time. I had very little pain, and only took a few tylenol the first couple days after surgery. I continued to take a stool softener for several weeks just to be sure that things flowed through and out freely. My surgeon at Cleveland Clinic does not believe that taking Cialis or Viagara serves any useful purpose after surgery and does not prescribe it. He did tell me that if I really wanted it he would write a prescription, but I declined. I've been able to get an erection that's marginally useful, so, for now, I'm happy in that respect. I still have quite a bit of urine leakage during sexual activity, but for now it's tolerable. One thing that you really need to do is to do lots of walking, avoid heavy lifting for a few weeks, and do your Kegels religiously. I'm still having some degree of incontinence, but it's getting better (just not quickly enough!). Good luck with your recovery, and as many on this forum have said before, in a little while this entire experience will be little more than a distant memory.

      "Content": "Originally Posted by rooster22 This makes a lot of sense, so I will expect to do this test. Hope it is not painful or uncomfortable. I bet this is no time to be modest. I bet my little guy will be on full display for all to see. Just not comfortable with this happening. No pain or discomfort at all during the test. And your little guy shouldn't be on display at all. I was given a long hospital gown to wear, and the only thing that anyone saw was the end of the catheter where it attached to the collection bag. I remained covered the entire time (which was only a few minutes). However, obviously, when the catheter is removed someone will get a look at your little buddy for maybe a minute. But as already mentioned, whoever is pulling the catheter has seen dozens or even hundreds of them. You won't care either, as you will be on the verge of FREEDOM!!! LOL And, the entire removal process takes mere seconds and is painless (just a weird feeling). So, don't fret over these procedures, they should be a piece of cake!!",

      "Content": "Hi, Your husband's final path report was very similar to my own. I was also upgraded to G7(3+4), with a positive margin at the point of urethral resection at the bladder neck, and perineural invasion present. My final staging was pT3a (microscopic extension at bladder neck). I had my first post-op appointment with my surgeon at the Cleveland Clinic a couple weeks ago, and he told me that he considers this to be a very good path report and is not too concerned about any cancer cells left behind. He didn't mention the possibility of radiation any time in the future, but I know that this remains a possibility. My PSA was <0.1, and my surgeon wants a repeat in three more months. I completely understand your husband's apprehension, as I was the same way after first receiving my path report. But, neither he nor I are likely to die from prostate cancer. So, I think that your husband's prognosis is quite good. With a G7(3+4), even if radiation is needed sometime in the future, he has an excellent chance of a complete cure. At this point, he should relax, recover from the surgery, and plan on living a really long life.",

      "Content": "Hi, Your husband's final path report was very similar to my own. I was also upgraded to G7(3+4), with a positive margin at the point of urethral resection at the bladder neck, and perineural invasion present. My final staging was pT3a (microscopic extension at bladder neck). I had my first post-op appointment with my surgeon at the Cleveland Clinic a couple weeks ago, and he told me that he considers this to be a very good path report and is not too concerned about any cancer cells left behind. He didn't mention the possibility of radiation any time in the future, but I know that this remains a possibility. My PSA was <0.1, and my surgeon wants a repeat in three more months. I completely understand your husband's apprehension, as I was the same way after first receiving my path report. But, neither he nor I are likely to die from prostate cancer. So, I think that your husband's prognosis is quite good. With a G7(3+4), even if radiation is needed sometime in the future, he has an excellent chance of a complete cure. At this point, he should relax, recover from the surgery, and plan on living a really long life.",

      "Content": "Hi, Sounds like your husband is doing fine. My surgery was on the 9th of September, so I'm just a little ahead of him. My first Post-op PSA is also scheduled for 6 weeks. I think anywhere from 6 to 8 weeks is the norm. You're correct that the PSA that was produced prior to surgery will circulate in the bloodstream for a few weeks. I can't really address the staple removal, as I didn't have staples. But the catheter removal can be anywhere from a week to two weeks, and will be whatever the surgeon is comfortable with. Blood in the urine can last a few weeks. Unless it's large amounts of blood (dark red), it's quite normal, as is the blood around where the catheter enters the penis, during bowel movements or bladder spasms. As for Tylenol, I only took a few after returning home. I never really had much pain, and never even opened the bottle of Percocets I was sent home with. Your husband will need to decide when it's time to cut back. About the only thing I could add is to insist that your husband take it easy, not lift anything heavy, and take several walks each day. He will likely soon, if not already, hate the catheter, and the day it's out will be glorious. Be sure he's able to have a bowel movement without straining. A stool softener or some prune juice will keep things moving nicely. Good luck, and don't hesitate to ask queations. There are several very knowledgable folks on the forum who will provide lots of good advice.",

      "Content": "I had my second post-op visit with my surgeon at the Cleveland Clinic yesterday, and he thinks my progress is good. My PSA (going on 8 months since RALP) is still <0.1. This makes me very happy! The incontinence is still an issue. I'm still using a light Depends shield, and depending on what I do, can go all day with one and only a few ml of leakage per 24 hours, or go through three of them, leaking 50-80 ml in 24 hours. Just puttering around the house, I'm mostly dry. (I've been dry at night almost since having the catheter removed). However, if I bend over to tie my shoes, I can feel a small squirt, and if I lift something heavy, the squirt is bigger. Standing in one spot for more than a few minutes will cause a few dribbles . I had hoped that by 6 months I'd be dry, but that didn't happen. When I discussed this with my surgeon yesterday, he told me that it sometimes takes an entire year to be completely dry, and he's confident I'll get there eventually. I sure hope he's right, as this is really starting to get me down. On a much more positive note, my ED is nearly 100% resolved, and without the use of Viagara or any other drugs. My erections are probably 95-97% as firm as they were prior to surgery (and they were completely rock hard right up to the weekend before the surgery!). I still can't get an erection without some amount of manual stimulation, but my surgeon says this is normal. (He remarked that the manual stimulation was the \"fun part.\" LOL) As others have noted, orgasms are WAYYYYY more intense (and enjoyable) than before.... like I'm 18 years old again! And they last forever - quite a spectacle, as I've been told. The urine leakage I had experienced during sex is now mostly (though not entirely) gone, which is a blessing. My next PSA will be due in six months, so between now and then I plan to enjoy life and consider myself to be lucky this PC thing was caught early and that the surgery was a breeze (relatively speaking). Life is good.",

Living a week or so with that thing hanging there will not be joyful, but in the grand scheme of things I suppose it's no more than a minor inconvenience. As for penile rehab, I've already been asked several questions about my current sexual function (which is perfectly fine, thank you very much!) and apparently, they're quite proactive in this area. Starting the Kegels soon is a great idea. I told my surgeon that I was potty trained at 9 months, haven't had an accident since, and intend to continue that for many years to come. He was mildly amused. LOL Pratoman, the wait time for surgery was actually the surgeon's idea. He said he likes to wait as long as practical after the biopsy (which was in February), and suggested early fall for the surgery. That fit perfectly with my schedule, which is rather booked up all summer. He agreed that my 3+3 Gleason and negative CT and bone scans didn't suggest any reason to rush into the surgery.",

My surgeon told me that the two genitourinary reconstruction surgeons at the Cleveland are among the best in the world, so perhaps this route would be a good option for me. I'll be giving this a lot of thought, and since I don't plan to rush into anything, I'll have plenty of time to make my decision.",

      "Content": "I had my annual checkup at the Cleveland Clinic on Thursday and discussed my continuing incontinence with my surgeon. I explained to him that I'm mostly dry, but after standing for 15-20 minutes or more, leaning forward for more than 30 seconds or so, lifting heavy items, etc., I start to leak slightly. I can feel it coming on, and nothing I do seems to be able to stop it. I've Kegeled more, less, none at all, and no frequency seems to help. The total volume of urine that I leak in a 24 hour period is usually actually quite small, anywhere from 5-6 ml to a maximum of 20 ml. While that doesn't seem like a lot, it can be bothersome. My surgeon suggests that I have a mesh sling implanted, as it is likely that my incontinence will not improve at this point. He all but guaranteed that I would be very happy with the result. That sounds good, but the thought of recovering from a gash right behind my scrotum is not very appealing. Has anyone here had this done? If so, how painful was the recovery period? Side effects? Was it successful? As my surgeon pointed out, there is no rush to do this, so I can take all the time I want to reach a decision whether to undergo the procedure or not. On the plus side, he considers the surgery a success and thinks that the cancer is permanently gone. And my erections are as good as pre-surgery, which is a testament to his nerve-sparing skill.",

      "Content": "Hi, Your husband's final path report was very similar to my own. I was also upgraded to G7(3+4), with a positive margin at the point of urethral resection at the bladder neck, and perineural invasion present. My final staging was pT3a (microscopic extension at bladder neck). I had my first post-op appointment with my surgeon at the Cleveland Clinic a couple weeks ago, and he told me that he considers this to be a very good path report and is not too concerned about any cancer cells left behind. He didn't mention the possibility of radiation any time in the future, but I know that this remains a possibility. My PSA was <0.1, and my surgeon wants a repeat in three more months. I completely understand your husband's apprehension, as I was the same way after first receiving my path report. But, neither he nor I are likely to die from prostate cancer. So, I think that your husband's prognosis is quite good. With a G7(3+4), even if radiation is needed sometime in the future, he has an excellent chance of a complete cure. At this point, he should relax, recover from the surgery, and plan on living a really long life.",

      "Content": "Hi, Sounds like your husband is doing fine. My surgery was on the 9th of September, so I'm just a little ahead of him. My first Post-op PSA is also scheduled for 6 weeks. I think anywhere from 6 to 8 weeks is the norm. You're correct that the PSA that was produced prior to surgery will circulate in the bloodstream for a few weeks. I can't really address the staple removal, as I didn't have staples. But the catheter removal can be anywhere from a week to two weeks, and will be whatever the surgeon is comfortable with. Blood in the urine can last a few weeks. Unless it's large amounts of blood (dark red), it's quite normal, as is the blood around where the catheter enters the penis, during bowel movements or bladder spasms. As for Tylenol, I only took a few after returning home. I never really had much pain, and never even opened the bottle of Percocets I was sent home with. Your husband will need to decide when it's time to cut back. About the only thing I could add is to insist that your husband take it easy, not lift anything heavy, and take several walks each day. He will likely soon, if not already, hate the catheter, and the day it's out will be glorious. Be sure he's able to have a bowel movement without straining. A stool softener or some prune juice will keep things moving nicely. Good luck, and don't hesitate to ask queations. There are several very knowledgable folks on the forum who will provide lots of good advice.",

      "Content": "Thanks guys for all the excellent suggestions. As to the catheter, I think that's my biggest concern. Living a week or so with that thing hanging there will not be joyful, but in the grand scheme of things I suppose it's no more than a minor inconvenience. As for penile rehab, I've already been asked several questions about my current sexual function (which is perfectly fine, thank you very much!) and apparently, they're quite proactive in this area. Starting the Kegels soon is a great idea. I told my surgeon that I was potty trained at 9 months, haven't had an accident since, and intend to continue that for many years to come. He was mildly amused. LOL Pratoman, the wait time for surgery was actually the surgeon's idea. He said he likes to wait as long as practical after the biopsy (which was in February), and suggested early fall for the surgery. That fit perfectly with my schedule, which is rather booked up all summer. He agreed that my 3+3 Gleason and negative CT and bone scans didn't suggest any reason to rush into the surgery.",

I drove home afterward with no pain or discomfort, and had just the slightest dull ache that night. I had a little blood in my urine that afternoon and once or twice the next day, but that was all. The only real shocker (even though I was forewarned) was the gross, bloody semen that I ejaculated about a week after the biopsy. That finally cleared up after a few pipe cleanings.

      "Content": "Originally Posted by rooster22 This makes a lot of sense, so I will expect to do this test. Hope it is not painful or uncomfortable. I bet this is no time to be modest. I bet my little guy will be on full display for all to see. Just not comfortable with this happening. No pain or discomfort at all during the test. And your little guy shouldn't be on display at all. I was given a long hospital gown to wear, and the only thing that anyone saw was the end of the catheter where it attached to the collection bag. I remained covered the entire time (which was only a few minutes). However, obviously, when the catheter is removed someone will get a look at your little buddy for maybe a minute. But as already mentioned, whoever is pulling the catheter has seen dozens or even hundreds of them. You won't care either, as you will be on the verge of FREEDOM!!! LOL And, the entire removal process takes mere seconds and is painless (just a weird feeling). So, don't fret over these procedures, they should be a piece of cake!!",

I had taken no pain medication other than a Tylenol while in the hospital, so that wasn't a factor, just the after effects of the anesthesia. I was fed a normal diet in the hospital (which, by the way was quite good!), so there were no dietary restrictions, though I did eat a relatively soft diet the first couple of days at home. I was getting rather concerned after about day 4 with no bowel activity, but the prunes and prune juice did the trick.",

      "Content": "Well, I slept all night and not a drop leaked. Before I went to bed (actually \"went to recliner\" LOL) I readjusted the catheter anchor on my leg, which I had previously adjusted yesterday afternoon when I changed clothes. I also was probably doing more physically than I should, putting things away in the kitchen, bending, etc, which may have been putting pressure on my bladder. Also, not to get too descriptive here, but my penis usually hangs down a bit. Now, however, it's only an inch or so long and is sticking straight out, but the catheter is trying to pull it to one side. When I release the catheter from the leg anchor and let things go where they want, letting the catheter stick straight out, the leaking stops. But this is a rather awkward situation, as I can't put on underwear or pants like that. Oh well, hopefully this will only last a few more days. My urologist is supposed to call me today to see how I'm progressing, and I'll discuss this issue with him. He did tell me prior to discharge that some leakage is considered normal and not to worry about it. Of course, he's not walking around with a drippy penis and wet pants. As far as I know. LOL",

The other values are three of the \"Red Cell Indices\" which are calculations made by the laboratory to estimate size and oxygen carrying characteristics of the red blood cells. MCH is Mean Corpuscular Hemoglobin, MCHC is Mean Corpuscular Hemoglobin Concentration, and RDW is Red Cell Distribution Width. To my knoledge, there is no link between red cell morphology and PC. (I spent the first half of my professional career measuring, reporting, and interpreting lab results, and I still remember a little of what I used to know!) Hope this helps.",

      "Content": "What you describe is perfectly normal. I could have written the same description. Like you, sitting and lying down were my dry times. Standing, walking, bending over,etc., the urine flowed freely. I went through lots and lots of pads that first week or so. It was very discouraging, but it did get better. Hang in there, you'll be fine, just do your Kegels as your surgeon recommends, and be patient. (Hah.. easy for me to say, but I am NOT a patient guy, so it was quite a challenge to get accustomed to walking around with a wet Depends pad, changing it out every so often, etc.) One thing that I would highly recommend is that you wash yourself well when changing pads and keep an eye out for any signs of \"diaper rash\" or skin breakdown resulting from prolonged urine contact. I think most guys don't have a problem with this, but I did have some skin irritation that caused some redness and slight burning. I started applying some skin cream a couple times a day and those symptoms soon went away. As for driving, I did start driving short distances as soon as the catheter was out, but I don't know that I would recommend it for at least a few days. You'll have to decide for yourself about that. I'm sure some guys would be fine while others may have problems, such as getting the foot on the brake in time, etc. I experienced a fair amount of fatigue for several weeks after my surgery, and, in fact, still have some degree of fatigue now at a little over three months, so for a while I limited my driving to short, infrequent trips. Just take it easy if you do decide to drive, and you'll know what your limits are. I held off on coffee for a couple weeks (which was more painful for me than the surgery - LOL), but when I started back with my usual two cups (and I have a really large coffee cup!), I really couldn't determine that it had any ill effects with regard to incontinence. I must admit that I'm still struggling with incontinence, and at one point a few weeks ago, thinking that the coffee might be having something to do with it, I stopped again for more than a week. There was no difference in the amount of leakage. Having said that, it is a fact that coffee (caffeine, to be specific) has a diuretic effect and can be a bladder stimulant, but, in my opinion, I really don't think these issues have a lot to do with stress incontinence, which is the type we experience after prostatectomy.

However, my checkup with Dr. Stephenson was cancelled and I wasn\u2019t able to get in to see him at a reasonable time, so I may have to skip this year\u2019s appt. My incontinence hasn\u2019t totally resolved, and I also wet the bed on a rare occasion when I sleep too soundly. It\u2019s very disturbing and embarrasing, but I suppose it could be worse. Gary",

Perhaps your husband could take half a day off, although if it were me, I'd opt for taking off the entire day. Of course, everyone reacts differently, but when the need to let go hits, it's rather difficult to delay it. I wish your husband well with his surgery. Keep us posted as to his progress.",

      "Content": "It's now been a little over four months since my DaVinci prostatectomy, and just as several other members have said, it's now mostly just a memory. I was diagnosed with PC after my biopsy last February, and due to a few non-health related factors, I put off the surgery until early September (with the blessing of both my local urologist as well as my surgeon at the Cleveland Clinic). I must say, my experience has been nearly spot-on as predicted by the other members of this forum. After reading through many, many posts and the stickies, I pretty much knew what to expect, what to request, what to do when I got home, etc. Life during those few days and weeks would have been a lot more stressful had I not found and joined this group. Here are a few aspects of my current state: Me energy level has just about returned to normal. I can do just about anything I ever did without getting winded, sleep soundly all night, and wake up refreshed in the morning. I'm returning to my pre-op exercise routine, but haven't quite got back to the same level I was pre-PC diagnosis. My ED issues are resolving, and I can achieve an erection about 80-85% of what I had pre-surgery (which was about the same as when I was 18!). It takes quite a while to achieve an erection that usable for anything but solo work, but that isn't necessarily a bad thing. I do leak a fair amount of urine throughout the process (even after emptying my bladder beforehand), and sometimes squirt out a good amount during orgasm, but we've learned to deal with it. I had never experienced any type of ED prior to surgery, so I'm hoping that in time I can get at least to the 90-95% level. I still have issues with incontinence. Even though the amount of leakage has decreased substantially, I still have to wear a Depends guard. I've been totally dry at night since only a couple weeks after surgery, and leak very little, if any, when sitting down, but I still have the squirts and dribbles when walking for any distance, running, lifting, sneezing, coughing, laughing, etc. I've altered my Kegel routine, both increasing and decreasing the frequency, but I can't see any difference in the rate of leakage. This is the most bothersome issue I have, but my surgeon tells me that it can take up to a year to totally resolve, and he advises me to just continue with my Kegels and not obsess about it. Another member of the group advised weighing the pads and keeping a log of leakage volume, and comparing weekly totals instead of daily amounts. I do this, and find it to be very useful, so thanks to whomever suggested that. I actually plot graphs of the weekly totals so that I can visualize my progress. Now if the slope of that line were just a little steeper! My next PSA will be around the first of February. I noticed that the order was entered into the computer as Free PSA. That doesn't sound right to me, and I plan to contact my surgeon to find out exactly what he wants. My first post-op PSA was a standard assay, not an ultra-sensitive assay. I'll try to resolve this issue prior to blood draw day. So, to summarize, the whole process, from biopsy through surgical recovery, was an experience, but not really a bad one, thanks in part to this group. I hope anyone reading this forum who is just beginning the process can put his mind somewhat at ease, knowing that it's not as bad as he probably imagines it will be.",

      "Content": "Ditto what Ray said. A PSA result of 0.04 is essentially zero. Can't ask for more than that! The incontinence is probably the most troublesome thing at this point, but it will get better. I'm nearly 5 months post DaVinci surgery and am just now starting to see the light at the end of the tunnel. I can't tell you how many Depends Guards I've gone through, all the time worrying that I'd never regain continence. But the other guys here on the forum told me it would eventually resolve, and, as usual, they were right. So, tell your husband to hang in there, do his Kegels, and in time he'll be dry.",
