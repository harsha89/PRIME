      "Content": "Hi! Not sure how to post in the Newly Diagnosed part but have found some very useful info her on my husband's condition. Thanks everyone! I'm looking for some help here understanding what we've been told to date. Last month my BH went to a new Dr since he had lost confidence in his previous one...for good reason it seems. The new Dr was very thorough and started with a complete physical which included a PSA....which was 270! The testing commenced with an ultrasound and CTScan. We were waiting for the CTScan results when we ended up in emergency because he couldn't pee and was in great pain. They inserted a catheter which helped for that issue but created others. When we were in emergency the Dr told checked and the CTScan results were available and he told us that it looked like there was prostrate cancer and his lymph nodes nearby were affected as well as a \"spot\" on his lower back. He also told us that my BH's PSA had been elevated 5 yrs ago but no follow up was done by the DR or my BH. A bone scan was scheduled and results showed no problem with his back (perhaps degenerative discs we knew about and/or arthritis) but did show an issue in the front of his hips. He had a biopsy today and the catheter was removed..hopefully will not have to back in. We have been told (prior to the biopsy) that he is not a candidate for surgery and chemo will likely be the best way to go. We understand we have to wait for the biopsy results in a couple of weeks to confirm things. So much info to digest so any insight, suggestions would be great! TIA!",

My BH does not meet the threshold for chemo (yah!) so we're on hormone therapy with testing every 3months to check it's working and the PSA is declining. Just having a treatment and a great talk with the oncologist, we're feeling much more in control and hopefully can move forward in a positive direction. The heparin is working on the blood clots and swelling is down enough that he felt able to do the chores he wanted. BP meds are down and readings are better and better. Just have to find a good range with the Flomax. Breathing better here. Happy Canada/July 4th everyone!",

We need to find out stage, grade and margins too. Anything else? We've been told that surgery is not an option and chemo has been in the forefront for treatment with another complimentary treatment but we'll know more soon enough. Once we have the info, I'll likely be here picking brains. The past couple of days have truly confirmed how little communication there is amongst health professionals. Luckily we have a few who go against that grain and are going above and beyond to help. We are going to talk with the Dr tomorrow and/or Thursday about dropping the Norvasc and continuing the Flomax. BP is still consistently low and today was HOT for here and my BH was still having trouble staying warm/comfortable. Thanks in advance! TTYS.",

I found I was getting almost obsessive about it and decided that wasn't good for me. I'm still working so that keeps me busy/distracted too, My BH is having a hard time with this and the blood clot today was another thing, he was in tears from the frustration. He's usually going like the energizer bunny and since June 1st, that has drastically changed. He is back at work when he can and that helps him too. I don't know how this all feels for him but try to keep a positive attitude until proven wrong, he's more of a glass half empty person which can be frustrating at times. One day/hurdle at a time is the best I can do and I'll be dammed if CANCER is going to take over our lives without a huge fight.",
