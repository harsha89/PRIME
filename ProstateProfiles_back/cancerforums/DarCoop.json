      "Content": "Thanks everyone for advice and support. I have spent numerous hours in past week reading this forum, along with books and other articles. My original plan of action was the AS route, but with six of six cores being positive, it looks like that is out. To add a some history to my story, my Primary Care Physician referred me to urologist February 2015 for elevated PSA. I saw both doctors every 6 months and PSA level would be between 4.6 and 5.4 and nothing suspicious we ever noted on DRE. Saw urologist September 2016 and he said he would not need to see me again if my February 2017 PSA did not jump. During February 2017 physical exam, PCP told me \"your prostate feels like a 40 year old's\". I'm 59. I asked if I needed to do one more visit with urologist and he said probably not, but lets see what PSA level is now before we cancel that appointment. PSA came back 6.34 and that got me to where we are now. (Urologist did tell me up-front that most biopsies took 12 cores, but recent study out of San Antonio (he was military doctor) shows they are having just as good results finding cancer after taking only six cores. That was his reasoning for six. I'm sure he was surprised that all six were positive) I'm not sure why I typed all of this out. I guess I am wondering how long cancer has been in prostrate for it to be in six-of-six cores, or maybe he got lucky with the six samples he took. Two days ago, I thought some form of radiation was best option for me. I thought that way, if cancer came back, they could always go back and do RP. Now I see radiation messes-up everything around prostate, so that makes future RP way too complicated. On a lighter note: I ordered Guide to Surviving Prostate Cancer book from \"super-store\" and when I went in to pick it up, lady behind counter took it out of shipping package to verify it was what I ordered. She read title and asked \"Is this for you?\". I replied \"Yes Ma'm\". She then said, \"everything will OK, do what doctors tell you to do, eat right, stop smoking if you do (I don't), and know you are not going through this alone\" I said \"Yes, I know it will all be ok.\" and started to leave. She then said \"I will be praying for you, please come back in and let me know how you are doing\" I walked out of store misty-eyed as she was first person I have told that \"yes, I have cancer, but I am going to be ok\". I AM going to be ok. Thanks Darwyn",

      "Content": "Unfortunately, it looks like I get to join your online club. I have had PSA level slowly rise over last 5-6 years. DRE was always \"unremakable\" with GP even mentioning I \"had prostate of a 40 year old\" whatever that means. I had been seeing a urologist last two years (along with my GP and he was going to release me to just see GP every six months. February 2017 PSA was 6.34 so I had to go back to urologist. Urolgist ordered biopsy \"just in case\". He said in cases like mine with no other symptoms, he usually only does six cores because one of the six will usually find cancer if it is there. (I had no other signs or symptoms other than elevated PSA. Occasionally I would have feeling prostate was swollen because it felt like I was \"sitting on a golf ball\". ) All six cores showed adenocarcinoma. Right lobe indicate adenocarcinoma in 76% of tissue. Left lobe indicates adenocarcinoma in 15% of tissue. Left lobe also shows \"Perineural Space Invasion:Present\" I assume this means it is in or near nerves. Wife and I go back to urologist next week for consultation and decision on next steps. Urologist did says I had time to decide what to do. I told my wife that I was not worried about the \"cancer\", my concern is which is deciding which is right treatment plan for me. I am reading this forum, Invasion of Prostate Snatchers and ordered the Dr. Walsh's Guide to Surviving Prostate Cancer. Thanks for all information I have gained from you so far. I'll be seeing you around I am sure.",

      "Content": "I'm back checking in and updating forum. I posted after original diagnosis, and have been logging in regularly reading everyone's updates. I really appreciate all of words od wisdom from all of the \"regulars\" on here. I had daVinci robotic surgery in Longview Texas on Tuesday June 13. Dr. Paul Bradley performed the surgery. I checked into going to Dallas and/or Houston but ended up choosing Dr Bradley who is local. Biggest benefit was it was close to home and did not have the 3-5 hours drive to other facilities. I remember they rolled me back towards surgery at 12:50pm and I was awake in my room at 5:00pm. Dont remember anything between that time. Very little post surgery pain, just some soreness at incision sites. Worst part at hospital was them removing tape from hands and arms and yanking hair out by roots. Wish I had shaved off all hair from fingers to elbows. I've finally gotten used to the catheter and carrying with me whenever I get up and move. Stool softeners have finally started working. I was \"stove-up\" on day 2 and that was miserable. Now I'm just waiting for next Thursday for cath removal and pathology report. Overall, it's all good.",
