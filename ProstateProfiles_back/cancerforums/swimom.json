      "Content": "Jean, No one can say just how long a person can live with bone mets. There is wide range for men with prostate cancer. Because of the different drugs currently being used and depending on the many different individual responses possible, time is just what it is...time. Some men live months, some a few years and some live for many years. If you're looking for a configured average I believe it is 5 years. The agressivness of prostate cancer can stay stable or it may change. The one thing we do know for certain is...If a man lives long enough, he will die from prostate cancer that has spread. Sooner or later the cancer will out-smart the drugs. Hope this answers your question. Swim",
