      "Content": "Hi everybody. It's been an interesting, sometimes comical, week following my DaVinci RP on July 14. Here are some vignettes of some of the happenings: Day 2 of being home: The large sticker on my leg that held the catheter tube in place came off. My wife and I tried everything to try to get it to stay on. We finally held in on with some athletic wrap. It looked hilarious. Day 3 of being home: I kept having pains in my lower abdomen like I had a UTI. Thankfully, reading posts on this forum relieved my fears. Day 4 of of being home: In the middle of the afternoon, I noticed that the pain in my abdomen was increasing and no urine was in the catheter tube. I shifted positions on my couch, gave the catheter a little \"turn\" near my little buddy and voila! The clear tube began filling the bag! It was a bit unnerving, but what a relief! Day 5 of being home: During surgery, the 7 incision spots from the surgery were sealed with the surgical super glue material. It seems I'm allergic to it. My incisions are raised and red and really itchy. Benadryl cream and tablets seemed to help a bit. I had my first BM, which was a relief, but also a bit painful in the catheter area. Days 6 and 7 of being home: More UTI pain, and it's getting difficult to find a comfortable lying/sitting position. Day 8 (Today): Back to the doc to rid my life of this vile serpent from hell. Removing it wasn't painful, just slightly uncomfortable, and just for a few seconds. I'm glad I took a pad with me to the doctor's office (again, thank you, forum members!). I've had leaks throughout the day, but nothing too significant. That is, except when I was changing clothes and lifted my leg onto a table to put on a sock. Bad idea. I guess that's why they invented mops. Here's my final pathology report: Gleason 3+4 Cancer in left and right lobes Tumor size: .9 cm Margins free from tumor No cancer in 7 pelvic lymph nodes Weight: 56 grams Staging: pT2c, pN0, pM-n/a Overall, it wasn't a week I'd like to re-live, but I'm thankful that I was able to be home and most of all that the cancer hasn't spread past the margins. My doc said he'd check my PSA every 3 months for 4 years. My surgeon, Dr. Kevin Art at St. Joseph East hospital in Lexington, KY is fantastic and so very capable. I can't recommend him enough. The hospital staff were also wonderful. From what I'm reading, I'm entering the recovery stage where patience is needed the most. I'm thankful we have each other to journey together. Bernard",

I even have great days and not so great days. I'm going through 2-3 pull ups a day (I call them 'man wraps') because I'm still too freaked out to go with just pads. While all of this is frustrating, I know its most likely temporary and I continue to focus on the fact that the cancerous prostate is long gone!

Those 3 things are very tough to overcome. I\u0092m in that situation now, and my uro has told me I\u0092m not dead yet. I don\u0092t believe him. I\u0092m planning on a implant. Just the way it is. Good luck, MM I've discussed an implant with my doc. Unfortunately my insurance refuses to cover it.",

I have an Italian sports car so in tune with the road that any little pebble feels like a speed bump. I'm concerned that the sometimes jostling ride might make for a few leaking problems (and not with the car). Has this been an issue for anyone? If anything, at least this post can give your pupils a workout with some eye-rolling exercises. Thanks, everyone! Bernard",

      "Content": "Hi everybody. It's been awhile since I've posted anything to the forum, but I've been lurking! My daVinci RP was in mid-July 2016. So far, I've had one post-surgical PSA test that put me in the \"Zero Club.\" I'm so thankful. Continence is great, and physically I'm doing just fine. ED is still an issue, though, and that's the reason for my post. I had no idea of the psychological toll of not having an erection for 6 months. I'm thankful I don't have cancer anymore. I'm thankful that incontinence is gone. In the reality of this new normal I suppose I'm grieving for life as it used to be. I'm already tired of pumps and the thought of possible injections. I'm working out five days a week and work is as busy as it has always been. It's not like I'm sitting around the house pondering these things and feeling sorry for myself. I'd cherish any counsel from you brothers who have been in this situation far longer than I have. As always, thank you! Bernard",

Two weeks ago my urologist gave me the news over the phone that my biopsy revealed that one sample was positive with cancer, and the two adjacent to it had atypical cells. My Gleason is 6.

I don't meet with my urologist until next Friday (May 20), so I don't really know what is in store for me. I've read so much conflicting information about Gleason 6 treatment vs. non-treatment. My family in Houston is already encouraging me to get a second opinion and possible treatment at MD Anderson (I live in KY). I cherish any counsel you have. Thank you!",

      "Content": "It seems like so much longer than 3 weeks ago that the surgical robot got to know me really well. My recovery has been interesting, anxiety-ridden, and sometimes humorous. I have good days and bad days. It's like taking two steps forward and one step back. At least that's still making progress. One day I'll be dry, and another day I'll be leaking like crazy. I do a lot of standing when I work (I'm a graduate-school professor), and I notice most of the squirts while I'm on my feet rather than sitting. I've been going to work for a couple of hours a day this week and I'm zonked by the time I get home. As many have posted, a majority of the leaking seems to come in the evening, when muscles are tired, but hardly at all when I sleep; although I do find myself having to get up to go to the bathroom 2-3 times a night. For those of you who are dreading the post-surgery life, I can say that 3 weeks out, my body has become accustomed to the new normal quite well, and I see improvements every day - and the doc did a miracle job with the nerve-sparing technique... Now for the big question: On the day my catheter was removed (day 8 after surgery), my doctor was concerned that the 7 incision points were a bit puffy and warm. He prescribed the antibiotic Bactrim for a week as a precaution. Although it caused some loose stools, I didn't have any issues with it. That is, until 2 days after I finished the prescription. I woke up at 1:30am this morning with a terrible burning itch. I had large, raised hives all over my body, from the top of my head to my feet. In the morning, my wife took me to my primary care doc and he shot me up with Prednisone and gave a script for tablet form. Since that injection, I've been leaking like a busted pipe. I know this medicine is nasty stuff, but does anyone know if Prednisone has been known to affect incontinence or recovery from Prostate removal? Again, I'm thankful for this very helpful community.",

The symptoms should go away after the medicine is out of the body. I've been up since 6am and I'm already on my third Depends at 4:30pm (I call Depends a 'man wrap').

      "Content": "My doctor texted me this morning and told me that the steroids will actually impair healing. Do I want to heal from the surgery or have burning, itching hives? I think I'll go with the hives. Hopefully Benadryl will do the trick. However, I discovered that taking Benadryl at night has its own risks! I believe somebody shared a similar situation on another post about taking NyQuil before bedtime and flooding the mattress! http://www.cancerforums.net/threads/...-the-Titanic!?",

      "Content": "Great post MF. Thanks for the info. According to my pharmacist, a common side effect of Prednisone for folks with incontinence issues is an increase in the incontinence. The symptoms should go away after the medicine is out of the body. I've been up since 6am and I'm already on my third Depends at 4:30pm (I call Depends a 'man wrap'). Before the Prednisone, I was going all day with just one.",
