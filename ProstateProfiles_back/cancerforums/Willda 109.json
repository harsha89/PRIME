      "Content": "Originally Posted by bigbrad2008 I think they radiate where the prostate was and the area around it (lymph nodes etc.) Even though your radioligist was not the best communicator, did he say SRT and hormones? He didn't really talk with us long enough to discuss SRT with or without hormone therapy nor did he even try to explain why he felt the PCa was still in the prostate bed versus distant spread. Didn't seem interested in talking to our questions based on our research.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by Replicant I have a couple of thoughts--first, I don't think I would stick with a non-communicative doctor. You've got a lot riding on this. Second, SRT might be worth a shot. The negative margin status doesn't help your odds of success, but it's just one of several factors. Another crucial factor is your PSA before you start SRT. Statistically, men who start at 0.5 or below do much better. You might want to try the nomogram (a predictive tool) for salvage radiation at the Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center: http://nomograms.mskcc.org/Prostate/...onTherapy.aspx You'll want to have your pathology report in hand, and know your PSA history. From your posting, I would guess you have all that. SRT is always a gamble, but for most men the downside to the gamble is greatly outweighed by the upside of a potential cure. Thank you for your insight, \"persistent\" rising PSA after RP with ECE and negative margins is not the norm evaluated in studies and research as I'm finding. Want to make sure I make the best decision on what's next.",
