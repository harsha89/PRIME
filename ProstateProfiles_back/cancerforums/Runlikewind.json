      "Content": "Jimmy, You will learn a lot by being on this site. My advice is for you to learn as much as possible, read and ask questions, not only here but especially in conversation with your surgeon and radiation oncologist. My biopsy only showed 5% contained to lower apex with Gleason 3+3. PSA ranged from 8-10. I considered all treatment options including doing nothing and just watching the PSA over time. I elected surgery (DaVinci) after my surgeon shared that in his experience a PSA of 8-10 produced more cancer than my biopsy was showing, again he was just sharing his experience. Sure enough, my pathology was worse as the cancer had spread to the seminal vesicles. Gleason was upgraded to 4+4 and now Im beginning radiation. If I had known my true pathology I would have had a different mind set. If there is a benefit to surgery it is that radiation is a secondary option. My understanding if one chooses radiation as primary then surgery as secondary can be problematic. Your PSA jump from low single digit to 17 may warrant a repeat PSA but for sure Id be asking my surgeon and RO what that PSA of 17 means to them. Become an expert and I promise your conversations with your specialist will be more productive.",

      "Content": "Hello Samie, My pathologic stage following surgery (Oct 1st) was T3b NX, Gleason 4+4 with seminal vesical involvement. My first post-op Ultrasensitive PSA at 9 months was 0.05 which some refer as \"undetectable\". My surgeon says to ignore those numbers and focus on pathology. In my case it was his clinical opinion to take the time to heal and move toward IMRT (6-week radiation therapy) along with hormone therapy (3-month injection of zoladex) and if at all possible accomplish this in a 6-8 month time frame. For my own curiosity I had another Ultrasensitive PSA at 12 weeks and it remained 0.05. Ive followed his clinical opinion and received the hormone injection mid-December and will start radiation Feb 22nd It is his belief that it my case you hit this hard......a better post-op pathology report probably would have led to a more conservative approach. My medical team believes a clinical cure is very much possible as there is no indication of lymph node involvement and bone scan plus CT scan were clean. The plan is to clean up this mess and radiate the prostate bed and surrounding tissue. He believes the research data points to higher success rates by being aggressive when the pathology report is similar to mine. He did however give me the option to wait and take continued PSA's if I didnt want the aggressive approach. Samie, everyone is different,clinicians are different. Be your own advocate. Ask your medical team the tough questions regarding the liklihood of reoccurance with your pathology.Ask about survival rates being aggressive now or waiting. Ive got more to share if you wish,so just let me know.",

      "Content": "Problem will continue to be that at biopsy it remains an educated guess. Many G6 biopsies are offered treatment choices that include AS, as was mine. Surgery in some cases may very much be over treatment but it does allows for an accurate pathology plus how many biopsy G6 end up with an upgrade to a much more serious pathology? Its not an easy answer. 2nd opinions can help clarify. It looks like the new grading system on paper will be easier to understand but not necessarily make the decision any easier. I guess we don't want newly diagnosed people to over react when told they have cancer but personally being told that I did and getting emotionally involved motivated me to be in charge of my treatment. Without that emotion I may have accepted my primary and initial two urologist recommendation to do nothing and just wait for PSA retest which in my situation would have been the wrong decision. I do like the comment above about the importance of getting into a \"fact finding mode\". Biopsy July 2015 Gleason 6 with 5% involvement Aug 2015 2nd opinion confirmed biopsy results. Aug 2015 3rd opinion suggested biopsy did not correlate with PSA 8-9 DaVinci Sept 2015.

      "Content": "Hi Steve, Ill share my experience and maybe the information will be helpful. My biopsy in July 2015 indicated 5% involvement of right apex and was given a Gleason 6 (3+3). PSA fluctuated between 8-9. (July-September) Local urologist suggested AS. Pursued a highly recommended surgeon at a teaching hospital in Seattle who confirmed that the biopsy was accurate but cautioned me that with a PSA of 8-9 he would expect to have seen more cancer. I opted for surgery. DaVinci surgery took place September 30th. Pathology report indicated that cancer was 30% and was in all four quadrants. Gleason score was bumped to 8 (4+4) with seminal vesical involvement. First 8 week uPSA was 0.05. Surgeon shared that current guidelines would consider that number undetectable but based on my pathology he wanted to ignore that number as in his clinical judgement that number would slowly increase. Second uPSA at 11 weeks was 0.06. We just completed a bone scan and CT scan this week and both were clean. Im following his clinical judgement. I was given an injection of Zoladex (HT) this week and will begin 6 week course of radiation mid-Feb. He believes with scans clean it supports any remaining cancer to be in prostate bed/surrounding tissue and with radiation is the best chance for a cure. He states that some would consider this aggressive treatment timeline but reminds me that you get one shot at this and in his experience ones pathology outweighs early undetectable readings. Let me know if I can share more. My pathology seems more serious than yours (SV+) so we are not comparing apples to apples but Ive learned you need to be your own advocate and knowledge is power. Bets of luck, Ill look forward to following your journey.",

When I asked them about the guidelines of waiting for reoccurance of 1.0 or 2.0 on two consecutive uPSA's, they believe based on my pathology the likelihood for reoccurance is moderately high and clinically a better chance for a cure is now with aggressive treatment. Their recommendation was to start Zoladex now, which I did and prepare for 6 weeks of radiation in Feb. All occuring within 5 months of prostate removal.
