      "Content": "Here is an interesting article on AS. Dr. Epstein of John Hopkins was 1 of the participants. http://www.ascopost.com/issues/july-...-surveillance/ It\u0092s interesting that Dr. Chapin states that doctors are motivated to treat because of financial incentives. Glad someone said the obvious. It\u0092s also interesting that the ASCO guidelines for low risk pathology is for serial biopsies every 3-5 years. There isn\u0092t much published data on the frequency of biopsies for very low risk cancer - my pathology. Dr. Epstein acknowledges that his approach may be considered controversial because his AS acceptance is more restrictive. He also makes reference to repeat biopsies in 1 or 2 years.",

      "Content": "In May 2016, I had a biopsy because my PSA had doubled to 4.0 over an 18-month period. I was diagnosed with Gleason 7 (3+4) in less than 5% of 1-core. Sent the slides to Dr. Epstein who couldn't confirm the diagnosis, however, he said the core looked suspicious and recommended a repeat biopsy. In July 2016, the biopsy was repeated and 1-core in an adjacent \"quadrant\" was a Gleason 6 (3+3). Dr. Epstein confirmed this as did another pathologist at MSK. The pathologist at MSK also said the first biopsy was a Gleason 6 (3+3). In summary, 3 different opinions on the first biopsy and 3 of the same opinions on the second biopsy. My last 2 PSA's (Oct. 2016 and April 2017) were 2.5 and 2.9, respectively - a pleasant surprise, although I know PSA's can vary. I know the active surveillance protocol is PSA's every 6-months and periodic biopsy's. I will ask my urologist if the biopsy frequency is dependent on the PSA - especially if it remains low. I will find out what his AS protocol is regarding repeat biopsy's. In Dec. 2016, I had a consult with MSK and their AS protocol is to repeat the biopsy every 2-3 years. I had a heart attack 10 years ago and although my heart is strong, I have a defibrallator and can't have an MRI targeted biopsy. I know that a transperineal template mapping biopsy would provide much more information than a standard TRUS biopsy, but I don't know if my insurance company would pay for it. Additionally, I'm not thrilled at the thought of them sticking many fine needles into my prostate. Since I can't have an MRI, is it fair to expect that my AS program be different than the standard AS programs where MRI targeted biopsy's are done? Being cynical, I don't believe doctors like to personalize medical care for their patients as it takes too much time.

      "Content": "I had mentioned in a previous thread that Dr. Epstein reviewed my slides and said that he couldn't establish a definitive diagnosis in the 1 core that was classified as a Gleason 7 (3+4) by the original pathologist. Medicine is changing and many \"small\" medical group practices are being bought by hospitals or very large medical groups. My urologist had 1 partner and is now part of a large urological group that has recently been purchased by a large health group. This large health group also has 4 hospitals. There are 2 pathologists that are employed by the hospital and they are not prostate specialists - as Dr. Epstein is. Should a second pathologist at the same hospital review the slides and sign-off on the report? The hospital pathology department only sent the slides that were diagnosed as cancer (Gleason 7(3+4)) and high-grade PIN (2 cores) to Dr. Epstein. I am surprised that they didn't send all slides (even those that were benign). When I called the hospital pathology department, they told me, for second opinions, they only send the slides that show cancer or PIN. Please understand that I am thrilled with Dr. Epstein's report, however, things like this are troublesome to me. Any thoughts? Hope everyone has a great 4th. Mitch",

      "Content": "Thanks all. Epstein did say \"Although these findings are highly atypical and suspicious for adenocarcinoma, insufficient cytologic.........\" I am thrilled with Epstein's report. Does anybody know what serum or urine tests Epstein may be referring too? He doesn't know that I have a defibrillator so imaging tests like an MRI cannot be done. Also, Epstein says \"in some cases\" a repeat biopsy may be recommended. Does anyone know the criteria for a repeat biopsy? I haven't yet spoken to my urologist about the report. I agree with Otago that it is scary how many people would have accepted the first pathology report and proceeded with surgery. It's very concerning that urologists don't recommend second opinions on pathology reports. If it wasn't for this forum, I wouldn't have known of Dr. Epstein and would probably be scheduling my surgery. Thank you, thank you, thank you.",

      "Content": "I\u0092ve been on AS for 2 years - my PSA is stable. My AS protocol is a PSA every 6 months, DRE every year and biopsies every 2-3 years -based on the PSA results. I can\u0092t have an MRI because of my defibrillator. I know that MRI\u0092s are part of the standard AS protocol. I asked my doctor(s) \u0096 local urologist and MSKCC consult about an MRI workaround and I was told there isn\u0092t any. My urologist told me that he would take 16 samples during the next biopsy. I was awake for the first 2 biopsies and although it wasn\u0092t fun, it wasn\u0092t too bad. I already told my doctor that I want to be knocked out for the next biopsy \u0096 especially if he is going to take additional samples. Question: Being knocked out; with a TRUS biopsy, will my doctor be able to take samples from areas of the prostate that he wouldn\u0092t otherwise \u0093reach\u0094 if I was awake? I really don\u0092t want a saturation biopsy or a template mapping biopsy \u0096 although I may ask my doctor about them. For low and intermediate grade cancer, I understand that the cure rate for surgery, IMRT and SBRT is the same \u0096 around 75%. Therefore, the probability for recurrence would be 25%. Questions: Assuming that HT/SRT is the follow-up treatment for recurrence after surgery, what is the cure rate after HT/SRT? I understand that an MRI is done as part of the simulation for SRT. For men that can\u0092t have an MRI, is there a work around? If radiation (IMRT or SBRT) is done as the primary treatment, if there is a recurrence, what is the secondary treatment and what are their respective cure rates?",

      "Content": "As some of you know, a month ago, I was diagnosed with Intermediate grade cancer. One of 12 biopsies had a Gleason 7 (3+4), involving 1 of 2 fragments, less than 5% of the tissue. An adjacent core had a high-grade PIN and was suspicious for cancer. The pathologist who diagnosed the cancer works for a large \"Health System\" and supports many of the doctors in the same health system. My guess is that this pathologist doesn't specialize in prostate cancer. I requested the \"Health System\" to send the slides to Dr. Epstein of Hopkins for a second opinion. Dr. Epstein said although highly suspicious for cancer, he couldn't establish a definitive diagnosis. He recommended follow-up, including serum or urine tests, imaging and in some cases, repeat biopsy with increased sampling of the atypical site. As I've said in a previous post, I am thrilled with Dr. Epstein's report. Realistically, I'm on Active-Surveillance even though, according to Dr. Epstein, I don't have cancer. I will be meeting with my urologist next week to discuss the plan going forward. A couple of observations/questions: 1) The Gleason 7 (3+4) core involved 1 of 2 fragments, less than 5% of the tissue. Should the \"less than 5% of the tissue\" and/or 1 of 2 fragments make it more difficult to diagnose? 2) When do urologists request second opinions on the diagnosis? 3) My urologist wanted to do a cystoscopy before surgery to make sure the bladder is okay. Is that standard before DaVinci surgeries? He does them prior to all prostate surgeries. 4) What percentage of second opinion of slides changes the diagnosis? As an aside, I requested the \"Health System\" to send all my slides to Dr. Epstein. Dr. Epstein was only sent the cores with the cancer diagnose and the high PIN. I questioned the \"Health System\" why they didn't send all the slides and was told \"that's how they always do it\". 5) Since I'm not a patient of Hopkins, if I request, would Dr. Epstein be the first line pathologist for my next biopsy - assuming I'll need one? 6) I wonder if the pathologist who diagnosed the core as cancer will look at the slides again after reading Dr.Epstein's report. Dr. Epstein sent a copy of his report to the original pathologist. 7) The thought of having surgery and then having a negative biopsy is frightening. Do you know how frequent this happens? Hopefully, very very rarely. When my urologist did the DRE, he said that 1 side of the prostrate felt \"rubbery\". Has anyone had this reported? He was surprised that the cancerous core came from the other side of the prostate. Two weeks ago, I saw a radiation oncologist who also did a DRE. He told me he didn't feel anything. 9) I believe my urologist will want to do a PSA in 6 months and repeat the biopsy in a year. Since I will worry if the PSA goes up, I would rather wait and do them both in a year. I know we look at PSA velocity but is there much risk in waiting for a year? I'd appreciate your input on these questions. Thanks Mitch",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by Michael F Hi Mitch! If me, I would follow Dr Epstein's lead and continue on a \"structured\" course of AS with predefined parameters that will trigger action if reached. Was there any \"measurement\" of your prostate size? Usually this is done via ultrasound at time of biopsy (or prior). Do you have BPH or prostatitis? If your prostate size is normal and BPH or prostatitis are absent and there are no urinary flow issues, I'm not sure why cystoscopy would be indicated prior to surgery. Especially when that surgery, IMO only, is clearly NOT indicated at this time point. Why would you want to contribute to the statistic: \"PC is the most overtreated of all forms of cancer?\" Again, if me, I would look into having the appropriate 3T MRI. In fact, 3T MRI is now required for AS protocol at NCI. This will both identify any additional areas of suspicion that may have been missed on biopsy & will serve as a baseline against which to measure any future changes. Plus if negative, this will provide enormous peace of mind! I'm clueless as to the cost and reimbursement issues for a 3T MRI, but I doubt it is any more expensive than the total (Uro MD fee + Pathology lab fees + Pathology MD fee) cost of having a another biopsy down the road. Good luck moving forward! But in terms of taking interventional action, move VERY slowly! MF Hi Michael. I do plan on following Dr. Epstein's lead on AS. About 7 years ago, I was told I had BPH. I had some blood in my urine and had a cystoscopy. Very uncomfortable - almost fainted. Never went back to that urologist. From the recent DRE, the urologist report says \"Left lobe rubbery - 40 gram or 2+ size\" It also says the prostate is approximately 54 grams. Does anyone know if this is \"normal\"? I never questioned it. The urologist report also says a hypoechoic area was identified in the left lobe transition zone. As far as an MRI, unfortunately, I can't have it because of my defibrillator. The wire going into my heart would got very hot from the magnetic field and cause damage to my heart. Before receiving Epstein's report, I told my urologist to schedule surgery. I had trouble sleeping knowing I had cancer - especially Gleason 7 (3+4). In any case, the report from Epstein gave me a new look on life. As seen by my questions, I'm still learning and questioning everything and I know I have plenty of time. The thought of having my prostate removed and potentially not finding cancer in the final pathology really has me thinking. I guess that's why doctors/pathologists have mal-practice insurance.",

      "Content": "I just read an article entitled \"Melanoma Biopsy Results Can Differ, Worrying Patients\". The article talked about the difficulty in diagnosing skin biopsies for melanoma when it's not black and white. In the article, the patient, an MD, received two-polar opposite diagnoses. She got a third opinion from a world renown pathologiist who said it was an atypical lesion that is harmless but looks alot like melanoma. I have a close friend that was diagnosed as having bladder cancer which was misdiagnosed. it was scar tissue as a result of a complication from his prostatectomy. In my case, I was first diagnosed as Gleason 7 (3+4) in 1-core and Dr. Epstein (Hopkins) couldn't confirm that it was PCa. A third pathologist at MSK diagnosed it as Gleason 6 (3+3). A repeat biopsy was done and 1-core was diagnosed as Gleason 6 (3+3). All 3 pathologists agreed on the Gleason 6. I know that about 30% of PCa get upgraded after prostatectomies, however, I wonder what percentage of second pathology opinions get changed. I'm sure Dr. Epstein and Bostwick would have that information. Anyone know if this data has been published? Also, I'm surprised that insurance companies don't require a second pathology opinion before PCa treatment. Dr. Epstein charges $250. but the insurance companies pay him less.",

      "Content": "Ken, your are correct. I was considering not having any more biopsy's (and PSA tests). This was mainly due to the MSK nomogram for my \"numbers\" had a very low probability of me dying of prostate cancer after 10 and 15 years. Notwithstanding that, I changed my mind (for now), based on discussions with family and friends. Fairwind and ASAdvocate, because of my defibrillator, I can't have an MRI. Since my last 2 PSA's have been 2.5 and 2.9, respectively and it's been less than a year since my last TRUS biopsy, my urologist wants to use the PSA velocity to determine when to do the next biopsy. Tall Allen has been very helpful in providing information on the different types of biopsy's and blood tests. My urologist still wants to use PSA as the trigger, rather than PHI, etc. In spite of the new AUA guidelines, my urologist still believes that treatment should be done, however, he knows that it's my decision and he's okay with it. Last year, I had a consult with an AS doctor at MSK. Their protocol is to repeat the biopsy every 2-3 years. I may decide to switch doctors although MSK is almost 2 hours away. As far as the genomic tests, in both biopsy's there wasn't enough tissue remaining to do a Polaris test.",

      "Content": "Based on my repeat biopsy, I have 1 or 2 cores that are Gleason 6 (3+3) less than 5% of the tissue. I hope to have Dr. Epstein's \"second opinion\" report by the end of the week. Assuming that Dr. Epstein confirms the Gleason (3+3), I will try active surveillance. The reason I say try is because, I need to override the psychological stress of knowing that I have low-grade cancer that is not going away. I will try meditation and thanks to \"Tall Allen\" Mindfulness Based Stress Reduction. In a brief conversation with my urologist, he said his AS protocol is to repeat the PSA every 6 months and repeat the biopsy yearly. I can't have an MRI because of my defibrillator. I know that color doppler ultrasound is a diagnostic tool, however, I would have to travel to California for that. I am also aware that Transperinial Mapping Biopsy is also an option, however, I understand that's done under general anesthesia and I'm not too excited about having my prostate \"cut\" that many times. I know that John Hopkins has a very structured AS program and I believe Sloan Kettering does as well. What additional tests would be done in a structured AS program besides repeat PSA tests and biopsy's? What is the advantage of being in a structured program? Finally, is there a certain percentage increase in PSA or PSA velocity that would require a change in the AS protocol? I live in NJ and am much closer to Sloan Kettering than I am to John Hopkins. Does anyone know if there are any structured AS programs in NJ? Thanks for your help. Mitch",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by HighlanderCFH There are other tests, such as free PSA, also a urine test, etc., which can be suggestive (but cannot replace a biopsy, of course) and perhaps complementary to the standard PSA test, annual biopsies, etc. There are probably a couple other tests as well. But I don't know if these tests are worth anything more than suggesting the possible presence of PC -- which is something that has already been identified through your biopsy. Also, you mentioned in your post about having just 3+3, but your signature indicates that it is 3+4? That could make a difference regarding AS. Standard protocol would have ruled AS out in the past, but some modern philosophies sometimes include 3+4 as being qualified for AS. Fortunately, your relatively \"low\" PSA readings do suggest low risk (G6) disease, although this is not always true. I tried to modify my signature to reflect the second biopsy results but it didn't save it. The second biopsy was done on July 29. Right lateral mid was a Gleason 6 (3+3) less than 5% of the tissue. Left base was atypical. All the other cores were benign including the additional cores taken around the areas of concern in the first biopsy.",

      "Content": "ASA, thanks for the reference article from Dr. Epstein. I guess a percentage of the 16% that get downgraded are downgraded from a Gleason 6 to benign. In these cases, I'd want to think the pathologist was negligent in his original diagnosis, although I doubt this could be proven. Being cynical, I guess there are pathologists \"for hire\" that would testify. I've learned that PCa diagnosis is not an exact science. In fact, medicine is not an exact science. I asked my urologist why he didn't request a second opinion after the pathologist report said Gleason 7 (3+4) in 1 core - less than 5%. He told me he's worked with the same pathologist for many and he trusts him. I wonder if he would have requested a second opinion if he had the exact same diagnosis as I did. In any case, thanks to this forum and others, I learned of Dr. Epstein and I'm now on AS.",

      "Content": "Ken, your are correct. I was considering not having any more biopsy's (and PSA tests). This was mainly due to the MSK nomogram for my \"numbers\" had a very low probability of me dying of prostate cancer after 10 and 15 years. Notwithstanding that, I changed my mind (for now), based on discussions with family and friends. Fairwind and ASAdvocate, because of my defibrillator, I can't have an MRI. Since my last 2 PSA's have been 2.5 and 2.9, respectively and it's been less than a year since my last TRUS biopsy, my urologist wants to use the PSA velocity to determine when to do the next biopsy. Tall Allen has been very helpful in providing information on the different types of biopsy's and blood tests. My urologist still wants to use PSA as the trigger, rather than PHI, etc. In spite of the new AUA guidelines, my urologist still believes that treatment should be done, however, he knows that it's my decision and he's okay with it. Last year, I had a consult with an AS doctor at MSK. Their protocol is to repeat the biopsy every 2-3 years. I may decide to switch doctors although MSK is almost 2 hours away. As far as the genomic tests, in both biopsy's there wasn't enough tissue remaining to do a Polaris test.",

      "Content": "Based on a doubling of my PSA from 2.1 to 4 in about 2 years, my urologist did a biopsy on May 27. On June 8, I learned I had PCa with Gleason 7 (3+4) in 1 core. I had a consult with a more experienced urologist and told him I want to send the slides to Dr. Epstein for a second opinion. He thought that was an excellent idea. Dr. Epstein's report said although atypical and highly suspicious for cancer, he couldn't establish a definitive diagnose. He suggested a repeat biopsy. The biopsy was repeated on July 29 by my regular urologist. A few days ago, he told me there are 2 cores that are atypical - not cancer, however, the pathologist was waiting for a second opinion from from Dr. Victor Reuter, Vice Chairman, Department of Pathology at Sloan Kettering. I received Dr. Reuter's report yesterday and it says there are 2 cores that are Gleason 6 (3+3). The pathologist only sent Dr. Reuter the \"atypical\" slides, which are in different areas of the prostate than the Gleason 7 from the first biopsy (as diagnosed by the local pathologist). The repeat biopsy samples taken from the area of the first \"Gleason 7\" diagnosis were benign (according to the pathologist's report). In Dr. Reuter's report, he says he doesn't fault anyone for calling these cores atypical, however, he is confident calling them malignant based on\u0085\u0085......., which supports his diagnosis. He also said \u0093In this day and age, treatment is likely not to differ, at least at his institution.\" I told my doctor that I will be sending the slides to Dr. Epstein for a \"third\" opinion. He emphasized that I have cancer. Notwithstanding this, I want to see what Dr. Epstein says. My doctor says that I'm now a candidate for AS since my diagnosis is Gleason 6. When it was a Gleason 7 (3+4), he said I needed treatment. He also told me reading biopsy slides is not an exact science. That\u0092s pretty obvious. Because I have a defibrillator, I can't have an MRI. As a result, I don't know if AS makes sense for me. My doctor said the AS protocol is to have a PSA test every 6 months and repeat the biopsy yearly. If I decide on AS, I may look for a more structured program, rather than stay with my doctor. With regard to AS, does anyone know how many people eventually have treatments and over what period of time? If there's a high probability that I will need treatment in 5 years, I would be concerned that my body may not be as strong to handle treatment than it is today. Additionally because I struggle with depression and anxiety, I'm not sure I can handle AS. For much of my adult life, I've been on medication for depression and anxiety. This emotional roller coaster is very stressful. When someone tells me that I won't die of prostate cancer, it's based on statistics. As Ben Franlin said, \"In this world nothing can be said to be certain, except death and taxes.\" Thanks for your continued help. Mitch",

      "Content": "Hi Paul, Otago suggested that you read the thread that I started on Pathologist Report. After my biopsy, one core was Gleason 7 (3+4) in less than 5% of the tissue. I was in the process of scheduling surgery when I sent the slides to Jonathon Epstein of John Hopkins for a second opinion. His report said \"highly suspicious for carcinoma\". Epstein's report also said: \"Although these findings are highly atypical and suspicious for adenocarcinoma, there is insufficient cytologic and/or architectural atypia to establish a definitive diagnosis. Follow up is warranted with serum or urine tests, imaging and, in some cases, repeat biopsy with relative increased sampling of the atypical site may be recommended.\" Had I gotten his report first, I would have been concerned, but never would have considered surgery. I would have been on AS. I struggle to understand why second opinion biopsy's aren't routinely requested. The urologist who would have done the surgery asked me an interesting question before I received the results from Epstein. He asked how would I feel if after surgery, the prostrate biopsy came our negative for cancer. I think he asked me the question because he really wanted me to do AS. Based on my psyche, I couldn't do that knowing that I have Gleason 7 (3+4). In any case, I now feel like I have a new life. I wonder how many people have surgery and the pathology doesn't confirm cancer. That's scary. The people on this forum are great. The decision to treat or not treat is a personal decision. Mitch",

      "Content": "Two days ago, I learned that I have prostate cancer. My urologist gave me some literature to review and I will be meeting with him next week to discuss the treatment alternatives. This support group is excellent and I thank you in advance for your help. With regard to the pathology report, I asked my doctor if I should get a second opinion on the pathology and he said it's up to me. He told me the pathologist who read the slides is excellent. The core sample from the right lateral apex is \"prostatic adenocarcinoma, Gleason score 7 (3+4) (Grade Group 1 of 5), involving one of two fragments, less than 5% of the tissue\". The new prostate cancer group grading system (see below) says Grade Group 1 is for a Gleason score of 6. My Gleason score is 7 (3+4) and I think it should be a Grade Group 2, not Grade Group 1 - as the pathology report states. If the pathologist is wrong, do you think I should question his overall diagnosis and tell my doctor that I want another pathologist to review the slides? If it wasn't for this, I probably wouldn't ask for it. Am I overreacting? It's my understanding that the Grade Group system is pretty new. The new grading system is: Grade Group 1 (Gleason score \u00036) Only individual, discrete, well-formed glands Grade Group 2 (Gleason score 3 + 4 = 7) Predominantly well-formed glands with a lesser component of poorly formed/fused/ cribriform glands Grade Group 3 (Gleason score 4 + 3 = 7) Predominantly poorly formed/fused/cribriform glands with a lesser component of wellformed glands Grade Group 4 (Gleason score Only poorly formed/fused/cribriform glands or Predominantly well-formed glands with a lesser component lacking glands or Predominantly lacking glands with a lesser component of well-formed glands Grade Group 5 (Gleason scores 9\u009610) Lacks gland formation/necrosis with or without poorly formed/fused/cribriform glands",

      "Content": "Thank you for your input. There is a tremendous amount of information on this forum and it will certainly prepare me for my meeting with my urologist next week. Are there clear guidelines regarding active surveillance? I've read some literature saying that the Gleason score should be under 6 and others saying that the Gleason score of 7 (3+4) is also acceptable. I believe the rest of my pathology report fall within the AS guidelines. As seen below, my pathology report found a Prostatic adenocarcinoma in the Right lateral apex with a Gleason score 7 (3+4) involving one of two fragments, less than 5% of the tissue. Also, are there similar guidelines for Cyberknife? With all the treatment options available and potential differing opinions of doctors, this will be a very difficult decision for me. By the way, I had a heart attack 9 years ago. I have 2 stents. Three weeks later, my heart went into fibrillation and a difibrallator was implanted. Haven't needed any \"therapy\" from the defibrillator and today, my heart function is very good. Having the defibrillator precludes me from ever having an MRI. The MRI would cause the defibrillator leads to heat up and damage my heart. Besides having my gall bladder removed 4 years ago, I am in pretty good health - except for the newly diagnosed prostate cancer. Mitch",

      "Content": "Hi Paul, Otago suggested that you read the thread that I started on Pathologist Report. After my biopsy, one core was Gleason 7 (3+4) in less than 5% of the tissue. I was in the process of scheduling surgery when I sent the slides to Jonathon Epstein of John Hopkins for a second opinion. His report said \"highly suspicious for carcinoma\". Epstein's report also said: \"Although these findings are highly atypical and suspicious for adenocarcinoma, there is insufficient cytologic and/or architectural atypia to establish a definitive diagnosis. Follow up is warranted with serum or urine tests, imaging and, in some cases, repeat biopsy with relative increased sampling of the atypical site may be recommended.\" Had I gotten his report first, I would have been concerned, but never would have considered surgery. I would have been on AS. I struggle to understand why second opinion biopsy's aren't routinely requested. The urologist who would have done the surgery asked me an interesting question before I received the results from Epstein. He asked how would I feel if after surgery, the prostrate biopsy came our negative for cancer. I think he asked me the question because he really wanted me to do AS. Based on my psyche, I couldn't do that knowing that I have Gleason 7 (3+4). In any case, I now feel like I have a new life. I wonder how many people have surgery and the pathology doesn't confirm cancer. That's scary. The people on this forum are great. The decision to treat or not treat is a personal decision. Mitch",
