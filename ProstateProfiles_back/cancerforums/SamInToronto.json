      "Content": "Like many of the recent (and not so recent) members of this forum, I was recently (last week) diagnosed with PCa and have yet to figure out what to do about it. I had a bone scan two days ago and will be meeting with the urologist at the end of the month to discuss options. When I learned of the cancer (3+4), I soft-peddaled it to my wife (\"a few cancerous cells, more tests needed\") and I was disappointed when she seemed to not be overly concerned. Really, I had down-played it a lot and she did not even understand that they had found cancer, only that there was a problem to monitor. But she seems a bit more worried after I explained to her that it really is cancer, although the good news was it appears to be non-agressive form at this point and treatable. But now I wonder, who to discuss it with. Of course, I am preoccupied with the issue, but I have not told anybody else. I am not sure why - perhaps I don't want to think of it as something so serious that I need to get others concerned. I also have a fear of being treated differently. I think I also have a fear of not being treated differently. I have family and friends who are doctors and I am sure that they would have insight. Thoughts?",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by HighlanderCFH I agree woth Otago. The standard, accepted prerequisite for AS is to have no more than 3 positive cores, less than 50% involvement in each core and no higher than a Gleason 6. In this regard, you would not qualify for AS. Also, if I'm reading your biopsy report correctly, it would seem that you have at least 8 positive cores? This raises red flags everywhere and, if there are that many positive cores, you absolutely should NOT consider AS. That would be playing games with your life. Treatment of some type is probably very important. Another troubling aspect is that they originally diagnosed a Gleason 7. Was it the same lab that downgraded it? I would feel more comfortable in having your original slides read by a very reliable, second lab just to be certain. Until then, I would not waste too much time in making a decision among your treatment options. You probably have many questions -- and we're always here and very happy to give you whatever information we can. Good luck! Chuck Thank you all (Flkjr, Otago, Highlander and ddayglo) for feedback. I have been reading this forum for a few months now and know that you know what you are talking about, so your advice is much appreciated. I just went for a PSA test today - if, contrary to what I am expecting, it is lower than the last reading or not much higher, then maybe I might wait, but I have a feeling I will not be postponing things.",
