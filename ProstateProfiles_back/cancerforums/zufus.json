      "Content": "There is a PCRI video out with Dr. Kwon and other docs, he is a urologist by trade but also super informed as an oncologist type and a cutting edge guy. He is running the C-11 Choline PET scan which is showing way superior imaging compared to CT or Bone or MRI type scannings. The other great new scanning method is in Arizona and is C-11 acetate type scanning and also Dr. Bravo in Florida using a very good scanning method and Dr. Dattoli referring many patients to him for imagings. Example: one man tried other scans to find recurrent PCa without results, went to Sand Lakes Imaging (Dr. Bravo) they found 2 lymnodes envolved and he got them treated thereafter....I don't his updated story....but might have a huge difference in his case as to control or possible cure situation (that term is evasive in any cancers...appearing cured is probably the better terminology). The scan in Arizona is not yet insurance approved and my friend went there recently and it did find an area of mets not found otherwise, cost him approx. $3200-3500 he paid in cash. Dr. Kwon has a couple of youtube videos and one is about the C-11 PET scan, so check it out. He is also very funny a great speaker, very understanding and not seemingly an anxious urologist (aka prostate snatcher type-lol). I thought he is great in that video, I wish he were local in my state.....he is wise in oncology of the disease, I think he is a rising star of PCa. Also, there may be value in getting a CTC (circulating tumor cells test on PCa) it might reveal via blood count information as to how pervasive the disease is and with baseline could be useful towards what kind of progression one may have. Nothing is total perfection in PCa that I know of, just improvements in imagings, some testing, some pathology options (molecular and genetic testings from a few experts).",

      "Content": "There are some drug options to counter side effects of LHRH drugs......megace, megestrol, cyproterone acetate, soy?, gabapentin, zoloft, effexor (37.5 mg by Dr. Yu recommendations). Also, estradiol patch or any estrogen drug also counters side effects especially hot flashes/sweats and assists bone density and memory (not many are totally aware of such or ever offered such options), some guys are now getting this Rx in conjunction with LHRH drugs and know the differences first hand. One would have to find an open minded doc and demand a patch added. All you likely need is around 1 patch .1 mg (some are 7 day patches), they also come in lower doseages, but .1 mg is not that much anyway for transdermal patch. Estradiol gels, DES or emcyt would also cancell side effects and help cause some apoptosis on PCa cells (as in Journal article from 2003 in Journal of Urology Nov. issue). I had Lupron in me and switched to DES 1-mg., it cancelled the nasty side effects within about 7 days and was a god send for me.",

      "Content": "I used to come to this board alot back a few years ago under a different name maybe neutrondbob I used. I am still fighting this dragon since 2002 with high stats and very high risk scenario, but right now not talking about me. I am in a prostate cancer group with a friend Doug whom has been dealing with PCa since surgery in 2004, he had inflated psa back in 1995 hindsight, he was a friend of Harry Pinchot and helped Harry with some questions before the PCRI oncologist panel (videos) years ago. Harry told him to learn all your can, hopefully more than the doctor treating you and become your own advocate....that was great advice from Harry the award winning PCa advocate award guy from years ago. Well Doug has studied the ever living blank out of this for years and attended many PCRI conferences. He was a Gleason 9 and failed surgery and failed SRT, then failed on different HT therapies that he would select and sequence on his own intitiatives (using different docs too). Even though failing on Lupron but with monitoring he almost never let his psa exceed 2.0 before switching protocols. Even with doubling times in low numbers in the last 2 years or so, he managed to keep it low, the highest was 2.33 and then he contemplated a protocol that he thought would work. He did this protocol just recently and the results are kind of austounding for a patient in this type of scenario. Short story now his psa went from 2.33 to .007 (ultra sensitive measured). The story is posted at the yananow website and on their forum I have this same type of message with the link within provided to read his digest info at yananow. The protocol is explained and is not wild and used some standard PCa drugs we have or can use. I have just started this same protocol but have much high psa level and it may or may not work in my case, will know within a month, via psa the blood markers. Not sure I can post the link to Doug's yananow herein just yet but will come back and attempt it in a reply.",

      "Content": "The study has great arguements as to possible various flaws, not to mention the bias and or agenda or ommissions of drug therapies not included, not offered, not endorse or recognized by most of the system. Then to consider quality of life, bone destruction or losses (LHRH especially) and memory losses and ED, weight issues and cardiac related risks, etc. If one gains a few months by continuous, you may have to weigh all these factors for yourself. Alot of money is being made off patients and the system doesn't endorse-offer or mention all your possible choices for drug therapies. I have done many and gone outside the norm and even fired my loving uro-doc, who's plan was Lupron for life. Question everything and maybe some of you others will have the moxy to challenge the status quo and find other docs that will let you use alternative drugs or less mentioned drugs. Example: I got 2 yrs. of control with ADT3 (2002-2004) and then it showed early signs of psa failure(rises), switched to the DES 1-mg drug (lol- yeah the one that is supposed to cause blood clots and kill you) and got 8 yrs. of lower psa's and great control, like no side effects and costs almost nothing. Now recently that has failed me, so I switched to about 4 different choices of drug protocols just this year. I didn't get any good responses and had psa rises with most of these new concepts, I even tried the expensive protocol of: Leukine+Keto+Estradiol patch (Dr. Myers says it works in 70-80% of hrpca high risk patients), well it didn't work in my case. So, recently I tried another protocol of my own choosing (I love my onco-doc with an open mind), I did get a reduction in psa and within a guaranteed rising scenario (aka- real results). Funny how it was with very cheap drugs, may work for awhile or may not (at my 11 year juncture with hrpca scenario finding anything that works is difficult). Here is what currently is working: casodex 100 mg+DES 2-mg (coumadin added for safety 2-2.5 mg). Generic casodex (if you get it from Canada like under .70 per pill), DES 1-mg costs me $130 a year including delivery charges (-:}, so this low priced protocol is showing results right now, the Leukine therapy which can be a useful choice didn't do anything for me and Leukine injections can run $400-500 each, one guy in my local support group got 4+ years of results (cost per year was around $70,000 and insurance covered his useage). I am showing this, just to prove some points or why things should be questioned or why patients may be getting the financial shaft. Friend of mine with early hrpca scenario came up with his own protocol idea, he failed Lupron, estradiol and other drugs already. He did Lupron (just to lower his T level)+ Dexamethasone+ estradiol patch and his results were astounding: psa was over 2.0 and within a few weeks on this concept his psa was .007 (ultrasensitive psa done). I also tried this protocol and it did not work, however 3 out of 5 people doing this already did have tangible lowered psa's in an otherwise rising scenario. Doug believes that it will work best in patients with somewhat low psa thresholds even with slight hprca. Note the Dexamethasone seems to have 2 pathways to effect your DHT level, Dougs T level was <2.5 and got a DHT test and it was <5.0 (normal is 119-719 range), so he cut off almost all T and DHT fueling sources for PCa....thus a new psa off .007 (this is pioneering by a guy whom studies this stuff plenty-Doug that is). We also have some guys on forums whom are doing very well using estradiol patches or someother drug ideas. The future may hold that estradiol custom doseaged made patches might be coming, you can right now get a customized compounded estradiol gel to try and Doug has done so already and tried it last year, although he believes his calculation for doseage was incorrect, he may revisit using this concept. (more pioneering, which I love to witness such stuff). Hope we get more choices and answers and not dictated to as to what you 'have to do'.",

      "Content": "It is referred to as super casodex as it binds to the AR receptor maybe 6+ times better than casodex and thus may work better or longer is the concept, Dr. Sawyers was co-inventor his other new one coming is ARN-509 a similar new casodex and might even work better, in trials now. There are some guys on Healingwell website doing this drug and another website PPML, some guys have had either no great success (fewer in numbers of course), some reported some nasty side effects, others said very tolerable and got results too. So it looks like it varies and even casodex users it varies as to your own side effect levels. Like most PCa drugs, one has to try it to know the variables: does it work in your case, how long does it work, how tolerable are side effects, how long does it take to show it is working (is another consideration). Side effects similar to casodex are listed as timeshifter shows and mentioned. I would guess the same countering effects drugs used on casodex might work on this one: thus megace. megestrol, cytproterone acetate, soy products?, zoloft, effexor (37.5 mg), gabapentin and last but not least estrogen patch may counter side effects. Most guys just tolerate them or take some other common drugs they can get an Rx for on this.",

      "Content": "My doc has a patient whom has been with him around 10 years now, said that he has no treatments and no HT drug therapies. So.........? His psa has been hovering at 250 ng/ml level for all these years, without much movement and without apparently nasty huge mets going on. Sure, he could very likely have micro mets or unknown mets and no bone pains. I guess this guy decided that he wanted his quality of life over whatever treatments and is obstainate. Anyway if anyone has further elaboration or has seen something like this in another patient, do tell. At low levels of psa and say fairly contained disease I admit something this is perhaps even somewhat common, without any treatments. But, at a psa of around 250 just have seen nothing like this. Dr. Fred Lee's success story is one I am very aware of an incureable PCa patient himself, still alive and now 33+ years since failed first treatment. It appears the drug emcyt was his huge salvation, which is very interesting and he avoided LHRH and casodex drugs (hhhmmmmm.....a doc avoiding those drugs)",

      "Content": "Although there is controversies on useages of any estrogenic drugs, there is a slow increase happening in awareness and even Rx's bening written by doctors because of informed and demanding patients, maybe even costs or other considerations. The oldest PCa control drug is DES (estrogen capsules) and even though was remarkably useful, back in those early days they over prescribed doseages and never screened anyone as to blood clotting risk (today INR Pro-Time) blood test for screenings. Estradiol patches and gels is what I am mentioning herein, even though I used DES 1-mg for 8+ with excellence results and control during that time frame even with hrpca and high risk scenario. First of all estradiols in skin patches (transdermal) or now even gels (even custom compounded doseage gels is possible), are very useful options and especially in tandeum with using Lupron or casodex (perhaps), when used with LHRH drugs like Lupron, Zoladex, Precisis, Trelstar etc., it will curtail some of those nasty side effects of hot flashes and sweats and aches and pains. A huge plus on using patches is also, because of its biological mechanisms it builds bone density and memory assisted....of which is robbed from you with LHRH drugs (so in conjunction is great insurance for that). Not super expensive either and basically no huge side effects, the exception would be possible breast enlarement (can happen also with casodex and other drugs too). You can take an additional drug (fermara) or others to help stop enlargement or get a minor breast radiation protocol to stop it from happening (it usually works), it can be done with electron rays in 1-4 sessions depending upon your radiologist. (I got it done in one session with electron rays). Dr. Premoli in Argentina used estradiol patches almost exclusively as main treatment therapy, perhaps cause without insurance whom can easily pay for Lupron in their country. He has excellent results and no patients with dvt's or blood clots, last I heard about. So estrogenics usually used as second line options when people fail on LHRH or casodex could be used otherwise. The reason is is useful in second line therapy is it actually can cause apoptosis on PCa cells (direct cell death) whereas with other drugs I don't know that that happens (perhaps dormancy), plus journal article on such said it can work on hrpca cells (perhaps not to perfection of all of them or stem cells???). I was failing ADT3 drugs, went to DES and got longer term control and excellence in results for many years and no side effects and have excellent bone density. The negatives of estradiol patches and gels are these: some believe the risk of useage is high (but it is not) almost unheard of to get blood clots or dvt's and especially with screening done properly. Patches are hard to know what doseage should be used, so docs have no simplistic guidelines, Dr. Myers had some people on patches using 8-12 patches (that's a lot of them) they come in various doseages and the high dose is .1 mg (7 day patches available), you may need to wear 3-5 or more to get the response doseage for your own case, it varies. But, for useage in conjunction with Lupron or other drugs in combo, you may only need to wear one .1 mg or maybe less or maybe .2 level....to obtain control over hot flashes and get some benefits of useage as to bone and memory assistance, too. So, since docs don't know easily what doseage to give you, it is problematic and would need psa monitoring often so as to try and adjust doseage for best results. My friend Doug did this on his own and figured out his doseage level. Now patches have one other issue and that is sticking well on your body, they vary in sizes, shapes and taking a shower can decrease sticking power. I think in the future they will be able to make a customized doseage patch, which would be perfect....wear one patch and that's it. Now estradiol gels you can spread on your skin is another option along the same lines, problem is what doseage level works for your PCa? Probably a huge unknown by docs right now, just assumed doseage levels....but with proper monitoring and trying it out one might be able to figure out doseage level. My friend Doug found a compounding pharmacy that can customize a doseage level for the patient. I believe this is going to become an option more used a few years from now. This would trump using patches for being more simplistic and quickly absorbed by your skin. Right now using estradiol patch with Lupron or HT drugs to assist lowering side effects and gain bone density or help save memory is the huge benefit of its useage. Those having got these Rx's and atest to the cancelling of side effects, I had Lupron in my system when switching to estrogenic DES, cancelled the hot flashes and sweats within like 7 days or so and was fantastic to witness that. In case you didn't know you have some estrogen in your body to begin with and estradiol blood tests can be done. Just like T levels can be checked and monitored especially while using LHRH drugs. Also one can test for DHT blood levels (the converted T into DHT the most potent fuel on PCa 6-10 times more so than normal T is what they say). A low DHT level is usually consistent with good PCa control, just like low T level also. Hope this somewhat useful for someone to know and read, I am just another layperson on this and not any kind of expert, just sharing what I have witnessed, done and seemed to find on this, at this juncture.",

      "Content": "Background, my friend Doug is very well versed in PCa issues, going way back he helped Harry Pinchot draft questions to the PCRI conference, for the panel questions from laypersons and became a friend of Harry's. He had RP in 2004 and failed, had SRT no long after and failed it, he was a Gleason 9 patient too. He went on to HT therapies, and started failing on various ones he tried, but he did sequence and switch protocols so as to keep psa's no higher than 2.3 (max). His protocol was this: Lupron (which he was failing on 1-2 yrs. prior)+ Dexamethasone 1 mg + Estradiol patch .1 mg his psa went from near 2.0 prior to .007 (ultra sensitive). He also switched to Prednisone thereafter to prove a point that Dexa has an effect on DHT that Pred. does not, and psa rose on 7 mg of Pred. which equals 1 mg of Dexa. Then he went back to his protocol but with this change: (no Lupron- worn off) so using: Dexa 1 mg+ Estradiol patches (4) of the .1 mg patches and psa was even lowered to .004 recently. I tried this and it failed for me, but I have very high risk disease and into yr. 11 of drug protocols. Here is the results on the 5 of us patients trying this: : Update on Doug's protocol phase II and psa at .004 (w/o lupron added) Here is some initial results in 5 men whom tried this, including myself and it did not work in my case, but that did not surprise me with my scenario, stats, and being 11 yrs. into PCa with high risk stats from 2002. Still a lot of questions about this protocol but evidence exists that something is here to be studied and noted: THERE ARE 5 PCa PATIENTS THAT HAVE TRIED DEXAMETHASONE+(with Lupron & Estradiol patch) 1. PSA BELOW 2 ng/ml\u0085\u0085\u0085\u0085 WENT DOWN TO 0.004 UNDETECTABLE * 2. PSA BELOW 8 ng/ml\u0085\u0085\u0085\u0085 WENT DOWN TO 3.2-- \u0093NOW 1,7\u0094---ATLANTA GA. 3. PSA BELOW 17 ng/ml\u0085\u0085\u0085\u0085WENT DOWN TO 14.6 THEN UP TO 19 * 4. PSA BELOW 19 ng/ml\u0085\u0085\u0085\u0085WENT DOWN TO 14.4-- NOW 8.1 ---ENGLAND *** PSA BELOW 25 ng/ml\u0085\u0085\u0085\u0085WENT UP TO THE MID 30\u0092s *(Doug's prior psa with Lupron+Dexa.+estradiol was .007.....next time was with No Lupron but with Dexamethasone 1 mg+ Estradiol patches (4) .1mg each=.4 mg) and psa was .004 now. Note: does not seem to work with Prednisone substituted even if equaled dosage value at 7 mg of Pred., tested that theory and psa went up during that experiment that Doug proved on himself. No side effects on Dexa that I could detect and estradiol patches are actually very safe and maybe get tender nipples at worst, so this is very doable. There is something to this self clinical trial. Not expense either, Dexa is super cheap too. I love it when alternative protocols show any results, just shows how much PCa is full of unknowns.",

      "Content": "I am with Fairwind on reading Walsh's and others books and more information, because your decisions coming are huge and will be a one way trip....no monday morning quarterbacking will be possible. I hate to point out some negatives on PCa as generalities but they are part of your equation as to your best decision or understanding the future of this dragon disease: 1) pathology is subjective and expert opinions are the best possible analyzes you will likely get and it is even imperfect (I will explain next) 2) you can have alot of missed biopsy areas (needle in the haystack concept), those missed biopsies 'could' harbor different Gleason scorings, even different variant type(s) of PCa (although is rarer to happen) 3) you could have PCa cells escape via PNI within movement from the gland to lymph/blood system and easily go unknown (missed by biopsies or found by biopsies) 4) you could have a much higher DNA ploidy on your PCa cell structures which is a risk factor (this can be tested via pathologies easily), you want 'diploid' DNA cell structures and not random chaos DNA 5) you or your doc should run nomograms and partin tables to see what are your odds for successful surgery (curative???) and add that to your decision process or know how lucky you might have to become 6) realize that even if you fail surgery and go to SRT radiation salvage therapy, it is still a huge gamble and might be less than 50/50 flip of a coin (newer scannings are best C-11 & Choline PET) for lympnodes etc. 7) look at all treatments, look ahead at even drug control therapies and consider your strategies like playing a chess game, one can sequence drug therapies for better control of escalation of PSA....although that statement is highly controversial I have seen evidence in my own case and especially a friend of mines case with Gleason 9 whom failed LRRP and SRT and some HT therapies, whom via his own advocacy and use of docs has many times switched to different drugs to confuse (per se) the PCa and keep psa under 2.33 (LRRP in 2004), he just recently had doubling times in weeks/month although from 1.0 to 2.33 or so....he found a protocol that he came up with that is based upon using Lupron (even though he failed psa using it before)+ estradiol patch+Dexamethasone and his new psa became .007 (rather huge from 2.33 level). He found that using Lupron to get T level low and estradiol also to get T level low (his T was 1.0 that is low-low), he even had DHT tested an it was 2.5< (super low), the reason for the low DHT he stated from his studying the heck out of Dexamethasone, was that Dex. seems to have 2 pathways to effect DHT (if you have low T like maybe below 30 level), he tested prednisone and it does not have this same effect, so although in the same drug family not the same results. (this is an interesting concept for others within similar scenarios, how long it works is always your next question with PCa). This adds to the adage that we are still practicing medicine when it comes to PCa and the disease is unique to each patient and not a singlar one size fits all thing. Hope your thought out decision process is the best for your situation.",

      "Content": "I am returning to this forum after being away a while now, forgot my password and could not access.....so my new namesake is herein is zufus which is what I use on another well known PCa forum. I have recently moved onto some other drug therapies but results of being a high patient since day one in 2002 April is pretty good, considering it all. 2002-2004 ADT3 prior to radiations like Bolla studies (unique radiations neutron 10 sessions, photon IMRT 24 sessions thereafter), failing ADT3 control in late 2004 2005-2012 used DES 1mg with coumadin blood thinner (lol cost for DES was $130 per year, no patents)....lowered psa and stabilized it most all these many years (8+) 2012- starting to fail psa conrol with DES 1mg, escalating over time now, so switched to various protocols using various drugs and got some temporary results, starting more protocols 2013 and switched on them, currently a new unique protocol will have results in about one month or so. I had a reaction trying Leukine+Keto+estradiol patch that is mentioned in a video by Dr. Myers, that some patient can have this nasty reaction (more rare), so I had to drop this protocol and checked psa prior with short term useage of Keto and it didn't seem to do much on psa, even with High Dose. Did get some slowing of doubling time going back to casodex+proscar+estradiol patch. Now onto another protocol I call it Doug's protocol, mentioned at yananow forum board and a new thread I mentioned some of it herein. Will see how that pans out soon enough.",

Dr. Bahn is near there too, he is an expert with color doppler ultra sound and focal cryo which could be used in some unique recurrent situations or monitoroing of A.S./W.W. (watchful waiting types) as to is their progressions seen in color doppler useage. Someone else can advise you on others out that way. Good luck and be your own best advocate will help your decisions and choices.",
