    "Content": "You will not make a mistake by going with Loma Linda. They have 20+ years experience with proton beam therapy. You will do fine at any of the other proton beam installations, too, but all else being equal, I would go with experience. The physics of proton beam therapy is clearly superior to photon radiation and to surgery. In my opinion, radioactive seeds are a distant second to proton beam treatment. I was treated for prostate cancer at Loma Linda a year ago and had no side effects during the treatment or after. Go to sites such as YANA (you are not alone) and read the experiences of patients who were treated for prostate cancer. There are many horror stories for all types of prostate cancer treatment except for proton beam treatment. If you value not being impotent or incontinent, go with proton beams. Best Regards, Gary",
