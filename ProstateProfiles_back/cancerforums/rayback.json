      "Content": "ok guys just wanted to update you. Just came back from my urologist appointment. I was told after examination that my prostate is large for a man my age, and it was a bit painful to his touch. I'm thinking it's good news, but the specialist wouldn't say so yet. He said he's yet to see PC in a man my age with no family history. He asked me to do an MRI just to be sure, and prescribed me a stronger dose of antibiotics (Resprim Forte) for the next few days. My MRI is next Thursday morning, and I see the specialist again on Friday morning for the results. I really appreciate everyone's support on here. It's the only thing keeping me sane.",

      "Content": "hey guys....I'm 38 year old. Had blood test about 3 weeks ago and my PSA was at 7.4 which was worrisome. I was prescribed 2 weeks of antibitics during that period, but my PSA result came back today at 7.2 which is not exactly an improvement. My UTI tests were normal and I have no symptoms, should I be worried? Any ideas?",

      "Content": "Thanks guys for the quick response. Really appreciate it. I have a urologist appointment Monday morning for further investigation. What's worrying me is that I've got no signs of an enlarged or inflamed prostate, such as problems urinating. All seems to be in order. Is it possible that stress contributes to an inflamed prostate? The past six months have been highly stressful and still are. Thanks.",
