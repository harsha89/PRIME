      "Content": "Hello WW, So glad to hear your results with Xofigo. Coincidentally I started my 1st thread as a newbie . My husband had 1st Xofigo yesterday. My question...what are side effects and outcomes from this treatment. BTW I did post in the \"general forum\". How do I move or repost that to this prostate cancer forum? Thanks, Anniee (also a worried wife!) I will make a signature with husband's history.",
