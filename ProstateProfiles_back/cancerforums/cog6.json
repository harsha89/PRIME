      "Content": "Well, it's been 6 weeks now, wow does time fly (except those 1st 10 days with Mr foley). External Healing is going great. Scabs and tenderness are gone those I still have a little swelling at one site. Most of the sitting discomfort is now gone. While I know I am not totally healed, I feel really good. Based on recommendation of a fellow member, I have extended the stool softener with another 30 day supply. I will take it one week at time and stop when I feel it is the right time. Based on the definition of incontinence being loosing control of the bladder and not being able to stop it, I have not been incontinent. Having said that, I do feel incontinent based on not having any issues prior to surgery. My situation has not been bad and it already much improved since catheter removal a little over 4 weeks ago. I am currently doing a light pad in the morning, a heavy pad in the afternoon if I am working and still doing a diaper at night just for insurance. I am planning in eliminate the diaper and go to a pad at night this coming weekend. My weekly average leaking per day in ounces is as follows: 1st week: 6.35 2nd week: 4.81 3rd week: 2.43 4th week: 2.43 and am currently tracking for less than 2 in week 5. Week 3 and 4 ended up the same but that is due to alcohol consumption during the weekend during week 4. If I average the other 5 days that week, week 4 would have been around 2 ounces a day. I have the normal stress leakage and seem to leak if I reach for something the wrong way. Otherwise, I stay dry. Overall, very happy with the progress. I have been doing my kegels but I have dropped the number I do each day. ED is also coming along. While I still do not have a firm erection, I can get semi hard, kinda like a water balloon in firmness. Each week has brought a slight improvement. I expect full recovery within the next month. I guess time will tell. I am taking 1 50mg sildenafil daily. I credit my good progress on eating healthy, watching my weight and walking. I walked everyday the 2 months prior to surgery and still walk as much as possible. My positive attitude probably did not hurt either. Thanks again for all the great info and advice.",

      "Content": "Well, one week post surgery all is going very well for me. I can't say I am crazy about Mr Foley. No pain with it but sure is irritating to deal with. Mr Foley gets retired this Friday morning and yes I am counting the hours.... Have only a little tenderness at incision sites but really not bad at all. Never took any heavy weight pain pills, just some ibuprofen the first 5 days. I had a couple of bladder spasms in the hospital just after the operation but they went away fast and I have not needed to take any medicine for that. Taking the stool softeners daily. You sure don't want to forget them.... I get up hourly and walk around the house which greatly helps. All in all, sounds like all is going well and as expected based on all the excellent information on this forum. Finally, my hat is off to my surgeon at Fort Carson. Much respect for her. She never once suggested one course of action over another. She only provided information and referrals so I could make my own decision. Nice to work with a doctor not motivated by money, only a desire to help.",

      "Content": "I thought for the new members and those headed for surgery may an insight on my journey may assist them with their own journey. While everyone's journey is unique and personal to them, my case fits into the averages. This is my average leakage per day for each week and products I used during each week. May journey began mid January, 2018 after my catheter was removed Week 1 5.75 oz. Depends Flex Fit and heavy pads Week 2 4.76 oz. Depends Flex Fit and heavy pads Week 3 2.42 oz. Depends Flex Fit at night, mixture of heavy & shields daytime - Returned to work this week Week 4 2.42 oz. Depends Flex Fit at night, mostly shields daytime Week 5 1.23 oz. Depends Flex fit at night, shields during day Average 3 pads a day Week 6 .68 oz. Shields only 2 or 3 a day Week 7 .48 oz. Shields average of 2 pads a day Week 8 .31 oz. 1 shield a day at work, double under ware at home, totally dry at night from here Week 9 .32 oz 1 shield a day at work, double under ware at home Week 10 .18 oz. 1 shield a day at work, double under ware at home Week 11 .21 oz 1 shield a day at work, double under ware at home Week 12 .21 oz. 1 shield a day at work, double under ware at home Week 13 .15 oz. 1 shield a day at work, double under ware at home Week 14-18 Double under ware with shield just in case, shields mostly dry , no measurements taken Week 19-26 Double under ware only - 99% dry Week 20 + Back to normal, boxers only average 1 or 2 tiny weeks a week Double under ware was 1 pair of bikini briefs under boxers All in all, I am have been happy with my recovery. ED wise I am 95% back and can achieve erections without treatments most of the time I highly recommend measuring your progress because without having a way to compare. Measuring will show you the small weekly progress you can't feel yourself. May you find peace in your journey.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by Michael F Hi Cog6! The issue Moving forward is: Will your PSA Rise or remain Stable? The answer can only be determined by vigilant monitoring - just as you are doing. At this point, you have 2 data points. Consider the March & April PSAs as a single data point (because they were drawn within 6 weeks). It is good they are both the same = 0.10ng/ml. This is your baseline post RP PSA level against which all future PSAs will be compared. IMO, you should be checking your PSA every 3 months. So your next uPSA should be around the beginning of Oct. This will give you 3 data points and indicate if your PSA remains stable or is possibly rising. For this reason it is most important that you have your uPSAs drawn at The Same Lab and Analyzed by The Same uPSA Methodology Each Time! To confirm this, be sure to get a copy of the original Lab Report each time. This will contain the information on the uPSA Methodology. (IMO, do NOT monitor uPSA via a URO Office based analyzer.) A post RP PSA of 0.10ng/ml is now considered Biochemical Recurrence (BR) by most institutions. Your URO Surgeon does not feel that this is the case. Be sure to discuss the PSA level in your case that he/she will consider to be BR. If your next uPSA indicates a rise, then you need to be prepared to take action. Regardless, your URO Surgeon's job is done. IMO, you should now go ahead and consult with URO RO who is highly experienced in treating recurrent PCa. Good luck! May your uPSAs maintain a flat line! MF Hi MF Thanks for your response; Yes, tested at same clinic and same standards. Since most recommendations are to wait to you have two consecutive rises, I am waiting till my October reading. That will let me know where I am at that time. I have also read multiple times on this and other forums that readings of 0.10 and 0.11 are statistically the same number, I am not sure that a .01 rise in 3 months constitutes a real rise. If I do see a rise in October, then yes, I will take the next step. Thanks Again",

      "Content": "Hi All Recovery is coming along very well. Healing, at least outside, is going well. I am healed at the 4 small incisions and almost healed on the bigger one above the belly button. Internal pain in all but history, only a little discomfort sitting too long. Will complete my stool softener prescription end of this week. Incontinence is also still improving. Been doing daily measurements but working on weekly averages. Week 1 saw an average of 6.35 ounces a day. Week two saw an average of 4.75 ounces a day. I'm in the middle of week 3 but averaging under 3 ounces a day so far. Mostly dry at night. Still doing a diaper at night just in case. I am using 2 to 3 pads a day. Mostly doing 2 light pads for the first part of the day then doing a heavy pad in the afternoon when the leaking is worse. I am happy with the progress. I walk daily when possible and doing kegels morning and evenings. Weekends (When not at work) I do more kegels and hold my bladder as best I can to expand it. ED: well, this week is tracking like last week. Can get mostly there but not all the way yet. Not sure if the 50mg of Sildenafil is helping but I'm sure it is not hurting. Had my first after surgery orgasm. Pee everywhere but it did feel good. I have read that the pee orgasm will go away in time. Will be sure to empty bladder first next time. 4 weeks past and no regrets...",

      "Content": "Hi Anwank. I am almost 2 months post Da Vinci. While I am older, for me, just being able to talk, really talk to my wife about all aspects of the surgery and recovery has been a great comfort for me. He will be going through some really personal issues and being able to talk openly with you will help. Sharing my recovery, the improving continence issues and ED has really helped me deal with it all. Educating yourself and him is key to making good decisions like following this and other forums, and reading books. Start a list of questions to ask your doctor. You will not remember everything you want to ask without a list. Once I knew what I was going to do, I walked everyday for 10 weeks before the surgery and continue till this day. Learn to do kegals correctly (See the Mayo Clinic method) and do them starting now. Being in shape really helps. Good luck to both of you.",

      "Content": "Hi All: Had my Auximin scan last week and met with the RO today. Scan came back with a couple of issues but all called benign. It may have depicted some benign issue at the bladder neck. PSA is stable at .12 and RO recommends AS as the best course of action for now. He stated that we my favorable pathology report and stable PSA, no further treatments for now. He Stated that with my PSA history and pathology report, he does not feel that my cancer could have metastasized. I asked him if my PSA rises again, what should I use as a guide post to take further action. He said that to keep doing PSA tests. He indicated that he would not recommend Radiation or hormone treatments till my PSA would be closer to .2 like at .18. He also said that the scan we just did would provide a baseline for any future changes in my situation. He said to keep seeing my Urologist and to report any changes to him. I will continue quarterly PSA tests through the end of this year and follow the doctors recommendations from there. As to my recovery from surgery, I am totally continent and have been for a while. My ED situation is greatly improved at this point. I would say 98% back. I am able to obtain an erection with no meds and get the deed done. All in all, I am happy with my progress. I feel like I have two great doctors. Neither doctor has ever offered me anything except advise. Neither as ever had an agenda as to how to treat me. Thanks for all the comments and recommendations. I will report my results moving forward.",

      "Content": "Well, 3 weeks past my surgery and here is where I'm at: Pain: almost none to speak of, a minor discomfort sometimes sitting. Bowel movement can still be a little stressful (Keep taking Stool softeners). Healing very well, almost no pain at incision sites. Incontinence: 11 days since catheter removal. Seeing a small improvement this week over last. Still doing a diaper for insurance at night but mostly dry at night now. Using 3 pads a day but changing more for freshness than need. Averaging 20 to 25 milliliters per pad over 4 to 5 hours so not leaking to bad. Only have stress related leaks and leaks from time to time standing/walking or reaching for something. All in all I am happy with the progress. I did kegals 2 months before operation and resumed as soon as the catheter was removed. ED: Taking 25 mg Sildenafil daily for penile rehab. Have not had a solid erection yet but I am getting nocturnal erections of 80 to 90 % of normal so also very encouraging. Been back to work since two weeks post surgery and feel almost back to normal. I walked daily prior to surgery and walk as often as I can now when over 20 degrees. Been drinking green tee and pomegranate juice every day since I was diagnosed. Not sure if it helps but I am sure it does not hurt. Been getting all my recommended daily fruits and veggies and have removed most processed sugar and red meats from my diet though neither were big in my diet before. I also most say again that all my research I did on this site not only prepared me but brought a level of comfort through all this. Still very thankful I had the surgery especially in light of my pathology upgrade.",

      "Content": "Well, I am 2 months past RALP. Had my PSA read today and did not receive the news I wanted. PSA came back at .09. Since it is only 2 months, I am hoping that I will see a drop with my next PSA reading in 6 weeks. Doctor was a little surprised based on clear margins and clean LN's. She thinks that it will drop at the next reading. 2 months is a little early per most posts on this site. Continence is good, down to one shield a day, around 1/4 ounce leakage. Basically stress leaks only. No pad in the evening or at night. ED is also coming along very well. I am almost back to normal. Overall, very happy with my recovery.",

      "Content": "Hi All: Got my catheter out yesterday and that is nothing less than wonderful. Continence is better than I had hoped. No leaks while sitting and laying. I have random leaks while walking which I can stop by contracting my floor mussels and of course the normal stress leaks. Getting a good flow and volume when I go. Started taking 50mg Sildenafil yesterday for Penile Rehab but nothing but a dead stick for now (Totally expected but one can dream). My pathology report upgraded my PC to Gleason 7, 3 + 4 with 40 percent involvement. Margins and lymph nodes were clear. First PSA test six weeks out. No regrets and pleased with the outcome so far. The upgrading of my PC after surgery was just icing on the cake. Again, my hats off to my military Doctor at Fort Carson. She was nothing less than incredible.",

      "Content": "Two weeks out from surgery and a lot of what I have read here has come to pass. Healing very well, only mild discomfort. Only took ibuprofen for first 5 days. I take my stool softeners without fail. Also started sildenafil, 50 mg daily for rehab. Catheter came out last Friday (10 days). Incontinence has been not so bad. I only suffer from the normal stress related items, coughing, sneezing, farting. I also spurt every now and then when walking. Some nights dry, some nights not. I do encourage weighing your diapers, pads, etc. What you feel each day is not necessarily what is actually happening. I have had days that I felt were really bad but weighing shows me otherwise. Leaking 100-200 milliliters on average a day. On the ED front, have not had a woody yet but I am doing better each day. I can get semi hard but not enough to get the job done. All in all, encouraging. Went back to work yesterday but I have a desk job so no real stress with work. Happier at work than sitting home. Walking when I can (Colorado at 8500 feet) and do my kegels daily. Thank you all for showing me the path. Much comfort in the knowledge presented here.",
