      "Content": "Thank you Chuck and newporter for the support! I am leaning toward radical open prostatectomy in an attempt to meet aggression with aggression. The literature does not have a lot to say about Gleason scores 8 and above, and that is disturbing. I cannot have surgery until the 8 weeks after my biopsy, so that puts me into early January. Fingers are crossed. Thanks for separating the threads: I did not know how this really works. Tim",

      "Content": "Thank you Pratoman. I need encouraging words, as this is driving me crazy. It is possible that I am reading too much. Most of it sheds only a weak, fearful light on Gleason scores 8 and above. It is nice to hear some optimism from someone. My bone scan did find a small area on a left rib, but the radiologist said it is not typical of cancer, rather, it must be a previous injury (that I do not remember). Thanks, Tim",

      "Content": "I was diagnosed 2 weeks ago. With a history of rising PSA over the last 4 years, negative biopsy in July 2009, negative biopsy in June 2013, positive Biopsy November 17 2014, I am a wreck. I have consulted with a radiation oncologist and a surgeon (open type), and am leaning toward surgery. I want this gone, and surgery seems to be the most sure way to do that. Reading the posts here (I just started today) is very helpful. My stats: PSA 2009 2.1 negative biopsy PSA 2010 3.8 PSA 2011 4.0 PSA 2013 11 negative biopsy PSA 2014 24 positive biopsy 2 cores out of 12: One core 2% Gleason 4+4, second core 20% Gleason 4+4, both left lobe Bone scan negative, MRI of pelvis w/without contrast negative. Stage T1c Started Lupron one week ago (Nov 25, 2014) Any advice to help me get through this is appreciated! Thanks, Tim",
