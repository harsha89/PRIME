      "Content": "Thank you all for your your comments and kind support. After reading the comments I will stay positive and help my dad through this. I've also purchased the Pat Walsh book and look forward to gaining more insight into PC. One thing I forgot to mention is the biopsy report shows that he has chronic protastisis. Would that be a cause for the higher PSA number? We are still waiting for a confirmation on bone mets appt. Will be back to update you all soon... Please wish him luck that the bone scan comes back clear. Thanks Thanks",

      "Content": "Hi Everyone, I'm grateful to have stumbled across this website. It's nice to know that there are people out there that are here to support one another. My dad (71 y/o) was recently diagnosed with Stage 2 PC. We are all very devasted by the bad news. Now that the shock has settled in a bit, we know that we need to accept this unfortunate reality and help support my dad in getting healthy. Here are his results from the biopsy: PSA Dec 16 - 7.4 Gleason - 7 (3+4) Core needle biopsy x 8 Postive cores 3 on right side. Greatest Amount in each Core: 5mm Proportion of Positive Cores Involved by Tumour - 14% We're currently waiting for a bone scan appt. Is this a standard test that the Urologist would order? Based on the biopsy results, would this be considered a low or high risk stage and in your opinion, is it curable? We pray that the PC is localized and have not spread to the bones or other organs. I'm so scared. Your feedback and support is appreciated. Thanks",

      "Content": "Hi Everyone, We met with my dad's urologist today to go over treatment options. He's recommending surgery over radiation. My dad is overwhelmed with the options therefore will take time to make a decision. My dad's bone scan results came back clear of mets (thankfully!) but the doctor said that my dad had a broken rib in the past. My dad was completely unaware of this. Because of that comment from the uro, I've become very worried even though the bone scan came back normal and the urologist indicated that it was not related to my dad's PC. Has anyone experienced this? Also, my dad has been complaining about some pain in his lower to mid back and he's also extremely tired. Is this a common symptom of PC or could this be mets that wasn't caught on the bone scan. I'm so worried! Thanks for reading and providing your thoughts.",
