      "Content": "Hi, I was diagnosed with pc 9 years ago with a 4/3 Gleason with a tertiary 5 and had my prostate removed (Da Vinci). I went for my regular PSA checkups for a while. However, I put the PSA testing on hold while I addressed other health issues. So, after 5 years, I just got retested and my PSA was .9. I'm waiting to see the urologist so we can discuss options. If he recommends SRT, I'm not worried about that. What I am concerned about is should I be worried that I waited so long? Would the .9 be higher if it had spread? Does anyone have a similar situation? Thank in Advance, Glenn",
