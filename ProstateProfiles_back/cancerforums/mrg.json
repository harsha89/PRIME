      "Content": "My Urologist has recommended continuing with harmone shots (4 within 1 year); have been told on other forums by CK oncologists that these have no benefit after Cyber Knife radiation and cause a patient to undergo unnecessary side effects that can cause harm; one specific very reputable CK oncologist has participated in multiple studies and has the facts to back this up.",

      "Content": "Fairwind, The Dr. that performed the Cyber Knife treatments is the Medical Oncologist I presume; He informed me that I do not need to have an appointment with him for 6months. I plan to make an appointment with him prior to 6 months. What you have stated is exactly true regarding being given the first harmone shot one month the prior to the first Cyber Knife treatment. I am getting from what you have said I should not question the continued HT for the remaining 2 shots if I had a G8 on one of the biopsys. My Urologists said when I questioned him about the difference of opinions regarding continuing with harmones \"after\"CK was to try to minimize the production of testerone to the greatest degree. So I quess he is right and I should stop worrying about it and accept the side effects.",

      "Content": "Really appreciate your response and your PSA history; I am 71...4 of the 12 biopsys showed cancer...one with a Gleason score of 8. Urologist recommended Cyber Knife. Went through all of the tests to see if matastisis had started (PET scan and the works). No evidence of any spread at that time. Urologist said was so small that did not show up on any of the tests. Went through the 5 CK treatments . I feel also that sometimes money and profit does have an influence on recommending these shots. I will ask a medical oncologist for an opinion on these harmones.",
