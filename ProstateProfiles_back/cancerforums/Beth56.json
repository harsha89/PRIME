      "Content": "This is my understanding of what happens. During a Radical Prostatectomy the entire prostate and seminal vesicles are removed, therefore you will be unable to produce semen (the fluid that carries the sperm) following surgery. Your testicles will still make sperm cells but they will die and be reabsorbed back into your body. Something similar happens when you get a skin bruise. The blood is reabsorbed back into your body over time and the bruise disappears. Hope that helps. Also, to add, Replicant was correct in his post regarding Retrograde Ejaculation. I can't confirm the percentage of men this happens to, but I believe it has to do with a problem with the sphincter.",
