I guess our next step is to get a complete copy of the post-surgery path report and start putting together a game plan. I will return with the report once I can correctly answer some of the questions posed above. Thanks again",

      "Content": "Hi Everyone, I am very thankful for this forum and for the participating members. My dad had a radical prostatectomy about six months ago after his cancer diagnosis. He is 68 years old and in otherwise excellent health. Upon diagnosis, his PSA was 6.5 and his Gleason was 7. 12 cores were taken and six showed signs of adenocarcinoma, as follows: 1. 4+3 with 80% of the tissue sampled and perineural invasion. 2. 3+4 with 90% of the tissue sampled and perineural invasion. 3. 3+4 with 80% of the tissue sampled (no perineural invasion). 4. 4+3 with 60% of the tissue sampled (no perineural invasion). 5. 3+4 with 80% of the tissue sampled (no perineural invasion). 6. 3+4 with 60% of the tissue sampled (no perineural invasion). After his surgery (non-robotic), his surgeon explained: The cancer in prostrate was not fully contained with a microscopic hole where cancerous cells may have escaped. There was, however, no indication of cancer outside the prostate area. Tests outside prostate included removal of 19 surrounding nodes that were all cancer free. Now, we are about six months after his surgery and he has had two PSA tests. His first PSA score was 0.02. Yesterday, he received the results of his second PSA test and it was elevated to 0.05. Even though we have read that the low levels are basically undetectable, we are concerned about an immediate jump in his levels. The doctor said that they will retest in three months and go from there. We will wait for the next rounds of tests, but we also want to make sure we are staying on top of everything and asking the right questions. We really appreciate any comments or advice and thanks for reading. Happy Holidays and all the best.",

My family and I will be keeping an eye on this thread and others, trying to learn as much as possible. TLDinMD, very sorry to hear about your father and hoping for the very best for him. I agree, as a family member, the waiting and unknown seems to be the hardest part of this early stage. Thanks again.",

      "Content": "Hi Everyone, I am very thankful for finding this forum and for the participating members. My dad found out last week that he has prostate cancer. It hit our family like a freight train and now we are just trying to make sense of the severity and our options. He is 67 years old and in otherwise excellent health. His PSA is 6.5 and his Gleason is 7. My understanding is that 12 cores were taken and six showed signs of adenocarcinoma, as follows: 1. 4+3 with 80% of the tissue sampled and perineural invasion. 2. 3+4 with 90% of the tissue sampled and perineural invasion. 3. 3+4 with 80% of the tissue sampled (no perineural invasion). 4. 4+3 with 60% of the tissue sampled (no perineural invasion). 5. 3+4 with 80% of the tissue sampled (no perineural invasion). 6. 3+4 with 60% of the tissue sampled (no perineural invasion). He is scheduled for a bone scan on Dec 22 and is still waiting on a cat scan appointment. I am really scared about the possibility of the cancer not being contained within the prostate, especially since there were two comments on cores about \"perineural invasion\". We really appreciate any comments or advice and thanks for reading. Happy Holidays.",
