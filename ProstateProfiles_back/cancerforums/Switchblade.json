    "Content": "Hi this is my first post and would appreciate some feedback in regards to my condition. I am 56 and have for the last year wild psa values. I have an enlarged prostate which got even bigger with the latest ultrasound. My PSA scores over the last year were 8.3, 5.3, 3.5, 21.0, and recently 8.9. I dont have any cancer symptoms but do take flomax which helps with the peeing. I am waiting to see a urologist which is taking forever as usual in Canada. I think the enlarged prostate is generating the high psa numbers and when it shrinks generates lower numbers. But I am sure they will do a biopsy which is gonna suck. Has anyone else had a similar scenario? I heard if its cancer the psa will remain elevated or go even higher. Thanks for your opinions!",
