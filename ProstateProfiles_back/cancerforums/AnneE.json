We have a surgery date of 9/11 with Dr. Patel in Celebration, which is way too long a wait, but it is what they were able to give us. We have asked to be put on a waiting list for any cancellations and hope that something comes through. Nice to have places online to talk to others who have similar situations.",

After the frustration of finding that there really was no one proper, scientifically better than the others choice, we decided the one thing we could control was the quality of the treatment input into our personal formula. Since we have one of the worlds most experienced prostate surgeons within a couple hour drive, and since radiation requires a more complex team of folks who each have a role (mark the spots, calibrate the machine, issue the treatment), and therefore more variables, we decided on the surgery.
