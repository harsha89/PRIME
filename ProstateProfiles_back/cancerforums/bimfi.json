    "Content": "I had Da Vinci robotic surgery in the beginning of May 2013. So far everything seems to be healing up. But, I still get periodic pains in my testicles and scrotum and more often in my rectum. These pains feel like muscle strains. It has not been quite two months since the removal of the prostate, but I have been having sexual urges. Although I have not been able to get an erection, I have been able to orgasm. It is after these orgasms that I feel the pains in my groin and rectum. I have spoken to my urologist about the rectal pains and he suggested that I follow up with a gastroenterologist to do a colonoscopy. It is the pains in my testicles that seem to concern me more. I'm not sure if there is a correlation with the \"orgasms\" and the tenderness in the scrotal area. I am being as gentle as possible when trying to achieve my goal, so I can't figure out why it would cause me pains afterwards. Any possible explanations?",
