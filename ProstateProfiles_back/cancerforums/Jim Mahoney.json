      "Content": "Kozmic got a referral from my Urologist, his nurses made contact and the Physical Therapy receptionist contacted me. Thanks Steve, Glad I decided to seek help with a professional Therapist. Since my 1st session I've adjusted my urinating pattern, spacing out amount of time in between voids. Instead of going frequently, try to avoid emptying small amounts. So 3 to 4hr period between urinating, I read a post on here about this. Kegel exercises instructions were exactly what was instructed by Urologist. Contractions of 5sec. with 5sec. rest periods 10x 3x a day, Quick contractions 2sec. 10x 3x a day Office kegel exercises consist of inserting a probe which is hooked up to a computer where the contractions intensity is measured . My physical therapist does explain before the insertion of the device but she clearly caught me off guard wasn't expecting this, my Medical Insurance doesn't cover the cost of $47 for the stimulation probe sensor, told the wife now I own my very first butt probe lol, man what next. Well at least my Insurance pays for 6 sessions",
