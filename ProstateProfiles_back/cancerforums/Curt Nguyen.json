      "Content": "I had a prostate biopsy 3 years ago. It's negative. The biopsy gave me an infection(sepsis).I had a DNA methylation over a year ago because my psa was 8 at that point. It was positive at the right apex. Right After that I had a MRI that was negative. A few weeks ago. I had another PSA test and it's 11. The doctor wants to do another biopsy at the apex where DNA methylation shows positive. Should I have another biopsy. I worry to get another infection from the biopsy. Thanks.",
