I probably should have stayed home a bit more due to bathroom problems, but I felt like it was necessary to get moving and stay moving. I also had the 6 months of cassadex and Luepron prior to Brachy. All I can say is it worked, I'm still in the zero club. My RO was a genius and sat with the wife and I for 3 hours on the first visit. He answered all of our questions and really put us at ease.",
