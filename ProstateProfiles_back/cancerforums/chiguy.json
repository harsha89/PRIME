      "Content": "Met with my urologist/surgeon today, and after discussing the issue of a continually rising PSA in the face of several biopsies finding only 1 or 2 cores of G6 cancer, he suggested trying Finasteride (Proscar). The way I understand it, it should lower my PSA by 50% in 3 months time. If not successful by then, it should achieve the 50% reduction within 6 months or there is a likelihood of a more aggressive cancer. Also, if, after whatever reduction is seen, there is ANY increase in PSA, it's also an indication of something more serious than a G6 and would likely require treatment. I understand that reducing the PSA is NOT eliminating any cancer. The way I understand this strategy is that it will eliminate any possibility that there is an issue of BPH, even though my prostate is not enlarged outwardly. (I have also been taking Alfuzosin since September '17) It will allow us to be more certain of a missed aggressive cancer if the PSA continues to rise. The 'risk' to this path, as I see it, is that I am allowing an aggressive cancer 6 months growth time. Is this an accurate understanding on my part?",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by Another I'm not a fan. There is no reliable translation factor. The multiplier is arbitrary. If your PSA is indicating cancer why mess with it and lose it as a barometer? If it indicates cancer find it and track it. The odds are you will eventually need treatment and a reliable PSA history is valuable. Some with cancer do not have a reliable PSA. If you do, protect it. It is valuable, imo. My PSA proved to be right on track with the progression of my cancer. Another, these are basically my thoughts as well. And have been for some time, as the PSA keeps moving on up. But as yet there have been no findings of anything greater than a G6 cancer. I will be asking a few questions of the doc today to see if 1) the PET option Michael F mentioned is available, as well as 2) how quickly my PSA levels would return to 'normal' after 3 or 6 months of Finasteride. Thanks for your thoughtful reply.",

The 'risk' to this path, as I see it, is that I am allowing an aggressive cancer 6 months growth time. Is this an accurate understanding on my part?",

      "Content": "Met with my urologist/surgeon today, and after discussing the issue of a continually rising PSA in the face of several biopsies finding only 1 or 2 cores of G6 cancer, he suggested trying Finasteride (Proscar). The way I understand it, it should lower my PSA by 50% in 3 months time. If not successful by then, it should achieve the 50% reduction within 6 months or there is a likelihood of a more aggressive cancer. Also, if, after whatever reduction is seen, there is ANY increase in PSA, it's also an indication of something more serious than a G6 and would likely require treatment. I understand that reducing the PSA is NOT eliminating any cancer. The way I understand this strategy is that it will eliminate any possibility that there is an issue of BPH, even though my prostate is not enlarged outwardly.

      "Content": "Originally Posted by Michael F chi: The logic appears sound BUT is this a clinically valid method? Also it adds 3-6 months of watching & waiting. I'm not a urologist nor a pharmacologist, but one needs to know the exact pharmacokinetics of Finasteride in order to determine if your PSA response is appropriate or not. Suggestion: Ask if you qualify for one of the newer radioligand PET/CT Scans for PCa. These have the ability to pinpoint locate foci of PCa. If it identifies PCa foci distant from the 2 known (from biopsy) locations, you will have your answer. This saga must be frustrating. Hoping that you will soon discover accurate answers which will determine either treatment or safe continuation of AS. Stay Strong! MF Michael, I appreciate your thoughts. I will learn what I can about the PET, I have not heard of that option before.",

If not successful by then, it should achieve the 50% reduction within 6 months or there is a likelihood of a more aggressive cancer.

      "Content": "Originally Posted by Another I'm not a fan. There is no reliable translation factor. The multiplier is arbitrary. If your PSA is indicating cancer why mess with it and lose it as a barometer? If it indicates cancer find it and track it. The odds are you will eventually need treatment and a reliable PSA history is valuable. Some with cancer do not have a reliable PSA. If you do, protect it. It is valuable, imo.

If your PSA is indicating cancer why mess with it and lose it as a barometer? If it indicates cancer find it and track it.

The way I understand it, it should lower my PSA by 50% in 3 months time. If not successful by then, it should achieve the 50% reduction within 6 months or there is a likelihood of a more aggressive cancer. Also, if, after whatever reduction is seen, there is ANY increase in PSA, it's also an indication of something more serious than a G6 and would likely require treatment. I understand that reducing the PSA is NOT eliminating any cancer. The way I understand this strategy is that it will eliminate any possibility that there is an issue of BPH, even though my prostate is not enlarged outwardly. (I have also been taking Alfuzosin since September '17) It will allow us to be more certain of a missed aggressive cancer if the PSA continues to rise. The 'risk' to this path, as I see it, is that I am allowing an aggressive cancer 6 months growth time. Is this an accurate understanding on my part?",

      "Content": "Met with my urologist/surgeon today, and after discussing the issue of a continually rising PSA in the face of several biopsies finding only 1 or 2 cores of G6 cancer, he suggested trying Finasteride (Proscar). The way I understand it, it should lower my PSA by 50% in 3 months time. If not successful by then, it should achieve the 50% reduction within 6 months or there is a likelihood of a more aggressive cancer. Also, if, after whatever reduction is seen, there is ANY increase in PSA, it's also an indication of something more serious than a G6 and would likely require treatment. I understand that reducing the PSA is NOT eliminating any cancer. The way I understand this strategy is that it will eliminate any possibility that there is an issue of BPH, even though my prostate is not enlarged outwardly. (I have also been taking Alfuzosin since September '17) It will allow us to be more certain of a missed aggressive cancer if the PSA continues to rise. The 'risk' to this path, as I see it, is that I am allowing an aggressive cancer 6 months growth time. Is this an accurate understanding on my part?",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by ASAdvocate Hi ChiGuy, I was reading your signature and my mindwheels were churning. Four low risk biopsies, and yet your psa keeps rising, up and up. Two questions: (1) Imaging. When have you had MRI's? What Telsa strength machines and what PIRADS results? (2) What is your current prostate size/volume? The larger the prostate, the higher a normal psa can be expected. Hopefully, that could be your case. If there has been am ultrasound or an MRI, there should be volume cited on the report. AS Advocate, the ever increasing PSA has my full attention - I'm due for a re-test mid March. Although I have minimal, if any, BPH symptoms, my doc's had me on smooth muscle relaxants since the fall. Started with Flomax, but that affected by BP - now on Uroxatral since Sept. The doc felt that those starts/stops/starts of meds, and the fact that I had a biopsy in Oct. and then re-test of PSA in Dec., could explain the higher PSA at that time. I have had two MP3T MRI's, the latest done in October before the biopsy, which showed two PIRADS 4 lesions. Prostate size is 33, which puts my PSAD at .46 - so I am anxious to see the mid March PSA result. If the PSA is up, my question will be - what might be causing it's rise, besides cancer, and how to move forward? I appreciate your concern.",

I did not include the fact that I did have a 3T MRI done in July. I was originally scheduled to get the MRI/Ultrasound fusion biopsy, but the day of the MRI I got a phone call telling me the facility is 'out of network'. So, I had it done at a facility 'in network' that didn't have the add'l. software that could fuse the images. They did see something in the MR - Asymmetric fullness involving the left side of the peripheral zone. At the periphery, there is an area of slightly lower signal intensity that does not contrast enhance. Infiltrative tumor or focal prostatitis or within the differential. Everything else was unremarkable. They wound up doing a regular 12 core biopsy, without the fusion. Not as accurate, in my view. I'm considering changing health plans next open enrollment, to be sure the next biopsy is done the 'right' way. Hopefully the next PSA does not continue with the same velocity. From what I've read, one possible treatment that could have been tried over the last many weeks would have been a round of antibiotics, to help rule out prostatitis. Would that be a valid course of action, even now? No one has mentioned that, either my primary care doc or the urologist...",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by Michael F Hi Chi! Here is my concern: \"Jun '15 - 9.51 / free psa % - 7.84 / 12 core - 2 POS (1 on each side), both G6\" Your PSA has increased > 60% in 15 months free psa % - 7.84 I would get an Expert 2nd opinion and make a highly informed decision - should not be hard to do in the Chicago area. Discuss having a 3T MRI to determine if there are areas with cancer that were missed at biopsy. Is there any sense in waiting another 6 months for a PSA that will likely be > 12.0? True - receiving \"The Diagnosis\" stinks but be thankful you have so wisely monitored your PSA and got The Diagnosis now and not disastrous diagnosis 3 years from now! Hope you knock this one out of the park! Also hope we get to see The Cubs win a WS in our lifetimes! Keep us updated! MF (Red Sox fan) Thanks. I did not include the fact that I did have a 3T MRI done in July. I was originally scheduled to get the MRI/Ultrasound fusion biopsy, but the day of the MRI I got a phone call telling me the facility is 'out of network'. So, I had it done at a facility 'in network' that didn't have the add'l. software that could fuse the images. They did see something in the MR - Asymmetric fullness involving the left side of the peripheral zone. At the periphery, there is an area of slightly lower signal intensity that does not contrast enhance. Infiltrative tumor or focal prostatitis or within the differential. Everything else was unremarkable. They wound up doing a regular 12 core biopsy, without the fusion. Not as accurate, in my view. I'm considering changing health plans next open enrollment, to be sure the next biopsy is done the 'right' way. Hopefully the next PSA does not continue with the same velocity. From what I've read, one possible treatment that could have been tried over the last many weeks would have been a round of antibiotics, to help rule out prostatitis. Would that be a valid course of action, even now? No one has mentioned that, either my primary care doc or the urologist...",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by charles384 I was diagnosed with PC this last year Gleason 6 3+3. My family has urged me to get a second opinion on reading the biopsy slides. I have an appointment March 1 to have this second opinion with MO. Doing research I know this hospital has the 3T MRI. I have already had 2 biopsies with the first being negative. My next primary appointment isn't until March 21 and my next Urology appointment isn't till May. My first biopsy was pretty painless but second was quite painful. I don't relish the thoughts of having a biopsy every year so if it is necessary to continue them, I think it would be best for them to have access to this MRI to guide the biopsy. Can I have the opinions of those who have been through this. I sure appreciate all the information I have gleaned from this forum. Thanks to all As your biopsy in August resulted in only 1 positive G6 core of less than 5%, and you're getting a 2nd opinion in just about 2 weeks, I'd likely wait to see what that doc has to say after seeing your slides. The 3T MRI is definitely the way to go moving forward, whether it's used by itself or with the TRUS biopsy to assess for any disease progression. But hopefully you will be doing nothing more than monitoring a low grade, non-threatening Gleason 6 for many years to come.",

      "Content": "This study is basically my situation - diagnosed at age 59, a G6 biopsy & a Prolaris score indicating 2% mortality in 10 years; at age 61, another G6 biopsy. In the cited case, the patient then was found to have a G9, and subsequently found that 75% of the prostate was cancerous, if I read it right. That's a HUGE change, one that I'd think should have surprised even the doctors. My takeaway is that the genomic tests are basically meant to confirm a cancer's aggressiveness based on the tissue samples submitted, NOT to imply how aggressive any other cancerous prostate cells might be. Have I read it right?",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by Woodbine130 Hello all, Just joined the forum. I\u2019m 60 and this past march I had my first urinary infection. Went on antibiotics for a week. Since then I notice my prostate and when I ejaculate very little comes out which is a definite change since the infection. Feeling is the same but not much volume so I went to my doctor. Doc said get a blood test to get a PSA. The Dre was ok. PSA came back 9.11. Have an appt with a uro. What should I ask or expect from the first appt. thanks for any advise Did you get your bloodwork done before or after the DRE? It should be done before, because the DRE will cause PSA to spike. Also, you'll want to avoid ejaculating, bike riding or intense physical activity for a few days before bloodwork as those activities will also raise PSA levels. Good luck with your appointment.",

The medicine is being taken to help with the urinary effects (urgency / night time bathroom runs). However, total Free PSA was at 16%, and my understanding is it shouldn't be under 25%. A quick question about the above - Since Finasteride lowers the PSA, would it also falsely RAISE your % Free PSA number? Asked another way - would your % Free PSA actually be lower?

I am concerned of course, as the prostate is not enlarging, and I've been on Alfusozin since September without any benefit. Really not sure what his next step might be, as I've just recently had a biopsy done. Would it be prudent to ask about a saturation biopsy? Or is it within reason to believe the rising PSA is not too alarming? I was counting on the Alfusozin reducing some BPH/prostatitis that might have been moving inward as opposed to 'swelling' the prostate. Luckily I've only got to stew about this for a few days...",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by Southsider It looks like you haven't had an MRI yet. An MRI can identify hotspots in your prostate, and could be useful. A saturation biopsy is pretty much a major operation, you have to be put under for it. What do you think the saturation biopsy can tell you? I don't know, I'd ask the doctor. An MRI might point out something in you plumbing that's causing a rise in PSA and your cancer really is indolent. I'm not a doctor, by all means hear what he says. I don't think your case is super urgent, you've had an elevated PSA for a decade, but you're only 61 Southsider, I've actually had several MRI's , most recently in October. It showed two PIRADS 4 lesions. Another in Jan 2016, which showed nothing to target. Both were 3T. I can't seem to be able to edit my signature to include them or my current PSA. I am in no hurry to go through a saturation biopsy. But i am getting concerned about the ever increasing PSA with no explanation. Prostate volume is normal and stable, I've got no symptoms of prostatitis or BPH, etc. I wonder if there is a PSA level that I should be seriously concerned about? I am looking forward to Thursday to get my doc's take on all this. Thanks for your thoughts.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by SubDenis I went through the 3T MRI and had a lesion. That became a target of the biopsy. DO you know if your lesions were biopsied? The key is \"fusion biopsy\" where they sue the MRI image and the ultrasound image to guide the biopsy probe to the lesions. You probably know this but I would press for details on the past biopsy or push for a targeted biopsy. P.S. I was under propofal for my biopsy. Keep asking questions! Hi Denis. They were fused MRI/TRUS biopsies. Actually, they didn't fuse the Jan 2016 biopsy since the MRI saw nothing to target. The Oct 2017 biopsy was fused as the MRI showed the PIRADS 4 lesions.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by RobLee There is a limit to the length of sigs here, and on most boards. I keep bumping into it myself. The settings screen flashes a message about 1000 characters, but I don't believe my sig is longer than that. I've had to remove a lot of bold highlighting and eliminate some duplicate stats to fit in the important new developments. It looks like you use a lot of bolding as well as duplication of terminology such as %free PSAD and spelling out months. With a few tricks you should be able to fit it what need to convey here. It's curious, I see some sigs here that take up a full page. I wonder how they got around the character limit. I finally figured that out when trying to edit the signature from my PHONE. My laptop browser may be preventing that 1000 character limit popup. I went back and eliminated all the colored text, which did the trick for now. Thanks.",

Switched docs and after looking at everything that had been done he did a saturation. Other than be put under I did not think it was a bigger deal than the other three.

They may explain your elevated PSA over the past few years in the face of having only found G6 tumor.

In my case they found 2 previously unseen lesions, which likely explain my high PSA and G6 history to that point. The 'new' lesions were in the base, which I understand is a more difficult area to read. I have not yet had a fusion biopsy to confirm all this, but feel it will show something more than G6.

      "Content": "Originally Posted by RobLee My PSA rose steadily for four years, but because DRE's were normal and initial biopsy was negative, nothing was done until a fusion biopsy two years ago found a G8 tumor at the base. Yes, a difficult area to read. My new Uro simply said \"you can never find them up there\". I wish my original Uro had been more open to following up with additional tests, and I wish I had known a lot more at the time. The MRI fusion is definitely preferred vs TRUS, as you know. Glad to see what looks like success for you after what had to be some difficult treatments.",

Ed With your G7 or G8 lesion(s) I'm a bit surprised to see that your PSA dropped as low as it did on Finasteride. Hopefully, that means you may have G3+4 with very little '4' and can continue AS.

      "Content": "EZ, an FYI - Your history is longer, but similar to mine, although your most recent biopsy found G7 and/or G8 lesions. They may explain your elevated PSA over the past few years in the face of having only found G6 tumor. I recently got into a clinical trial - https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT03429244 - at Indiana University that uses a Ga-68 tracer with PSMA PET scan to 'light up' G7b - G10 lesions. In my case they found 2 previously unseen lesions, which likely explain my high PSA and G6 history to that point. The 'new' lesions were in the base, which I understand is a more difficult area to read. I have not yet had a fusion biopsy to confirm all this, but feel it will show something more than G6. Just throwing this out there as another option for you to consider going forward. This PSMA PET appears to me to be a very useful tool in the way PCa diagnosis may be heading as it would likely help eliminate unnecessary biopsies and be ultimately more accurate in some cases than MRI. Good luck to you going forward!",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by ANWANK Hello everyone. I am new here and posting on behalf of my wonderful fiance. This last month has been quite stressful and I am trying to learn and understand everything that I can. So I will give a brief description of what has been going on. In December, my fiance went in for a check up at his gp. Much of this was due to my urging because of his family history and I just wanted to make sure he was doing good. His 48 year old brother had his prostate removed one year ago this month due to prostate cancer. His father also had prostate cancer. So I had been pushing him to go get examined because I wasn't sure if this was hereditary. Anyways, he had no issues such as symptoms and is a very active and healthy 45 year old man. He goes to dr and she draws his blood for psa test. We did not even know what that was. I just thought she would do a dre, which she did and it was negative. A few days later she calls and says he needs to go to urologist. His psa was 4.04. I started researching and thought that was not really high but we went earlier this week. Dr does another psa, dre and schedules a biopsy. DRE negative again and psa 4.1. He also said that his psa should not be over 2.5 at his age and typically should be about 0.7 or so. He recommended genetic testing. He stated that if his biopsy comes back negative he will submit to his insurance for an MRI guided biopsy. I guess I am slightly confused. I understand his family history plays a factor but with two negative dre,no symptoms, and slightly elevated psa, why does this urologist seem pretty confident that there is cancer? Has anyone here had a similar experience? Hi and welcome to the forum. It sounds like the urologist is doing a great job in trying to determine if your fiance has cancer or not. Hopefully it is not cancer, but with his family history and PSA levels his doc is doing exactly what I'd want my doc to do - using every tool to determine as best he can if there is reason to be concerned. Keep us posted please.",

It rarely moves beyond the prostate. Others here with greater knowledge and experience will be along soon to offer you good advice and information. You're doing exactly the right thing - learning all you can by reading everything you can find and discussing on a great forum like this one. Many helpful knowledgeable people here. Good luck! Ken",

I had a few bouts of it in my 30's, not recently treated for it. Caused me symptoms, but they went away. But when I had my biopsy,a lot of lnflammation of the prostate was noted, even though I hadn't had symptoms for many years. OK, I could deal with that. I was under the impression that prostatitis usually caused big spikes in PSA readings, as well as symptoms, but it is worth asking about. Thanks.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by Southsider There are \"acute\" prostatitis and \"chronic\" versions. I guess the acute forms can cause a big spike. I was only in my 30's, and if I had any PSA tests during that time, I didn't pay any attention to what my scores were. Gotcha. I am doing some reading on it now. I don't think my prostate's been inflamed at all, at least it's not been written or mentioned. And I've had no symptoms. But maybe the chronic version would be more subtle. It's a balancing act - on one side is a benign inflammation and on the other is a growing tumor. I'm personally thinking that with a positive result for cancer, and being on AS for over 2 years, I'd feel better if they'd reevaluate things with some further testing. Thanks again Southsider.",

      "Content": "Prostate cancer diagnosed 2 years ago - Gleason 6. The latest PSA result saw an increase, to 13.8 on Sept. 11th, from 12.48 on June 1st. It's been increasing steadily over the last several years. In June, doc started me on Flomax, but after 5 weeks of being very dizzy I came off the med. I'm due back to follow up with the doc in 10 days or so, and am hopeful that he'll be talking about getting a repeat MRI or biopsy or something. Even though I'm Gleason 6, and the Prolaris results were quite favorable, the fact that the PSA has kept chugging upward, without an increase in the prostate size, has me a bit concerned. Had the PSA come down or even stayed the same I think I'd have been OK to sit pat. Any thoughts on what might cause the PSA to rise as it has, that ISN\"T growth of a tumor? I am all ears!

The plan is to return in 6 months for another PSA check. My only concern is the continuing rise of the PSA. Is there a point where it will require action, even though no aggressive cancer is detected with the biopsy? Or can the PSA level continue rising without necessarily indicating a real concern?

Prostate Needle Biopsy Pathologic Parameter A) Prostate, right base medial; needle biopsy: - Benign prostatic tissue. B) Prostate, right base lateral; needle biopsy: - Benign prostatic tissue. C) Prostate, right mid medial; needle biopsy: - Benign prostatic tissue. D) Prostate, right mid lateral; needle biopsy: - Benign prostatic tissue. E) Prostate, right apex medial; needle biopsy: - High grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia (PIN). F) Prostate, right apex lateral; needle biopsy: - Benign prostatic tissue. G) Prostate, left base medial; needle biopsy: - Benign prostatic tissue. H) Prostate, left base lateral; needle biopsy: - Fibromuscular tissue, no prostatic glands or tumor present.

      "Content": "Thanks. It could be a whole lot worse, at least based on the horror stories you hear about how bad it CAN be. From what I have read, shingles is often brought on by a suppressed immune system or stress. I figure I was all stressed about the latest PSA reading being up again. Now that the MRI and biopsy are scheduled the stress level is down. The worst part about it is not being able to hold those grandkids! And I did not get vaccinated - but both my brothers have since got theirs The 'rash' is no longer getting any worse, so I'm hopeful things will be quieted down (and crusted over) by biopsy time. A very strange thing, shingles.",

      "Content": "Your PSA is high for someone your age, but so is your prostate - about twice the size of 'normal'. A large prostate = higher PSA. Benign prostatic hypertrophy (BPH) is an enlarged prostate, which is, as it says, benign. Non cancerous. It may cause urinary issues like frequent peeing, urgency, burning, peeing several times at night, etc. There are ways to treat BPH symptoms with medication if present. As for the lesion, your doc will certainly want to watch that going forward. Any history of prostate problems in your family? I'm sure others here will give you good information and advice.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by edwardtyme Hello- My name is Edward From Florida and I'd sincerely appreciate any advice / guidance some here may provide: I'm a healthy 59 year old male with an increasing PSA reading over the last 5 years. Back in 2013 my PSA reading was at 4.6 and it steadily increased over the years to a current reading of 17.5 which was verified as my blood work taken twice over 5 weeks. I have had three negative biopsies and 18 months ago I had an MRI which indicated a two small mass with a PIRADS score of 4. I believe my urologist, that is also a part-time assistant Professor of Urology at a major medical school in Florida will suggest yet another biopsy. Any suggestions ??? Anything different you would do if you were in my predicament ? Thanks, Edward God Bless Edward, what was the timing of your 3 biopsies? Did you have one 18 months ago after the MRI that saw the PIRADS 4? Was your latest PSA of 17.5 very recent? Do you have any BPH symptoms - frequent urination, trouble with your stream, etc.? If it's time for another biopsy, I'd be sure to have your doctor (or a different doctor if yours doesn't perform it) do a multi-parametric 3T MRI, and then an MRI guided TRUS (trans rectal ultra sound) biopsy. It's much more accurate than guessing where to hit for samples during the biopsy. You'll get plenty of great input from the forum people here with much more knowledge and experience very soon...",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by dth32 What does that mean? Well, we have been tracking my PSA for nearly a year now and it has not dropped below 14 during that time. In September I had an MRI that found two nodules in the right portion of my prostate. In November I had an external biopsy and from what I have read from others experience this seems to be the way to go. I was asleep and then I woke up. I had the blood in the urine of course but didn't have to go through being awake with the noises and knowing others were in the room with everything in the open Well my results came back and they found the two nodules that were Gleason 6 3+3. I think my signature explains it. Now to the unicorn.. My doctor hasn't seen anyone with my results, meaning my PSA is so high and my Gleason is 6. This is very abnormal, maybe a 1% or less of cases and he hasn't seen it. He performs the surger 5-7 times a week and has seen countless patients but hasn't seen someone my age(49) with these symptoms. So, I am a bit of a Unicorn. My wife and I went in today fully expecting to opt for surgery but the doctor wants to bring the case to his whole department. I feel like an episode of House honestly. We told him that our choice is for surgery and he said that is one of the options and one he would be leaning towards. I am just rambling on now because I just wanted to put things down in words here. Maybe someone else has seen something like this on this forum. I suppose I have a little more stress since a doctor that has seen thousands of these cases has never seen this before. What is lurking in me that they haven't seen before? It's back to the wait and see game... Dth32 Not sure how uncommon it is. My PSA is 15.2, and 4 biopsies have found either no cancer or 1 or 2 G6 cores. Prostate size of 30-33. How much experience does your doctor have?",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by Michael F Looks perfect Chiguy and will shed light and hopefully provide exact answers. Has your URO MD arranged a referral for you? Also, It appears that the 68Ga-PSMA-11 PET has sufficient sensitivity to detect recurrent PCa with PSA levels <1.0 which is superb news for those who want to pinpoint locate and treat accordingly. Good luck getting quickly enrolled in the trial! Keep us updated. MF Michael, I'm scheduled for the PET in about a week, and will hopefully hear results by the end of the month. Most trials I've found using this Ga68 tracer are looking for recurrent cancer. I think this trial is a natural progression - 'if it works for recurrence, why not for diagnosis?' My gut tells me this (PET w/ a tracer) will be used more and more for the men (and women) whose biopsied cancers are indolent but whose markers keep rising. It will hopefully allow a high level of confidence one way or the other - either aggressive cancer is present or it's not.",

Thanks Another, that's good to know - it will be part of the discussion for sure. I've got a couple more things I'd like to get answered - --- How large are these 2 newly found lesions that were seen on the October 2017 MRI disks last week? --- Let's look at my January 2016 MRI to see if they are there as well. If so, how big were they then? --- Just how close are these lesions to the prostate wall? I will text my doc these questions today, with the hope of getting answers no later than my June 28th appt.",

      "Content": "Here's a link to a clinical trial being done at Indiana University Health that is looking at the usefulness of PET/MRI with 68Ga-PSMA-11 as a tracer in detecting clinically significant PCa lesions in low and intermediate risk disease - https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT03429244 It's designed for use with patients who have low (G6) or intermediate (G3+4 or G4+3) risk cancer to define the accuracy of the tracer in identifying clinically significant lesions. It's my understanding that this type of diagnostic procedure has previously been used when PCa recurrence is suspected. It's the only trial I've seen designed to help rule out more aggressive cancer in patients who are basically in an Active Surveillance program. Perfect for those in AS who may have unexplained rising PSA levels.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by ASAdvocate Chiguy, Thanks for posting this. We are all hoping for a magic tool that will accurately separate those who have indolent PCa, and those who have significant risk. Maybe this will be that tool, maybe not. But, there sure is a lot of research to try to replace our current diagnosis process with something less intrusive and more accurate. ASA, a magic tool would be great, but this seems to be a definite step in the right direction towards being able to 'light up' cancer cells. The tracer used in this study shows an affinity for attaching itself to PSMA (prostate specific membrane antigen), which sits on the surface of cancer cells. And it appears that it has a real affinity for the more aggressive cancer (G7b-G10) which are of course the cells we'd all like to find and remove. The PET in the study is a whole body scan, which would show metastatic disease as well. Johns Hopkins has people looking at not only how to use a tracer to find aggressive cancer cells, but how those cells can then be targeted with a paired radiopharmaceutical agent and killed (right now, THAT sounds like magic!). Very promising stuff. I'll be having the PET done later this month - and will hopefully report the results soon after.",

They are up in the base, where I understand the prostate tissue is more heterogenous and therefore more difficult to identify potential tumors.

He has indicated previously that he didn't think ther was any benefit to the PSMA PET vs an MpMRI in identifying tumors/lesions. I have now seen otherwise. The study protocol includes a repeat PSMA PET in 12 months, but the study doc has offered to do a repeat in November, along with a biopsy, which I will likely be doing. This will also give the Finasteride that my doc has had me on since March the time to rule out BPH as a partial cause of my PSA rise. That is fast becoming a moot point in my mind, as the PSMA PET has shown 2 'new' lesions potentially >G6. I asked if the PET results could be shared with my doc, but was told it could not as it is part of the study... Not a problem, as the ride down to Indy is easy enough, even with all the damn trucks.

      "Content": "Originally Posted by dth32 What does that mean? Well, we have been tracking my PSA for nearly a year now and it has not dropped below 14 during that time. In September I had an MRI that found two nodules in the right portion of my prostate. In November I had an external biopsy and from what I have read from others experience this seems to be the way to go. I was asleep and then I woke up. I had the blood in the urine of course but didn't have to go through being awake with the noises and knowing others were in the room with everything in the open Well my results came back and they found the two nodules that were Gleason 6 3+3. I think my signature explains it. Now to the unicorn.. My doctor hasn't seen anyone with my results, meaning my PSA is so high and my Gleason is 6. This is very abnormal, maybe a 1% or less of cases and he hasn't seen it. He performs the surger 5-7 times a week and has seen countless patients but hasn't seen someone my age(49) with these symptoms. So, I am a bit of a Unicorn. My wife and I went in today fully expecting to opt for surgery but the doctor wants to bring the case to his whole department. I feel like an episode of House honestly. We told him that our choice is for surgery and he said that is one of the options and one he would be leaning towards. I am just rambling on now because I just wanted to put things down in words here. Maybe someone else has seen something like this on this forum. I suppose I have a little more stress since a doctor that has seen thousands of these cases has never seen this before. What is lurking in me that they haven't seen before? It's back to the wait and see game... Dth32 Not sure how uncommon it is. My PSA is 15.2, and 4 biopsies have found either no cancer or 1 or 2 G6 cores. Prostate size of 30-33. How much experience does your doctor have?",

      "Content": "Thanks. It could be a whole lot worse, at least based on the horror stories you hear about how bad it CAN be. From what I have read, shingles is often brought on by a suppressed immune system or stress. I figure I was all stressed about the latest PSA reading being up again. Now that the MRI and biopsy are scheduled the stress level is down. The worst part about it is not being able to hold those grandkids! And I did not get vaccinated - but both my brothers have since got theirs The 'rash' is no longer getting any worse, so I'm hopeful things will be quieted down (and crusted over) by biopsy time. A very strange thing, shingles.",

The plan is to return in 6 months for another PSA check. My only concern is the continuing rise of the PSA. Is there a point where it will require action, even though no aggressive cancer is detected with the biopsy? Or can the PSA level continue rising without necessarily indicating a real concern? Surgical Pathology Report FINAL PATHOLOGIC DIAGNOSIS A-M) Prostate; biopsies: - Prostatic adenocarcinoma. - See pathologic parameter and comment. Prostate Needle Biopsy Pathologic Parameter A) Prostate, right base medial; needle biopsy: - Benign prostatic tissue. B) Prostate, right base lateral; needle biopsy: - Benign prostatic tissue. C) Prostate, right mid medial; needle biopsy: - Benign prostatic tissue. D) Prostate, right mid lateral; needle biopsy: - Benign prostatic tissue. E) Prostate, right apex medial; needle biopsy: - High grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia (PIN). F) Prostate, right apex lateral; needle biopsy: - Benign prostatic tissue. G) Prostate, left base medial; needle biopsy: - Benign prostatic tissue. H) Prostate, left base lateral; needle biopsy: - Fibromuscular tissue, no prostatic glands or tumor present. I) Prostate, lef t mid medial; needle biopsy: - Benign prostatic tissue. J) Prostate, left mid lateral; needle biopsy: - Benign prostatic tissue. K) Prostate, left apex medial; needle biopsy: - Benign prostatic tissue. L) Prostate, left apex lateral; needle biopsy: - Prostatic adenocarcinoma, Gleason score 6 (3+3)(Grade group 1), less than 1.0 mm focus. - Tumor volume is less than 5% of the submitted tissue. M) Prostate, MRI; needle biopsy: - Fibromuscular tissue, no prostatic glands or tumor present. Comment Part L: Immunohistochemical stains p63 and HMWK support the above diagnosis. Controls are appropriate. Deeper levels are examined.",

      "Content": "Your PSA is high for someone your age, but so is your prostate - about twice the size of 'normal'. A large prostate = higher PSA. Benign prostatic hypertrophy (BPH) is an enlarged prostate, which is, as it says, benign. Non cancerous. It may cause urinary issues like frequent peeing, urgency, burning, peeing several times at night, etc. There are ways to treat BPH symptoms with medication if present. As for the lesion, your doc will certainly want to watch that going forward. Any history of prostate problems in your family? I'm sure others here will give you good information and advice.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by ASAdvocate Chiguy, Thanks for posting this. We are all hoping for a magic tool that will accurately separate those who have indolent PCa, and those who have significant risk. Maybe this will be that tool, maybe not. But, there sure is a lot of research to try to replace our current diagnosis process with something less intrusive and more accurate. ASA, a magic tool would be great, but this seems to be a definite step in the right direction towards being able to 'light up' cancer cells. The tracer used in this study shows an affinity for attaching itself to PSMA (prostate specific membrane antigen), which sits on the surface of cancer cells. And it appears that it has a real affinity for the more aggressive cancer (G7b-G10) which are of course the cells we'd all like to find and remove. The PET in the study is a whole body scan, which would show metastatic disease as well. Johns Hopkins has people looking at not only how to use a tracer to find aggressive cancer cells, but how those cells can then be targeted with a paired radiopharmaceutical agent and killed (right now, THAT sounds like magic!). Very promising stuff. I'll be having the PET done later this month - and will hopefully report the results soon after.",

If so, how big were they then? --- Just how close are these lesions to the prostate wall? I will text my doc these questions today, with the hope of getting answers no later than my June 28th appt.",

      "Content": "Had the PSMA PET done and it lit up 2 lesions that had not previously been seen. They are up in the base, where I understand the prostate tissue is more heterogenous and therefore more difficult to identify potential tumors. Anyway, I had brought my most recent MRI disk along, which allowed them to take a look to see if there was anything actually visible there - which they found on closer inspection. With this PSMA PET, if anything lights up it is typically >G6, so these 'new' lesions would help explain my rising PSA. The study doctor offered to do an MRI/PET fusion biopsy that day. I asked if it was an urgent thing or him saving me a trip back to Indianapolis, and it was the latter. So I decided to hold off so I could follow up with my doc here in Chicago and get his thoughts. My doc offered to do another MRI guided biopsy with some additional random cores from the area of the 'new' lesions. I see him on the 28th of this month for my 3 month follow up, and will talk in more detail. He has indicated previously that he didn't think ther was any benefit to the PSMA PET vs an MpMRI in identifying tumors/lesions. I have now seen otherwise. The study protocol includes a repeat PSMA PET in 12 months, but the study doc has offered to do a repeat in November, along with a biopsy, which I will likely be doing. This will also give the Finasteride that my doc has had me on since March the time to rule out BPH as a partial cause of my PSA rise. That is fast becoming a moot point in my mind, as the PSMA PET has shown 2 'new' lesions potentially >G6. I asked if the PET results could be shared with my doc, but was told it could not as it is part of the study... Not a problem, as the ride down to Indy is easy enough, even with all the damn trucks. I do believe the PSMA PET is going to find greater and greater use for a variety of cancer detection scenarios - pretty incredible stuff.",

Thanks Another, that's good to know - it will be part of the discussion for sure. I've got a couple more things I'd like to get answered - --- How large are these 2 newly found lesions that were seen on the October 2017 MRI disks last week? --- Let's look at my January 2016 MRI to see if they are there as well. If so, how big were they then? --- Just how close are these lesions to the prostate wall? I will text my doc these questions today, with the hope of getting answers no later than my June 28th appt.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by ASAdvocate Chiguy, Thanks for posting this. We are all hoping for a magic tool that will accurately separate those who have indolent PCa, and those who have significant risk. Maybe this will be that tool, maybe not. But, there sure is a lot of research to try to replace our current diagnosis process with something less intrusive and more accurate. ASA, a magic tool would be great, but this seems to be a definite step in the right direction towards being able to 'light up' cancer cells. The tracer used in this study shows an affinity for attaching itself to PSMA (prostate specific membrane antigen), which sits on the surface of cancer cells. And it appears that it has a real affinity for the more aggressive cancer (G7b-G10) which are of course the cells we'd all like to find and remove. The PET in the study is a whole body scan, which would show metastatic disease as well. Johns Hopkins has people looking at not only how to use a tracer to find aggressive cancer cells, but how those cells can then be targeted with a paired radiopharmaceutical agent and killed (right now, THAT sounds like magic!). Very promising stuff. I'll be having the PET done later this month - and will hopefully report the results soon after.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by ASAdvocate Chi, reading through this thread, I certainly agree with the others that you need to take some action...but, I have almost no idea what to recommend besides consulting with more specialists and getting more opinions. You have done the expected blood, biopsy, imaging, and genomics testing, with very little cancer found. IF I were you, I'd be looking to meet with more doctors and hearing what they suggest. You could just have a benign issue, but it really needs to be further explored. I will be seeing my URO in the next few weeks, who I'm sure will give me sound advice. He was highly recommended, and when I met with him 18 months ago I found those recommendations to be accurate. So, the next 18 days will seem a bit longer than usual, but once there the next steps will become clearer I'm sure. Thanks.",

      "Content": "I'm due to see my urologist on the 22nd, so will likely wait til then to discuss the latest bloodwork results. June 1st, PSA is 12.48, % free PSA is 7.85, and PSAD calculates to 0.42. As my signature shows, PSA is up 40+ % since last year. A bit concerning to me, as my prostate has not likely grown dramatically in that time. My concern has been a higher than desired PSAD for some time, and now I'm concerned about the PSA moving up so much in a short period of time. I know my doc is going to give good advice - I guess I'm venting a bit. Really surprised at the rise. Thoughts on this from anyone? Is there a reason this might happen besides CA growth??",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by Michael F Hi Chi !!! Sorry that the \"bafflement\" continues. Everything that you have posted to date is not suggestive of PC. However, your steadily rising PSA requires continued attention. You now have 3 consecutive PSA rises > 10 since last August. This is 1 metric that must be weighed to make the decision to continue AS. Is it possible that you are experiencing some type of as symptomatic BPH? This would contribute to your rising PSA. Simultaneously this would decrease your PSAD. Just food for thought! What measurement do you use for your prostate size? - TRUS measurement? If so, which date? - MRI measurement? What was the date? Lastly, since you are in/near CHI, have you considered getting a 2nd opinion? I'm not in any way challenging your current URO's position but another opinion provides a fresh perspective and may or may not shed light. Possibly they recommend a different type of imaging scan. Both michiganman16 & ReadyTo Fight went to UC for 2nd opinions and never looked back. For certain you & your MD(s) are monitoring this closely. Good job! Hoping the mystery is soon solved with a benign explanation! MF An enlarged prostate due to BPH is exactly what I'm hoping it is. That would explain the elevated PSA, and would likely bring my PSADensity number back down a bit. But the PSAD has been over double the 0.15 most use as a cutoff for AS since the diagnosis almost 2 years ago. The prostate was measured via TRUS at that time and then by MRI about 18 months ago, by my 2nd opinion URO at Univ of Chicago, who michiganman16 recommended. Both methods measured it the same - 30cc. I am asymptomatic if it is BPH. I feel very confident in the level of care I'm receiving. It's my ability, or lack of, that is making me nuts. I'll be glad to see the 22nd get here to hear what the doc has to say... Thanks for your thoughts.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by Michael F Hi Chi !!! Sorry that the \"bafflement\" continues. Everything that you have posted to date is not suggestive of PC. However, your steadily rising PSA requires continued attention. You now have 3 consecutive PSA rises > 10 since last August. This is 1 metric that must be weighed to make the decision to continue AS. Is it possible that you are experiencing some type of as symptomatic BPH? This would contribute to your rising PSA. Simultaneously this would decrease your PSAD. Just food for thought! What measurement do you use for your prostate size? - TRUS measurement? If so, which date? - MRI measurement? What was the date? Lastly, since you are in/near CHI, have you considered getting a 2nd opinion? I'm not in any way challenging your current URO's position but another opinion provides a fresh perspective and may or may not shed light. Possibly they recommend a different type of imaging scan. Both michiganman16 & ReadyTo Fight went to UC for 2nd opinions and never looked back. For certain you & your MD(s) are monitoring this closely. Good job! Hoping the mystery is soon solved with a benign explanation! MF An enlarged prostate due to BPH is exactly what I'm hoping it is. That would explain the elevated PSA, and would likely bring my PSADensity number back down a bit. But the PSAD has been over double the 0.15 most use as a cutoff for AS since the diagnosis almost 2 years ago. The prostate was measured via TRUS at that time and then by MRI about 18 months ago, by my 2nd opinion URO at Univ of Chicago, who michiganman16 recommended. Both methods measured it the same - 30cc. I am asymptomatic if it is BPH. I feel very confident in the level of care I'm receiving. It's my ability, or lack of, that is making me nuts. I'll be glad to see the 22nd get here to hear what the doc has to say... Thanks for your thoughts.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by ASAdvocate Chi, reading through this thread, I certainly agree with the others that you need to take some action...but, I have almost no idea what to recommend besides consulting with more specialists and getting more opinions. You have done the expected blood, biopsy, imaging, and genomics testing, with very little cancer found. IF I were you, I'd be looking to meet with more doctors and hearing what they suggest. You could just have a benign issue, but it really needs to be further explored. I will be seeing my URO in the next few weeks, who I'm sure will give me sound advice. He was highly recommended, and when I met with him 18 months ago I found those recommendations to be accurate. So, the next 18 days will seem a bit longer than usual, but once there the next steps will become clearer I'm sure. Thanks.",

      "Content": "I'm due to see my urologist on the 22nd, so will likely wait til then to discuss the latest bloodwork results. June 1st, PSA is 12.48, % free PSA is 7.85, and PSAD calculates to 0.42. As my signature shows, PSA is up 40+ % since last year. A bit concerning to me, as my prostate has not likely grown dramatically in that time. My concern has been a higher than desired PSAD for some time, and now I'm concerned about the PSA moving up so much in a short period of time. I know my doc is going to give good advice - I guess I'm venting a bit. Really surprised at the rise. Thoughts on this from anyone? Is there a reason this might happen besides CA growth??",

      "Content": "I haven't been on the forum for a bit over a year - been on Active Surveillance a little over 1 1/2 years now. Just been regular PSA checks since then. I'm due back to the urologist in May/June and called them to see about scheduling my visit. The doc had said back in Jan '16 that he wanted a repeat biopsy in 18 months (sooner if PSA increased 20% before then). When I talked with their office today they told me to schedule the visit, but that there would be no MRI or biopsy done at that time. I asked her to verify the 'no biopsy' part, and am waiting for a return call letting me know whether they really do not want a repeat done. Have things changed recently regarding frequency of biopsies while on Active Surveillance? I certainly don't want to have it done if it's not necessary, but at the same time I don't want to NOT stay on top of the situation. I've become pretty comfortable with the whole idea of Active Surveillance over the last year or so, but the one stat that keeps me a bit uncertain is the Prostate Density - currently .36 (history below). I'd appreciate your input on the subject",
