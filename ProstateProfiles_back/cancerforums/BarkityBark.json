    "Content": "Can a targeted biopsy even be practical when the result from a previous MRI utilizing a new Siemens 3T machine (with isotope dye) of the prostate didn't find anything at all?ï»¿ My PSA has been fluctuating between 5.5 and 7.2 for the last year, so I went for this new tech 3-D scan. Age 65. The radiologist commented on the report results \"Low risk for cancer\". My urologist wants to stick me with 24 biopsy needles now, seeing that nothing was visible on the scan.
