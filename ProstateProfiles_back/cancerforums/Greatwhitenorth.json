      "Content": "First off I would like to thank all the contributors to this forum,the knowledge and insight I gained from this site has helped me get through a very difficult time. I was referred 3/12 by my GP to a URO due to a rising psa ,neither felt anything with a DRE the URO tracked my PSA for 14 months before suggesting a biopsy.I was diagnosed 7/13 at age 57 with prostate cancer,biopsy results stage T1C , 2 of 10 cores positive (3+4 4+4)presented with options of either surgery or brachy I decided on the surgery based on the pro's and con's of each procedure.I had a nerve sparing open radical prostatectomy Dec 17th the surgery went well and I was released from the hospital 3 days later.My surgeon(also my URO)had done 900 of the open procedures.Recovery so far has been tolerable aided by the knowledge of what to expect based on the information I gathered from this site and other sources.I do not want to cover every detail of the experience as it has been well covered in other posting's but I did want to cover a few points that were profound for me. -Get into the best shape you can possibly be before the operation -The bloating is real intense but it will pass -The first few bowel movement's and the accompanying bladder spasms are a real eye opener but with stool softeners,fiber and patience they will diminish in intensity with each one For the catheter removal I debated whether to take pads or the full Depends that I had purchased previously I decided to pack 3 pads.When my surgeon removed the catheter after 11 days on 12/28 he told me I would leak a lot for the next week which is what he wanted to happen so nothing clogs as he said.In reality I have been virtual dry since that moment with only a few dribbles . According to my surgeon I was lucky that the cancer was caught early and should not have escaped the prostate. This coming Monday I go for my follow up hopefully the path results are good and the cancer is all gone.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by ddayglo congrats and great news on the continence... If you get a chance, ask your surgeon if he did anything \"special\" like the \"rocco stitch\". I'm down to a \"squirt a day\"... except for a day like this one... it used to be my back which complained when shoveling and lifting 40 lb bags of rock salt. Now it's my front I did ask my surgeon about the rocco stitch before the surgery and he felt that the technique increased the risk of leaving cancer behind.I will ask him why my level of continence is as good as it seems. I know all about back pain as before the surgery I went to see my physio for some nagging back pain.It helped but I must say that with the amount of manipulation during the surgery and the postage size hospital beds my back was almost as painful as the bloating.",

When I received my path report I had to ask about ED rehab and received a prescription for Viagra 25 mg every 2nd day which I plan to start tomorrow.I mentioned my concerns regarding atrophy to my uro/surgeon and he kinda chuckled and said that would take years.There seems to be a variety of opinions on this subject.For now I think I will follow his course of actions as he has gotten me this far.I am barely 4 weeks out and have some time to wait and see what happens.",
