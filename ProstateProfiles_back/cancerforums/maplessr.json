      "Content": "I'm 15 months post surgery and doing great, with one exception. Beginning immediately after the surgery I noticed a significant change in my urine -it is cloudy and smells horrible. I have talked to my doctors and am being told that the only thing that could cause this is dietary changes, of which there haven't been any. Has anyone else experienced anything like this?",

      "Content": "Your husbands story is earily similar to my experience. I totally understand what he is going through. At 2 months post-op I was essentially in the same shape as the day the catheter was removed. I soaked 5-7 maxi-pads a day. I performed my kegel excercises exactly as the doctor prescribed but imovement never came. I contacted the surgeon for advice - he set me up with a PT group here in the Houston area that addesses only the pelvic floor and specializes on men after prostatectomy. Results have been superb. My worst day was right after the first visit with this PT group. They had me start logging fluid intake and weighing my pads. I soaked 9 pads for a total of 1280 grams of fluid, that is nearly 1.5 quarts of liquid. Within 3 weeks I was down to 1 pad a day and averaging about 50 grams of leakage a day. It has now been 2 months since startng PT (4 months post op) and things continue to slowly improve. My issues stemmed from the muscles of my pelvic floor being in spasm which kept them fatigued and prevented them from working correctly. PT was able to get the muscles to relax (through biofeedback, relaxation techniques, and internal massage) and allow them to start working for me. I would strongly urge that you ask the doctor for a referral to Pelvic Rehab Facility. Your husband's problem may not be the same as mine, but a pelvic rehab specialist should be able to diagnose his issue and offer suggestions for treatment. Good Luck",
