      "Content": "I posted earlier today asking about Lupron (Eligard), but then realized that probably no one would identlfy this as the drug as what is used in hormone therapy, so thought I had better make my hormone therapy inquiry understandable to anyone who has been on hormone therapy............... Advise on Lupron (Eligard) usage Met with my uro-surgeon last Thursday. I had Da Vinci 3 months ago, with a slow painful recovery because of lymphocels. I am healing much better now, but latest PSA test produced a 0.22 read out. Doc says that number denotes I still have some PCa. Latest plan is to receive Eligard injections once a month for 6 months. This will put the PCa into remission, and give my surgery additional time to heal, before receiving radiation to kill off PCa. Doctor said side effects of reduced testosterone produced by Eligard, is hot flashes, fatigue, and low sexual desire. At an Eligard website, I found additional effects listed, with numerical percentages. Hot flashes -- in up to 73.3 percent of people Injection site reactions, including mild pain, burning, and stinging -- up to 34.6 percent Fatigue and general discomfort -- up to 17.5 percent Decreased testicle size -- up to 7.2 percent Muscle pain -- up to 4.5 percent Dizziness -- up to 4.4 percent Clamminess -- up to 4.4 percent Weakness -- up to 3.6 percent Breast enlargement -- up to 3.6 percent Nausea -- up to 3.4 percent Joint pain -- up to 3.4 percent. Other common reactions, occurring in 2.2 to 3.3 percent of people, included: Decreased libido (decreased sex drive) Night sweats Pain in the arms or legs Frequent need to urinate Itching Stomach and intestinal irritation (\"stomach flu\") Getting up in the middle of the night to urinate Hair loss Testicular pain. I would like to hear any testimonials from anyone who has received Eligard. Thanks...........Rooster22",

None of the radiation treatments cause any pain or discomfort in of themselves. It was only in the last week of radiation, that I began to feel some urinary irritation.

It is important to show up for treatments with a nearly full bladder, and an empty bowel. Some days that was not easy to do. Agree with others to begin radiation upon psa readings steadily increasing. It shows that cancer is growing. Often, hormone therapy is begun before radiation.

They sort of work, but when I inject, it depresses me to think that my sex life has come down to this. I have looked into penile implants.

      "Content": "Hi Felix, I have had two recent cystoscopys done within the past 3 weeks. My situation is a bit different, in that I am recovering from DaVinci Rp, and I have a problem where the urethra is reattached to the bladder. For unknown reasons, I have a great deal of pain for the past 3-4 weeks. So my surgeon said he needed to \"take a look,\" The instrument is a flexible cable like devise that is inserted into your Johnson, and moved up, and into the bladder. In my case, I had a lot of inflammation, so probably helped to produced extra pain, even though a little pain killer gel was inserted into the tip of my Johnson. 10 days ago, I had another cystoscopy done in his office. This time I showed up at his office after having taken 2 codeine based pain pills. This time the pain was more bearable at about a 4 level, not like the 7-or 8 level as before. I see my doc on Thursday. I don't know what he wants to do, but I will take a couple of pain pills as before to mediate any pain. If the procedure is done in his office, chances are it will be with the local pain killer only. I can say that urination afterwards was normal with no pain, so don't have much concern about that.",

      "Content": "Hi Felix, I have had two recent cystoscopys done within the past 3 weeks. My situation is a bit different, in that I am recovering from DaVinci Rp, and I have a problem where the urethra is reattached to the bladder. For unknown reasons, I have a great deal of pain for the past 3-4 weeks. So my surgeon said he needed to \"take a look,\" The instrument is a flexible cable like devise that is inserted into your Johnson, and moved up, and into the bladder. In my case, I had a lot of inflammation, so probably helped to produced extra pain, even though a little pain killer gel was inserted into the tip of my Johnson. 10 days ago, I had another cystoscopy done in his office. This time I showed up at his office after having taken 2 codeine based pain pills. This time the pain was more bearable at about a 4 level, not like the 7-or 8 level as before. I see my doc on Thursday. I don't know what he wants to do, but I will take a couple of pain pills as before to mediate any pain. If the procedure is done in his office, chances are it will be with the local pain killer only. I can say that urination afterwards was normal with no pain, so don't have much concern about that.",

I don't need the strength of 100 mg., so I use a pill splitter to break up the pill into pieces. This process reduces the cost per dosage considerably. Results are just as good as Viagra. Purchasing is very easy. Just have your doctor fax the prescription scrip to the pharmacy, and pay for it by credit card. Pills delivered to your door. I purchase from Pharmacy RX world, located in Toronto. Their website is: https://www.pharmacyrxworld.com I highly recommend them. Their customer service is excellent.

      "Content": "I developed an Incisional hernia, known as a Ventral hernia after RALP. My RALP was a year ago. Apparently a ventral hernia is common after pelvic surgery. It developed right at the sight of the incision, and presented itself as a tummy bulge. It was there, that the muscle tore open at the scar, with the bowel trying to push itself through the muscle tear. I think that my bout of heavy coughing from bronchitis may have caused the problem. The hernia was easily fixed with Laparoscopic repair, just 3 hole portals in my abdomen with plastic mesh installed through the portals to give the muscle extra strength. Not much pain involved after out patient surgery, just soreness for the past few days. I just think it is important enough for anyone who has had a RALP, or open surgery to be aware of a potential hernia problem developing. Any unusual tummy bulge that shows up should be checked out by a physician.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by rmotacek1 Rooster-thanks for this info. I have been wondering if I might need to go get checked. I have some minor pain at my largest incision scar above my navel and when I cough hard it bulges out a little but goes back in. That is the same exact location of my hernia, just above the naval, where the surgery scar is located. I had a puffy bulge upon standing, but would disappear when lying flat on my back. The hernia started to bother me with some burning pain with any physical work, so I knew it was time to have it looked at by a doc. Doc said it would probably tear larger over time, so it was time to get it repaired. I still can't believe how easy recovery was after Laparoscopic surgery. Very minimal pain right after surgery, with minimal soreness for just 2 days. I had surgery at 10 AM, and was home by 12:30 PM, and immediately was able to walk our two dogs. I had no lifting restrictions, and was bowling 7 days after surgery. Laparoscopic surgery is a true blessing over what was done previously with open surgery.",

      "Content": "My treatment for Pca has progressed much like yours, with a gleason score of 7. I had Pca in seminal vessels, but none detected in lymph nodes, though doctor thought otherwise. I had 8 weeks of radiation Had RP, three months later had psa of 2.1, month later psa 2.2. So doctor started on Eligard hormone thereapy injections, which is the same stuff as firmagon, just a different name brand. I am now 17 months on Eligard, and still doing the hot flashes. I, too, gave strong thought of bailing out of HT, but then read on line the significant statistical increase of not getting biological occurrence of PCA, when HT is given for 18 to 24 months. The reasoning is that HT does not kill any remaining Pca cells, but causes a huge testosterone reduction, which causes Pca cells to go into hibernation, not replicate, and turn old and die off. With that information, I decided to continue on HT for the best chance of a cure. My doc says I have an 80% chance of a cure. If Pca does reoccur, doc says I will be on hormone therapy for the rest of my life. At present my psa is undectible. My advise is go the long route of HT, though it is not easy, but do-able. It gives you that much better of a chance for a cure. There is a med I take to reduces number of hot flashes, and there intensity. I will discuss if you are interested.",

      "Content": "The med I take to reduce hot flashes is Venlafaxine ER 37.5 mg capsule. I think that is a generic named product, but not sure. The product is actually a med to combat depression. I recently had an annual physical with my family doctor. I told him my HT has affected my temperament, in that I have reduced patience in dealing with people. I have to watch myself to not verbally snap at my wife over trivial problems. My doc thinks that is a symptom of depression, so he increased Venlafaxine to 75 mg strength. I am glad to say that it is helping me. I feel less intense. Control of hot flashes remains the same. Suggest you do a google search of side effects of Eligard, Lupron, and firmagon. I think all three are the same, just different manufacturers. There are probably a dozen side effects to the med. It is important to know what they are, should you continue on HT, and be prepared to deal with them. One of the most important things is to take calcium, with vitamin D to combat bone loss while on HT. It is also important to get lots of exercise to keep your muscle strength up, and to feel better about yourself. As said in my last post, HT is not easy, but do-able. Far better to be on HT now, with a better chance of gaining a cure, then to have biological occurrence, and therefore relegated to hormone therapy for the rest of your life. I keep thinking that all forms of prostate cancer treatment is crude and barbaric, and wish all cancer patients could live their lives 50 years in the future. Treatment most certainly will be so much better by then. For now, all we can do, is complete the treatments offered to us, and hope and pray for the best.",

      "Content": "My treatment for Pca has progressed much like yours, with a gleason score of 7. I had Pca in seminal vessels, but none detected in lymph nodes, though doctor thought otherwise. I had 8 weeks of radiation Had RP, three months later had psa of 2.1, month later psa 2.2. So doctor started on Eligard hormone thereapy injections, which is the same stuff as firmagon, just a different name brand. I am now 17 months on Eligard, and still doing the hot flashes. I, too, gave strong thought of bailing out of HT, but then read on line the significant statistical increase of not getting biological occurrence of PCA, when HT is given for 18 to 24 months. The reasoning is that HT does not kill any remaining Pca cells, but causes a huge testosterone reduction, which causes Pca cells to go into hibernation, not replicate, and turn old and die off. With that information, I decided to continue on HT for the best chance of a cure. My doc says I have an 80% chance of a cure. If Pca does reoccur, doc says I will be on hormone therapy for the rest of my life. At present my psa is undectible. My advise is go the long route of HT, though it is not easy, but do-able. It gives you that much better of a chance for a cure. There is a med I take to reduces number of hot flashes, and there intensity. I will discuss if you are interested.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by RobLee When you say stage 3, I assume you mean you were either T3a or T3b. Hopefully the eight weeks of radiation cleaned up whatever cancer may have remained following your RP. That's what it was supposed to do anyway, not necessarily the Eligard. The HT is intended to keep your PSA down between RP and SRT (or at least, that's how I understand it's supposed to work). Also tenderize the cancer cells so to speak.. it starves them of that tasty testosterone they love so much. It's a bit disappointing that some of the more knowledgeable guys haven't replied yet. Hopefully they will soon. If you could provide your exact pathology... margins, LNI, SVI or whatever, that might help. I have never seen a pathology report. My surgeon urologist is not very communicative, which I don't like. Last week I got a second opinion from another urologist. Best investment of time and $40 copay ever. Learned my status is PT3B, with probable positive margins, since PCa escaped from the capsule. Since I just completed adjuvent radiation, while on Eligard, and projected another 18 months on Eligard by my doc, it is, impossible to tell if the radiation killed off remaining PC cells. Last blood test showed psa <.0l, so Eligard is working well for me. At this rate, it will be another 18 months to see if psa rises without Eligard, to judge effectiveness of RT Second opinion doctor advised using Eligard for just a year per latest research. Guess, I could go this route, and if psa starts rising, then it is back on Eligard, and I would know that RT did not leave me cancer free. I may switch my care to the second opinion doctor beginning the first of the year. I have to wait until then, as my current Medicare supplement has second opinion doc as \"out of network.\" Currently having problems from the radiation. It burns to take a leak, and has been this way for about 2 weeks. I gave a urine sample at a lab for testing for infection, but feel sure that the radiation is the cause. I hope to hear back from radiation oncologist soon, and what can be done. Hope this condition is short lived. Nothing is easy in the treatment of PCa.",

I had 8 weeks of radiation, 5 days a week, and saw my radiation doctor once a week for discussion and updates. I am guessing this is standard practice, so there is your opportunity to speak with your doctor, now, or within a week. I had the rectal balloon installed before each treatment to move a good portion of the bowel out of the way of the radiation. I think it helped. Some doctors subscribe to the balloon others don't. In your case, it may help. Your one injection in abdomen that is supposed to be good for 6 months is most likely Eligard hormone therapy. That is being given to help make radiation treatment more effective in treatment of cancer cells. Suggest you do a google search of Eligard to learn about its side effects, should you experience some. Most common side effect is hot flashes. Another side effect is increased depletion of calcium from the bone. I take calcium/vitamin D pills to counteract the problem. You may want to do this as well. Hang in there with your radiation. I know it becomes a drag, and comes to feel like a part time job. However, the days and weeks pass quickly, and then you are done with it. Good luck, and God bless.",

      "Content": "As others have posted, you should discuss these problems with the radiation doctor. I had 8 weeks of radiation, 5 days a week, and saw my radiation doctor once a week for discussion and updates. I am guessing this is standard practice, so there is your opportunity to speak with your doctor, now, or within a week. I had the rectal balloon installed before each treatment to move a good portion of the bowel out of the way of the radiation. I think it helped. Some doctors subscribe to the balloon others don't. In your case, it may help. Your one injection in abdomen that is supposed to be good for 6 months is most likely Eligard hormone therapy. That is being given to help make radiation treatment more effective in treatment of cancer cells. Suggest you do a google search of Eligard to learn about its side effects, should you experience some. Most common side effect is hot flashes. Another side effect is increased depletion of calcium from the bone. I take calcium/vitamin D pills to counteract the problem. You may want to do this as well. Hang in there with your radiation. I know it becomes a drag, and comes to feel like a part time job. However, the days and weeks pass quickly, and then you are done with it. Good luck, and God bless.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by PDV Rooster, one thing I and many others have found is that, post op, when you have to go, you really have to go. Without that second brake Chuck mentioned, the feeling of urgency can be acute and you need to take care of it ASAP. I peed the bed once in the first month. I had a hard time with the pads chaffing my junk so I didn't use them at all after three weeks but I did answer every call to pee urgently. The only time I peed the bed again was when I took an Adavan to help me sleep three months post op and slept through my bladder's wake up call. That being said, I believe the majority of guys return to full continence. In my case it was relatively quickly, other than pee coming out during orgasm. That took a half year or so to stop. My surgeon said he was able to spare a good urethra stem and predicted incontinence would resolve quickly and it did. Good luck. I can really get a sense of the second brake missing. It feels like urinary control is now located only at the base of my penis. Now when I urinate, the flow seems to drop straight down about 10 inches in a hurry from the bladder with a high degree of force for expulsion. The first time I peed with a rather full bladder, it surprised me how fast and forceful the urine stream was. I can't remember emptying my bladder so fast. I now fell qualified to put out small forest fires in California at a moments notice. So far my bladder control is not bad, mostly just some squirts at odd times. I remain continent sleeping at night, getting maybe once or twice at night to hit the john. Yes, I do now pay attention to urgency to relieve myself. If I feel a need to go, then it is time to go NOW. If I wait, I will beginning squirting. Thanks for all the great advise and encouragement.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by HighlanderCFH Your incontinence is a classically standard sign of a normal recovery. With many, it takes considerable time for full continence to return. As for the plumbing... In the \"factory manufactured\" male urination plumbing arrangement, there are three \"brakes\" that control urine. As we are born, we are equipped with the sphincter muscle where the bladder is connected to the urethra. That is the first brake that helps provide continence and control urine flow. The second brake is the prostate, itself, since the urethra goes through the center of the prostate. The third one is the sphincter muscle at the base of the penis where the urethra emerges from the bottom of the prostate. If I'm not mistaken (hopefully I don't have this backwards), the sphincter at the base of the bladder is called the \"internal\" one and the one at the base of the penis is the \"external\" one. During a standard prostatectomy, the prostate removal, of course, removes one of those brakes. Usually, the sphincter at the top of the prostate (where it connects to the bladder) is also removed. As a result, the patient is left with only the one sphincter, at the base of the penis, to hold urine back and also control its flow. This is in conjunction with the urethra being reattached to the bladder (the bladder is gently moved downward to fill the gap where the prostate once lived) without the bladder sphincter that was removed during the surgery. Basically, the female plumbing system comes from the \"factory\" with only that one sphincter -- the same one that males are left with after surgery. So, in effect, a man is no worse off than a female after going through the surgery. It also shows why many females must do the Kegel exercises after giving birth, etc. This muscle, by nature, is not a very strong muscle, though, and too many Kegel reps can tend to weaken it. So it is important to not overdo the Kegel exercises. In fact, Mayo Clinic advises prostatectomy patients to do only a total of 7 (just seven individual squeezings) per day -- and to do them most every day for life. Hope this helps a bit. Thanks Highlander, I can tell you know what you are talking about. Your medical knowledge, and discussion helps me understand continence problems a lot better now.",

Like many on this forum, my continence is a lot better in the morning and then deteriorates in the late afternoon/evening. I even have great days and not so great days. I'm going through 2-3 pull ups a day (I call them 'man wraps') because I'm still too freaked out to go with just pads. While all of this is frustrating, I know its most likely temporary and I continue to focus on the fact that the cancerous prostate is long gone! After reading the sticky post about the Mayo kegel regimen, I've been following that process. All the best to you! Agree that the Mayo Kegel advise is good. Like you, I am continent during the day, but after dinner I am getting tired, and start loosing the conscientious effort to tighten up the floor muscle to control continent. Then next, I find myself squiring unexpectedly. I have learned to immediately go to the bathroom to relieve myself. It surprises me that I can pee quite a lot, and have no sense that my bladder is getting full. Seems like loosing the prostate diminishes the feeling of the bladder filling up. Don't know if I need to get used to this happening, or with healing some sense of how full the bladder is becoming will return to my brain. Like you, not proud to be wearing \"pull ups,\" but that is the new reality for a while or longer. Just need to have a mind adjustment to get used to the new reality. Like you, glad the prostate is history. Good luck to your continued recovery.",

      "Content": "I had the balloon after a protatectomy. It was highly recommended by my radiation oncologist. I am glad I had it. I will never know how much it helped to move a portion of the rectum out of the way from radiation, but I can say I had no rectal problems after radiation. It is a little uncomfortable having the balloon devise installed, but once installed, it is not uncomfortable at all. As others have said, it is important to gain as much continence as possible before radiation, as I was told, and others have said, that radiation stops any further improvement in continence control. In my case, I slid back a little bit in continence control, but I can live with little dribble drops once in a while, and an occasional minor squirt upon sneezing or coughing. Often hormone therapy is started a month or two prior to radiation. That is what my doctor did for me. There is evidence that hormone therapy \"softens up\" prostate cancer cells, so that the radiation is more effective in treating the pc cells. Also, hormone therapy is known to put pc cells into hibernation, so they don't divide and spread. This hibernation period also gives you time to work on your keegles to improve continence. You don't have to rush into radiation. It was 6 months post surgery, that I started my 8 weeks of radiation. Plenty of time to get my continence under control. Lastly, be aware that small radiation treatment centers, often in small towns, do not have the latest and greatest radiation equipment, as most often found in large metro hospitals. Older equipment is just not as good as newer equipment. The control of the radiation beam is not as good. A friend of mine has a job of calibrating cancer radiation equipment. His advise to me was to find a radiation department that uses the Varian rapid arc equipment, not the older equipment that radiates on a herky jerky stop and go zapping basis. That is what I did, and am glad I followed his advise. Good luck to you. Ask us more questions, we are glad to help you. Don't be intimidated about asking your doctor as much as possible. After all, it is your health, and life that is on the line, not his or hers.",

This continued to get even worse after completion of radiation. Both the radiation MD, and my urology doctor thought I had developed blockage in my urethra and bladder. I had out patient surgery to correct this supposed problem, but surgeon found nothing wrong. Urologist had me drinking lots of water, and taking meds that turned my urine orange. The \"orange\" drug did not help. At this point the pain was really bad, and lasted for several months until doctor said to take 2 Aleve in the morning, and 2 Aleve in the evening. This was a far higher dose then what is prescribed on the med bottle. However, this worked and cured my problem within 3 days of taking Aleve. I stopped taking Aleve after one week because of my concern regarding potential damage to my liver or kidneys. I have had no problems since. I, and my urologist finally concluded my urethra was \"cooked\" from the radiation. As stated, everyone responds different to radiation. I hope your problem quiets down. Suggest drinking plenty of water to keep flushing out your system. This dilutes your urine, and decrease the burning pain urination. Take care, I hope it gets better for you.",

      "Content": "Had a couple of discussions regarding incontinence before and after my Da Vinci. Dr. told me that my BPH (enlarged prostate) was pressing on my urethra. This causes the slower stream of urine, but the restriction also helps towards continence. Over time your body gets use to the BPH restriction, and as a result the muscles don't have to work so hard to contain the urine, and are happy to be weak and lazy. I don't think I had ever read about this anywhere on this forum. Now removing the prostate is a game changer, it is off to do Kegel exercises to strengthen those weak muscles. The doctor may have also said something else about the prostate having another bladder control feature, but I can't remember any specifics. If so, with removal that feature is gone too. In my case, I am 13 days post Da Vinci. I am having some trouble staying dry. If I sneeze, or cough, or pass gas, I will squirt urine in a hurry. I am learning to tighten up muscles before these things happen. I also am not continent when I am tired, or not feeling well with a head ache. Discussion after surgery, my surgeon said that I have a longer then usual tube extending from the bottom of the bladder, and that it is more muscular then normal. So, he said I should not have much difficulty getting continent. Well, I am sticking with the Kegels, still it is a small inconvenient price to pay for getting rid of a cancerous prostate. The Da Vinci surgery is a blessing.",

I will never know how much it helped to move a portion of the rectum out of the way from radiation, but I can say I had no rectal problems after radiation. It is a little uncomfortable having the balloon devise installed, but once installed, it is not uncomfortable at all. As others have said, it is important to gain as much continence as possible before radiation, as I was told, and others have said, that radiation stops any further improvement in continence control. In my case, I slid back a little bit in continence control, but I can live with little dribble drops once in a while, and an occasional minor squirt upon sneezing or coughing. Often hormone therapy is started a month or two prior to radiation. That is what my doctor did for me. There is evidence that hormone therapy \"softens up\" prostate cancer cells, so that the radiation is more effective in treating the pc cells. Also, hormone therapy is known to put pc cells into hibernation, so they don't divide and spread. This hibernation period also gives you time to work on your keegles to improve continence. You don't have to rush into radiation. It was 6 months post surgery, that I started my 8 weeks of radiation. Plenty of time to get my continence under control. Lastly, be aware that small radiation treatment centers, often in small towns, do not have the latest and greatest radiation equipment, as most often found in large metro hospitals. Older equipment is just not as good as newer equipment. The control of the radiation beam is not as good. A friend of mine has a job of calibrating cancer radiation equipment. His advise to me was to find a radiation department that uses the Varian rapid arc equipment, not the older equipment that radiates on a herky jerky stop and go zapping basis. That is what I did, and am glad I followed his advise. Good luck to you. Ask us more questions, we are glad to help you. Don't be intimidated about asking your doctor as much as possible. After all, it is your health, and life that is on the line, not his or hers.",

Before surgery I did a good number of keegles, but after surgery, the sphincter was too sore to do keegles, and has continued to be too sore to do keegles. Fortunately, I have not had trouble regaining continence, but the soreness continues at the sphincter. It is made much worse after a normal, not hard, bowel movement. That activity really irritates the sphincter to the point that it aches severely with time. I now have to apply an ice pack to control the pain. It seems like I have swelling at the site, so passing urine is becoming more difficult. Seems like I have to push and squeeze the urine out. Anyone experience this problem?? I see my uro surgeon tomorrow for a 5-6 week check up and blood test. This problem will be at the top of my list of what to do. Thanks for any advise.",

The surgeon will recommend surgery, the radiation group will recommend external beam radiation, so you are still left on your own. Suggest you read the stick notes at the start of this forum regarding radiation and surgery from those who have been there. The down side of both is that they will heavily impact your sex life negatively. You may want to look into brachytherapy as a possibility.

I also learned that being on ADT for a 2 years, then stopping treatment, it will take a year for Leigard/Lupron to leave your body. Also, at that point, your body may only recover the ability to produce at a 20% testosterone level, that it produced prior to ADT.

      "Content": "A support group based in Canada has excellent information for those on ADT. They offer a book, as well as offer a webinar program. I joined their webinar educational program presentation via the \"go to meeting\" format last Wednesday. It was an excellent hour and a half program detailing the effects, and side effects of ADT with things I did not know, like ADT can be the cause of emotional irritability. I also learned that being on ADT for a 2 years, then stopping treatment, it will take a year for Leigard/Lupron to leave your body. Also, at that point, your body may only recover the ability to produce at a 20% testosterone level, that it produced prior to ADT. The Canadian group can be found by Googling \"Life on ADT,\" or http://www.lifeonadt.com/ I highly recommend joining their educational presentation via \"go to meeting.\" They ask that both you and your partner attend the webinar meeting together.",

      "Content": "Keep up the low psa scores. They are just what you want to see. I had an incisional hernia after RALP. It is not uncommon. I decided to have it repaired, as I felt it could only get worse, though it was not bothering me. The surgery was done as out patient under general anesthesia via arthroscopic. Just three hoses in my abdomen were used to install plastic mesh. It has to be my easiest surgery ever. Really hardly any pain, registered about a 1 or a 2 pain level. Went home put an ice pack on my abdomen, and went to sleep. The next day just minimal soreness, The second day I felt good as new. Really did not need the narcotic pain pills. Quickly went to Tylenol. My surgeon urologist referred me to a general surgeon for the hernia repair. I asked the doc before surgery if I could get a copy of the surgery video. He said he doesn't video, but would get me pictures of the surgery. At out patient departure, I was given 4 still pictures of my surgery in color. All were pictures of the mess insertion inside my abdomen. Pretty interesting how the mesh is \"tacked\" into place with tiny rivets. They dissolve away in about 9 months, during which time scar tissue grows in and around the mesh to hold it in place. If you do the surgery, find a doc who will do the surgery arthroscopically, much easier recovery then having it done by the open surgery method.",

It was an unbelievably easy surgery, had minimal pain, used an ice pack only for one day. On day two, I felt really good, was back to doing anything I wanted. Used pain pills first day only, aspirin for another day afterwards. Advise getting hernia repaired. It won't get any better left along, only potentially worse.",

      "Content": "Had posted earlier about development of much pain that seemed to get worse beginning at week 5. At week 6, saw my surgeon who said the problem lie with the rejoining of the urethra to the bladder. My rejoining developed a problem for reasons unknown. He said to take it easy, and it should get better on its own. Well it did not, and after struggling with the burning pain for 2 weeks, I met again with my surgeon yesterday. He put me back on a Foley catheter for 2 weeks, and said things should heal. Two of the physician's assistants said that my problem just sometimes happens, and weren't surprised that I was still encountering the problem 8 weeks post surgery. They had treated a number of patients with the same problem. Both assistants said I will fully recover with some time to heal. The doc did another cystocopy on me before inserting the catheter. From having my first cystocopy two weeks prior, I was not looking forward to the procedure again with pain level 7 intensity. That was torture. This time on my own, I took 2 codeine based pain pills just prior to going to his office to curb the pain. I was glad I did, as pain level intensity dropped to a tolerable 4 level. It just seems to me that uro doctors don't have a great concern for patient pain for procedures done in their office. Just my humble opinion.",

      "Content": "Won't ever know if bowling at 4 weeks caused the problem. My surgeon said ok to bowl after 4 weeks, so I went ahead and bowled. I never felt any pain, or discomfort during, or after bowling, so just don't know. Life is now much better with catheter in. All the severe crotch pain is gone, along with the burning pain upon urination. What a relief that is. This Foley catheter is somewhat different from the one installed at time of surgery. Just what the difference is, I am not sure, but it is really not noticeable 90% of the time. Just so much more comfortable using this catheter. I just have to watch how full the travel bag is during the day. I nearly over filled it. I make it a point to lube the penis tip several times during the day, so it does not get irritated as it did with the Foley installed at time of surgery. So far, so good. Thanks for the words of encouragement. I appreciate that.",

      "Content": "From my experience.........lube the tip of the catheter at the end of your Johnson. You can even pull out the catheter tube about a quarter inch or so. When pulled out, lube the tube, then push it back inside your Johnson to better lube yourself. That is far better then just lubbing the very tip of your Johnson. Any time you feel a need, lube the catheter as much and as often as you like. If you change catheter bags, I found it far better to use the small travel bag during all waking hours. I wore shorts, so the catheter empty control valve would just barely stick out the bottom of the shorts. This made it very easy to empty urine, and a lot easier then carrying a bucket around the neighborhood. I did both approaches, and found the small bag much easier to manage. When transferring from small bag to large bag, I found it easier to do so in the bath tub. Any urine spills were much easier to clean up in the bath tub, as opposed to bathroom hard wood floor or carpet. If you are sleeping in a bed alone as I do, I found it better to lay the catheter collection bag on the bed beside me. I used a rubberized mattress cover, so any urine spill would not soak into the mattress. I never had a spill, and found the extra length of the drain tube gave me much more freedom to lay different ways in bed, particularly being able to sleep on my side. I used extra pillows placed on both sides of my body to keep from rolling over or around too much in the bed. Overall this is a much better experience, then hooking the collection bag to the side of the bed rail, or laying it on the floor. It does not allow much body movement in bed. I had to wear a Foley catheter for a total of 21 days over two episodes, so during that time, I had plenty of time to experiment to see what wearing improvements I could find to make Foley catheter life just a little better and easier. Hope some of these ideas help you and others. Get well soon...........Rooster",

Lots of good support from people who care, so hope we can give you good advise and support. You mention in your post that your uro has performed many \"open prostatectomies.\" On your profile you list \"RRP scheduled for 09/14/2016.\" I don't know what RRP stands for, but I hope it is not open prostatectomy. That surgery approach is really old fashion, and really only done if the patient is unable to have Da Vinci type surgery because of previous abdominal surgery, as in hernia repair. The old open surgery will keep you in the hospital as a patient for a week in severe pain. Da Vinci surgery gets you released from the hospital the next day with minimal surgical incision work, and a lot less pain, plus a much quicker recovery. As discussed above, moving to surgery in a hurry is not necessary. You don't have much prostate cancer, and what you have grows very slowly, and you probably would not have much more of it, if tested again at the end of the year. With your minimal cancer amount you may also be a good candidate for one of the radiation approaches. Cure rates are about the same with radiation vs surgery. I suggest you take time to get multiple opinions to decide what is best for you. You have plenty of time to do this. Let us know how you are coming along. We care.",

      "Content": "Radiation treatment does not automatically cause incontinence. Do you have other issues causing incontinence before radiation? A rectal balloon can be installed before each treatment. Not painful, just uncomfortable. It is used to push part of the rectum out of the way of radiation. I used it, and glad I did. Not all docs recommend it, you may have to ask for it. I had a scheduled colonoscopy about 4 months post radiation. The doctor said nothing about seeing anything abnormal, so I don't think that radiation is a factor during colonoscopy. Suggest you go to the Frank Talk Forum. www.franktalk.org That forum deals with primarily ED. I read through their topic on penile implants, and remember one guy posting that he had the implant and AUS. Check it out!",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by HighlanderCFH I'm not sure, but I don't think Cialis would work as far as erections go if the nerves were not spared. However, prostatectomy patients usually are given a one-month supply of it (probably a low, 5 mg dose) to simply help enrich the blood flow to the surgical field. This helps speed up the healing process from the surgery, itself. Afterward, the Cialis probably would not be needed anymore. Once again, I'm not 100% certain, but I think injections would be the route to take in having future erections since the nerves were not spared. Either that or a surgical implant. Good luck! Chuck Highlander............you are spot on with your med knowledge and cialis treatment. Yes, I got the 30 day low 5 mg dose of cialis as you surmised. I am taking the drug as advised, perhaps it will enhance blood flow to aid healing, guess it can't hurt. With nerves NOT spared, no amount of cialis will ever help me achieve a natural woodie. Was surprised that my Urology surgeon called in a massive order of Cialis to my pharmacy without my knowledge. Pharmacy simply called me saying the script was ready for pick up. Cost was to be $379, but have a $200 discount Cialis coupon. This was all arranged prior to surgery. What a waste of $ and Cialis towards treating NON spared nerves. I declined the Cialis order, and felt the doc was too pushy in prescribing the drug. Made me wonder if he has an ulterior motive for prescribing, like being on a rewards program by prescribing Cialis mfg. by Eli Lilly Company, who makes Cialis. Whatever, the Cialis prescription was unwarranted, and not helpful.",

Don't be surprised if Radiation Oncologist will want you to use a rectal balloon during radiation. It is somewhat uncomfortable having it inserted, but once inside, it doesn't feel bad. It really helps push a good portion of the colon out of the path of the radiation beam to keep the colon from being radiated. A good radiation machine is the Varian Rapid Arc.

Still seems strange to have this problem 6 weeks out from Da Vinci.",

      "Content": "When I got \"marked up\" for radiation therapy, I though for sure that I would get the freckle tattoos. But no, my radiation group simply marked me with a permanent felt tip marker, then applied surgical tape over the marking. I was told to leave the tape on, but after a few weeks, it started coming loose. No problem, new tape was applied, and radiation continued. Like others, the \"marks\" were used to line me up on the radiation table via laser beams. I had a custom molded tray created to lay my butt in. That is so you will remain in that position through out the treatment, and not move around. Has the RO promoted your having a rectal balloon installed per each treatment to move a portion of the bowel out of the way during radiation?",

Was told that I would need to be on HT for 3 years but opted out, so far so good. Met with my radiologist MD after radiation therapy. Agree that RT is easier then HT, as rectal baloon is so disagreeable. Radiologist plan in conjunction with my Uro-surgeon is for me to be on Ht (Eligard) for a total period of 2 years. This is because I had a Gleason 5 reading at time of surgery, and PSA started to edge up after surgery. The thought of 2 years of HT is depressing. I am at 5 months of HT, and hate being without testosterone. Doc says at the end of two years, the castrating effects of Eligard have set in, so negligible chance of testosterone recovery after stopping Eligard. The thought of no testosterone for the rest of my life is really depressing. I will be getting a second opinion from another urologist soon to see if 2 years of HT is needed, or if the 2 years is really a medical over kill.",

Some advise regarding the foley catheter. It helps to keep the tube entering your Johnson clean and well lubricated. Don't use rubbing alcohol for cleaning, just some very mild soap. You will be able to withdrawal the catheter tube a little more then a quarter inch. Lube the tube, and gently push the tube back into your Johnson. I did this whenever I felt irritation. Sometimes, I must have lubed the tube about 6 times per day. If you do this, wearing the foley is so much easier, and irritation free. After a while, I would forget that the catheter was still in use. I also found that sleeping with the catheter bag next to me on the bed worked much better then hanging the bag on the side of bed, or resting on the floor. With the bag on the bed, it is so much easier, and convenient to move around in bed. I had a plastic mattress cover on the bed to prevent any urine ever reaching the mattress in case of an accident. I never did have an accident. The bag is still lower then the rest of your body, so you won't have any reverse flow of urine back to your bladder. I never had any problems with urine filling the bag. This was all done with my sleeping alone on a full size bed. Hope my advise is of value, and wish you quick healing.",

It is the hot flashers that are the most bothersome. About 80% of users experience this. I take Venlafaxine to reduce the hot flash effect, and it cuts hot flash intensity by about 50%. The other issue, is that Eligard/Lupron reduces bone calcium. I off set that with calcium pills, but then have constipation issues. The drug is also mood altering. I seem to have less patience with everything and everybody. There is also a strong tendency to put on belly fat. and there is also loss of muscle to some degree, and loss of stamina or endurance.

      "Content": "Originally Posted by MRJ Just a note on the Vasoline: Some sites say it it okay to use and even go as far as to suggest Vasoline as a lubricant for the Foley catheter. Other sites make the case that Vasoline, due to being petroleum based, can damage the catheter. In one study, the effects of 4 different lubes were tried on Foley catheters over the period of 5 days. Each lube was tested with 20 catheters each. At the end of 5 days, there were 20 catheter balloon ruptures, all of them involved the catheters where the Vasoline was used. Yes, petroleum based products like Vaseline can degrade plastic. However, in this case, the use of Vaseline at the tip of your johnson is at a considerable distance from the catheter balloon located inside the bladder. I don't see any possibility that the Vaseline could ever enter the bladder to affect the balloon. When I used the Vaseline, I saw no damage to the plastic catheter tubing after 10 days of use.",

      "Content": "Bulldog..............I had 8 weeks of EBRT with the rectal balloon. My radiation oncologist in charge of my radiation treatment recommended it. I am glad it was incorporated into my treatment. It is designed to move a portion of the colon out of the path of the radiation treatment, thus saving a portion from unnecessary radiation. The insertion of the balloon devise is not painful, just somewhat uncomfortable. Once installed, there is no discomfort at all. Sometimes during radiation, I would fall asleep, to give you an idea of no discomfort. After a while, the daily insertion of the balloon becomes normal to what you expect of the treatment. There is a difference among techs, as to who inserts the balloon. Some are really good at it, so it is gently inserted easily, while others have a rougher technique, which you will learn not to appreciate. It did not take long for me to learn who was the gentalist, and I would ask that, that tech install the balloon. The removal of the balloon is super easy, and not uncomfortable at all. EBRT becomes like a part time job, in that you get a treatment Monday thru Friday. I generally would show up about 45 minutes prior to my appointment, so I could better regulate having a full bladder. If needed to fill bladder more, I would drink more water, if too full, I would go to the bathroom to pee for just 2 or 3 seconds. Often, I would get my treatment prior to appointment time, which was alright with me. Good luck with your radiation. It is not difficult. I think you will easily adjust to having the balloon installed.",

      "Content": "Met with my uro-surgeon last Thursday. I had Da Vinci 3 months ago, with a slow painful recovery because of lymphocels. I am healing much better now, but latest PSA test produced a 0.22 read out. Doc says that number denotes I still have some PCa. Latest plan is to receive Eligard injections once a month for 6 months. This will put the PCa into remission, and give my surgery additional time to heal, before receiving radiation to kill off PCa. Doctor said side effects of reduced testosterone produced by Eligard, is hot flashes, fatigue, and low sexual desire. At an Eligard website, I found additional effects listed, with numerical percentages. Hot flashes -- in up to 73.3 percent of people Injection site reactions, including mild pain, burning, and stinging -- up to 34.6 percent Fatigue and general discomfort -- up to 17.5 percent Decreased testicle size -- up to 7.2 percent Muscle pain -- up to 4.5 percent Dizziness -- up to 4.4 percent Clamminess -- up to 4.4 percent Weakness -- up to 3.6 percent Breast enlargement -- up to 3.6 percent Nausea -- up to 3.4 percent Joint pain -- up to 3.4 percent. Other common reactions, occurring in 2.2 to 3.3 percent of people, included: Decreased libido (decreased sex drive) Night sweats Pain in the arms or legs Frequent need to urinate Itching Stomach and intestinal irritation (\"stomach flu\") Getting up in the middle of the night to urinate Hair loss Testicular pain. I would like to hear any testimonials from anyone who has received Eligard. Thanks...........Rooster22",

      "Content": "As mentioned in second thread on same subject, I failed to mention that Eligard was the drug for hormone treatment. I got to thinking some users would not know that. I don't think my uro/surgeon failed. I knew in advance of surgery, that it was likely that my PCa had spread a little out of my prostate, and that radiation would be most likely to kill off any cancer cells remaining in the pelvic area. My slow recovery from surgery with lymphocel pain, an additional 2 weeks of Foley Cather, plus 2 illnesses during recovery all add up to the doctor saying that another six months of healing is in my best interest before radiation. The hormone therapy is a way to put the PCa into sleep mode remission, and to stop, or at least slow down cancer growth. I trust my doctor's plan, and trust I will beat PC with time. Thanks fl drifter (David) for your testimonial of your 6 month experience with hormone therapy. None of the side effects sound good, but at least manageable. I have already promised myself to fight through any fatigue, control my diet against gaining weight, and resigned myself to no sex drive. I do hope if my testes shrink, that they will return to normal in due time. I also hope my testosterone level will rebound to normal.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by white08gt Well, I had all the side effects listed in your first post. You will not have any testosterone, it will be zero. Do the monthly shots, definitely don't take the 6 month. I opted out of HT some 6 months following SRT. My PSA has been <0.05 for close to 2 years and testosterone is in 200s and has not rebounded as have the twins. I will take your advise regarding a monthly shot vs the shot good for 6 months. I just started the monthly shot last week, so side effects are probably weeks ahead for me. If side effects get to troublesome, I may opt out early from the 6 month recommendation given me by the doctor. The doctor told me that the reason for the HT is to give me extra time to recover from the DaVinci surgery about 3 months ago. I may not need the extra healing time before starting radiation therapy to kill off cancer cells not removed during surgery. Also, the thought of testicle size reduction, and potential low testosterone production after HT is not something I want to be left with. I have started taking the calcium and vitamin D supplements to help prevent bone weakening",

      "Content": "Bulldog, unsure what you mean by SBRT. What type of treatment is this? Regarding ADT, there is an excellent sticky note that is the second from the top listing of topics, when signing on to this forum. It is titled........\"What I Need to Know About HT\", which is ADT. Myself, I have been on ADT for 15 months of an 18 month sentence. It is tolerable, but uncomfortable with daily hot flashes, some fatigue, and loss of endurance. It really depends on how long you will be on ADT to feel side effects. The longer, the more side effects encountered. Beyond maybe 6 months, it is a battle of watching your diet. If you are less active, then reduce your calorie intake, or you will put on weight, and all that weight will become belly fat. It is important to stay active, with weight bearing exercise to ward off bone loss, and the weight gain. Also, ADT can affect your temperament. I don't have much patience now, and am irritable at times. Again, exercise will help your temperament, so best to be active. There are a host of other side effects, that are not as common. Reading the sticky note, will tell you about them. I had surgery, not seeds, so I have no knowledge regarding see treatment. Good luck, I hope all goes well.",

      "Content": "Saw this response to another thread, and thought it may be of value to your..................... Given the low volume you have, you may want to consider another option between AS and surgery: focal HIFU, which is sometimes called a \"male lumpectomy\" where the tumor is ablated (i.e., cooked) via ultrasound, but most of the remaining prostate is spared and remains functional. I've posted information on HIFU under the \"Sticky\" at the top of the page if you would like to review the pros and cons. I reviewed the panel discussion on HIFU at the AUA conference, and there seems to be more enthusiasm for focal HIFU than for HIFU of the entire prostate. Focal was not an option for me because both lobes had tumors, but if I had only 5% involved, I would have investigated that treatment. If you do decide to look into HIFU, I strongly encourage you to seek out a urologist who has had substantial experience in HIFU. The procedure was only approved by the FDA in Oct. 2015 (although approved in Europe and Japan for 10-15 years) and lots of urologists are now offering HIFU. The US uro's with the most experience were doing HIFU treatment before 10/15 by doing treatments in Bemuda and other Carribean locations",

He advised me where to go for treatment, because they had the latest state of the art equipment. He advised getting treatment with the Varian Rapid Arc equipment. You may want to consider asking each center what equipment they have. Also, it is important to know that radiation equipment, and technique has advanced considerably in the past 15 years. Now, the equipment focuses very precisely, with less radiation to internal organs. Ask to have the rectal balloon if available. That helps protect the colon from radiation. Be aware that radiation is done with a nearly full to full bladder, so driving a long distance can be a bladder concern. Weeks of radiation gets to feel like a part time job. Time passes quicker then you may think, and then you are done. Hope all goes well.",

I never bothered to tell the doctor about taking the pain pills, as I didn't think he was interested in my pain. As far as using a Foley catheter, I found it better to lube the tip of your johnson with any type of cream including vasoline. Do so any time you start to feel irritation. For me, I was probably lubbing 6-8 times per day. It helps to slightly pull out the catheter slightly until resistance is met. Clean the crud that forms on the catheter tube, lube the tube and end of your johnson, then with light pressure push the tube back into your johnson. Doing that made life so much better. Don't know why someone at doc's office didn't offer that advise. All that was said, was keep the tip clean, and use some cream.",

      "Content": "IMHO, you won't have that much actual pain after the Da Vinci, but your abdomen will be very sore for about the first 3 days. All pain comes from abdominal soreness. You will probably spend one night at the hospital. Ask for an abdominal wrap from a nurse. It will be about 12\" wide, and wraps around your abdomen and fastens upon itself with velcro. It helps a lot to limit movement in your abdomen, and thus reduce pain. For the first few days, you will not want to cough or sneeze, as it will cause a lot of pain. If you feel a sneeze coming on, use both hands to push in your abdomen to help control the pain. On my bed, I added an extra mattress on top of my existing mattress to raise the height of the bed to make it easy to enter and exit. The issue is that it is painful to bend down much that first three days. Standard instruction is to lay the catheter bag on the floor next to the bed. I did that for a while, but found it easier to move around on the bed with the catheter bag lying next to me on the bed. I used a rubberized water proof mattress cover in case of any leakage, but never had a problem. I slept alone in a bed, so for me, I positioned myself more towards the center of the bed, and used pillows on both sides of my body to keep from rolling over, so I could sleep on my back. Within a few days, I was able to sleep on my side, and roll over a bit. The catheter bag lying beside me on the bed gave me plenty of urine drainage tube length to move around. I sleep a lot better on my side, so I was glad to be able to figure that out. Use stool softners and laxatives frequently when taking any codeine based pain reliever, as codeine will make you constipated. Failure to do so will result in a hard stool that will be painful and difficult to pass. Try to walk as much as you can immediately following surgery, and during the first week following surgery. This helps to clear your lungs to ward off potential pneumonia and blood clots. When walking my neighborhood with the large urinary bag, I used a cloth shopping bag with cloth handles to carry the bag. It looked a lot better, and was easier then using a bucket with a bail handle. Overall, Da Vinci is not that bad. It is not that painful, and recovery is mostly over by the end of the first week. Good luck on your surgery, we are all here to help you.",

Immunotherapy is where cancer will be cured at the cellular level in the future. Until then, cancer treatment is crude and barbaric in MHO.

Twenty-five years from now, people will look back at 2017 cancer treatment in dismay. I am on ADT to kill off suspected stray cells, but not sure ADT really kills cancer cells, but really just puts them into hibernation, so they don't grow and spread. Maybe existing cancer cells simply die off with ADT from old age.",

I remember how sore my abdomen was in this regard, when recovering from umbilical hernia surgery years back. I am doing DaVinci surgery on August 3rd. and strongly suspect much worse soreness abdominal pain compared to the hernia recovery. I am thinking of using snow ski poles to help hoist myself out of a chair, or up from a bed. I have practiced this a few times with the ski poles, and the strain on the abdomen is much reduced when using your shoulder muscles to pull yourself up. Has anyone tried this, or similar after DaVinci?? I have given some thought about sleeping on a recliner as suggested on this forum, but with my wife is recovering from knee replacement surgery, and she will be unable to move the recliner from the reclined position to regular upright chair position.

      "Content": "Finished 8 weeks of RT in mid April, after RT last August of 16. Last week of RT felt irritation upon urination. A week after finishing RT irritation became burning pain, then within a few weeks it became pelvic pain. After my urologist ran tests, he could not find anything wrong. To me, it was becoming pretty obvious the problem was from the RT. Pretty sure the problem is with the urethra only, specifically at the sphincter muscle. My bladder seems unaffected. The very small area just felt \"cooked\" inside and out. Just a week ago, my uro doctor had me start taking Alive, 2 tablets in the morning, 2 tablets at night. I am surprised the burning pain subsided greatly within 24 hours. After a week, I am now down to one Aleve in the morning, one Aleve at night. My remaining issue now is occasional bouts of intense need to urinate even when my bladder is not full. Seems worse when I bend over at the waist. Has anyone else had this side effect from RT? If so, how long did it last before fading away? Thanks, Rooster2",

      "Content": "Sounds like you have had a Foley catheter installed. Hard to believer you left the doctor's office without someone giving you a tube of lube to be used as a lube where the tube enters your penis. Most any kind of ointment helps, even Vasoline to take away the irritation. My last Foley was installed for 2 weeks, and the lube became my best friend. What works great is to know that the tube can be withdrawn maybe up to a third of an inch by gently pulling on the tube. Once pulled out, coat the tube with an ointment, and gently push it back into your penis. Doing this pulls the lube back inside of your pecker to soothe the irritation. Do this as often as you feel irritation. When applied often, a crud will tend to build up on the tube. When tube is pulled outward, clean off the crud with water and a kleenex, then apply more lubricant. Don't use alcohol to clean the tube. Once you start using lube, you won't need the pain killers you are taking. Using lots of lube, I found it stopped all irritation, and I would forget I had the Foley in me. I also found it a lot easier to sleep by putting the urine catch bag beside me in bed. Having it on the floor beside the bed was too movement restrictive for me. I never had a problem of urine leakage on the mattress. Hope my advise helps!",

      "Content": "Glad to hear that things are going well. Some advise regarding the foley catheter. It helps to keep the tube entering your Johnson clean and well lubricated. Don't use rubbing alcohol for cleaning, just some very mild soap. You will be able to withdrawal the catheter tube a little more then a quarter inch. Lube the tube, and gently push the tube back into your Johnson. I did this whenever I felt irritation. Sometimes, I must have lubed the tube about 6 times per day. If you do this, wearing the foley is so much easier, and irritation free. After a while, I would forget that the catheter was still in use. I also found that sleeping with the catheter bag next to me on the bed worked much better then hanging the bag on the side of bed, or resting on the floor. With the bag on the bed, it is so much easier, and convenient to move around in bed. I had a plastic mattress cover on the bed to prevent any urine ever reaching the mattress in case of an accident. I never did have an accident. The bag is still lower then the rest of your body, so you won't have any reverse flow of urine back to your bladder. I never had any problems with urine filling the bag. This was all done with my sleeping alone on a full size bed. Hope my advise is of value, and wish you quick healing.",

      "Content": "both my uro doc, and RO thought I had a urethra stricture, or a mass in my bladder as the cause of the problem. So had that \"looked into\" under general anesthesia for out patient surgery. I came to thinking I would have a foley catheter to put up with, and the problem solved. But no, doc found nothing wrong. So, had a CT scan and body bone scan. All results were negative. Only thing really left was to think the problem was caused by radiation. At that point my doc said to drink lots of water. I found that helped the dysuria, I already knew that if I became dehydrated, as was mandated for the out patient surgery, that the pain would be terrific. Upon getting prepped for surgery, the pain was so bad, that I was given to shots of morphine in the saline drip tube to control the pain. I think my problem is rather rare. I have read several cancer forums, and no one has had my problem. Still, if anyone knows about this, I would like to hear from them. I am still not over this problem, and would like to know how much more time it will take to end this recovery episode.",

      "Content": "Saw my uro surgeon for 3 month visit. I asked him what the slight lump was on my abdomen. He said it is a small hernia, that has developed at the site at or near the incision. It is small, doesn't hurt. Doctor thought it best to see a surgeon for an opinion of what to do, or not do. Well that is like asking your minister his advisement on members attending church service on Sunday. We all know what that answer to that will be. I had an umbilical hernia repaired years ago, so I know it is no big deal having out patient surgery for a repair. So, will probably get advised to get it fixed, because it could get larger, and cause a big problem in the future. I have read that RALP could result in a hernia, but don't think I have ever read on this forum of it happening. I did not do any heavy lifting, or strenuous exercise to cause the hernia, it just happened. Still, it is prudent to advise against activity that could cause a hernia while healing.",

Lube the tube, and the end of your johnson and gently push the tube back into your johnson. The problem seems to be that guys don't lube often enough. At the first sign of any irritation, I would lube asap. As a result, I had minimal irritation, and didn't mind the Foley. Sometimes, I was lubbing 6-8 times a day. That worked great for me.",

I was told that it is unusual for the Lymphocele to fill up again with lymph fluid. Usually a single drain is all that is needed. From what I read, a Lymphocele can get infected, but not very likely, and don't think it will burst. Oh, re-read your original post. You already have a drain tube inserted. The doc will probably removed the tube, if nothing more is draining out. Your burning up peeing is what I had after 8 weeks of radiation. My uro-surgeon told me to drink lots and lots of water.

      "Content": "Yes, I developed two Lymphoceles about 2 months after RP. Mine were very low in my abdomen. One of the Lymphocele pressed on a nerve to cause a lot of pain. It took my doc a while to figure out what was causing my pain. Treatment was done by inserting two drain tubes into the Lymphoceles. Lynocaine injection, and an IV with a pain killer were used at time of tube insertion. This was done under a cat scan, so doc could accurately insert the needle to the right spot. It was nearly painless. Unfortunately, after draining, the Lymphoceles filled back up with fluid, twice more, and had to be drained twice more. The last two sessions, the doc injected something into the Lymphoceles to seal off further drainage. That finally ended the Lymphoceles, and the pain. Lymphocele is something I had never heard of before. It is not very common according to my uro-surgeon, but do occur, when lymph nodes are removed during an RP. Somehow, the surgeon fails to seal off all lymph involved, so that is the source of the fluid leakage. Good luck to you on the 6th. It is pretty much an easy out patient procedure. It was easy to get up, and walk out of the hospital, with no pain or restrictions afterwards.",

      "Content": "Southsider.............IMHO, It is my understanding that ADT \"buys time\" by keeping cancer cells from replicating. However, often, ofter 2-3 years, cancer cells can mutate, so that they become hormone resistant. At that point, ADT ceases to work, and another approach is needed to curb cancer growth. So, yes, I think ADT has great value, and should not be delayed if psa starts rising. What is Doctor Walsh's opinion of this? I have not read his book.",

      "Content": "Southsider.............IMHO, It is my understanding that ADT \"buys time\" by keeping cancer cells from replicating. However, often, ofter 2-3 years, cancer cells can mutate, so that they become hormone resistant. At that point, ADT ceases to work, and another approach is needed to curb cancer growth. So, yes, I think ADT has great value, and should not be delayed if psa starts rising. What is Doctor Walsh's opinion of this? I have not read his book.",
