    "Content": "My husband has been fighting prostate cancer for years. Needs Zytiga. On Medicare and it will cost $2000per month until he meets catastrophic level. Lots of help if you have commercial insurance,no insurance or,Medicaid. Cannot find anything for middle income on Medicare. He has bone mets and failed Enzalutamide. Only worked one month. We were so hopeful. Enzalutamide had great financial assistant program. He wants to give up now. We cannot afford $2000 a month. I am new to this site and would be grateful for any advice on how to get financial assistance for this drug if you are on Medicare. They have a program that will let you get a coupon to pay only $20/ mo if you have regular insurance. Cannot use if you are on Medicare. Desperate!",
