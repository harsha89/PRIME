      "Content": "Ok, got some additional info this week. I saw my GP on Tuesday, she agreed that I should see my urologist. Went to the urologist Thursday (yesterday). He agreed that 3.4 was a big jump from 0.6 last year. He indicated that the colonoscopy should have no impact on the score. He then did a DRE and said that size wise my prostate was normal for my age, and there were no bumps, lumps, etc. He indicated that the next steps would be to recheck the PSA and if still high then move to biopsy. What bothered me a little is that he then immediately drew blood for the PSA test (this was 5 minutes after the DRE). I thought that was a no-no, but he seemed to indicate it was fine??? So, this morning I checked the docs web portal and my PSA was posted there. It is now 2.86. I called the office to talk to the doc about it, and he is not in on Fridays. So I cannot talk to him until Monday. I am freaking out and not sure if I should be.... On the good side, the number went down from 3.4 and that was even AFTER he did a DRE. If I had cancer, would you expect that this number would drop at all? On the bad side, it is still above the 2.5 threshold that they like to see most people in their 50's under.... I am hoping that since it dropped at least a little (.54 in about 2 weeks time) that this is a good sign?? Thoughts? Thanks for the support, Tom",

      "Content": "Hi, I am new here and hope to get some opinions. I started getting my PSA checked 3 years ago when I turned 50. My first check was 0.3 and my DRE was normal. A year later my PSA was 0.6 and my DRE was normal. I am now 52, and just had my most recent check. My PSA is now 3.4. I did have a colonoscopy on Jan 12 and my PSA test was on Jan 28. I see my GP next week. I will likely head to the urologist as well. Very worried, as expected. Just wondering if you might think the colonoscopy may be the cause of the raised PSA. I know it can have an effect, just not sure how much and for how long? Thanks, Tom",
