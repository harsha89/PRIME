      "Content": "Ok, I've been quiet, waiting to meet with the prostate team at Virginia-Mason in Seattle. I've been taking Finasteride, P-statin and Resolve, two Chinese herbal remedies for tumor shrinkage, the last three weeks. I had a follow-up PSA two days ago and it came back 2.92. The free was 0.500 and percent was 17.12. Much better results that before. My meeting with V-M is next week. We (my wife and I) have pretty much decided on surgery, but these readings are giving us pause. What we have read is that Finasteride and the herbals may help shrink the prostate and alleviate some of the associated urinary difficulties, but that they do not do much for the fact that my biopsy result showed widespread malignancy (11 of 12 samples tested positive). My doctor also told me that most doctors, when faced with this condition, choose surgery over radiation due to the collateral damage always associated with radiation and that 'pinpoint' accuracy is never a sure thing? And because surgery allows the surgeon to look for additional malignancy. Ideas? Opinions? Thanks",

      "Content": "Talked to my urologist this morning and received the detailed biopsy results. Due to the global nature of the tumor(s), his recommendation is to pursue treatment, either surgery or some form of radiation. We (my wife and I) have a MRI scheduled in 6 weeks after the prostate inflammation recedes. If the MRI suggests that the tumor(s) are contained within the prostate, I am leaning toward surgery. My wife has Systemic Exertion Intolerance Disease and has a hard time handling anxiety and stress. Radiation therapy of any kind is 90 miles away. The local hospital as robotic surgery and my urologist has experience with this kind of surgery. I also think I prefer the secondary line of treatment (radiation) if surgery does not get all the cancerous cells as opposed to hormone treatment followed by radiation followed by more hormone and radiation as a secondary approach. But, all of this is our first impressions. As I said above, nothing happens for six weeks and the MRI, unless we decide to discuss other treatment methods. Right now we are digesting everything we learned this morning. Thanks for the posts and suggestions. I hope this helps clarify matters with me. I did paste more info to my sig.",

      "Content": "My husband had DaVinci surgery on March 30th 2016. Although the surgery only took about 3 hrs and went very smoothly, he was in considerable pain which was surprising since he is in very good shape. He is 66. It is a good thing that we stayed in a motel owned by the hospital, because within 3 days he was in horrible pain because his intestines would not restart. He was nauseated so became dehydrated. A couple of employees from emergency came and got him and he spent another 2 nights in the hospital. It was a pretty bad experience. Fortunately after that, he healed quickly and was fine. Today is his first day without pads and he seems to have most of his strength back. Almost hard to believe that he had surgery. We just came home from picking up his results from his 3 month PSA test. We are happy that his numbers are 0.008. Although my husband wasn't on the forum much, I came here a lot during the last 5 months. I didn't post, but I gained comfort from reading the forum. Sometimes what I read frightened me, but for the most part I was happy to be here. You guys are a great group of guys and you are providing a wonderful service to some very frightened folks. Thank-you!",
