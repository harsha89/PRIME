      "Content": "I am a 47 year old man with a strong family history of prostate cancer. I have been getting yearly exams at a urologist with PSA. PSA 2011 0.8, 2014 1.1, 2015 1.25. Last week he said he felt a soft nodule on my prostate and I am having a biopsy tomorrow. He told me that a soft nodule was good and my PSA was low so he optimistic. I've done nothing but cry for 4 days. Every time I shoot basketball with my kids or even in the same room I leave and go to my shop and cry. Is it possible that the soft nodule is just the start of BPH and maybe nothing serious? Thanks",

      "Content": "Thank you all for the reassurance. I feel like a whimp compared to what you guys have been through. I guess the biopsy scares me because I am afraid of the results. My father and two uncles had PC so it makes me very nervous. It is good advice to take one step at a time. I hope I can sleep tonight. I believe the urologist said he is taking 6 samples tomorrow. If it is nothing what would cause a soft nodule? Thanks for listening",
