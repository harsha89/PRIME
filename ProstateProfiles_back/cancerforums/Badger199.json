      "Content": "As I posted last week I have had a prostatectomy (4th March) and was told that I would have to have a catheter in place for 3 weeks. When my appointment came through for a TWOC it was 3 weeks and 5 days later (should be removed today). On phoning the hospital for an admission time I was told they didn't have a bed for me and I now have to wait until Monday ... 4 weeks post surgery. I am already worried about the incontinence and want to begin the kegel exercises again. Is it going to make it worse by leaving the catheter in place for this long? Just about everything has gone wrong - keyhole surgery was abandoned and after 2 hours in theatre the surgeon had to resort to full open surgery, wound opened up after 12 days, urinary infection and now an extra week with catheter. Is anything going to be straightforward for me I wonder!",

      "Content": "Hi, I've joined the forum in my hubbies name so that we can both access and ask questions of the people that have \"been there, done that\". Hubby had his prostatectomy on 4th March, discharged from hospital on 7th after the surgery didn't go to plan. It should have been keyhole but the surgeon said that the prostate was low and tucked behind the pubic bone so open surgery was needed. Anyway, 36 staples later he came home to recuperate. After 10 days the community nurse came out and removed all of the staples. Low and behold the wound opened up top to bottom. Restitching apparently is not an option so he was steristripped and dressings applied. Yesterday the nurse came out again to change dressings and take off some of the strips to find that the wound had opened again. She's packed it with some iodine strips and covered with a dressing again. In the meantime he also has to deal with a catheter which has already been in place for 20 days and not due to be removed until next Friday - another 6 days time. We have also had a catheter malfunction in the middle of the night and found the bed absolutely drenched because the tube had come apart at the junction - not unheard of apparently in the see through tubes. We now put micropore around the junctions to ensure that doesn't happen again. It's all been very stressful and with the wound business it's beginning to affect hubbies state of mind and I am seriously worried that he may fall into a depression. Has anyone else had these type of problems? It would be good to know that there is a light at the end of the tunnel. Oh, also the surgeon phoned and told him to expect to be VERY wet. He is feeling the urge to urinate and we wonder if that's a good sign? He also had a semi-erection in the middle of the night a couple of nights ago. Not good with a catheter in situ. Are there any similar stories? Any advice please?",

I don't think it's unusual for the community nurse to remove staples/stitches and dress wounds at home although any future care will now be with his GP. He has to go to the medical centre on Monday to have his dressing changed as the nurse told him on her last visit to our home that as he can move around she wont be out again. Not sure but I think you only get so many home visits then you go back to the GP. We've been checking the dressing regularly today. There seems to be some leakage staining through although he says there is no pain, tenderness or heat from the surrounding skin.

Just hoping that nothing else goes wrong. Thanks for your good wishes.",

      "Content": "I haven't been on here for some time and just thought I would post an update on my condition. Basically I've had a hell of a time since my prostatectomy. If you've read previous threads you'll know that I've suffered with wound opening, catheter in for just over 4 weeks, infections and very slow to pass urine. Well the list goes on ... I have had constant infections, catheter back in for a further 2 weeks, severe strictures which prevent urine flow completely culminating in a 2 night hospial stay last week after the district nurse attempted to insert 3 different sized catheters at home with no luck then the nurse at hospital tried 2 more and called the doctor who also had a go!!! Between them they must have nudged something and I began to drip (literally) urine which relieved the pressure. I am now booked in for another operation in 2 weeks time to hopefully sort the problem out. I'm just keeping my fingers crossed because I can't go on like this. I am pleased for most of you on this site who have had a prostatectomy as it seems the vast majority come through unscathed but let my story be a warning to anyone weighing up the pro's and cons of surgery. We don't all come through recovery text book style and there ARE problems and related health issues to be aware of.",

I had my prostatectomy 3 months ago and have been plagued with strictures. If this is what it is you will have increased urge to urinate, flow will be restricted, gradually decreasing and it will be painful to pass. I have been dilated once, had several catheters, been taught self dilation and still get a stricture once every 2 weeks. I am now waiting for further surgery so my fingers are crossed that a course of antibiotics will relieve your symptoms!",

He has an infection which he is taking antibiotics for but he had this problem before he started taking them and it is continuing and not getting any better. Are we expecting too much? Is 6 to 12 times excessive at this stage? Other than that he does not leak at all which is good but the lack of sleep can't be good for him??",
