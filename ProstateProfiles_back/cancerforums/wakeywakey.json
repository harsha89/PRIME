    "Content": "Hi Guys, Guess it might be wise to tell you my story. I was initially on this forum under another name back in 2011 My PSA had been tested at 4.5 and they wanted to do a biopsy. My symptoms were dribbling, not voiding fully and poor flow. Since I had heard that cancer (if found) can be spread by the biopsy I argued against one. It was agreed we should wait and see, with 6 monthly PSA tests. All was well until March this year when I started slightly worse symptoms of voiding, (pause 20 seconds, finish voiding), dribbling and quite poor flow really. (If 10 is like a racehorse, I was about a 4, with several short bursts at the end) My PSA had gone upto 8.6 at the next test. GP referred me back to Urology. Now I was getting quite concerned. In August this year I went to Ultrasound for a unrelated scan on my liver. Whilst there the Ultrasound guy said all fine apart from your enlarged prostrate. When I enquired further he said he would measure the size and send it to my GP. This was all new news to me. On visiting the GP he told me it was 70cc. I asked if an enlarged prostrate had been recorded previously and he said I was diagnosed with enlarged prostrate in 2011. I'm not sure how when no scans were made. Now I'm confused. I have never been told I had an enlarged prostrate by anyone until the Ultrasound. Visited the Urologist last week and he did a DRE and said it felt normal, but now he wants an MRI scan pre-biopsy. I agreed to the scan as I don't believe it creates any problems, but I hope to see my PSA go down and the MRI show nothing substantial next week. The consultant did actually agree that some cancers can spread after biopsy (which surprised me a bit really), but this wasn't one of them he assured me. I am now also wondering why no medication was given if they suspected enlarged prostrate? I would be grateful of any thoughts or advice, especially on my \"biopsy spreads cancer\" concerns.",
