      "Content": "The VA continues to move slowly. Original diagnosis 8-26-13, Gleason 8, PSA 8.4, age 60. Had appt with surgery but resident referred me to radiation oncology. Oncologist did DRE, we had a conversation and he agreed that RP was a reasonable option for me. On November 4th, 2013 went to preop appointment. Resident noticed my biopsy had been reviewed and Gleason changed to 4 cores positive Gleason 9 then bounced right back to Rad Onc. Went to that appointment and Doc said \"I won't touch you\" because I was enrolled in Bay Pines System ( I was referred to Maimi by my local urologist who had confidence in the surgeons at Miami VAMC). To make a long story short, I saw my local urologist last week and we both agreed that RP and Adjuvant therapy prn was still a reasonable choice. My preop now is not until Jan 24, 2014. I worry that this aggresssive cancer is busy doing its work while I wait and wait and wait. Very worried and frustrated Jeff",
