    "Content": "Robert, My diagnosis was similar to yours and I elected brachytherapy due to the lower incidence of side effects, particularly incontinence and ED. I had the seeds implanted on April 16, 2012, and missed 1 day of work. I was actually able to take my grandson to Disney World on May 1. I have had nothing that I would call a real side effect. I experienced some fatigue starting about week 2, but only lasted about 2 to 3 weeks. I've had no urinary, bowel or ED issues. While everyone dealing with prostate cancer has to choose a treatment that is best for them individually, I can say without hesitatation that I am completely satisfied with my choice for brachytherapy. If you have an opportunity, I'd recommend that you take a look at a study by Dr. Ronald Chen that appeared in the August 20, 2009 issue of the Journal of Clinical Oncology. It compares quality of life outcomes for the different treatment options for localized prostate cancer. Best of luck to you.",
