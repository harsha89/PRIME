      "Content": "Went to see my local uro. The guy's great - I really trust him. I presented him with my conundrum. uPSA showed .06. Since I had standard done previously, I then had a standard done so I could figure out what .06 would translate to. It came back .1. Based on my research I was unsure what to do. His take - After prostatectomy, PSA should be undetectable. No specific number. He only uses standard, so at .1 it is no longer undetectable. Doesn't matter if uPSA shows .05 or .14 which would all translate to .1, It's detectable. We will repeat the test in 3 months to make sure the test was not an anomaly and to be sure it is still detectable and to see if it is rising. He then referred me to the RO he sent me to upon the initial diagnosis the previous year. The RO is great and I trust him as well. I have an appointment with him and will get his take. He then told me something that if I understood correctly, makes sense. He said those with non aggressive cancer, if it is still present, the PSA will rise sooner rather than later and rise faster. Those with more aggressive will rise slower and later. He described it as PSA is created by the prostate. PCa stimulates the prostate. The more prostate cells there are the more PSA produced. An aggressive cancer morphs more normal prostate cells into cancer cells, lessening the amount of prostate cells. A less aggressive cancer leaves more normal prostate cells to produce PSA faster. My pathology is in the less aggressive category. Anyway, his bottom line is PSA should not be detectable. If it is, I need to do something, but it's not like I have to do it tomorrow. Waiting 3 months to verify isn't going to make a difference. I have a clear plan forward and it is what I hoped to have after meeting with him.",

      "Content": "Went to see my local uro. The guy's great - I really trust him. I presented him with my conundrum. uPSA showed .06. Since I had standard done previously, I then had a standard done so I could figure out what .06 would translate to. It came back .1. Based on my research I was unsure what to do. His take - After prostatectomy, PSA should be undetectable. No specific number. He only uses standard, so at .1 it is no longer undetectable. Doesn't matter if uPSA shows .05 or .14 which would all translate to .1, It's detectable. We will repeat the test in 3 months to make sure the test was not an anomaly and to be sure it is still detectable and to see if it is rising. He then referred me to the RO he sent me to upon the initial diagnosis the previous year. The RO is great and I trust him as well. I have an appointment with him and will get his take. He then told me something that if I understood correctly, makes sense. He said those with non aggressive cancer, if it is still present, the PSA will rise sooner rather than later and rise faster. Those with more aggressive will rise slower and later. He described it as PSA is created by the prostate. PCa stimulates the prostate. The more prostate cells there are the more PSA produced. An aggressive cancer morphs more normal prostate cells into cancer cells, lessening the amount of prostate cells. A less aggressive cancer leaves more normal prostate cells to produce PSA faster. My pathology is in the less aggressive category. Anyway, his bottom line is PSA should not be detectable. If it is, I need to do something, but it's not like I have to do it tomorrow. Waiting 3 months to verify isn't going to make a difference. I have a clear plan forward and it is what I hoped to have after meeting with him.",

My solution was an athletic supporter - yeah, the old jock strap. You can put the pad in the supporter (this is the solution if you like to wear boxers) or attach the pad to your briefs and put the supporter outside the brief. I found that this holds the pads securely in place and prevents leakage. I also found that pointing ol Peter up in the pad really helps limit squirts, leaks, and drips. The supporter helps hold him in this position.",

The key is that everything should be done wiping away from the opening of the penis. Wash hands. The tube moves in and out a bit, so make sure it is out so the short part that side into the opening gets cleaned and lubed. Using warm water and soap clean the head of the penis and the tube to about 2 inches from where it enters. Using a swab, put lubricant on the tube for about 2 inches. They told me twice a day and initially I tried only once a day. Things were feeling a bit irritated so I decided I better do twice a day.

When I see a list that long for a drug, I wonder how many and which ones are really the common ones and how many are listed as legal cover.

      "Content": "Thanks for the supportive comments. First session today. Went perfectly. Bladder full, rectum empty. Stayed perfectly still for the duration. This one was a little longer about 30 minutes) as they told me. They had to do setup and get the doc to check everything before starting treatment. I was surprised when the techs came in to make some marks. They told me we were done. I asked when the treatment occurred. They told me it was about 2 minutes during the last rotation of the equipment. I thought it was still making sure everything was positioned correctly. I've got the bladder part down pat. I can go a long time with a full bladder and it takes about 2 hours to feel full. The empty rectum is a toss up. I've really been trying to get the bowels on some type of schedule, but no dice. I've dropped about 10 pounds going on a low FODMAP diet to try and get my bowels tuned up. I've also upped my exercise routine in the morning to maintain muscle tone - a combination of stretching, resistance tubing, light weights, and cardio - not all in the same day, but mix and match 6 days a week for about 45 to 60 minutes. I take Sunday off and only stretch. After all, even God rested on the seventh day. That's one of the benefits of being retired while I go through this. I have ample time to do what I need to. As for the Lupron, not too bad so far. Any hot flashes have been minimal to where I can't even say for sure that's what it was. The one thing I have noticed is the libido has essentially gone to zero. If ail the women in the world walked around naked, my only response would be \"Why are they all not wearing clothes?\" I feel blessed to have the medical team I've had - from my urologist, to my surgeon, to my RO. I feel I've had great care all along, especially my urologist who I've had the most interaction with. He's steered me with sound advice.",

When I saw my uro after reviewing my free PSA test, he immediately scheduled a biopsy at the first available time. I got it 1 week later. Gotta be frustrating to say the least and maybe extreme caution on the uro's part.. And be prepared for more waiting if you get a PCa dx after the biopsy. My surgery was 2 months after dx which seems pretty standard. They have to give time for the prostate to settle down after the biopsy. Even with radiation there will be a bunch of preliminary stuff that has to be done. I don't know if they have to wait for the prostate to settle down for radiation, also. Hang in there. The \"good\" thing about PCa is that unless it is a highly aggressive strain, it doesn't go racing off and spread.",

Next you will stay dry doing normal daily activities. The you will stay dry except for the occasional leak on a hard sneeze or cough or when you really strain the abdomen. Between the staying dry during normal daily activities and the occasional leak phase you will have a stage where when you squat or compress the abdominal cavity, you will leak. That's where I am at 4 months.",

      "Content": "If I need salvage radiation, I've been offered the opportunity to participate in a phase 3 trial for hypofractional radiation for prostate cancer (I'm guessing involving salvage radiation). I'm intrigued because the duration is shorter but I want to be sure that the long term effect is not worse. Everything I read shows similar outcomes and less short term effects. There is some long term effect data that shows the long term effects are similar. DjinTonic, feel free to add this to your study page if you don't already have it. It is one of the few I've found and easiest to understand long term studies for this. I have found studies for breast cancer that show hypofractial radiation has far fewer short term side effects than traditional. It all sounds pretty promising. Hypofrational radiation treatment means higher doses for a shorter duration, but the total radiation is the same. For prostate cancer instead of 39 treatments, only 25. https://www.redjournal.org/article/S...619-7/fulltext",

      "Content": "There is more to it than just the amount you get at what age. How long do you expect to live? There's your gamble. If you wait until age 70 to take SS, it will take about 11 years to catch up to the amount you have been receiving since age 62. If you die before that time, you lose. Now it gets a bit more complicated if your spouse is going to take benefits off your earnings record because that would give the spouse more $ than taking it off their own earnings record. Will you live beyond 83? Who knows. That's the gamble. You can estimate your own recovery time by setting up an account on SS online. You can get an estimate (based on what you have earned up to thhis point) on what your benefit will be at full retirement age. You may also be able to see what it would be takng it at age 70 or other ages. Since I'm retired, I can't do that on the site anymore. It just shows me exactly what I am getting. You can calculate the reduction - it is 6.7% per year. So if full retirement age is 66 and you start taking at 62, it will be reduced by about 26.8%. You can also estimate what it will be beyond full retirement by multiplying by 6.7% x # of years. For example, let's say SS at full retirement will be $2000. You decide to start taking it at 62. That would give you $1464. If you wait until 70, approximately $2536. This is assuming you are no longer working. If you keep working you will add more to it since you are adding to your earnings record. From age 62 to 66 you collect $1464 x 48 months = $70,262. At full retirement you collect $536 more per month. $72,262/$536 = 134 months, = 11 yrs, 2 months to make up the difference. At age 70 you would have collected $1464 x 96 months = $140,544. At age 70 you collect $1072 more per month. $140,544/$1072 = 131 months, = 10 years, 11 months. You will have to do this calculation for your situation and decide what is best for you. The final gamble is how long will you live. The financial experts touting wait until 70 are basing it on folks living beyond 85. If that is the case, it works out. But how many folks live beyond 85? As I said, you need to do the calculation and figure out what works best for you. Me, I retired at 64 and started takeg SS immediately. When my wife hits 62, she will start taking SS off my record. We will have that much additional money the to enjoy life together. I have a 3 pronged retirement financial situation - SS, federal pension, and IRA that produces a good amount of cash each month without having to touch the principal. If I die before my wife, she will be in good financial shape. This may not be your situation and you may have more concerns about a spouse's SS after you die.",

I more than 4, I am surprised the urologist would recommend active surveillance. I am a bit surprised he has decided on left nerve sparing pre surgery.

But again I advise you not to do it unless your doctor has instructed you to do it yourself and when to do it and you have been given detailed instructions on how to do it. Do it too soon or do it wrong and you will cause severe damage to the urethra. A bit of discomfort comes with the catheter. It is not out of the ordinary.

I paced about the house after my surgery doing 500 steps at a time and worked my way up to 5 times a day. I had open surgery and 2 weeks post surgery I didn't feel like I had surgery. I had to remind myself I just had major abdominal surgery and not to overdo it. I'm convinced the getting up and walking had much to do with it. 7 weeks post surgery I'm still working through continence issues, but that will come in time - 3 to 6 months the doc said.

      "Content": "My agenda alarm goes up on this one. The first thing I look at when I see an article like this is what is the source. Flag 1. Check the editors note- flag 2. The other major flaw here is their study. They didn't break it down into cancer grades. They only criteria was that it had not metastasized. As those of us on here know, there are many other factors involved as well. Eating healthy is a good thing, but extrapolating it out like this is questionable. That said there have been studies done by Hopkins and other research institutions that have noted that Asian countries with their diets have little to no breast and prostate cancer. They have also noted that there is less prostate cancer where there is more sun. They think it is a vitamin D link.",

      "Content": "I hope any who are facing SRT will find this information useful. This thread will discuss weeks 5 through 8 of my SRT. Here is a link discussing the lead up with ADT and the first 4 weeks: https://www.cancerforums.net/threads...ay-Through-SRT Weeks 5 through 8 did not have any significant side effects. I never developed diarrhea, I maintained full urinary control, did not get radiation \"sun burn\" in the treatment area, no burning sensation or discomfort during urination. I gained no weight and kept the 10 lbs I lost off, no hot flashes or any of the other side affects associated with ADT. I did have some constipation and developed a couple hemorrhoids during the time. Taking stool softeners and treating the hemorrhoids with a preparation H type cream seemed to alleviate that problem. The only side effect I noticed was some fatigue starting in week 6. It wasn't debilitating and tended to take one of 2 forms. If I was doing some work around the house I would sometimes hit an energy wall. Some other times I would feel like a wind up toy winding down. It was never like a tiredness where I needed to take a nap, but more like I am out of energy and need to just chill for the rest of the day. It would usually come on in late afternoon or early evening. It did not happen every day. There were a few days that I felt somewhat lethargic. From drinking so much water, I did have to urinate more frequently than normal and did have to get up once each night to empty my bladder. They told me to continue to drink water throughout the day. In week 6 they coned down the radiation to narrow the focus. I would occasionally feel a twinging type sensation in my urinary system, but had no issues with continence. This was tested one day in week 7 when one of the machines broke down and they were't sure how much of a delay there would be. I ended up having to hold my urine for 1.5 hours past my appointment time. It was uncomfortable but never felt like there was going to be an issue with leaking. They told me that the radiation will continue working for 3 weeks after treatment stops so there still could be some increased side effects. They also told me that since I haven't had any significant side effects to this point, I probably wouldn't develop any more. I feel really good right now, like I just haven't been through 8 weeks of radiation treatment. But, I also felt back to normal 2 weeks after an open RP, so maybe I am one of the fortunate ones that following instructions I was given led to quick recovery for surgery and minimal radiation side effects. The staff at Central Maryland Radiation Oncology were top notch and made the treatment experience as pleasant as possible. If you are in the central Maryland area, I would highly recommend them. Overall I would describe my treatment like this: I lived 10 minutes from the treatment center. Actual time on the table was 10 minutes. Total time per day for travel to and from, waiting and treatment was about 1 hour. I am retired so I didn't have to be concerned about work. It was an 8 week distraction that put my life on hold somewhat. Week 1 was \"exciting\" with learning the routine and seeing all the equipment which made that week go fast. Week 2 was getting into the routine. Weeks 3 through 6 were a grind. Day after day of getting the bladder full at the right time and going to and getting treatment. I could not see the light at the end of the tunnel. Weeks 7 and 8 the light at the end of the tunnel kept getting brighter as the end approached and the feeling was that this will soon be over. I go back in 3 months and here's to hoping my PSA is undetectable and remains so. As for long term effects, I'm not going to worry about it. I'll deal with them if and when they come. I say if, because just like the bad side affects you hear about from ADT and radiation treatment that did not happen to me, the longer term effects may not.",

      "Content": "You must be somewhere in my neck of the woods. I'm about 45 minutes from Hopkins to the south. I was sent by my urologist to Hopkins to talk to surgeons and to the U of MD Oncology for a RO. Both were top notch. The RO went over all the radiation options. Some were not available as an option, some were not used to treat PC, some I was not a good candidate for, some were not covered by my insurance. The only viable radiation option for me was external beam radiation. I discussed open and robotic with the surgeon, Dr. Alan Partin. In the end I chose open RP. That was MY decision - the one I would not second guess no matter the outcome. I had a real good experience with Hopkins. Everything well explained so I knew what to expect regarding surgery and afterwards. Recovery went exceedingly well. 6 months out I was fully continent. I have ED, but had that before surgery. All follow up is done by my local urologist. I just send information to Hopkins.",

      "Content": "You must be somewhere in my neck of the woods. I'm about 45 minutes from Hopkins to the south. I was sent by my urologist to Hopkins to talk to surgeons and to the U of MD Oncology for a RO. Both were top notch. The RO went over all the radiation options. Some were not available as an option, some were not used to treat PC, some I was not a good candidate for, some were not covered by my insurance. The only viable radiation option for me was external beam radiation. I discussed open and robotic with the surgeon, Dr. Alan Partin. In the end I chose open RP. That was MY decision - the one I would not second guess no matter the outcome. I had a real good experience with Hopkins. Everything well explained so I knew what to expect regarding surgery and afterwards. Recovery went exceedingly well. 6 months out I was fully continent. I have ED, but had that before surgery. All follow up is done by my local urologist. I just send information to Hopkins.",

      "Content": "As others have said, take your time, research all options. Some will be eliminated because insurance won't cover it (unless you feel strong enough that you want to pay the cost). Some will be eliminated because you are not a good candidate for that type treatment. Some will be eliminated because where you can reasonably go for treatment does not do that kind of treatment for PC. It may very well get whittled down to where you have a reasonable choice between 2 or 3. Then you weigh the pros and cons and make your choice based on the advice in the quote in my signature. In my case I had a high suspicion I had PC in January 2017 as a result of a PSA test that measured total and percent free. It gave a > 50% chance. This followed one I had 6 months prior that gave it a 10% chance. I started my research in January. In March I got the results of the biopsy. At that point I could listen to the urologist go over the options and understand them because I had already done research. He referred me to a good RO at U of MD Oncology and 2 surgeons at Johns Hopkins. I had already eliminated HIFU as insurance did not cover it. I also eliminated cryosurgery (freezing) as I did not like what I read about it. The RO spent a good bit of time going over radiation options and explained why I was not a good candidate for some of them. He narrowed it down to external beam radiation. He told me proton beam would offer no additional benefit and would be much more inconvenient as I would have to travel up to Baltimore daily (30 minute) vs conventional and a 5 minute drive. They didn't do cyberknife for PC. Brachytherapy was out because my prostate was too large for that. I talked to the surgeon, Dr. Alan Partin, at Hopkins to discuss open vs robotic. I opted surgery and for open because he said he could feel things with his fingers that he couldn't see with robotic and have never looked back. He has done over 5500 PC surgerys, both open and robotic. Only you can decide what suits you. The one big benefit surgery has over other options is that you get a full pathology report on the entire prostate, so you know exactly what you have.",

      "Content": "There is a fellow PCa sufferer at my church whom I advised of what to do and expect. He had his RALP the first week of May. Saw him Sunday and asked how he was doing. He said fine except instead of incontinence after catheter removal, he can't urinate at all. He went to the emergency room twice to get catheterized. Contacted his surgeon and they showed him how to self catheterize. He asked the doc about it and the doc said he has done 1000 RALPs and this is only the second time this has occurred. He said it will get better with time. In the meantime he has to self catheterize. He said it's not fun but it beats the pain of not being able to urinate and having to go to the emergency room. Anybody here experience that or know someone who has? I'd like to be able to give him some idea of how long it takes to clear up. Man, I feel bad for him. Handling leakage is a piece of cake compared to that.",

      "Content": "Here's another possibility that may affect response to continence questions. I'm 15 months past RP. At about 5 months I considered myself fully continent. At the beginning of July I started experiencing urinary tract issues. Wet spots at night, having to get up and go at night, feeling like I had to go right after I went, having to go frequently. I thought I had a urinary tract infection. Culture was negative. Cleared up while on 2 week course of antibiotics. OK for a week, came back.

      "Content": "As others have said, take your time, research all options. Some will be eliminated because insurance won't cover it (unless you feel strong enough that you want to pay the cost). Some will be eliminated because you are not a good candidate for that type treatment. Some will be eliminated because where you can reasonably go for treatment does not do that kind of treatment for PC. It may very well get whittled down to where you have a reasonable choice between 2 or 3. Then you weigh the pros and cons and make your choice based on the advice in the quote in my signature. In my case I had a high suspicion I had PC in January 2017 as a result of a PSA test that measured total and percent free. It gave a > 50% chance. This followed one I had 6 months prior that gave it a 10% chance. I started my research in January. In March I got the results of the biopsy. At that point I could listen to the urologist go over the options and understand them because I had already done research. He referred me to a good RO at U of MD Oncology and 2 surgeons at Johns Hopkins. I had already eliminated HIFU as insurance did not cover it. I also eliminated cryosurgery (freezing) as I did not like what I read about it. The RO spent a good bit of time going over radiation options and explained why I was not a good candidate for some of them. He narrowed it down to external beam radiation. He told me proton beam would offer no additional benefit and would be much more inconvenient as I would have to travel up to Baltimore daily (30 minute) vs conventional and a 5 minute drive. They didn't do cyberknife for PC. Brachytherapy was out because my prostate was too large for that. I talked to the surgeon, Dr. Alan Partin, at Hopkins to discuss open vs robotic. I opted surgery and for open because he said he could feel things with his fingers that he couldn't see with robotic and have never looked back. He has done over 5500 PC surgerys, both open and robotic. Only you can decide what suits you. The one big benefit surgery has over other options is that you get a full pathology report on the entire prostate, so you know exactly what you have.",

I asked about Brachy and my RO told me I wasn't a candidate for Brachy (LD) because my prostate volume was too great. Perhaps in the future these will be used more widely, but that doesn't appear to be the case right now. That's much of the reason why men don't chose these as an option.

When I looked up U of MD and Hopkinns cancer departments, I saw why. HD Brachy was not mentioned and I didn't see that on either of their sites. I asked about Brachy and my RO told me I wasn't a candidate for Brachy (LD) because my prostate volume was too great. Perhaps in the future these will be used more widely, but that doesn't appear to be the case right now. That's much of the reason why men don't chose these as an option. Not because they weren't told, but because these options are not available from where they are getting treatment.",

      "Content": "I've posted what I hope are a few helpful articles, now I will give you my PC story. It is a bit long, but I hope any newbies can garner helpful information from my story. The approximate timeline can be seen in my signature block. No history of PC in my family. Annual checkups starting at 50. After many years of PSA 2 to 2.5, it jumped to 4.1. Continued checking to see if that was a spike. For several years after my PSA bounced between 3.5 and 3.9, then it jumped to 5.5. Went to a urologist and extended test had 6.0 with free % showing only a 10% chance of cancer. 6 months later PSA was 7.7 and free % showed 50% chance of cancer. Biopsy time. It was actually at this time that I had my \"punch in the gut\" and faced the realization I probably had prostate cancer. I started my research. My urologist explained the biopsy procedure thoroughly, so I knew what to expect. It was not painful as many seem to describe, a bit uncomfortable like getting a sygmoidoscopy. The only slightly painful thing was a pinch when he snipped a few of the 12 samples. It was a little uncomfortable afterwards and took Tylenol to take care of that. The one thing I didn't quite expect was how long the after effects lasted. Blood in the urine for about a week (expected) but blood in semen for several weeks after that. A bit shocking, actually. When I went to the urologist for the biopsy report, I was going to be more surprised if it wasn't cancer than if it was. It was, and I was already prepared and understood everything the urologist talked about. 5 of 12 cores all 3+3 with perinerual invasion in 2. He automatically sent it to Hopkins for a second opinion. The Hopkins report had 5 of 12 cores positive, 4 (3+3), 1 (3+4) with 1 perinerual invasion. My only concern was how was I going to determine who to see next. Without my asking my urologist gave me a referral to 2 radiologists and referred me to Hopkins and Dr. Partin or Dr. Moswick for surgery. He told me Hopkins would be contacting me to set up an appointment. If you are in the Columbia, MD area, Dr. John Kischel of Central MD Urology is wonderful. Age at dx - 62. HIFU was off the table because insurance considered it too new in the US with no track record to show it was more effective. I eliminated cyrosurgery because it seemed less effective and seemed to have more after effects. Saw the radiologist, Dr. Young Kwok, of Central MD Radiology. I was most interested in brachytherapy (seeds), but he told me I am not a good candidate for that because of the estimated volume of my prostate. The largest volume they will do brachtherapy is 60 ml. Mine was 57. He personally won't do it above 45ml. The larger it is, the more seeding needed, the greater the concentration of radiation and the greater chance of more severe after effects. He also eliminated proton beam because it would offer no more benefit to me then normal external beam radiation - that and the fact it was much more inconvenient as I would have to make daily trips to Baltimore where the machine was. He didn't mention cyberknife. So it came down to external beam radiation as my best option and he explained the process thoroughly. It would take 9 weeks, 5 days a week. He didn't push radiation as my best option, but encouraged me to make the decision I could live with between surgery or radiation. He said both would be equally effective. I wasn't particularly interested in external radiation. At my appointment with Dr. Partin I asked about robotic vs open. He does both and has done thousands of each. I chose open for 2 reasons. One - he told me he can feel things doing open that he can't see with robotic. Two - he told me if he was having it done he would chose open. Good enough for me. Hopkins makes it easy. Everything scheduled at one time right after seeing the Dr. Surgery, day before pre op check in exam. I had to schedule a preop physical with my primary care physician with 30 days of surgery. Surgery was May 17 @ 930AM, arrived @ Hopkins @ 730AM. Checked in, pre stuff done, then my wife could join me in preop until they wheeled me to the OR. My wife was able to join me in post op and was with me the rest of the stay. Got up to a room late afternoon. I stayed only 1 night. Went home Thursday May 18. Like most hospitals, some staff are better than others. Overall my care was good. My post op nurse, and nurse and tech on my departure date were wonderful. The departure nurse and tech made sure I had what I needed, including pain meds, and explained what I needed to do at home. I left confident I would know what to do at home, particularly with managing the catheter and bag. The pain was not that bad. I took extra strength tyenol and added 5mg oxycontin when it got a bit edgy. I didn't use the oxycontin but 2 or 3 days at home once or twice a day. After that it was pure tylenol 1000 mg 3 times a day. I tapered that off to 500 mg 4 times per day, and by day 10 had stopped all pain meds. What was a bit surprising was finding out how much my abdominal muscles were used in just about every move I made. It got better each day and by day 7 I was moving pretty freely. I had to keep the catheter in for 10 days. I wasn't going anywhere so I thought Id have some fun with it. I put the bag in a small plastic bucket to carry it around with me. I named it Peabody. So for the next 10 days, Peabody and I went everywhere together. The first several nights I slept in a lounge chair. When I sat, it was with my legs up. My backside was getting tender from being pretty much in the same position when sleeping or sitting, so I moved to the sofa so I could at least sleep on one side, with Peabody on the floor next to me. I also wore a path in the carpet doing walking as advised. I believe it helped a lot. Several times a day I would take 500 steps. I figured I did a mile a day in the house. Dr. Partin insists that you remove your catheter yourself. On day 10 I did that. No big deal really. Just follow the instructions. Painless. A week after surgery Dr. Partin called with the pathology report. He said it was a good report. Lymph nodes, seminal vesicles, vas deferens all negative. It was organ contained except at 1 6mm area where it could not be determined if there were cancer cells left behind or not. This is called a positive margin. The area in question is a non aggressive 3+3. The only way to know if it was all gotten is to wait for the 3 month PSA check to see if it is zero or undetectable. If not, it will be checked again in 3 months to see if it went up or went to undetectable. Then we would go from there. So that is where I currently stand. Waiting for an August PSA test to see what, if anything, is next. As far as recovering from the surgery, I feel great, much better than I thought I would at 2 weeks. I have to keep reminding myself I just had major abdominal surgery and to not overdo it.",

      "Content": "The RO recommended we do nothing at this time and check the PSA in again in 3 months. The 3 month \"rise\" from .06 to .07 may or may not be a rise. We could take it again now and it might show .06. I agree seeing as there can be some variance in the measurement. One thing we do know now is that the .1 and .06 were not an anomaly. There IS measurable PSA. He wants to see a rising trend, so we will see again in 3 months. It could rise or it could be stable. It could be stable for a long time. Even looking at doubling time, rising .01 every 6 months means it will be 1.5 years to double. And if it keeps rising at .01 per quarter, it will be over 3 years to double again. Now this assumes it keeps rising at .01 per quarter and the rate of increase does not increase at higher uPSA levels. This got me to thinking about doubling time. It would seem that most of the retroactive studies on doubling time are based on standard PSA measurements since uPSA is relatievly recent in terms of study. There is a big difference between doubling from .1 to .2 vs doubling from .02 to .04 or .03 to .06 in the same amount of time. Its 5 times or 3 time more PSA increase in the same amount of time. So just what does doubling time in 2 and 3 digit PSAs reflect? I'm OK with this. Maybe I get lucky and it stays stable for a long time such that I never have to have anything else done. If it does rise slowly, I pretty much can decide when it is convenient for me to take a chunk out of my life for treatment. Right now I'm thinking that if the uPSA hits .1, then it's time. I don't think my RO would have any issues with treating at that time. He told me in his 12 years he has treated only 2 people with stats like mine (pathology and PSA level) and that was because they insisted. They really couldn't take the idea of any possible cancer at all being in them.",

      "Content": "The key is to establish a baseline. Everyone's baseline is different and prostate size affects how much PSA you have. You have that. PSA slowly increase with age and you are at that point. 4 is usually the point that triggers further investigation. A big jump, say from 2 to 3.5 may trigger further investigation usually with a test that measures free PSA. A really big jump usually indicates infection and not cancer. The recommendation is an annual check. I notice you are now getting checked every 6 months. Is that on recommendation of your doctor?",

I had a + margin and was T2C - on both sides of prostate but not outside the capsule. In 3 weeks puts you about 6 months out from RP. That's a usual amount of time between RP and RT when they recommend follow up radiation. How's your continence? You want that to be as good as possible before undergoing RT.",

Focus on increasing frequency, pace and duration each day. Couldn't agree more, especially the walking part. I paced around the house until I got the catheter out. Figured 2 feet per step and started at 250 steps once a day and increased to 5 times a day. After 2 weeks I had to remind myself I had major abdominal surgery and I had an open RP, not a Da Vinci. I'm convinced the pacing/walking played a big part in that. Get those kegals going but NOT while the catheter is in. Measure your continence gains in weeks, not days. You will have good days and not so good days that feel like setbacks. But compare it to the previous week. The usual sequence if first dry at night in a couple weeks. Then dry doing normal activities. This takes a couple months. The dry except for rare exceptions. This takes 3 to 6 months. I was at the 3rd stage in 4 months. Best to you.",

The biopsy is sort of like getting a 15 minute DRE with 12 pin pricks. You lie on your side while they go about their business. They played music and asked me what I preferred. For me, I didn't feel some, felt a little with some, and felt a bit of a pinch with a few. Nothing really major. I just counted them knowing there would be 12 so I knew how close it was to being done. I had a sigmoidoscopy done once and it was about like that in terms of discomfort. No pain, just an odd psychological feeling of having something checking out your insides. Granted, I don't know you, but it seems from what you have shared you have a pretty high tolerance for pain and discomfort. I really think you could handle it with a local and get it over with.",

I have an appointment with my urologist and I'm pretty sure he is from the .2 school. So now I have to decide what to do and how to go about it. I may make an appointment with the RO I talked with initially and see what he thinks. Of course then there is the concern if insurance will cover it before .2. Geez, I hate being in no man's land. I thought I was done with this, so this has affected more than the original Dx. I was ready for that, but this caught me by surprise. Yes, I had a positive margin, but the path report stated it was Gleason 6 at the margin. So no worries, right? Well, this is the hand I was dealt. No looking back and no regrets on my choice.

It also stated in the study that progression was higher (more than double the number) in the surveillance group that either the surgery or radiation treatment groups. I didn't see anything about 60% that had surgery or radiation didn't need it. It may be in there and I didn't see it as I didn't read every word of the study. In any case, it still comes down to what you are comfortable with. My situation did not fit surveillance, but had it, I'm not sure what I would have done. I have a co worker who was a prime AS candidate, but he chose brachytherapy because he didn't like the idea of doing nothing to a known cancer in his body. An article posted by another person talks about cancer-host relationships. Its an interesting read and sure makes it seem like a crap shoot if cancer will affect you. Detect it early and you don't know if doing nothing will end up in dire results or not depending on how your body and immune system respond.",

That's a usual amount of time between RP and RT when they recommend follow up radiation. How's your continence? You want that to be as good as possible before undergoing RT.",

      "Content": "Thanks RobLee. I've already determined I am on my way to BCR. It's no longer a question of if I will need SR, but when. I considered asking about getting a Decipher test done, but my wife asked me at what % would I consider myself safe - 25%, 10%, 5%? She had a point, so why bother. There is no zero. My thinking is I'd rather go through it sooner rather than later. Get this behind me which is why I choose surgery in the first place - over with quicker. Now I just need to get the go ahead from the docs and get into an RO sooner than I could myself. Then , of course, will insurance cover it at this point? Like I said, I thought I was done with this and all the decisions that go with it, but not yet.",

Focus on increasing frequency, pace and duration each day. Couldn't agree more, especially the walking part. I paced around the house until I got the catheter out. Figured 2 feet per step and started at 250 steps once a day and increased to 5 times a day. After 2 weeks I had to remind myself I had major abdominal surgery and I had an open RP, not a Da Vinci. I'm convinced the pacing/walking played a big part in that. Get those kegals going but NOT while the catheter is in. Measure your continence gains in weeks, not days. You will have good days and not so good days that feel like setbacks. But compare it to the previous week. The usual sequence if first dry at night in a couple weeks. Then dry doing normal activities. This takes a couple months. The dry except for rare exceptions. This takes 3 to 6 months. I was at the 3rd stage in 4 months. Best to you.",

      "Content": "Saw the RO on Wednesday and he too supports checking again in 3 months to be sure it is rising. It's a Hopkins facility in my hometown, not at the campus in Baltimore. His trigger point is .1 which goes along with my local URO. By the way - Prato - I borrowed your questions. The one thing that surprised me is that he recommended ADT along with the salvage radiation if we get there. I thought \"what the???\". I've got a non aggressive gleason 6 at the margin with an overall 3 + 4. To me that seems like a low threat to have gone anywhere especially at this early stage and to be still confined to the prostate bed. He did say it is my choice but he recommends it. I also asked would they just be radiating the prostate bed and he said they would also be radiating some areas around the pelvis. Is that typical for salvage radiation? He also offered up the opportunity to be part of a study where instead of 7 weeks of radiation, doing 5 weeks at a higher dose. So now I have a plan but more decisions to make. I 've looked up the 5 week/7 week thing and found a couple of studies on it and it looks promising. Toxicity seems to be slightly less and effectiveness is the same. I found some studies with ADT and salvage radiation and it is clear as mud. I even found an article that talked about it being controversial. It seems to be more effective with more aggressive and later occurring BCR than radiation alone. For less aggressive and earlier occurring, not quite so clear. The studies I found used IMRT, but this facility's salvage plan uses EBRT. Dang, I hate the uncertainty. I thought I was going to come out of the RO consult with a definite plan going forward if needed.",

      "Content": "A year ago I had PCa surgery at Hopkins. The \"experience\" was excellent. Well informed beforehand and well educated for what to expect afterward and how to care for things afterward. Inpatient care was very good. Some nurses were better than others, but overall, very good. Now one year later my PSA is no longer <.1, it is .1. So I thought I'd be able tap into the expertise of Dr. Partin to try and get some insight into sorting through all the myriad information about when you need to consider taking further action. He doesn't do routine followups, but I thought going from undetectable to .1 would not be routine. Not so. He didn't consider .1 as abnormal, so no consult. I have seen studies with his name on them associated with the .03 intervention point and the benefit of earlier intervention. If I recall, these studies may have involved gleason 7 or 8 and higher, but I'm not sure. I'm really disappointed. I thought I would have the ability to tap into the top expertise of Hopkins and in particular Dr. Partin with any questions I would have down the line. I feel like they want to have nothing to do with me after the surgery. They do want to follow my progress by sending the PSA annually and the asked me to participate in a study that I report to every 6 months. I feel like I am just a data point to them now. Any one else have surgery at Hopkins and any followup interaction? Is it just Dr. Partin or do all the surgeons at Hopkins follow the same script?",

      "Content": "A year ago I had PCa surgery at Hopkins. The \"experience\" was excellent. Well informed beforehand and well educated for what to expect afterward and how to care for things afterward. Inpatient care was very good. Some nurses were better than others, but overall, very good. Now one year later my PSA is no longer <.1, it is .1. So I thought I'd be able tap into the expertise of Dr. Partin to try and get some insight into sorting through all the myriad information about when you need to consider taking further action. He doesn't do routine followups, but I thought going from undetectable to .1 would not be routine. Not so. He didn't consider .1 as abnormal, so no consult. I have seen studies with his name on them associated with the .03 intervention point and the benefit of earlier intervention. If I recall, these studies may have involved gleason 7 or 8 and higher, but I'm not sure. I'm really disappointed. I thought I would have the ability to tap into the top expertise of Hopkins and in particular Dr. Partin with any questions I would have down the line. I feel like they want to have nothing to do with me after the surgery. They do want to follow my progress by sending the PSA annually and the asked me to participate in a study that I report to every 6 months. I feel like I am just a data point to them now. Any one else have surgery at Hopkins and any followup interaction? Is it just Dr. Partin or do all the surgeons at Hopkins follow the same script?",

      "Content": "Went to RO today with results of latest PSA tests. My RO is conservative but I trust his judgement. He usually uses .2 as the trigger point, but with the definitive rising trend in the uPSA he said there is no point in waiting if I don't want to. I said let's get on with it. He said there was just a recent study that was presented but has not been published yet that shows a definitive benefit to doing ADT with SRT. But as with most of the other studies the benefit is not as great with intermediate risk as high risk. So I am still in the gray area. With my pathology, he said the ADT would be an option to do it during radiation or monitor PSA after radiation and if PSA becomes detectable after radiation, do 2 years ADT. I'm choosing the 6 month during radiation because I had 40% gleason 4 as part of my 3+4. That puts me 10% from a 4+3. My URO recommended it because of the volume of gleason 4. Even though the gleason at the margin was 3+3, there is no guarantee that some cells of the gleason 4 did not escape and are sitting somewhere outside the prostate bed. The ADT will take care of those. It becomes a choice of doing 6 months now or 2 years or more later. My RO did bring up an interesting piece of information in the latest treatment guidelines. He said because of my positive margin, the guidelines now recommend ADT. He said ADT is now recommended if any one of 5 conditions is present: +margin, intra capsular extension, seminal vesicle invasion, lymph node involvement. That's 4, I think the 5th was either gleason 8 or greater or P3. He also said there has always been a difference in view between surgeons and ROs when it came to +margins. I won't be eligible for the hypo fraction study because it requires a .2 PSA. I'l be doing 8.5 weeks starting with a planning session on January 10. I will be getting an ADT shot sometime within the next 2 weeks. I had a top notch surgeon, and I have a lot of trust in my URO and RO. We have a plan and I'm ready to get on with it.",

      "Content": "I've reached the half way point of my Salvage Radiation Treatments - 19 of 39 down 20 to go. So far so good. No real adverse affects yet. Here's the story so far. Prior to starting, I changed my diet to the low FODMAP diet. It is designed to get your digestive system working well. Mine has been out of wack for a couple years, gassy and cycling between constipation and diarrhea, so I thought it would be good to try and get it straightened out. It was on the recommendation of my gastroenterologist. Digestive system went to mostly constipation and I did lose 10 lbs which I thought would be good seeing as most guys on ADT gain some weight. Lupron shot end of December. The only real thing I am feeling from that is total lack of libido. I describe it as: if all the women in the world were walking around without clothes on, my only thoughts would be \"Why aren't they wearing clothes?, and \"Don't they get cold?\". I haven't had noticeable hot flashes, maybe warm flashes that I wonder if that was a \"hot flash\". I'm having some sleeping issues that my wife tells me comes with menopause. Maybe that is from the Lupron, maybe not. I have not gained any weight. I am maintaining my 10 lb loss. Digestive system. Constipation when I started. Maybe a good thing. No diarrhea so far. So far I have had no issues with having an empty rectum. I do take Gas-X after the last meal I eat prior to treatment to eliminate gas. Seems to wok well. Urinary system. About once a week I have a bit of a squirt at night which is new and some nights I get up to go to the bathroom. It's more because I am awake I go. I don't wake up because I have to go. I can still hold my urine a long time, so if treatments are running late, it is not a problem. I've got the timing down pat for when to drink so I have a full bladder for treatment. It varies by the time of day. Fatigue not a factor to this point. The first 3 weeks my treatment times were all over the map, but now it has settled into the same time every day making it easier to get into a routine.",

Once it's out, expect it to take 3 to 6 months to recover \"full\" urinary continence. I say \"full\" because there will always be a bit of stress leakage when you stress your abdomens doing something. Measure progress week by week, not day by day as some days will be better than others. The first thing to come back is staying dry overnight. The next thing is staying dry while doing normal daily activities. The last thing to improve is leakage doing things that compress or stress the abdomen.",

My thinking is I'd rather go through it sooner rather than later. Get this behind me which is why I choose surgery in the first place - over with quicker.

The latest Hopkins newsletter had an article by Dr. Epstein about positive margin. Gleason score at the margin is an important factor. Another article I read talked about margin size. < 3mm was insignificant. Mine was 6mm but gleason 6, so doesn't look bad. I read some Hopkins stuff that seemed to indicate after 2 years of undetectable, the chance of recurrence goes way down - not to zero, but way down. Hopefully I get there and beyond.

      "Content": "Thanks RobLee. I've already determined I am on my way to BCR. It's no longer a question of if I will need SR, but when. I considered asking about getting a Decipher test done, but my wife asked me at what % would I consider myself safe - 25%, 10%, 5%? She had a point, so why bother. There is no zero. My thinking is I'd rather go through it sooner rather than later. Get this behind me which is why I choose surgery in the first place - over with quicker. Now I just need to get the go ahead from the docs and get into an RO sooner than I could myself. Then , of course, will insurance cover it at this point? Like I said, I thought I was done with this and all the decisions that go with it, but not yet.",

I also suffered leaks wearing cotton boxer briefs. When I switched to boxer briefs with spandex, it held the pads in place much better and pretty much eliminated the leaks. At about 3 weeks I was staying dry at night. At about 10 weeks I switched to mini pads. That's stage 2 where you no longer leak in most normal every day activities. I'm still working on phase 3 which is no leakage when doing something that stresses or compresses the abdominal cavity. I consider myself fortunate as I seem to be on the early end of the recovery curve. My doctor said it takes 3 to 6 months to get full continence back. I've been told by those who are years down the road that even then with a hard sneeze or cough or real strain they still get an occasional leak - nothing major, just a little spritz. So be patient my friend. There will also be the frustration that at times you feel that you are making progress and then it seems to take a step back. The step back is temporary. Watch your fluid intake and be especially mindful of caffeine and alcohol. I drink little of each and I think that helped in the recovery along with kegal exercises.

      "Content": "Continence recovery comes in stages. You are only 2 weeks past surgery. Patience is needed. I used the Depends men's large absorbent pads and went through 3 to 4 a day initially. I also suffered leaks wearing cotton boxer briefs. When I switched to boxer briefs with spandex, it held the pads in place much better and pretty much eliminated the leaks. At about 3 weeks I was staying dry at night. At about 10 weeks I switched to mini pads. That's stage 2 where you no longer leak in most normal every day activities. I'm still working on phase 3 which is no leakage when doing something that stresses or compresses the abdominal cavity. I consider myself fortunate as I seem to be on the early end of the recovery curve. My doctor said it takes 3 to 6 months to get full continence back. I've been told by those who are years down the road that even then with a hard sneeze or cough or real strain they still get an occasional leak - nothing major, just a little spritz. So be patient my friend. There will also be the frustration that at times you feel that you are making progress and then it seems to take a step back. The step back is temporary. Watch your fluid intake and be especially mindful of caffeine and alcohol. I drink little of each and I think that helped in the recovery along with kegal exercises. I rarely do them anymore at this point.",

I say \"full\" because there will always be a little bit of stress incontinence when you strain your abdomen (like heavy lifting) or a sneeze sneaks up on you. It proceeds in stages. First you stay dry at night. Second comes staying dry doing every day activities like walking and every day stuff. Last comes staying dry when you do something that squeezes or stresses the abdominals - this includes getting up from being seated. Measure progress week to week, not day to day. There will be good days and bad days. Be patient. You'll get there. The vast majority of guys do.",

      "Content": "Hey Bad, I just had surgery May 17. My advice, take it one step at a time. Deal with what comes up when it happens. 5 cores is not bad and if it is all 3+3 that is good. Get through the surgery. Get up and moving after the surgery - it helps recovery a LOT. 2 weeks after surgery I feel so good I have to remind myself to take it easy because I just had major abdominal surgery 2 weeks ago. As far as the pathology report, handle it when it comes. My biopsy results were read by 2 labs and the results were similar to yours. Both labs had 5 cores, one had all 3+3, the other had 4 3+3 and 1 3+4 (5% of core). Both showed perineural invasion. All indications were that it was organ contained. My pathology report was good. 3+4, neg lymph, neg vas deferens, neg metatasis. It was organ contained except for a small (6mm) are of positive margin at an area of 3+3. It might be a false positive. We won't know until my 3 month PSA in August. If my PSA is not 0 in August, we will repeat the PSA in November. If it is not zero then, we will go from there on what to do. Was I surprised by that there was a positive margin? Yes. But we will have to wait and see. Here's an article about margin: http://urology.jhu.edu/newsletter/pr..._cancer410.php You can look at all the charts and after a while it gets confusing. I can look at my situation and guess which category I fit in and the possibilities, but that doesn't mean that is what will happen. The best thing I found to do is take it one day at a time, focus on what you know and getting better, and deal with what comes later when it comes, if it comes. Numbers on a chart cant tell how your situation will go.",

      "Content": "Sub Denis, this is not meant to take anything away from what you said. I'm sure many have/had the same feelings you did. Maybe I'm an outlier, but when the doctor told me it was cancer, I was already prepared. I saw the signs from the PSA rise and the decrease in free PSA. After those results, was my \"I've got cancer\" moment. Never denial. I started educating myself at that point. The results of the biopsy were no surprise. I could follow along as the urologist went over possible courses of action. I talked to a radiologist and a surgeon. I made my decision to go forward with surgery and not look back. I had the support of my wife. We were going through this together, take it one step at a time, and handle whatever came up next when we got there. I also had the support of those at my church, several of whom had already been through this. I lived my life while waiting for surgery without anxiety. Got a little anxious as the day drew near not because of the cancer, but because I was going to have major abdominal surgery after all. The path report was good but not perfect. No spread, 3+4, but there was a positive margin. Six months out all is good, PSA < .1. Will be getting it checked every 6 months. Both my surgeon and urologist do not see the need for uPSA and I'm fine with that. None of the other men I've talked with had uPSA done afterward. If it climbs and radiation is in the future, we'll handle it if and when we get there. In the meantime I will live my life. No amount of worrying will change things. I must say my faith has a lot to do with having the \"look forward\" and \"handle whatever comes when it does\" attitude.",

      "Content": "Just got the results from my 3 month PSA check. Standard test, < .1, undetectable. Note on my signature that I had a 6mm positive margin, with Gleason 6 at the margin area. I had seen a study that suggested that a margin less than 3mm is insignificant and larger is more signicant, with Gleason at the margin a secondary indicator. I thought the chance of having detectable PSA was greater than undetectable. So for those of you who have a positive margin in the pathology report after surgery, keep the faith! Oh, I guess I now can submit my application to the zero club. Just as additional encouragement, I had an open RP. No catheter issues, kept it cleaned and lubed as instructed. At 2 weeks felt as if I hadn't had major abdominal surgery. I did a lot of pacing in the house while I had the catheter. At 3 weeks I stayed dry overnight. At 10 weeks I stayed dry in daily activities. I'm still working on staying dry when I do anything that compresses or strains the abdomen. According to the docs instructions, I'm on course.",

Maybe I'm an outlier, but when the doctor told me it was cancer, I was already prepared. I saw the signs from the PSA rise and the decrease in free PSA. After those results, was my \"I've got cancer\" moment. Never denial. I started educating myself at that point. The results of the biopsy were no surprise. I could follow along as the urologist went over possible courses of action. I talked to a radiologist and a surgeon. I made my decision to go forward with surgery and not look back. I had the support of my wife. We were going through this together, take it one step at a time, and handle whatever came up next when we got there. I also had the support of those at my church, several of whom had already been through this. I lived my life while waiting for surgery without anxiety. Got a little anxious as the day drew near not because of the cancer, but because I was going to have major abdominal surgery after all. The path report was good but not perfect. No spread, 3+4, but there was a positive margin. Six months out all is good, PSA < .1. Will be getting it checked every 6 months. Both my surgeon and urologist do not see the need for uPSA and I'm fine with that. None of the other men I've talked with had uPSA done afterward. If it climbs and radiation is in the future, we'll handle it if and when we get there. In the meantime I will live my life. No amount of worrying will change things. I must say my faith has a lot to do with having the \"look forward\" and \"handle whatever comes when it does\" attitude.",

Cancer lethality set early The study looked for changes in cancer aggressiveness in men diagnosed with prostate cancer from 1982 to 2004. All of the men had their prostates removed after diagnosis, and biopsy samples were taken from the glands. The Harvard team reexamined the samples and graded them using a tool called the Gleason score, which assigns a number from 2 to 10 based on how abnormal the cells look under a microscope.

Over the study period, fewer and fewer men were diagnosed with advanced, late-stage prostate cancers that had spread beyond the prostate gland. This reflected the growing use of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) testing to diagnose prostate cancers earlier and earlier. In contrast, the proportion of high-grade cancers, as measured by the Gleason score, remained relatively stable rather than gradually becoming more aggressive.

I wear boxer briefs and the 100% cotton ones I had would stretch out and lead to gaps and leaks. I tried going down in size. It was better but they still stretched out and also presses on my abdomen which served to squeeze out more leaks. I tried wearing an athletic supporter with the pad in it. First under the underwear. Gets a bit uncomfortable but helps. Then I put the pad in the underwear and the supporter outside. Helped but is a bit cumbersome. I finally tried boxer briefs with spandex. It doesn't have to be poly/spandex blends or the moisture wicking or the athletic wear. A simple 95% cotton 5% spandex works well. It holds the pad petty firmly in place and prevents leaks.",

One thing all these studies do not take into account is personal preference. Obviously ASAdvocate is very comfortable with the idea that something in his body has cancer. I know a couple of guys who based on their biopsies would have been good candidates for AS, but couldn't live with the idea there was cancer in their bodies.

      "Content": "The article does state that one of reasons for these results in VA is cost control. There's almost always $$$ involved in some way one way or another. I was very fortunate in that my doctors emphasized they get paid the same no matter what treatment I choose as they were all on salary and not paid by the procedure. One thing all these studies do not take into account is personal preference. Obviously ASAdvocate is very comfortable with the idea that something in his body has cancer. I know a couple of guys who based on their biopsies would have been good candidates for AS, but couldn't live with the idea there was cancer in their bodies. One opted for surgery, one brachytherapy.",

      "Content": "Here's the explanation I got from my docs as well as docs of 3 other guys in my church who had PCa and who doctors said the regular PSA screening post treatment tells enough. The PSA will round any fraction of measurement, meaning a PSA of .1 could be anywhere from .05 to 1.4. My results would seem to bear that out. The .1 both times in my case would be correct in that the uPSAs were .06 and .07. It would show <.1 if it were .04 or less. That means at 3 months and 6 months the uPSA would have been .04 or less. At 1 year it was .06. This all seems to fit together and make sense. The only thing I don't know is what a uPSA would have shown at the initial 3 month time (maybe <.02, maybe .02?) and 6 months. At the 1 year time, the uPSA was done first and a week later the regular PSA. At the 15 months, the regular PSA was done first and 3 days later the uPSA. I'm going to go with what 6 docs have said. As to further screening tests, the RO mentioned some of that as possibilities at the 12 month appointment in terms of seeing if anything shows up outside the prostate bed. I shall see what he had in mind this appointment. There is also a psychological side to this. As much as I try not to, the last three months have had me somewhat under a cloud of thinking about what may come after August. Not worried, more wonderment about if it will be time for treatment and spending the next 3 to 6 months going through it. Do I want to keep doing that for every 3 month period of my life and for how long? Maybe I get to keep doing that the rest of my life, or maybe not. Like I stated previously, if I pull the trigger, I will never know if I overtreated, but I very well may end up disease free. What quality of life side effects will I experience? I don't know to what extent. Will I question why I went through what I did and wonder why I did it? Maybe, if the SEs are severe. Would I question why didn't I do it earlier if things get worse later? Yes. 2 sides to the coin neither of which is a guaranteed winner. Even in the research realm there are 2 sides. Treat early or wait, each which has research to support it.",

      "Content": "So at my 12 month mark my PSA was .1 (lost the <) and a uPSA came back at .06. The plan was to repeat in 3 months and see where we are. Got the results this week and the PSA is still .1 and the uPSA is .07. So it was not an anomaly and IS detectable. Based on the uPSA a slight upward trend or maybe steady (don't know the variance range of the uPSA test). So I've got another RO appointment this Friday and we will decide what to do and when. My urologist has been great with his advice. At the one year he told me it doesn't matter what the numbers are, PSA should not be detectable after a prostatectomy. If it is, we need to do something. When the RO at the time suggested adding ADT to salvage radiation, I asked my uro about that given I don't have an aggressive or bad pathology. His advice was that if some cells have gotten away and are somewhere other than where the radiation is, the ADT will get them. If you just have radiation and PSA recurs, I would be on ADT for life. So I've pretty much resigned myself that I am going to undergo salvage radiation with ADT. Don't know whether the ADT will be 3 months or 6 months. I've come around to realizing that if I throw everything I can at it now, I could very well be done with this. I will never know if I over treated, but I sure as heck would know if I undertreated and would question why I didn't do more earlier so I didn't have to be on ADT the rest of my life.",

      "Content": "The 90 day wait is to allow the body time to remove the PSA from your system. It is removed via the liver and kidneys. Some folks systems remove it faster than others. The 90 days is to give ample time for your system to remove it. If done earlier, there may be residual PSA in your system and give a false positive. At 90 days there is a small chance it is still residual and it should be repeated in another 90 days. This is the protocol I am on with my doctor.",
