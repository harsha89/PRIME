    "Content": "Greetings from Kansas! I was diagnosed 10-14-11 with prostate cancer, with 10 of 12 biopsy cores positive. I had the robotic surgery on 12-15-11. My psa has been <0.01 since the surgery. I had a psa test recently and it has started to elevate, to .13, which doesn't sound like much, but now come the mind games. My local Dr said not to worry much, but the urologist scheduled an appointment soon, he also said not to worry just scheduled an appointment for the 26th of this month. Need a little help with the mind issues for the next 10 days, then we will see what the urologist has to say. Does anyone have experience with the psa rising in small increments? I did not have radiation after the surgery. Thanks, good luck to you all! I think I posted this in the wrong place last time.",
