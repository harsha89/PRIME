      "Content": "I found this site while looking around for information having recently been diagnosed with prostate cancer Gleason 6. My wife convinced me to have a PSA test a year or so ago and when I asked my GP it turned out he had already been taking them without me knowing. I was within normal levels, but the graph showed them increasing rather than going up and down, so I agreed to see a urologist. On 23 August after my first biopsy he told me there was one very small tumor. He suggested an MRI to be on the safe side, so we did that and found a couple of hot spots, which resulted in me having another biopsy. Yesterday he told me that there were 2 more tumors around 3mm and rather than going on active surveillance he recommended radiation. I can't do external radiation because I travel for work, plus I'm in negotiation for a new contract and don't want to tell them that I have cancer in case they decide not to renew my contract. That leaves me with brachytherapy as it's not bad enough for surgery and frankly the thought of the surgery gives me the willies. I've been told about TBL-12 and am thinking that it might be worth trying given that I am in early stages and it is rated as slow growing. I couldn't find any reference to that here, but it sounds like low risk. This is all very new to me and I am trying to get my head around what it all means without focusing on it too much. I don't want to be rushed into any form of treatment, but obviously I'm keen on a long healthy as possible life in all that entails. Anyway, here I am, I guess I've joined a new club I'd rather not be a member of, but keen to share and learn from the experience of others.",

      "Content": "Greeting folks, this is my first post, so a quick summary to date: My PSA was within safe limits but trending up, so my GP recommended seeing a urologist. He recommended a biopsy after doing an internal and finding what he thought was an irregularity but turned out not to be. That found one small .8mm tumor on 23 August. He then recommended an MRI which found 2 spots so last Friday I had another biopsy which found 2 more tumors around 3mm also Gleason 6 3+3 which I found out about yesterday. Urologist said that with only one he would have said active surveillance but with 3 he recommended radiation and suggested I visit an oncologist and that brachytherapy would be recommended. I will visit him and also do a flow rate test next week. I'm feeling a bit rushed and its all still sinking in. I'm not going to race into anything, which I suspect I don't have to at this stage. I know of people who are using TBL-12, one with terminal cancer and 2 that don't have it but have decided to use it anyway. It sounds like zero risk, but not cheap. There is not a lot of info around, but it apparently has orphan approval with FDA, whatever that means. I can't find a lot of info about it and it doesn't seem to be mentioned here. Does anyone know anything about it? I have bought a Kindle edition of Winning the Battle Against Prostate Cancer 2nd edition. Open to any other suggestions as to how to get good info without all the medical jargon. Comments and suggestions welcomed.",

      "Content": "Thanks to all of you who have replied, much appreciated. I appreciate the advice re travel and the job. If I was at a higher Gleason level I would take a different tack, but given where I am at right now and that I want to do some research and get feedback/advice first, the timing works. The travel isn't a lot, but it would mean I couldn't do 8 weeks x 5 days a week, so if I do radiation, brachy seems to be the option. I have health insurance and would only have to pay around 20% and could just take annual leave, if get the job I'm looking for. I haven't got my latest PSA results yet and I don't recall what the last one was, just that it was within normal, but each test level has been higher than the previous one. I'm a little confused as to whether they found 3 or 4 cores, because the original one was estimated at 0.8mm but I've been told they now found 3 that were all slightly bigger. They are all in the right side. The details were all (3+3): 1.2mm no perineural tumour invasion identified 3mm no perineural tumour invasion identified 3mm perineural tumour invasion is identified (don't know what that means yet) It also says non-neoplastic prostate shows gland hyperplasia and patchy zones of chronic inflammation. Appreciate the comments about experience. I will ask the oncologist what his experience is, how many brachy's he's done etc. He works closely with the urologist I have been seeing who appears to have a good reputation.",
