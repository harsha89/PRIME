      "Content": "Hello willie49: Liver Lesions are not necessarily \"Liver Cancer\". Since this part of the forum is relatively quiet and your husband, determined by previous posts, was diagnosed with Prostrate Cancer. This being the case, I am going to move this thread over to the Prostrate Forum but I would talk with your husband's doctor for clarification on the test findings.",

With no disrespect, I edited and removed your link as it is against our policy here on Cancer Forums to ask members for money as I am sure you can understand. Cancer puts a tremendous burden on those left behind and especially with the snail pace in which the VA works to get benefits to the family members is truly disheartening. I am hoping that the benefits will be processed very soon and help you financially. Lisa",
