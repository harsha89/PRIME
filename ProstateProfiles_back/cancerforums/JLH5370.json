      "Content": "Hello. This is my first post and I hope I don't make too many men mad but I just have a question about what men who have had their prostate removed have gone through. I'm 53 and I've never had a DRE or PSA test. I also need to inform you that I am a single gay man. I'm the type of person that not only goes to the library to do research in something that is important to me, I also make use of the internet. Now I know some people will say that Dr. google is a dangerous doctor. That's your opinion, I personally don't care for any doctors but that is just me. There is a lot of controversy on PSA tests. Some say it's very important, and some say it's a flawed test that ruin the lives on thousands of men a year by over zealous Urologists. But to the reason I'm here. How many here wish they haven't gone through with the removal of their Prostate? To me, if I can't have quality sex, life is not worth living.",
