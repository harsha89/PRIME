If it's any consolation, some people find that they worry more about their significant other and how he or she is holding up than they worry about themselves. It does mean you can stay in bed all day when you're not working, rather than have to \"look alive\". Some spouses have different attitudes about illness -- some are \"battlers\" and use fighting metaphors and all that. It exhausts me. My wife didn't \"fight\" her cancer. She suffered. She bore suffering nobly, but there was nothing to fight. She maintained her own inner strength and grace despite what happened to her body. About the ED. I don't want to go into why I know about this, but I CAN say, that if you approach it with a sense of humor, rather than frustration, people are understanding. After all, the people worth being with want you to enjoy yourself, too, and if you can find a way to do that, to let them know it's not them \"not doing it for you\", they're ok. If you want to talk, feel free to PM me. I only cared for my wife, I have not had cancer myself. But I sure know what it's like to need somebody to talk to.",
