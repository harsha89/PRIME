    "Content": "Diagnosed with PCa with 2 cores of the 10 positive ones showing Gleason 7 (4+3). PSA 7.5. RRP in August this year. There was involvement of 1 seminal vesicle, but not extra capsule extension. Staged at T3b. First PSA was <.1. Looked again at my post-surgery path report recently and noticed a section showing the tertiary pattern of Grade 5. Never paid much attention before until I saw a 2007 article that said a Gleason 7 and Tertiary Grade 5 indicates agressive cancer. Anyone have any information or thoughts on what this means and how this should effect next steps? Second PSA scheduled for mid-January. No salvage treatment has been discussed at this point. Thanks.",
