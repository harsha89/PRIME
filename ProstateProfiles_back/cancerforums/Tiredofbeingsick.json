I am very familiar with the SE of Lupron and to allow your dad to endure that, would be nothing shy of cruelty. Your Doctor has a problem and his arrogance is only exceeded by his ignorance. My doctor told me that I would not likely die from PC, but the treatments were going to be the cause of my demise. Think about this for your dads sake. Best to you and your dad",
