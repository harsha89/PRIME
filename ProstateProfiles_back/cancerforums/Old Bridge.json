I am 45 and was diagnosed post-surgical pathology as: PT3a (ECE present and focal margins). Gleason 7 (3x4) Pre-surgery PSA was 3.78 Surgeon who performed RRP felt very confident that what post-surgical pathology was detecting on the specimen were simple \"surgical artifacts\" -- he felt confident that surgery was successful. Given that the RRP was performed in a top NYC hospital and by a leading surgeon I shared his optimism. Now, however, I am experiencing anxiety over this 3x rise in 6-months (rounded .06 = .1). Here are my questions (meeting with my urologist this week to discuss): What is this forum's opinion of movement from .02 to .06? The recent PSA test was taken in the afternoon and all others have been taken in the morning. Would having test performed later in day impact results? I am prepared from surgeon to recommend that I take repeat test in 3 months or so, but this 6-month increase in PSA has me a bit freaked-out and with ECE and focal is time my \"friend.\" Thx.",
