      "Content": "My 72 y/o dad was recently diagnosed with PC. 3 of the 12 lobes are clear, 7 have Gleason score of 9, 2 have score of 7. There is perineural invasion. His PSA at the biopsy appointment was 2.7. He had a bone scan on Monday and he's waiting for approval for his MRI. They said his cancer is aggressive. My dad was fairly active most of his life until he had back surgeries and 2 knee replacements about 5-6 years ago. The replacement was on the same knee as the first one got infected. It took many, many months to get that infection under control. This is my 4th (and hopefully last) category on these forums I've visited since 2009. I was my uncle's caregiver (lung), mom's caregiver (head/neck), and step dad's caregiver (liver). They've all passed. My dad is in Arizona and I am in Oklahoma. I'm feeling pretty helpless right now and very angry. My dad is in great spirits, lol. He's not worrying about it right now, which is good. We all know this phase. Hurry up and wait. Are there forum members with similar results who can share their experiences? Good, bad, or indifferent.",

He's going to call both on Monday. He's also going to put me down as an authorized person so I can help get the ball (no pun intended) rolling from here when necessary.",

      "Content": "I believe there's an MD Anderson Cancer center near them. I'm hoping he'll be able to go there. I think my biggest fear is that my parents (I was blessed with 2 sets) won't be assertive enough to ask questions and be led like sheep. From past experiences I *know* you have to be vigilant in your care, write questions for the next appointment and don't let the doc leave until they're answered. This particular forum has been very helpful in helping me understand PC and hopefully I'll be able to explain to my parents what it all means. I'll be sure to keep updating. Dad is trying to get his scan pathology report before his follow up. Thanks ðŸ˜€",
