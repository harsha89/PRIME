    "Content": "I'm new to the forum and looking for advice or comments on my situation. I've been on Active Surveillance since PC Dx in August 2013. My PSA is actually declining somewhat, but the last ultrasound shows \"evidence of cancer extension towards the distal apex up to the level of the external sphincter.\" Both my doctors now advise ending AS and starting \"locoregional treatment\" with a recommendation for Brachytherapy. With my family history and the tumor progression I feel like I need to make a decision quickly and begin treatment. Surgery is not an option due to proximity of external sphincter to tumor. I'd appreciate any thoughts on my situation.",
