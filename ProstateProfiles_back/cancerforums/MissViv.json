      "Content": "Originally Posted by Jim215 Welcome MissViv: Could you please provide us with some info, such as your husband's age, medical history and PSA results, within a signature, that led to his Gleason 8 diagnosis? In answer to your question about why both a CT scan and a full-body bone scan are usually recommended, other than being routine investigative tools, they also serve as means to avoid pointless procedures. As I'm sure you are already aware, Gleason 8 represents an aggressive form of prostate cancer. I apologize if this is too direct but the bone scan is looking for whether the cancer has spread (metastasis). If so, it \"could\" rule out some treatments, such as surgery. As long as the cancer is believed to be confined within the prostate, a \"cure\" remains possible. However, even under a worst case scenario of metastasis, treatments are available to extend life for years and, sometimes, decades. Of course, it's not possible for us to understand or evaluate how his prior colon cancer may or may not impact upon his current diagnosis. Best of luck, Jim We did not get all of this information, in writing, but I will state what I remember. His age is 68 and I do not remember his PSA (maybe 12). They took blood again at his biopsy results appt. last Thursday. I will try to get lab results in writing when we go back Thursday. He was diagnosed with colon cancer in Dec. of '14 and had surgery with part of his colon removed and no chemo or radiation. The urologist did not order a bone scan, only the CT & MRI. He had not been getting regular blood work but his PSA was high several years ago but not high enough for further tests, evidently, but we did have another doctor at that time.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by Jim215 Welcome MissViv: Could you please provide us with some info, such as your husband's age, medical history and PSA results, within a signature, that led to his Gleason 8 diagnosis? In answer to your question about why both a CT scan and a full-body bone scan are usually recommended, other than being routine investigative tools, they also serve as means to avoid pointless procedures. As I'm sure you are already aware, Gleason 8 represents an aggressive form of prostate cancer. I apologize if this is too direct but the bone scan is looking for whether the cancer has spread (metastasis). If so, it \"could\" rule out some treatments, such as surgery. As long as the cancer is believed to be confined within the prostate, a \"cure\" remains possible. However, even under a worst case scenario of metastasis, treatments are available to extend life for years and, sometimes, decades. Of course, it's not possible for us to understand or evaluate how his prior colon cancer may or may not impact upon his current diagnosis. Best of luck, Jim We did not get all of this information, in writing, but I will state what I remember. His age is 68 and I do not remember his PSA (maybe 12). They took blood again at his biopsy results appt. last Thursday. I will try to get lab results in writing when we go back Thursday. He was diagnosed with colon cancer in Dec. of '14 and had surgery with part of his colon removed and no chemo or radiation. The urologist did not order a bone scan, only the CT & MRI. He had not been getting regular blood work but his PSA was high several years ago but not high enough for further tests, evidently, but we did have another doctor at that time.",

      "Content": "We received the results of the biopsy and I tried to list in my signature (not sure if I did it right). There was a comment about the suspicious sample that said \"Although these findings are atypical and suspicious for adenocarcinoma, there is insufficient cytologic atypia to establish a definitive diagnosis.\" The prostate diagram was in six sections (three on the left and three on the right). The mid left was malignant and the apex left was \"suspicious\". Didn't see my signature so I will try to list here what I wrote. Age 68 diagnosed with prostate cancer on 2/02/17 after biopsy on 1/23/17. Left mid was 7% involved length 20-23mm tumor length 3. Left apex 15 to 20mm \"suspicious\".",
