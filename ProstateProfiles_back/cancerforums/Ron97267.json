      "Content": "I am 56 years old (soon to be 57..), PSA in 2006 was 2.2, May 2011 came back 4.6. Doctor was concerned and gave me the option of seeing a Uro or retesting in 6 months. 13 months later, June 6, 2012 I finally got back in and PSA rose to 7.29. Doctor very concerned, contacted me at home and wanted me to make an appointment with Uro in the next couple of weeks. DRE negative on all visits. June 26 I met with Uro and he retests, DRE negative, PSA dropped to 4.8, Free PSA 8%. Free PSA very concerning, Uro says 56% predictive of PC (I already knew that based on my research of the internet and this forum). July 26th had a 12 core biopsy and received a call from his nurse day before yesterday that it came back negative and was due to BPH and some inflammation. She cancels my follow-up consultation and tells me to come back in 6 months for another blood test. 30 minutes later I called back and rescheduled the appointment as I have some questions and concerns, especially what might be causing the low free PSA of 8%. Prostrate was 55grams. While I am overjoyed the biopsy came back negative I know from my research that about 20% of the time the biopsy can miss cancer. Any thoughts on this. I am glad to not be a member of the club at this time, figure I will likely go through another biopsy at some time down the road. The amount of information and support is incredible on this site. I am also reading Dr Walsh's book..... Thank you.",

      "Content": "Thanks for all the information. The signatures of some of the posters here whom have had several negative biopsy's flash at me like a neon sign! The 8% fPSA is still of concern to me. My Uro does not seem as concerned at this time. He didn't rule out PC, wants me to have another blood test in January and depending on the results of that, any changes from my last PSA will determine any follow-up procedures. BTW I obtained a copy of the lab results of my biopsy. Prostrate was measured at 52grams not 55grams as I thought he had mentioned. Also, he took 14 cores, 2 in each of six regions and also a core from two abnormalities he saw on the ultrasound. While I am glad the biopsy came back negative if there is cancer I want to get it out before it is too late and at an early stage. Hard to explain that but I know many on this forum understand what I am expressing. My prostrate is larger than normal and may hide PC in an area that is hard to access. I have researched the trans perineal biopsy and that might be the way to go if the numbers are suggestive of the need for another biopsy. I wish you all the best. Thank you again for your information. I consider none of this lecturing just good advice from those that have been here before me.",
