      "Content": "My doctors said radiation would be used to relieve pain from the tumors. I did have pain in the prostrate area but they removed that tumor when they did the biopsy. I've had very little pain in that area sense then. I might add that my cancer was found due to a C/T scan. They were looking for kidney stones and found some but also found enlarged lymph nodes and blood in my urine. Then they did the scope up the urethra to look for bladder cancer and the bladder was clear but there was a white mass setting in the prostrate area. That's what they removed and biopsied and below is the diagnosis. Prostatic Urethra, Tumor Bospsy: Postatic Ductal Aderocarcinoma; Gleason Grade 4+5=9. The prostate neoplasm is predominantly a ductal adenocarcinoma with areas of comedonecrosis. PSA and PSaP are weakly positive. Ck903 is negative for basal layer staining the neoplastic glands and a P504S is strongly positive. All controls show appropriate reactivity. The MRI showed swollen lymph nodes along the blood vessels going into the legs and tumors in and around the prostrate. Bone scan was negative. Maybe some of you folks could tell me what all this means and do I need to be doing something beside the firmagon and casodex. I might add that I'm 68 years old.",

      "Content": "Hello to everyone, making my first post as a new patient of an aggressive prostrate cancer. I have a gleason score of 4+5=9 and a PSA of 6. It has not spread to my bones but it has spread in my lymph nodes down both legs. I have tumors in my prostrate and outside of the prostrate. One tumor was removed during biopsy. My case is being treated by my local urologist and a vanderbilt urologist and a team of vandy doctors. There are no plans to remove the prostrate. I am taking casodex and firmagon. No plans for radiation at this time. I am told this is not curable. Please, i welcome any comments. Thanks",
