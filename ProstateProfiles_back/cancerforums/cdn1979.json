    "Content": "my father was just diagnosed with prostate cancer. We know very little of this disease. I read the pathology report but if course don't really understand. Total involvement is 22.5 percent. There is less than five percent involvement on the right side in one section. Each of the four sections on the left side has 30-50 percent involvement. His gleason score is 8 and Psa is 10. He starts radiation today. The doctors said removal of the prostate is being avoided due to his age. He is 73 years old. Does this seam like a proper course of action? Is radiation painful? What are the side effects?",
