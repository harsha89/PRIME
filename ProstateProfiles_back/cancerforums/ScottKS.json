      "Content": "Hi J. I just had robotic surgery on Monday. You can read some of my recent posts. Basically, I came home Tuesday afternoon. I was a candidate for robotic surgery for a few reasons: 1. The urology group that I go to specializes in robotic surgery. My urologist/surgeon is the head of robotic surgery at the hospital where I had the surgery. 2. I'm young. Removing the prostate through robotic surgery gave me the best chance of a 40+ year cure. I had negative CT and bone scans, too. Once the prostate was removed, the cancer was away from the margins, so my future is good. Get as much information about treatment as you can. If you decide to have the surgery, continue working out. Since you feel great, step up your workouts. I worked out like crazy for the three months before my surgery and I think it really helped. I've never had any other surgery, so I don't really have anything to compare it to. For me, the pain was manageable. The robotic surgery puts four holes and a larger \"port\" incision in your abdomen. I had some pain from the incisions. Most of my pain was a result of the constipation from the bowels being \"asleep\" during anesthetic and then waking back up later in the week. The pain medication adds to the constipation. After robotic surgery, you have a catheter for at least a week. I still have mine and am due to get it removed on Monday. The catheter is bothersome. It's uncomfortable to sit or to move around. Everyone that I've talked to about the surgery says they really started to recover once the catheter comes out. Good luck!",

      "Content": "Hi. I had my prostate removed last November. At the time, I was 46, my PSA was 20 and my Gleason was 3+3. DaVinci surgery really was the best option. I have a 9-year old daughter. As a single man in my late 40s, I knew I was giving something up in order to have a better chance of being around for 40 more years of my 9-year old daughter's life. Here's the irony of my situation. I didn't date for awhile after the surgery, for obvious reasons. I started going on a few dates in May. I've been on dates with three different women in the last three months. Two of the three women have father's who have had prostate cancer. The other woman's father passed when she was 9. Two-for-two on women whose father's have had PC. Odd.",

      "Content": "You know, this is a tough one. I feel for you. I'm 47 and I'm eight months post-surgery. My emotions have run the gamut from thankful that I caught the PC, to regret that the treatment I chose was too aggressive (daVinci surgery) to motivated to get into better shape and eat right, to wondering if I'll ever meet a woman that is sympathetic to my situation. I have a therapist that I go to about once a month or so -- more often lately. He's helped me to understand that I can only control the things that are under my control. In order to get into a positive, fulfilling relationship, I just need to be myself, understand my weaknesses and work on them. As a 45+ year old man who isn't interested in dating 20-somethings, he said that most women my age have been with a man who experiences ED. It's something that happens to men as they age. He also said, \"just think, many of those guys have to get up during the night to go to the bathroom and, as they age, they're going to have get up more often. You don't have to worry about that.\" You know, he's right. Now that my continence is back (came back quickly), I sleep through the night, except for the occasional hot flash, which is only once a week...if that often. I'm 47, single, not involved in a relationship and don't have a prostate. I know how my body may respond to sex, but I'm not really sure. All I know is that before a relationship becomes sexual, I have to be honest with whomever the woman may be. If she's not interested because I don't ejaculate or because of the possible ED, then I need to move on and not give up hope. My Gleason was 6. PSA 19.9 10% cancerous, away from the margins My PSA is now undetectable",

      "Content": "You know, this is a tough one. I feel for you. I'm 47 and I'm eight months post-surgery. My emotions have run the gamut from thankful that I caught the PC, to regret that the treatment I chose was too aggressive (daVinci surgery) to motivated to get into better shape and eat right, to wondering if I'll ever meet a woman that is sympathetic to my situation. I have a therapist that I go to about once a month or so -- more often lately. He's helped me to understand that I can only control the things that are under my control. In order to get into a positive, fulfilling relationship, I just need to be myself, understand my weaknesses and work on them. As a 45+ year old man who isn't interested in dating 20-somethings, he said that most women my age have been with a man who experiences ED. It's something that happens to men as they age. He also said, \"just think, many of those guys have to get up during the night to go to the bathroom and, as they age, they're going to have get up more often. You don't have to worry about that.\" You know, he's right. Now that my continence is back (came back quickly), I sleep through the night, except for the occasional hot flash, which is only once a week...if that often. I'm 47, single, not involved in a relationship and don't have a prostate. I know how my body may respond to sex, but I'm not really sure. All I know is that before a relationship becomes sexual, I have to be honest with whomever the woman may be. If she's not interested because I don't ejaculate or because of the possible ED, then I need to move on and not give up hope. My Gleason was 6. PSA 19.9 10% cancerous, away from the margins My PSA is now undetectable",

      "Content": "Your situation is not that different from mine. At 46, I had a PSA of 20 and a Gleason score of 6. The Gleason score was mid-range the PSA was very, very high. I decided just to have my prostate removed. I thought that would provide the best opportunity for long-term success. I'm exactly 4 weeks from robotic radical prostatectomy. Good bladder control, very little leakage and I feel good. I ran two miles today. As far as other \"action\" down there...not much, yet. The doctor says to measure that in months rather than weeks for the bladder/urinary control.",

      "Content": "I'm curious if anyone else has had a hernia post-daVinci robotic radical prostatectomy? I had the daVinci RP on 11/5/2012. My recovery went very well. I had little pain and my continence returned almost immediately. I wore the pads for about three weeks after the catheter was removed, but I really didn't need them for more than a week. However, after the surgery, I noticed some swelling in my lower abdomen...all the way down by my groin on the right side. It was uncomfortable when I wore jeans and bent over to tie my shoes. The first time the urologist who conducted my daVinci sugery saw it, he said, \"Well, you may have some extra fluid build up after surgery. That's normal. Just watch it.\" Well, I've watched it for three months and it's still there. My GP doctor is sure that it is an inguinal hernia, which will require surgery to repair. Anyone else had a inguinal hernia after daVinci RP? For me, the two could be totally unrelated...but I don't think they are.",
