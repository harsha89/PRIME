    "Content": "I am on my third week of radiation therapy. It is the Calypso method. Just had sex this morning before treatment and it was just a little painful but certainly not enough to discourage me from \"it\". edit: I have already been having a urgency to go pee when my bladder is full, and I had this a little before anyway for the past few years. My appointment is at 8:00 AM and when I return I seem to be always hungry and I also seem to be kind of tired. I have been sleeping pretty good, actually better since I started radiation. Unlike radio active my treatment is equal doses of radiation Mon-Fri for 9 weeks.",
