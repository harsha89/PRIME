      "Content": "I need some feed back on the seed implant. I've been told that because my prostate is pushing against my bladder and my PSA's are higher than 10 that I may not be able to have the implants. Now my gleason scales are as following right side 4+3=7 & my left side 3+4=7. I dont want to have the removal surgery,nor do I want to go through Chemo. I appreciate all that get back to me! Thank You In Advance!",

      "Content": "Thank you highlander for the encouraging words. I havent been scheduled for surgery as of yet. Right now i have to have the cat scan on 10/30 and the mri on 11/14. Then i will see the uroligist on 11/16 to bee scheduled for surgery. I only have 2 choices and they are radiation or having my prostate removed.i do believe that it will be the open method. I was diagnosised at the va hospital in northport,ny.......and thats where i will have my surgery done. My psa was at 11.2 and according the the gleason scale my right grade is 4+3= 7 & my left grade is 3+4=7. I don't wanna have radiation because it can damage other parts of the body as well so im going to have the whole thing removed. I'm not going to give up because i've come to far in life. I am a era-vet & a recovering addict who just celebrated 8yrs clean, so giving up is not an opition for me. Please if there is any information that you can give me please feel free to do so!!!!",
