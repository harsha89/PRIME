      "Content": "Originally Posted by HighlanderCFH Welcome to the forum, dilly, Can you give us your biopsy stats, along with your Gleason scores, etc? While the medical field suspects that some diet considerations \"MAY\" help PREVENT cancer, there is no dietary consumable I have ever heard of that can actually cure any type of cancer once it has hit. You say that \"they\" said the lemon juice is 10k times more effective than chemo. Can you tell us who \"they\" are? I would tend to think that it was the radioactive seeding that has been so successful and not what you have been taking. In any case, it certainly does not hurt to take it -- as long as it is not replacing the traditional treatment. In any case, we are all very happy that you are doing much better -- regardless of what is responsible. Good luck! Chuck The Doctors name is William Kelly and the artical I read by him is called, Cancer, curing the incurable. Sorry I don't have the other info that you asked for, just know that it keeps going down and the only thing I have done different is drinking the lemon concentrate every day",

      "Content": "Hope this helps! 4 years ago My psa was tested and it came back 9, had a bladder biopsy and a prostate biopsy and it showed cancer in the prostate, had 110 radiation seeds put in and two weeks after had another psa test, it came back 3 , YEA! got home that day and got on the internet and was looking for natural cures for cancer, What I found was that concentrated lemon juice kills cancer cells in 12 different types of cancer, including breast cancer, they said it was 10,000 times more effective than chemo. To make a long story short I have been drinking about 1 inch high of concentrated lemon juice for 4 years in a glass of water. Every 6 months I have to have another psa test, and every test I have taken since then has come back lower, It went from 3 to one and a half, next six months it went to one point one, next six months it was one, any way the last one was .03 My doctor kind of blows it off, guess he does not want to kill his business, same with big pharma, they would lose millions if not billions. it cost $3.25 for a quart bottle and last about a month. its better than the alternative.",
