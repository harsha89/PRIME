      "Content": "NIH is in Phase II of their study which started in 2011. Originally Posted by Otago I don't think waiting until early June is too long. Only about 3 extra months than you would have if you did early surgery. Regarding the laser ablation, I doubt you'll find anyone here who has done it for prostate cancer. I see a early 7 person trial for cancer. http://www.uchospitals.edu/news/2013...l-therapy.html Interesting concept.",

      "Content": "Another reluctant member of the club\u0085. My dad had PC at age 62, both his brothers had it. All still alive today. My dad is 82. So I was not surprised with the diagnosis. Just wasn\u0092t expecting it so soon. I have an appointment with Dr. Patel at Florida Hospital this week to find out about the surgical option. I also contacted NIH about their clinical trial for the MRI guided laser ablation. I met the first round of qualifications with my pathology results and will be going there in April for an MRI to see if I further qualify. I have to wait 10 to 12 weeks after my biopsy to allow the prostate heal for the before they will do the MRI When I meet with Dr Patel this week, I plan on scheduling the surgery for late May or June so I have time to finish with the qualifying at NIH. At this point that would be my preferred treatment. When I have all the facts, I make a final decision. A few questions. \u0095 Do you think waiting to June for surgery is too long of a wait? \u0095 Has anyone here had the Laser ablation and what were your results? Thanks",

      "Content": "Thanks Lots of good information and a lot to read. I will go to NIH in April for an MRI and proceed from there. I did meet with Dr Patel and his team at Florida Hospital as a backup option, if necessary. If I do go for the surgical option, I have 100% confidence of having it done there.",
