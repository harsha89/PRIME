      "Content": "Hi, i am a new member, my partner has been diagnosed with prostate cancer Although he has had tests MRIs and 2 biopsies it has taken8 months to come to this conclusion, not that he hasnt been seen or long gaps between appointments etc, but the last appointment he was told he had a shadow on the perineum, which is where the last biopsy was performed Just wonderingif anyone else has been diagnosed this way, also lymph nodes were mentioned, so might mean it is in his lymph nodes, Still waiting for more details of exactly what and where this cancer is, appointment later this week Thanks in advance",
