I agree with neutronbob that Zytiga is way over priced and any study that gives me 4 months over a sugar pill does not give me a warm and fuzzy feeling. Also this becomes a cost issue if it falls under part D medicare drugs instead of part B.If you have already gone the homone therapy route I am not sure if this will do much for you. Note to neutronbob, I tried to get back to you last month but your E-mail links wouldn't work.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by panascope What was your experience with Jevtana in effects and side-effects? The side effects were much less than Taxotere. Overall it may have bought me time but did not help PSA or Alk Phos. I had 9 cycles total when we decided it was not doing anything. I am now signing up for a phase two study of XL184, it shows promise of actually getting into the bones and improving scan results and Alk Phos, which is funny as I have been following Alk-phos for over a year. Even my oncologist agrees it is more indicative of my condition than PSA. exelexis.com",
