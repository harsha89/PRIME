    "Content": "Hi all! Some advice appreciated. I was diagnosed in July'17 with prostate cancer that had also spread to my lymph nodes. Initial PSA was 748ug/l with a gleason score of 10. I'm 47 years old. First ADT injection in August'17 followed by chemo (6 cycles of Docetaxel). Had RP with pelvic & para aortic nodal dissection in March'18. 61 lymph nodes removed with 26 of them positive (YpT3bN1M1a). Completed 7 weeks of radiation 2 weeks ago. Current PSA less than 0.1ug/l. Feeling good, tired in the evenings. My question is, what can I expect? Oncologists are not very talkative! I'm positive but also realistic. Any thoughts & experiences would be very much appreciated ��. Thank You! BiographyEdit Value 25/07/17 Pain and numbness into right foot / Lower back discomfort / Leg weakness.
