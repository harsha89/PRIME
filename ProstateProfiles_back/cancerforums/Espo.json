Had infections ruled out & a post op cysto done that was normal. Urolgoist is flummoxed but have seen a pain clinic doc who thinks its referred nerve pain from surgery. Am taking amitriptyline with ? some help but not totally asymptomatic yet. Hopefully is something that resolves with time",

Hopefully things will resolve with time, though being in this profession can be a curse, knowing some of the bad outcomes that are possible. Despite being able to review & digest the medical literature, it nothing like being able to share experiences with actual people who have experienced similar issues...",

      "Content": "OK here's the story...am a 59 yo physician (not urologist) who underwent Davinci procedure 11 weeks ago for localized cancer picked up on routine PSA (1.8 only), nl DRE. Surgery was uneventful, pathology showed Gleason 3+4, localized , path pT2c, 10% gland tumor. Did OK till about 2-3 weeks post-op when had e coli UTI , treated with antibiotics. Despite treatment, symptoms persisted leading to an extended course of antibiotics (3 weeks), although urine cultures & analysis (done twice) were both normal a week after treatment. For the last 2 months however, I have persistent pain in penis (near meatus, i.e, tip) associated with tingling/\"drippy\" sensation there, although I am fully continent & have good stream. Have also some daytime frequency/urgency with this pain , though most nights I can get through without needing to void. Urologist colleague at fits suggested residual inflammation from UTI/healing, now raises possibility of chronic \"pelvic floor\" pain. The symptoms vary in intensity, but the persistence is what is concerning & getting to me...have tried ibuprofen, Azo, Neurontin (2 doses only, side effects) & now on Flomax X 1 week. I feel fine otherwise but cannot envision living like this long term...Urologists I have spoken to don't seem to recall other patients post-Davinci like this...anyone have any similar experiences? Any suggestions are welcome...Thx to all",
