      "Content": "Is it possible for PSA to go to zero after seed implant? Wonder if prostate gland will still produce PSA since there is still tissue. Additionally, is zero the ultimate target after seeds? I didn't ask Doc this. Gleason 7 (3+4), 12 Core Biopsy, PSA 10.8 prior to seeds implanted 5/15. PSA since is 0.2 and last month 0.1. Doc is happy with DRE, PSA and my return from post implant. Thanks",

Considering everything I'm extremely happy. I was blessed to have found a great Radio guy, Dr. Ibrahim Abdalla, in SW Missouri who has excellent results. I talked to multi-doctors before deciding on brachy. I passed on the Robot Surgery but it wasn't because its not a great option. I just felt that brachy at this specific location had great history of positive results and I personally knew of folks who had over ten years of positive results. I've read numerous articles about zero PSA but thought best to ask real folks and not rely on studies. In that I appreciate this forums advise and knowledge. In preparing for my original choice for brachy, I used this source often to see when and where specific folks weeded through their options and how they decided. Thanks for replies.",
