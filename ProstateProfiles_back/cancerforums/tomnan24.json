      "Content": "Originally Posted by Fairwind First, you should know that very few men ever die from Gleason 6 prostate cancer..That grade of tumor very seldom if ever metastasizes and spreads to other organs or bones. BUT, you can never be sure, from a 12 core biopsy, that all of your cancer is Gleason 6. The biopsy performed after a prostatectomy when the entire organ is examined 30% of the time will be upgraded to a higher Gleason score. Your biopsy, with cancer found in 8 of the 12 cores points to fairly extensive (but low risk) cancer. You have probably had it for quite a while...So waiting another 6 months before treatment is not that big a deal but it does add to the risks involved... Having a consultation with a Medical Oncologist (ask your primary care physician for a referral) can be enlightening. They work with both surgeons (Urologists) and Radiation Oncologists and they have seen it all. Their insights can be very helpful..... Urologists can also be surgeons. Radiation Oncologists are a different specialty. They frequently work with Urologists, sometimes in the same treatment center. Medical Oncologists take over when the other two have failed to provide a cure.. While Hormone Therapy is very effective at suppressing prostate cancer, it comes with a heavy side-effect load...Many doctors will shy away from it except as a last resort because of quality of life issues..It also makes treatment more difficult because it masks whether the primary (curative) treatment is working or not... How dangerous is your cancer? That's hard to say without more information..Have you had previous PSA tests before the 5.6 one? If so what are those numbers and when were they done? PSA velocity is important. As a general rule, the quicker your PSA rises, the more aggressive your cancer...Have you read Dr. Walsh's book? It's the best money you will ever spend... Thanks for your insight. I had a 4.5 about 4 months before the 5.6.",

      "Content": "1st Opinion. PSA 5.6, biopsy May 2013 gleason 6, 8 of 12 positive. He said it probably wouldn't kill me for 10-15 years. Had CT scan in February 2013. Doctor said from this that Cancer was contained in prostate so I would be a candidate for hormone therapy to delay surgery/seeds til next year when I will have insurance. Got a second opinion to be safe from a respected doctor. He said I am not a candidate for hormone therapy and in addition said I will need another CT scan for staging in order to have surgery/seeds. Can anyone make sense of these differing comments? 2nd doctor was not that easy to discuss things with. I'll probably talk to the first doctor again, but may get a 3rd opinion. Any thoughts? I'm bummed out.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by Otago You are 64. In which month is your 65th birthday? You'll be covered by Medicare on the first of that month even if your birthday is on the 30th. You do know you need to sign up early so you'll be ready to go on that first day of that birthday month. Do I understand that you know which type of treatment you will choose? Often times if you are doing seeds, and your prostate is large, then they use hormones to shrink the size of the prostate prior to doing the seeds. Not sure if your prostate is large. One example of a study talking about this dual procedure. http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20869105 I'm sure there are many many other studies you could look up. http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/580995 Or you could just do nothing for 5 months. Probably wouldn't make a difference, but I suppose in a small percent, it could make some problem. In the prostate business, nothing is for sure. Where do you live? BTW, do you know the percentage of each of those 8 cores, that is involved? Like in each one being from 5% to perhaps 80%. I don't recall if you gave us that information. You and each doctor you see should know that information. If you acted sooner, you'd probably still be a month or so out anyway. In September at the earliest. Perhaps October. You need to know which type of treatment you will do and how fast you'd be doing it even if you had insurance. The time between that and waiting for Medicare may be small, if you did some preliminary planning prior to actually getting Medicare. Need to know which type of Medicare you'll have. Independent or through someone like Kaiser Senior Advantage,, or whatever they call it now? Where the HMO does all your care and you pay a supplemental fee each month. I take it you've explored all those aspects. Again, where do you live? Has anyone given you a \"total cost\" estimate of doing any of the treatments prior to getting insurance. How much for the total treatment? Your comments are greatly appreciated. I turn 65 May 8th. Although I understand health insurance through Obamacare takes effect Jan 1 and that there is no pre existing condition clause. If nothing changes I will go with seeds. The doctors have noted that my prostate is slightly enlarged, which,before the biopsy, seems to have been nothing of concern. I live in NE Ohio. My 8 positive out of 12 were 1-10%, 3-20%, 1-25%, 1-35%, 1-40% and 1-50% I have not explored those insurance options but my insurance agent(and friend) is looking into the Obamacare options first. We can sign up starting in October but won't be effective til January. Doctor #1 guesstimate $15,000 for seeds and $35,000 for surgery, but he's the same one that estimated my biopsy at $500-$700 and it cost $2,000. Again, thanks.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by Fairwind How old are you? I would guess 64....Urologists like to save ADT until LAST, when other efforts to achieve a cure have failed..Going on ADT produces a lot of nasty side-effects that surgeons don't like to deal with. They say it makes your prostate gland \"sticky\" and hard to operate on, although the best surgeons manage to deal with it if they have to...Radiation Oncologists on the other hand feel HT makes their radiation treatment more effective so they are more likely to approve of your \"holding action\" plan....You are going to discover that Urologists (many of whom are also surgeons) Radiation Oncologists and Medical Oncologists all compete against each other for the patients dollar so it's hard to get all three specialists to agree on a course of treatment.. While Dr. Walsh's book is \"The Bible\" of prostate cancer, Dr. Gerald Chodak's book \"Winning the battle against prostate cancer\" is shorter and sticks with all the treatment options and deals with them in an unbiased way. You may find some insights in that book to help you through the next 12 months.. If waiting 12 months to begin treatment feels to be just too risky for you, traveling to a foreign country like Thailand or even Mexico for the operation might be an option you may wish to consider.... Thanks for the thoughtful comments. I am 64. Both doctors I have talked to are Urology MD's. I'm confused as to how to find out whether they're medical or radiation oncologists. Their offices do both radiation and surgery. Is there a third type that would give me an opinion? My confusion stems from doctor #1 stating I would probably live 10-15 years w/o treatment, then states I need hormone therapy to get me through the next 6 months. Doctor #2 based upon the same results basically says I need to do it(surgery/radiation) now. I would love to wait til January but first need to feel comfortable based on medical opinion. Since they don't agree I am left with very little to base a decision on.",
