      "Content": "Thank all of you for taking the time to answer my post. My husband still has his mental faculties and he still can take care of himself, however, it is hard for him to take a shower or even get into a bathtub now. He sponge bathes. I've tried to get him to agree to have a Home Health Care Nurse come in and bathe him but he won't allow me or them to do so. Because my husband doesn't act like a man who is facing perhaps a heart attack, stroke, or who knows what else, he looks and talks like a smart, intelligent fellow that is in great shape except for his walking ability. My neighbors tell me everday how great he looks, and yet they don't have a clue what I deal with inside the home, when he does have his bad days. He has three children who live close by and they are in their 60's. They call him once in awhile, but never come over. It's not their fault. My husband doesn't want anybody around him but me. I can't go anywhere or do anything without him wanting to be by my side. His kids have offered to take him golfing. Just riding in the cart. But nope, he won't go. So they have given up. But by them giving up, it leaves me taking care of him and never having any \"me\" time. I think my delimma lately, since he stopped taking any meds and seeing any doctors is wondering what happens next. The doctors have told him, that if he doesn't take his heart medication he could end up having a stroke and becoming a vegetable. But he doesn't care. He will not take any more medicine because it makes him feel like a Zombie, and he is a Zombie when he takes his medications. And I have to admit, that was hard on me to deal with. But now that he is not on any meds and good, I'm struck with worry day in and day out, as to what will happen now. it's hard to make plans to do anything to protect my future when you I don't have any way of knowing now how far along he is in his cancer. How far has it spread? The doctor wanted to do a Pet Scan. Fianlly got it approved by Medicare, but there was no sense in going and us paying $150.00 out of our pocket when he says he won't take the treatment or pills or anything if it comes back that it has spread even further. The doctors say what's the point of doing all this if he is refusing treatment. And he absolutely is. My husband doesn't believe he had a heart attack to begin with. He doesn't believe he had an Abdominal Aortic Anuerysm and He doesn't believe 100% he has prostate cancer because he feels good, he says. He believes doctors are only doing this and saying these things because they want to make money. And yes, my husband has been diagnoses as severely paranoid, thus a lot of the problems added to his health problems. However, in a way, I can see his point. Medicines do turn us into Zombies. And the doctors do tell him that Quality of Life does matter and at his age, they understand his not wanting to do all these things, but my goodness he should at least see his Primary Care Doctor, but he won't do that either. I did take some medication for my depression over this and it made me a Zombie, so I stopped taking that too. So I understand where he is coming from. My faith is my medication. No more pills for me either. My post today was hoping to see if anybody has had the experience of knowing somebody who has all these illnesses, and who doesn't see a doctor or take medication could give me an estimate time frame of how long a person can survive with all this and no medication at all or seeing a doctor. I try to Google and I search and seach and search and I can't even find one tiny answer. I know it depends on the person, but surely if someone who is this old and has heart problems and cancer, and doesn't continue any type tratment or take medications, how long can they survive. I guess I will be the only one who will know and then when someone comes along on here and asks the same question, I will be able to tell them. Because I guess I'm the only one who will know. But I don't think I'm the only one that has and is going through this scenario. Somewhere someone has or is experiencing this and I really would like to find them. A person can deal with anything that is thrown at them as long as they have the answers. Some type of time line to be able to work things out both physically, mentally, and financially. I guess this is what my problem is. I can't do any of the above unless I know an estimated time-line. I can plan all day along, which I have. Created budgets and different scenarios, but none of this is worth anything, unless one knows some sort of time-line. Because each scenario I've planned depends on a different time-line. And the longer the time-line is extended, the more chance that the money will run out in our savings account and I may be facing living in my van. FORGOT TO SAY: This is important. His PSA doubles every three months. The last time it was checked was in December and it was up to 14.9. In October of 2017 it was like 9.0 and before that was 2.0. So it is climbing fast and why his Urologist was quite concerned. I know I can't get the answers. I appreciate all of you so much. I wish none of you were on here suffering with your own problems, but you are and you're so willing to help me despite it all. I guess I'm just lost. Can't go forward, can't go backwards, wouldn't want to. Just have the present, which is good, for now. But it's hard to watch someone grow old and be ill, and be so stubborn, and paranoid, and refuse anyones help. I feel useless and lost.",

      "Content": "It's been a long time since I've posted. Perhaps a year ago? My husband is 84 years old In 2014 he had a widow maker heart attack In 2015 he was diagnosed with Advanced Prostate Cancer Stage IV M1a In 2016 he had an Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm In 2017 his PSA kept rising and his hormone treatment of Eligard is not working - his doctor wants to put him on Xtandi In December 2017, my husband stopped seeing all his doctors and he stopped taking all his meds. Since then he looks great and says he feels great and he is still capable of fixing little things around the house. However, looks can be deceiving. He cannot walk very well at all. He gets confused due to some form of dementia coming on. However, he still can make decisions. He gets very weak and gets tired very easily. Needless to say I freaked out when he stopped taking his meds and seeing his doctors. But it is his wishes and the doctors told me there was nothing they could do and they wished me well. Since 2014 I've been a basket case as it's been touch and go for several years now as to wheather he is going to live or die. And now that he is not seeing his doctors or taking his meds it's hard to sleep at night. He still seems strong and he seems not sick in anyway, outwardly. I worry everyday about what that day will bring. I worry about what will happen to me when he passes away as our savings is all gone now do all the Medical Expenses. I worry about me perhaps having to live in my van with my two elderly animals. I go through the day like a Zombie not knowing what my future entails. I try to be strong and not show my worry to my husband because what he is going through is real and what will happen to me lays in the future, and right now I feel guilty for even thinking about my future when I should really be focused on his needs. With all I've said here on this post, has anyone dealt with someone who has a lot of things wrong with them, but are still strong? And if so, how long they lived or what the survival rate may be for someone who stopped everything and lives a life without any form of pills. Not even an aspirin will he take. He takes absolutely nothing. If only I had an idea of what to expect. A year? Two at the most? Can he lived to be 90? Am I being awful for thinking these things? For posting this? I've read where men my husband's age can live a long time even if they are 84 years old, but only if they have low risk Prostate Cancer. Whereas, my husband is high risk. I don't know. I just need to post this today. Please forgive me if this is not the place to post all this.",

Taking care of car repairs, problems that come up, financial woes by high medical care and drug costs that has broke us. Sad because he can't carry on a conversation or understand most anything I say or he forgets our life together more times than not. But I just realized now that after typing all that I said above, it boils down to the real crux of the matter, and that is I don't want to see him die. I can do it all. I can take care of everything. But one thing I can't do, is watch him die. To watch someone so strong become weak and disabled and slowly fading away is just unbearable!!!!! And I don't know if I can do it.",

      "Content": "My husband will be 79 in November. He did see a Urologist in 2010 and I believe his PSA was 65 at that time and they wanted to do a Biopsy on him, but he never went back. My husband exercises every day, takes walks everyday and is very active and eats right. However, he does have serious Prostate issue regarding bathroom trips. I'm worried!",

      "Content": "My husband SPA test result was taken last week and was 80! Yes 80. Our doctor recommended my husband see a Urologist and he went today and this doctor was also very Concerned to see his PSA this high. When this doctor examined him, he found no lumps, but wants to do a Biopsy next Thursday. I understand that most PSA's arer 2.2. or 4.1 and most doctors feel that a 10 is extremely high, so for my husband to be diagnosed as 80...what is going on!",

      "Content": "I actually don't know for sure if the doctor in 2010 said PSA was 65. But I do know what our doctor told me last week, and that his PSA was 80. I did some research online and someone said they had a PSA of 6000 !! I'm really new to all this. I know that PSA stuff is on a point system, but both our regular doctor and the urologist quoted 80 and not 8.0. Do you think that they are assuming we know it is 8.0 and not 80? The doctor said that normally it is a 2 and they get concerned when it's a 10, but yours is an 80 and I think you definitely need to have that Biopsy. My husband is a stubborn man, and doesn't believe in doctors. He has only gone to a doctor a few times in his entire life and believes in Hollistic Healing. I think he will follow through this time, though.",
