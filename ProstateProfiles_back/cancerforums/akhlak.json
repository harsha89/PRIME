      "Content": "Dear Sir, I am Mohammad Asaduzzaman from Bangladesh. I am 45 years old. I am writing about my prostate cancer condition and requesting the opinion from experienced people. I had to take urological consultation in last year, August 2016. Then my PSA (Prostate Specific Antigen) level was 7.1 ng/ml. I had been taking antibiotic medicine according to the doctor and after four months checking my PSA again and it was 4.1 ng/ml. Thereafter I had been leading my normal life. And on February 24, 2017, I checked my PSA level found 6.83 ng/ml and Gleason\u0092s Grade 3+3=6/10 by biopsy test. Lastly, I took consultation from an Indian doctor and he suggested me to take Hormone Therapy (Zoladex Injection) monthly (3 Month) and Calutide tablets 50mg per day without any surgery. Already I have taken two injections. On June 17, 2017, again I have checked my PSA found 1.37 ng/ml. Is it the right way to save me from spreading cancer cell? And What Should I do now? Is it needed to undergo surgery early? Kind Regards, Asaduzzaman Lipton",
