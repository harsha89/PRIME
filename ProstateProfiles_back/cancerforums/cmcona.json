      "Content": "I am 60 years old, recently diagnosed with PC. Gleason 3+3. PSA - 9. Father & maternal grandfather had PC. 10+ years with BPH (taking Flowmax). I am seriously considering having a robotic prostatectomy. The local surgeons have significant experience with the da Vinci Surgical System. Their technique has evolved over many years. Their reputation is good. While doing research I have found a lot of information about Dr. David Samadi's \"SMART\" technique for prostate removal. He claims a 95% cure rate while achieving continence rates of 97% and potency rates of 81% within 1 year. I realize that experience has a lot to do with the success of robotic surgery; however, is there a significant difference in surgical techniques?",
