      "Content": "I wanted to share this info. with anyone who may benefit from it. I was diagnosed in November, '08 from via a rectal biopsy. At that time, only 12 samples were taken...one was a Gleason 6. That was considered to be an 'insignificant' cancer, and I did the watchful waiting for a year. I was not all that concerned, and frankly, had one hell of a good year...leaning more towards the live for today philosophy. When I returned for a follow up, my PSA has risen over 2 points in one year. My urologist wanted to do a follow up biopsy. At that point, I started to do some real research as I'm sure you all have done. The two point jump was cause for concern, as was my urologists switch from 'open' surgery to laproscopic during that particular year. While he had done a thousand plus open surgeries, he had done only a handful of the laproscopic ones. I really liked that guy, but all of my research told me to stay away from anyone who had done less than 300, and one style 'radical/open' did not transfer to laproscopic. I suspect he had to do this because he has MS, but regardless of his decision, I felt that I had to go elsewhere. My research deepened. I correspnded with Dr. Walsh from JH. I did not like his style...frankly, he scared the hell out of me, but I did buy his book(s): maybe that was his goal, I don't know. But after reading them, I was not convinced that I ever wanted to have a radical prostatectomy even though one of his most distinguished 'students', Dr. Joel Nelson, practices right here in Pittsburgh, and he had done over 2000 procedures when I checked him out. I then looked at 'experts' in the laproscopic/robotic surgery. No one in my area had much experience here. I would have had to go to Aventura, FL or Manhatten to find someone who approached the skill level of Dr. Nelson. I actually tried to contact the Kongrad Institute (Florida) after reading a testimony from Steeler linebacker, Robin Cole. They never returned my emails. My research continued to Cryoablation, brachytherapy, beam radiation, to whatever. Some of the treatments that I looked at were not recognized by the AMA, and I would have to travel to the Bahamas or Mexico to have it done...at my own expense, of course since my insurance would not cover it. I 'may' have expressed my confusion, bordering on depression, to my friends. One of them gave me the name of his cousin whom he insisted that I call. This guy had brachytherapy from some 'guy' in nearby Wheeling Hospital, and he couldn't have been more pleased. Turns out that this 'guy' was Dr. Gregory Merrick, and he is a guru (perhaps even the guru) of brachytherapy. He is a radiation oncologist at the Schifler Cancer center in Wheeling Hospital. He responded immediatley to my email message (or rather his staff did), and I had an appointment within 3 weeks. Interestingly enough, I had a biopsy scheduled with my original urologist in 2. Dr. Merrick's nurse told me that I could do what I wanted, but if I went ahead with the standard biopsy, Dr. Merrick would still insist that I have a mapping biopsy before any treatment would be considered. I found out later that the mapping biopsy is much more conclusive as it covers the entire prostate and not just the 25% that the rectal biopsy covers. Further, 60 samples are taken as opposes to the 10 to 15 in the rectal one. Turns out that 16 of my 60 were Gleason 6, and another was Gleason 7. I no longer had an 'insignificant' cancer. Having met Dr. Merrick, and resarched him thoroughly, I decided that I wanted him to do my treatment. That biopsy was in April. I had to 'heal' properly before treatment could commence, which was fine with me. I fished, rode my Harley, and had a great summer with my Honey before doing the treatment yesterday. I don't know if I made the right decision, but I made the one I thought was right. Afer all, it is a balancing act to try to find a treatment that will save your life while not ruining it. Dr. Merrick says that I have a 95% chance to be alive in 15 years...much better odds, he insists, than I have on my Harley. My chances at those scary side effects are no worse, and maybe slightly better than many of the other options that I had. I know this for sure. I have had friends who have taken 6 months to 'recover' from a radical prostatectomy, and they are still in pain, incontinent to some extent, and totally impotent. I am sitting here one day later with no catheter, very little pain, and a pretty good chance for survival. I realize that as the seeds get 'hotter' things could get worse, but hey, it's cancer...nobody said the cure would be easy. I just know that this particular treatment gave me the most hope, and Dr. Merrick was the best choice for me. If it helps even one person...that would be great. One final note. At no time did Dr. Merrick try to scare me. After the biopsy, he told me that I was an excellent candidate for either type of surgery, beam radiation, or brachytherapy. If you didn't know what his specialty was beforehand, you still would not. I liked that. After I told him I wanted brachytherapy, he told me that my chance of surviving 15 years was 95%, and if I had chosen to do nothing, I would have been dead in 5 years...with the last two being very unpleasant. I liked that he waited til after my decision to spring that on me. Sorry to ramble, but if you are diagnosed with PC, you have probably already followed a similar route. God Bless.",

      "Content": "Fairwind...yes everyone must find his own path. My PSA trail is not a long one. After a divorce at age 53, I had a vasectomy. That doctor said that I had an enlarged prostate and should have a PSA test. I had never even heard of that, but followed his advice. I never heard from him, so I don't even know what the reading was. At age 55 when I had a routine colinoscopy, that doctor also suggested a PSA test. I went to a new urologist and had a reading of 4.1. He said that was a bit high, but we would watch it. Six months later, it was 3.8. I was relieved because I had read that if you have cancer, it will not go down. Not true. Six months later, it was 4.3. That is when I had the first biopsy with one core of GL6. Next reading one year later, it was 6.3, still not high by comparison, but the nearly 2 point jump can be considered very bad from what I read. Tell you the truth, Dr. Merrick didn't pay much attention to that 'jump'. PSA scores are suggestive, but mapping biopsies are precise. The 16 GL6's and 1 GL7 meant that I needed to do something, but I still had options. Regal, I just came back from doing a light workout at the gym. I'm pretty sure I would not have been able to do that if I had had surgery on Monday. One factor that helped me make the decision was my bilateral knee replacements on Jan 14, 2008. Right now I am very happy that I did that, but the recovery was pure hell. I hope that I never have to have major surgery again. Even this very small procedure on Monday kind of freaked me out.

      "Content": "I had HDR brachy on Oct. 4, 2010. Mine was done by Dr. Merrick at the Wheeling Cancer Center. I couldn't be happier with the results. I had very little difficulty with the procedure and was back to work after 2 days and back to the gym after 5. I had a bit of rectal discomfort during the 'hot times' (days 10-25), but that was controlled with a light steroid, and passed quickly after day 25. The only issue that I have now is when I drink lots of coffee at which point I sometimes have some leakage before I get to the bathroom. Overall, I am very pleased. My PSA was 6.1 before treatment. At 6 weeks after treatment, it was 0.24. I get checked again in a year. As for ED, I can tell you that this was the primary reason that I chose brachy. My research told me that if I did have issues, I would be more likely to respond to drugs. I have never had 'failure to launch', but I was concerned before and after the procedure because I don't think I get nighttime erections, and I read that can be a sign of ED even if I can still perform. Doc wrote me a script for Viagra, and it is like I am 25 again.",
