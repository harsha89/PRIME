      "Content": "I haven\u2019t posted in four weeks and would like to say that this forum has helped immeasurably. I have not encountered anything that was not covered either in this forum or by my doctors\u2019 forecasts. I strongly encourage all who are facing even the possibility of PC to start with this forum, read everything you can (and judicially investigate/consider the source), and do not be afraid to ask questions of your doctor. Yesterday I finished week 5 of EBRT/IMRT \u2013 24 \u201cdoses\u201d down, 15 to go. My chronology is in my signature, with one exception \u2013 due to the standard urination problem (frequency, occasional difficulty starting stream, occasional cases of unable to maintain stream) I was experiencing before treatment, my urologist prescribed Uroxatral to alleviate additional issues during treatment. I think it has been a big help. I still have frequency and occasional (but at least not chronic) issues, but so far have not had pain or leakage. I must say I feel very fortunate, compared to some of the other cases shared in this forum. I would characterize side effects (hot flashes, fatigue, a couple of instances of dizziness) as annoying but manageable. The worst thing is making sure to have a full bladder for the daily treatments \u2013 as others on this forum have said, I\u2019ve come to REALLY appreciate my two-day weekend breaks. Hot flashes were less than minor the first few weeks, but due to the cumulative effects of the treatments, they have become much more intense in the past week. Still, I would say manageable, because I have observed definite connections to caffeine intake, an occasional glass of wine, and large meals \u2013 things I can control with a bit of discipline! After each Wednesday treatment I see the oncologist for a \u201chow goes it\u201d session. He asks questions about my experience and wellbeing and makes recommendations for treatment management and activities. This coming week I\u2019m scheduled for an ultrasound with my urologist, fingers are crossed for a good result on that.",

      "Content": "Thanks MichiganMan16. You might get a kick out of this little episode \u2026 I like having the first treatment of the day (07:30), figuring that reduces the chance of any delays from backups. So I was sitting there this morning by 07:15 with my full bladder ready for action. The radiologist was a few minutes late (not more than 5, no big deal) calling me in, so I got up onto the table into my mold, they did the alignment, all set and ready to go; however, my picture/personals were not on the monitor, so I wondered about that. Got the scan completed, and I started my mental count for the procedure; got up to three minutes, and wondered why the machine wasn't starting the treatment. Another minute, then another, heard the heavy door, and the radiologist came it to tell me they had a \"software glitch\" and were downloading software, and treatment would start in \"one minute\". So I counted off another four, then from the corner of my eye saw the monitors display my file, and the panels began the treatment. Now, while this is all going on, of course, the only thing I could think of was how badly I had to go, which of course only made the sensation even worse! All told, I was \"on the table\" an extra eight minutes this morning, which at any other time is nothing, but when you're wondering how long you can hold, it seemed interminable!",

      "Content": "Thanks for the encouragement, RobLee. Yes, I did read the EBRT and HT sticky entries, those are great reference tools. Agree on the reluctance to diagnose based on PSA alone; GP originally said he had seen PSAs as high as 80 that were not cancer, and ordered the Cipro. Fortunately, though, he did refer me to the urologist for more aggressive exam and screening, so in the long run he did the right thing. I'm just grateful that it is slow-moving, and we caught it early enough for the optimistic prognosis.",

      "Content": "Thanks for the welcome, guys. After reading several of the forum posts, gaining a better idea of what to post to help other FBs. Just into fifth week after receiving the HT injection (Eligard). Pain after the injection was slight, very manageable, just felt like a little bruise. First morning after the injection felt very groggy, confused, and tired. Caveat - had picked up my wife from airport late the previous night, so the \"hangover\" effect could be attributed to insufficient sleep, also possibly an overactive imagination from all the reading leading up to the Eligard. Next few weeks were so-so. Some very infrequent flashes, but nothing causing sweating. I would sense a sort of warmth spreading through my body, nothing lasting longer than 30 seconds. I had been having frequent nighttime urination for several months, so did not notice any increase from the HT. Had a couple of times that I could not get back to sleep, just felt \"uncomfortable\" and wide-awake. Other than that, I have noticed that I fatigue a bit more frequently during yard work and other exertion, so have learned to pace my activities throughout the day. Have not yet noticed any weight gain; in fact, I seem to have lost 3 pounds since starting HT - but that could be attributed to paying more attention to eating smarter, and reducing alcohol. Still enjoy a glass of wine while reading in the evenings. Today is Thursday, just started EBRT/IMRT on Tuesday, so will withhold observations until I have a comparison. Hope this helps others just starting their journey.",

      "Content": "DjinTonic, Thanks for the tipoff to the studies. Finally got around to checking them out. I just completed week 5 of treatment (24 of 39 \"doses\" done). For no good reason, I have been putting off returning to my fitness center workouts since the biopsy came back malignant. I think it has been a case of fearing that something physiologically negative might happen - with no good reason, obviously. I've been rationalizing by using two exercise walks a day with my dog and light yard work. Based on the encouragement from the studies, I will make a focused attempt to get back to the treadmill and light weight resistance at my fitness center (I'm paying for membership, after all!). Again, thanks for the suggestions. Regards, Jim",
