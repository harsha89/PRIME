      "Content": "I have been lurking in these forums the last several days, but decided to actually post my query after some hesitation. My heart goes out to all the men here who have been dealing with prostate cancer - your positive attitude and outlook is infectious and encouraging. I am 31 years old and in good health. Although I feel like I don't even have the privilege to post here until I have done a biopsy, I hope that you would be willing to hear me out to help me decide how to proceed. Here's a short background: I had a prostate flare-up in September, which got taken care of with Cipro and I was feeling 100% in 3 weeks (no DRE was performed at this stage because I couldn't see a Dr.). I've had a couple of short flare ups before - several years ago. Then I had a second more serious infection at the beginning of December, which has now lasted 2 months. At its worst, symptoms included lower back pain, pain and discomfort in the prostate from sitting, and prostate pressure that I felt in the rectum; no urgency or frequency of urination, though I have had somewhat slower stream and sensation of the prostate at the end of my urination process. Cipro alleviated most of the symptoms, except for the hardening of the prostate (which is what worries my urologist). After extensive testing, my urologist has had a difficult time giving me a clear diagnosis. We have been unable to detect white blood cells or bacteria in prostate liquid, and the semen culture is clear. My PSA is normal (0.5). My MRI showed some low signal in parts of the prostate, but nothing too alarming or decisive. A rectal ultrasound showed some white spots on the image in the back area of the prostate, but since it didn't show shadowing we can't attribute that to stones. Urologist has done 2 DREs 2 weeks apart, and during both of them he said that my prostate is \"very hardened and very abnormal.\" First time around he said that if I were an \"older man\" he would diagnose me with prostate cancer. He claims that the hardness is general, not isolated in one area and he didn't mention any nodules. I actually feel the hardened prostate when I sit, especially in the second half of the day as I feel it get worse as the day progresses. Although he says that my chances of having prostate cancer are very low, he is unable to explain the hardened prostate (as far as I know this is not a common symptom of prostate infection). He says that the only way to rule cancer out is to do a prostate biopsy. I am seeking a second opinion this week, but wanted to reach out to those who have experience with this to see what they would recommend. Should I do a biopsy? It is extremely concerning to me that hard prostate is almost always associated with cancer, and it never seems to be mentioned as a normal symptom of inflammation or infection, so this has left me (and my Dr.) highly confused.",

      "Content": "I now have an update based on my consultation with a 2nd urologist, who I sought out for a second opinion. After DRE he reported that my prostate feels \"smooth, normal, not hard at all, not bumpy, no nodules, or anything of the sort\" (this seems to be the exact opposite of what my main urologist said as late as last Thursday, when he again reiterated that it felt \"very abnormal and hard\"). He is ruling out cancer and thinks that a biopsy is not warranted, especially give its risks. This 2nd urologist also mentioned that DRE's can be very \"subjective,\" but these are diametrically opposed assessments from two guys all within 6 days of each other. The 2nd urologist also had a very interesting suggestion about my current lingering symptoms, which are (1) growing discomfort as the day passes in the scrotum/rectal area, especially if I sit most of the day, getting worse into the night; (2) sudden pressure and discomfort in the prostate and rectum area from erections and even arousals. He thinks that this may be associated with stressed, weakened, or irritated nerves and muscles in the pelvic area (usually referred to as Chronic Pelvic Pain) which tend to cause symptoms that are very similar to chronic prostatistis. I don't doubt that I actually had a prostate infection during this episode, but the pelvic pain syndrome seems to be a reaction to the infection or at least lingering symptom. He referred me to a physical therapist for the pelvic pain, and gave me 2 weeks sample of Rapaflo (an alpha blocker that's usually prescribed to help with urinary symptoms due to BPH, but apparently can relax the muscles in the pelvic area and help with symptoms of chronic prostatitis as well). It is a relief to hear that this guy thinks it is not cancer, but I am going to see a few more urologists just in case.",

      "Content": "Highlander - thanks for your response and for welcoming me. I will say that the hardness in the prostate definitely seems to fluctuate (from what I can tell internally in my backside and scrotum region). For the last week or so it has softened up and feels almost normal during the first half of the day, but gets irritated by prolonged sitting (or by alcohol in the evening - which I have cut out ) and then it seems to become harder. There's another symptom that I didn't mention which is that whenever I get erections I feel a rush of tremendous pressure in the prostate area - at the peak of the infection a couple of weeks back, I would actually get pain in the prostate area when I would get erections but that has subsided and now I just feel a lot of pressure down there. I have no urinary symptoms but I know that PC tends to be asymptomatic until it reaches a certain stage when it causes an obstruction (which I also don't have). Super worried even though the doctor says I would be one for the record books if I have cancer - but as you said it is not unheard of.",
