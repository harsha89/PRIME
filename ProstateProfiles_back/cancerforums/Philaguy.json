    "Content": "Looking for a good doctor in the Phila area for a second opinion. My current urologist has already suggested prostate removal and recommended a Dr. Ilia Zeltzer out of Bryn Mawr. My PSA at diagnosis was 56 and my gleason score is 3+3 & 3+4 with one core 4 + 3. CT and bone scans are clear. I'm confused because there hasn't been any suggestions of oncologist - just the urologist and surgeon. Trying hard to stay positive, my husband is not handling this well at all any info provided is much appreciated!",
