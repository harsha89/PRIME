      "Content": "I just visited my Urologist/Oncologist Friday and sounds like I have 3 options to consider for my PC treatment: 1) The most recommended is open surgery rather than DaVinci. Apparently, I have a couple of Lymph nodes that need to be looked at and they are not where the DaVinci robotic surgery can easily reach. The open surgery option necessitates an extra day of hospital stay (so 4 days instead of 3), catheter insertion for at least 2 weeks (not looking forward to that), and who knows what all else I'll run into. 2) Radiation treatment is another option but even the Radiation oncologist said that in my particular case, he would recommend surgery rather than radiation. 3) No treatment at all. Live with whatever comes. Got to make a decision! Now what to do? Wayne",

      "Content": "Not sure what else to expect next. In August, I started a 2 month period of Hormone therapy (30 days of pills and then one injection in abdomen that is supposed to be good for 6 months) prior to the Radiation Treatment starting on Oct 24th. Today is the 2 week date from the start of the radiation and I'm experiencing difficulty urinating, painful rectal burning, occasional blood in stool similar to what I've previously experienced with hemorrhoids, an almost constant feeling of needing to have a bowel movement, etc. I always prepare for the radiation sessions with a full bladder and after a recent bowel movement. At last weekly clinic appointment the doctor suggested regular Advil to treat the urinary issues (that should relieve the inflammation somewhat). The bowel issues have started since then and will be the topic of discussion at this week's clinic I'm sure. I'm beginning to wonder what else I can expect. These are starting to feel like pretty severe issues and I'm still in the fairly early days of my radiation therapy. What else is likely to happen and how bad are my current symptoms likely to get. Any insight would be welcome....",

      "Content": "Primary care Dr. has been tracking PSA levels for 20 years (I'm currently 65) with steady slow increase over time. Latest PSA levels are bouncing between 5.5 - 7.9 and my doctor has referred me to a Urologist. Last year the Urologist performed a DRE and indicated that he felt nothing suspect (but 10 minutes later changed his story when I objected to having an ultrasound and decided that he had felt something of concern). Then, he sent me to his assistant who scheduled me for an ultrasound guided biopsy - NOT an ultrasound! So already, I've been lied to, tried to be tricked into a biopsy, etc. Total lack of trust with this Urologist now - I don't believe anything he says. I really don't want a biopsy unless it is absolutely necessary. Our local hospitals have too may stories about exposure to C-Dificile, MRSA, etc. infections. Then, I read all sorts of articles that show minor life expectancy differences between people who have PC treatment and those who don't. BUT everyone I've ever met who has had prostatectomy or radiation treatments has had catastrophic side effects of their treatment with corresponding quality of life issues ever afterwards. Why would I subject myself to a biopsy and/or treatment if cancer is indicated? I really don't know what to do here but I have been referred to a different Urologist for a 2nd opinion next week. How can I ever trust these guys to do what's right for me and not their pocketbooks? Wayne",
