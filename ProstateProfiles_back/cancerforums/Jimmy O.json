      "Content": "Was recently diagnosed. Gleason's were one 4+5 ten 4+4's and one 3+3. Ct scan report looked good as far as containment. Waiting On bone scan. Any opinions on surgery or radiation as far as options? Also has anyone used the DA Vinci surgical method? Still have to meet with doctors but hoping to get some insight from men who have been there. Thanks for any input",
