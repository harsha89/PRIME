      "Content": "My understanding is it has nothing to do with healing the nerves. That is simply time. The purpose of Cialis,Viagra and Levitra is to keep blood flow going into the penis so the tissue does not atrophy and die wihile waiting for the nerves to heal. That therapeutic dose for blood flow is low and shouldn't have side effects. Hubby takes 2.5mgs every night. Night time is best so it's strength is strongest and simulates nighttime erections.",

      "Content": "My husband had the DaVinci on May 9th, 2013. We have sex thanks to Trimix. His erections with that have been as hard or harder than before surgery. We've had a few \"oops\" where it didn't work, but it's operator error. He has no complaints about the orgasms. Different but good. The orgasm during intercourse after one of the successful shots, was as close to before surgery as he's had. He said he felt a release even though nothing came out. I think the biggest difference is the spontaneity. We have to plan. That is my biggest issue. Can't wake and decide to have a quickie. Since he can only do 3 shots a week, we have to plan. The rest of the time, we have sex while he's soft. He can have an orgasm that way too. Everything else, including the \"oops\" is much, much, much better than I read it would be and anticipated it to be and worried about. I think one of the reasons is communication and laughter. We talk and laugh, talk and laugh, talk and laugh, talk and laugh, talk and laugh, talk and laugh and talk and laugh some more. Nothing is too serious or sacred. With open and honest communication all things are possible. Laughter diffuses tension and stress. Besides, floppy dicks are soooo cute! lol... I can see the eye rolls all the way in AZ! He does not like the pump, but does it for therapy and believes it helps. He takes daily Cialis to help with blood flow. Use it or lose it! We intend to use it! He is just hit the 3 month mark. Doctor said it's like a toddler in the terrible twos. Things that were going good, stop. He said hang in there and it will get better again.",

      "Content": "It's been one year today since Dave's surgery and what a year it's been. I was scared to death but it's all been so much better than I ever dreamed after researching during those months before. Life has changed and our journey has taken different directions. We have a new normal. What hasn't changed is our love and commitment to each other. He has been cancer free so far and will find out next week when the year results are in for the PSA test but I know in my heart it will be zero. He's alive, healthy, happy and I couldn't feel more blessed to be his wife. Bottom line? Life is pretty damn good!",

Everyone should get them every 5-7 years or when doctor says to. Can I give you guys a hard time? ok, I am anyway. Men whine about the DRE. Seriously. we have that done along with every other orifice checked every year, have our boobs mushed and squeezed till we get tears in our eyes, expel blood from our vagina every month, have colonoscopies when we get to a certain age AND we give birth. So...guys, seriously. A colonscopy and a DRE is not a big deal. Dave whines like it's as bad as his surgery. I hope that ya'll are getting that I have a pretty wise-ass sense of humor.",

      "Content": "I really don't think about the PSA. But when he called that morning, I got instantly choked up and had a hard time even saying hello. When he told me the tears just started flowing. You really don't realize how bottled up the emotions are inside, even though we talk about it a lot. Now about the Trimix.... Doc said it is most likely the med and not anything Dave is doing wrong. He told him he could go up on the dose to 25-28 and see if that works. Well, yesterday he did 25 and never got hard at all. He would prefill some syringes and leave them in the fridge. Now Dave is thinking he had it in the fridge too long. He has 2 frozen vials and we'll try a new vial. If the new vial doesn't work, he'll take it back and talk to the pharmacist. He also has a new prescription. Venus leakage....doc says that happens to some guys during the nerve healing process and it should stop on it's own. If not, there really isn't anything you can do. Now about testosterone.... doc said 1 more PSA in 3 months. If that is 0, then he'll have Dave do T gel for three months to see if there is a rise in PSA. If not, he'll ok him for pellets. Now about his knee (the list goes on)..... saw that doc right after the urologist and had another MRI. there is a spot that shows the bone has died. Doc said if he wants to take a risk, he could try a partial knee replacement, but it might not work given the ligament damage too. Or he can do a full replacement. Here's the deal....a partial knee replacement will last him his whole life. A full replacement is good for about 15 years. Now about his wife....oh wait...that's another story for another forum somewhere.....",

      "Content": "I really don't think about the PSA. But when he called that morning, I got instantly choked up and had a hard time even saying hello. When he told me the tears just started flowing. You really don't realize how bottled up the emotions are inside, even though we talk about it a lot. Now about the Trimix.... Doc said it is most likely the med and not anything Dave is doing wrong. He told him he could go up on the dose to 25-28 and see if that works. Well, yesterday he did 25 and never got hard at all. He would prefill some syringes and leave them in the fridge. Now Dave is thinking he had it in the fridge too long. He has 2 frozen vials and we'll try a new vial. If the new vial doesn't work, he'll take it back and talk to the pharmacist. He also has a new prescription. Venus leakage....doc says that happens to some guys during the nerve healing process and it should stop on it's own. If not, there really isn't anything you can do. Now about testosterone.... doc said 1 more PSA in 3 months. If that is 0, then he'll have Dave do T gel for three months to see if there is a rise in PSA. If not, he'll ok him for pellets. Now about his knee (the list goes on)..... saw that doc right after the urologist and had another MRI. there is a spot that shows the bone has died. Doc said if he wants to take a risk, he could try a partial knee replacement, but it might not work given the ligament damage too. Or he can do a full replacement. Here's the deal....a partial knee replacement will last him his whole life. A full replacement is good for about 15 years. Now about his wife....oh wait...that's another story for another forum somewhere.....",

      "Content": "So, as I posted in my 6 month...thread, we had fun. But the curious me is always looking for/at changes. We had some very positive \"first times\" since surgery happen. Of course, I approach all this objectively and scientifically. Pure medical research. During the Levitra experience, he couldn't get penetrative hard but hard enough to stroke. He was spurting a whitish fluid like he used to spurt ejaculate. It was not during orgasm and it was NOT urine. This is the first time that happened. Could that be from his testicles? I have no idea. He was standing because of gravity helps with erections and his damned knee. He had a hard time having an orgasm that way because of pain in his knee. We decided to experiment and had him lay down and used a cock ring. It was not the one that comes with the pump. It was a cheap sex toy one that I got for free. lol... don't ask. But! It worked! First time for that too! First time that he stayed hard laying down too! Another thing I've noticed and that many of you have expressed concerns about is length. I'm not sure it's so much length that is lost much as the penis is pulled back into the body a bit. I've noticed with him that the injections get him what I believe is a bigger penis than before surgery, but it doesn't look like it unless his pelvic area is pressed in. If there is any pelvic fat, it's even more obvious. The purely objective curious scientist in my decided to experiment. I will admit to having a willing subject. I would say that 1-1.5\" was added when pressing in on the pelvic area. Subject was surprised as well as he thought he lost length too. The absolute best part of all the scientific tests and observations is that the subject is very happy with the test results and the progress made since surgery and is very encouraged about the future and continued improvement.",

I'm also very active in helping women regain through hormone support what menopause or hysterectomy takes away. A total hysterectomy is pretty much like what PC surgery is. I know first hand as I had one in 1987. We may still have an orifice that a penis fits into but without hormones, that's all it is. Men after PC surgery have the desire, but not the means. Women after a hyst, have the means, but lose all desire. Kind of the same but different.",

      "Content": "My husband (age 62) had DaVinci surgery on May 9th, 2013. Nerves were spared. He healed quickly and without complications. Catheter came out in one week. His doctor had started him on daily Cialis (5mg) 1 month prior to surgery. He is now taking 2.5mgs daily. One week after the cath came out, doctor got him set up with vacuum therapy which he was told to do every day for the first month and 3-5 times per week after that.. One month after surgery he went in for his first Trimix injection. He has not dripped in 3 weeks and has not worn a pad in a month. He does Kegels religiously. PC is not a journey we wanted to take. But we want to share that there is life after surgery. I think one things that helps us is his wife survived breast cancer for 5 years and was then diagnosed with stage 3 ovarian cancer. She fought that for 6 years till she died in 2005. It changed him. It made him realize how fragile life is and he gives thanks for each and every day because you don't know when it will be your last. He said he will not let cancer beat him or define his life. I think another reason we are doing so well is communication. We talk and laugh and talk and laugh and talk and laugh and talk and laugh and then talk and laugh some more. No topic is off limits. No joke too insensitive. We both have a wise-ass sense of humor and will not give that up. We don't judge the other's feelings and emotions. We don't focus on what we lost and can't do but instead, on the future and what we can do. Is sex the same? Yes and No. The spontaneous act of lovemaking or hot, intense sex is gone. We have to plan. So we plan. Is the sex with or without intercourse as satisfying and incredible? ABSOLUTELY! He said the orgasms are great and feel just about the same but without ejaculate. He can have orgasms while completely soft. We laugh about attempts that don't work. We celebrate those that do. Only WE can make our future good. And in spite of PC we are. If anyone wants some tips, please PM me. I'm not sure how much I'm allowed to post here.",

      "Content": "After my hysterectomy in 1987, I lost ALL my sex drive and I got old. Very old. I thought old, acted old, dressed old and felt old. After moving to AZ in 2000, I discovered my gyn did hormone pellets. These are made of either estrogen or testosterone and are a little bigger than a grain of rice. She implants them under the skin of my rear in a simple office visit. Within 48 hours my sex drive went from 0 to 160. Desire, arousal, lubrication and orgasm were not only back but incredible. I actually reversed my aging; physically and mentally. I've helped hundreds of women find doctors that do pellets and have the largest support group on the internet. I'm also a moderator on the menopause forum of the same website where I'm active in the prostate cancer forum. These pellets have been around for about 70 years. My dad who had PC cancer in the 90's had estrogen pellets implanted in his stomach. They are FDA approved for men (testosterone only) but not women. Compounding pharmacies make them. Dave had low T and did the pellets for 2 years. He felt great, sex drive improved, erections were like when he was in his 20-30's, he had energy, slept better, had more motivation to work out and a host of other things. Because Testosterone feeds PC, the 3 urologist we spoke to said they were his guardian angel in that they made the cancer grow faster and allowed it to be found so early. Out of 14 cores, they only found a tiny spot on 1 core. After he is cancer free for 9-12 months, they said he can go back on T therapy. that's one reason he did surgery so fast. He loves how he feels.",

      "Content": "Dave is approaching 6 months post surgery. We talked about leaking today and he said he's not really leaking at all and doesn't even think about it anymore. He said last week he got caught on a couple conference calls where he could not get off and had to pee. He said he was able to make it through the calls and to the bathroom after the calls. Today we were fooling around before he did the shot. To our surprise, he got engorged! Not enough for penetration but not marshmallow cream either! His \"unit\" as he calls it was actually standing at attention. I believe he has venus leakage a bit. He did the shot, got really hard and we had sex. We were an absolute comedy to watch. Remember his knee surgery? Well, try to find an upright position where he doesn't have to be on his knee. Standing at the side of the bed is one, but you can't do that for a long time. Plus he has a difficult time having an orgasm that way. lol we tried a few positions, got stuck in one and couldn't move and and one time I fell over. So once we were done laughing and could actually move, I had him lay down. The erection kind of went down a bit. Not all the way, but noticeably. We finished and once he stood up, he got really, really hard. Lay down go softer, stand up get harder. Anyone else have that happen when laying down? We are very, very happy with the progress! The biggest change I don't like is the loss of spontaneity. But we deal with it.",

Dave said he swore it was going to come out at times. But when the doc pulled it out, I was amazed at how long it was and that there was the bulb. Make sure you don't wear a damp/wet pad. Once you feel it get damp, it's time to change. First of all, it's dark, hot and with the plastic, it's easy to sweat down there. Yeast thrive in dark, hot and damp. Dave got either diaper rash or jock itch from wearing the pads. Keep talcum powder on down there and the pads dry. If you do get a rash/chafed/irritated try organic coconut oil. That is very healing and fixed Daves. If you don't want to smell like a Pina Colada, get the refractionated and it won't smell.",

      "Content": "The BRCA gene test is a blood test that uses DNA analysis to identify harmful changes (mutations) in either one of the two breast cancer susceptibility genes \u0097 BRCA1 and BRCA2. Women who have inherited mutations in these genes face a much higher risk of developing breast cancer and ovarian cancer compared with the general population. Dave's wife had the BRCA1 gene. She survived breast cancer, but passed away from ovarian cancer. Both of her sisters had breast cancer. We were told that their sons should start PSA tests at 35 as the BRCA can increase the risk of PC in sons. Especially now that Dave has pc. Kind of a double whammy. There is some controversy over that and I found this site that, I think has some good information both for and against. http://prostatecanceruk.org/news/brc...s-myth-busters But my point here, is if you know any women with the BRCA 1 or 2 genes and they have sons, they should be aware of the connection and get tested about age 35.",

      "Content": "There are many things that are natural and do help fix things besides prescribed medications. What is wrong with at least trying a natural fix? It took care of hubby's problem. Way too many doctors and non-doctors put down a possible cure that isn't benefiting the big pharma and the doctor's wallets. I used to be more resistant to more natural things, but have a friend that completely believes in them. So far, the things she's told me have worked. For example, I suffer from chronic constipation. For year, my doc said take this drug, take that drug....nothing worked. In addition to the prescribed drugs that did nothing but make me nauseated, I took 3 stool softeners per day and fiber. I ended up having a hemorrhoidectomy that is the most painful surgery I've ever had. They could have cut off my legs with a chain saw and no pain meds and that wouldn't have been as bad. My friend told me about slow release, high quality magnesium. Totally took care of the constipation. If I had known about it years ago, I probably could have avoided the surgery. I told my doc and at first he was resistant and said \"they just want to make money from you\" and \"what works for you doesn't work for everyone\". More accurately, he's not making money from natural supplements so he doesn't want to suggest them. After I got pissed and told him he needed to open his mind and close his wallet to big pharma, maybe, just maybe this might help someone else. Guess what? He now has it in his office. After hubby's surgery, they told him to take stool softeners. They did not work. He started taking my magnesium and it worked like a charm. So....open your minds, close your wallets supporting big pharma and just try some natural things. You might just be surprised.",

      "Content": "My discussion of the differences between HRT vs. BHRT has nothing to do with whether or not something can be patented. The difference is in the molecular structure and the delivery method which determines how the body uses it. The molecules in HRT from Pregnant Mare's Urine and is NOT the same molecular structure as what the ovaries produce. In BHRT, they are. The proof I need: is does it improve my quality of life? If yes, then it's a choice I make for myself. I have Ankylosing Spondylitis. I do two medications that have very dangerous side effects. One is an injection that is a TNF inhibitor called Enbrel. The other is a cancer drug called Methotrexate. There is no cure for AS, just drugs to improve my quality of life and maybe slow down the progression of the disease. Based on Brad's and Otago's comments, I should not use those drugs either because they have such high side effects including death. My rheumatologist that monitors my AS told me he wanted me off of HRT (Premarin). However, it was about the same time I found BHRT pellets. He approved of the BHRT and the pellets because they bypass my liver and stomach and are not metabolized by them. Because of AS, Enbrel and Metho, my kidneys function at about 60%. My kidney doctor also approves of the BHRT over HRT. Here is some good information about the differences between HRT and BHRT: 1. http://thecompounder.wordpress.com/2...-therapy-bhrt/ 2. The ESTHER Study from France published in Circulation in 2007, showed oral, not transdermal estrogen, was associated with VTE. None of the studies utilizing subcutaneous hormone pellet therapy have shown an increase risk of VTE, heart attack, stroke, or breast cancer. In addition, the WHI did not utilize any of these preparations and therefore conclusions about subcutaneous hormone pellet therapy cannot be made based on WHI data. Ronald Young, MD, a prominent Houston Ob-Gyn, and an investigator in the HERS Study and the WHI, in a recent interview agreed the WHI was flawed. He stated you just don't give estrogen in those doses to women at that age (average age of women in WHI was 64) very often. 3. http://www.differencebetween.net/sci...-hrt-and-bhrt/ 4. http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3131235/ I am trying to upload a PDF with some studies, however, I'm running into problems.

I asked him if he's getting his PSA checked. He said his was 0 and his doctor told him there was no chance of him ever getting pc and didn't see the need for PSA test. So, me being me, told him he needed to get it checked. He said he was in October. So a doctor who is giving a man testosterone pellets tells him he doesn't need to get his PSA checked. Lovely.",

No one can say that with 100% assurance. The second thing is not testing PSA when a guy is doing T therapy. Irresponsible in my opinion. Yes, I have been getting estradiol and testosterone pellets for 9 years. Although testosterone converts to estrogen, it doesn't convert enough in women to rely on it alone. Dave's estrogen got really high the first time he got pellets so he had to take arimidax to lower it. It is 100% correct that there has to be the correct balance of estrogen and testosterone. Too much or too little of either causes symptoms which can be the same.",

      "Content": "In regards to Testosterone therapy after prostate cancer surgery, I encourage you to watch this video starting at 25:19. Sloan Kettering is pretty highly regarded as experts in PC. Dr. Mulhall discusses where the belief came from that testosterone fuels prostate cancer. He also discusses the incidence of men using T therapy after PC surgery at Sloan Kettering. I know a urologist here in Phoenix would not have prescribed T to pc patients 2 years ago and does so now. Information is changing. Old information is being challenged. Patients are being given the right we deserve to make decisions as long as we know the good, bad and ugly. I spoke to him personally and he agrees that it's ok. Now, I also agree that any kind of therapy should be monitored and the lowest does that is effective is given. That applies to any drug or supplement. We don't need to be stupid about it and more is not necessarily better. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ie8NkOu2VNA",

      "Content": "Dave has dry orgasms. He says they feel good but different. I asked if they were satisfying. He said yes. However, the last time he used the injection he said he felt like there was a release to his orgasm. He said it felt almost like a pre-surgical one. He did say too, that the orgasm while he was hard was better than when soft. I did not detect anything in me, so I don't think anything actually came out. My ex did not have PC cancer, but did have an elevated PSA and probably prostatitis (sp?). He also had dry orgasms on occasion. I know you guys miss ejaculating. I can't speak for other women, but I miss it too. I think guys usually have one kind of orgasm. I'm not sure if some can be stronger or weaker than others. I've asked him as well, if orgasms during intercourse feel different than manual or oral. lol...He looks at me like I'm crazy (he's not far off!) and says \"it's an orgasm!\". Women have many different kinds. Clitoral, vaginal, uterine, cervical and the always mysterious g-spot. We also have NBN (no battery needed) orgasms from manual or oral and a host of different kinds of vibes which give different sensations. Some of my friends that have also had a total hysterectomy (TAH-BSO) swear that they had uterine orgasms before surgery and after surgery orgasms are a blip and not a tidal wave.",

I don't take what they say as gospel. I question and question again. That being said, I would like to make a comment about doctors, forums and our health. As a moderator of a menopause forum, forum owner, owner of several Yahoo groups and a participant of many forums for lots of different topics, please remember that in your research following diagnosis or treatment, the many posters in any kind of forum are those not doing well, are searching for answers, need help, are scared and maybe depressed and desperate. The vast majority of people that are doing great are living their lives are not posting on forums and groups. There are some of us that have made helping others a passion and we are also out there posting or even starting support groups for others. When my husband was first diagnosed, I was alone in a hotel on a business trip for a week. I spent every night researching (even knowing I shouldn't) about PC. I cried myself to sleep every night too. I thought our lives were basically over. I dreaded the last 2 weeks prior to surgery and didn't handle the thought of our last time making love very well. Well guess what? There is life after PC surgery! He's doing well, not leaking like a firehose as I read he would. Our sex life is still awesome. I won't say things haven't changed, but it's still awesome. So, please try (I know it's hard) to keep a positive outlook. I know you are scared but post treatment life may not be as bad as you read about in forums and on websites. We have found that to be true. Does life take a different road? Yep, and the road can and will be bumpy. But not as bad as I or he expected.",

The difference is in the molecular structure and the delivery method which determines how the body uses it. The molecules in HRT from Pregnant Mare's Urine and is NOT the same molecular structure as what the ovaries produce. In BHRT, they are. The proof I need: is does it improve my quality of life? If yes, then it's a choice I make for myself. I have Ankylosing Spondylitis. I do two medications that have very dangerous side effects. One is an injection that is a TNF inhibitor called Enbrel. The other is a cancer drug called Methotrexate. There is no cure for AS, just drugs to improve my quality of life and maybe slow down the progression of the disease. Based on Brad's and Otago's comments, I should not use those drugs either because they have such high side effects including death. My rheumatologist that monitors my AS told me he wanted me off of HRT (Premarin). However, it was about the same time I found BHRT pellets. He approved of the BHRT and the pellets because they bypass my liver and stomach and are not metabolized by them. Because of AS, Enbrel and Metho, my kidneys function at about 60%. My kidney doctor also approves of the BHRT over HRT. Here is some good information about the differences between HRT and BHRT: 1. http://thecompounder.wordpress.com/2...-therapy-bhrt/ 2. The ESTHER Study from France published in Circulation in 2007, showed oral, not transdermal estrogen, was associated with VTE. None of the studies utilizing subcutaneous hormone pellet therapy have shown an increase risk of VTE, heart attack, stroke, or breast cancer. In addition, the WHI did not utilize any of these preparations and therefore conclusions about subcutaneous hormone pellet therapy cannot be made based on WHI data. Ronald Young, MD, a prominent Houston Ob-Gyn, and an investigator in the HERS Study and the WHI, in a recent interview agreed the WHI was flawed.

My husband got the testosterone pellets for 2 years prior to diagnosis. He so much wants to go back on them and as long as his PSA is non-dectable, he can maybe after 9 months. The pellets are tiny compressed pellets that are inserted under the skin of the rear. His PSA was 197 before he started and it was raised to about 1000 after insert. He got them about every 4-5 months.",

      "Content": "Dave has dry orgasms. He says they feel good but different. I asked if they were satisfying. He said yes. However, the last time he used the injection he said he felt like there was a release to his orgasm. He said it felt almost like a pre-surgical one. He did say too, that the orgasm while he was hard was better than when soft. I did not detect anything in me, so I don't think anything actually came out. My ex did not have PC cancer, but did have an elevated PSA and probably prostatitis (sp?). He also had dry orgasms on occasion. I know you guys miss ejaculating. I can't speak for other women, but I miss it too. I think guys usually have one kind of orgasm. I'm not sure if some can be stronger or weaker than others. I've asked him as well, if orgasms during intercourse feel different than manual or oral. lol...He looks at me like I'm crazy (he's not far off!) and says \"it's an orgasm!\". Women have many different kinds. Clitoral, vaginal, uterine, cervical and the always mysterious g-spot. We also have NBN (no battery needed) orgasms from manual or oral and a host of different kinds of vibes which give different sensations. Some of my friends that have also had a total hysterectomy (TAH-BSO) swear that they had uterine orgasms before surgery and after surgery orgasms are a blip and not a tidal wave.",

      "Content": "Sorry Brave, I have to respectfully disagree with you. Neither are pharmacists and I've found that doctors know squat about drugs. If you really want to know about a drug, ask a pharmacist, specifically the pharmacist that made it. The pharmacist that makes our Trimix has \"keep frozen\" on the package. So who really knows more about the drug? A doctor that really only prescribes a drug that goes with a condition or a pharmacist that makes it. In my long list of drugs and medical conditions that I have, my money is on the pharmacist. I have learned so much more about when, how, with what to take drugs from my pharamcist then I ever have from my doctors. Here is a study that was done on Trimix. -About 8% alprostadil loss occurred in five days at room temperature; -Under refrigeration losses of about 6% and 11% occurred after 1 and 2 months, respectively. -Frozen at -20°C and -70°C, less than 5% loss of any of the drug components occurred in 6 months. http://www.ijpc.com/abstracts/abstract.cfm?ABS=1799",

      "Content": "Just found this post on another forum: SUCCESS WITH FROZEN TRIMIX! I am 38 months out from DaVinci RP and have been using Trimix since month 8. I wanted to share with you some factual news regarding frozen Trimix that I can personally attest to. about July 1, 2008 I purchased a new mix from a local specialty pharmacy in the St. Louis area. When I arrived to pick the prescription, the pharmacist made me aware he had reduced the price to $50 for a 10cc bottle because the material was within two week of \u201cexpiration\u201d. In addition, knowing that he most probably would not be able to sell some of the remaining mix by this expiration date he asked if I would be interested in taking another 10cc bottle with the mix frozen. For free? Why not and $50 for 20cc if it all worked out. Having freezer packs with me in a cooler I headed home with a smile. The first bottle lasted me from that date of purchase until the last drop was used on March 31, 2010. Mind you that the dosage gradually had to be increased as time went on with 0.10cc being the max. For 20 months the 10cc bottle did well with solid performance. It was time for the frozen Trimix and I was excited to see what the results were going to be. I started the first injection with 0.06cc. It worked with excellence but a little heavy on the dosage amount. Very firm for over four hours but somewhat pleasant. More annoying then anything else and it faded slowly with no alarm or Sudafed. I have been there before on overdose and I new I was not in that situation so all went OK. After a few more injections I am down to 0.03cc with very firm erections. I will reduce this amount to check on the results but I believe I am on the edge. I think it will be OK but will require more stimulation. I presume I have about 20 months on the 10cc bottle also. All in all, this is probably the best bargain that I will ever come across for Trimix. Moral of the factual story is two fold, don\u2019t let the expiration date fool you and don\u2019t be afraid to use good frozen Trimix!",

      "Content": "Another note on freezing from The Compounder: http://www.thecompounder.com/alterna...-mix-injection Storage and stability. The mixture is not stable for long periods. That is the primary reason that it is not available as a commercial drug product. Our studies indicate that frozen preparations are stable for a year \u0096 maybe more. Once thawed, the stability falls to just a few weeks. If kept under refrigeration, the amounts we dispense are easily used up before they lose potency. It is important to note that improper storage does not result in harmful chemicals in the preparation. The only thing to suffer is the potency \u0096 the preparation may not be as strong as when fresh. It may not elicit the expected results. We are often asked about problems if the preparation is left at room temperature. That\u0092s somewhat complicated because what I consider room temperature may not agree with your definition. At best, expect the potency to last about three days. This is another good reason to ask that your prescription be dispensed in pre-filled syringes. A single dose can be removed from the refrigerator and there isn\u0092t the risk that the remaining doses will inadvertently be left out.",

I know it feels like the worst thing ever to leak during orgasm, regardless if it's a drip or a blast. But honestly? Just enjoy the sensation and go with it. It's not going to hurt anyone so you clean it up and go on. Most women leak urine at some time during sex or orgasm. I have. I think there can even be some urine in semen at times. A friend that had pc surgery 2 years ago said during orgasm, he leaked like a fire hose in the beginning. His wife squirts. So they joke about having shooting contests. Ok, maybe a bit too much out there for most of you, but the point is, don't let it scare you or depress you or make you feel bad. At least you are having orgasms which is the best part! Also, if guys are freaked out about it, than wives may react the same way. So relax and go with the flow. Sorry, for the pun! lol...no I'm not! Guys, it's just pee!",

      "Content": "I prefer to see D.O.'s as they are trained to treat the whole body. They will spend more time talking and instead of focusing on the particular, will look at how the whole body affects disease. D.O. physicians complete conventional residencies in hospitals and training programs, are licensed in all states, and have rights and responsibilities, such as military service, that are identical to M.D. physicians and surgeons. Insurance companies cover DO's. http://www.mayoclinic.org/osteopath/...s/FAQ-20058168 http://piedmont.org/patient-tools/Li...nd-DO-697.aspx",

      "Content": "Our first try with Trimix was a low dose in the docs office of .05. It gave him about a 50% erection. Had fun though. lol He has slowly increased to .12 with not completely great results. Now we are at .15 and IT WORKS GREAT!!! He stays hard for about 2 hours but after orgasm would prefer it to go down as he gets so sensitive. We love it and aside from the lack of spontaneity, I am glad we can use it. I think I have a thread somewhere around here about our first try. I really think we need a sticky with all the Trimix first try stories.",
