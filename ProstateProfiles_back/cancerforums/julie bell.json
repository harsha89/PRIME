      "Content": "Hi there. My Dad (71) also has prostate cancer and is on the hormone injections. I just wanted to let you know that my father has also had the pains in his joints, however we think this is connected to the hormone treatment along with the other side effects including hot flashes, sweats and some weak turns. My Dad is due a scan soon to see if his cancer has spread at all. He is hoping for radiotherapy in the new year. Keep posting your concerns here, I have experienced a lot of support from the other forum members. Julie",

      "Content": "Hi everyone, My father has prostate cancer gleason 8. He was diagnosed a year ago when his PSA rose to 9. He was firstly given hormone tablets, which did not reduce the PSA sufficiently and then he was given 6 months of injections. He was hoping for radiotherapy, but they are worried about this as he still has a weakish urinary stream at times. He may need a repeat of the small operation that widens the neck of the bladder first. He is also due another full body scan to check if the cancer has spread. I realise that radiotherapy can cause more urination problems and I am worried that my dad will now not get this treatment which could add years to his life. Has anyone else had experience of this that they would like to share? Also what happens if the prostate cancer is locallyt advanced? Is radiotherapy still an option? Thank you so much for your support so far! Julie",

      "Content": "Thanks guys. It is helpful to read everyone elses stories and learn from their experiences. To clarify, Dad is waiting for radiotherapy, and has not started it yet. He has been having hormone injections for 6months, to shrink prostate (Prostate tumour possibly) and keep PSA low. My father is a fit 71 year old with no other health problems, he golfs once a week and walks 3miles at a brisk pace almost every day. He has had a weak urine stream for a while, even when prostate was enlarged but non-cancerous. We are concerned that this problem will prevent him from receiving the radiotherapy treatment he has been promised. We live in the UK and are in the NHS system, basically it's a waiting game (I have heard that over 70's are made to wait longer for treatment!!). Thanks for all your support to date Julie",

      "Content": "Thanks again guys, Fairwind, it is correct what you say. I feel that my father's treatment has been held up because he is in the over 70 age range. It is distressing for him to see 2 friends with the same condition jump ahead of him on the waiting list - just because they happen to be 68!! (At least we think that thats the reason - but now he needs this procedure repeated to improve urine flow first), theres always something, and now it is 1.5 years since diagnosis and although psa is low we are starting to worry that the cancer could have spread. Chuck - thanks for all your correspondance - The consultant told dad that at his age with a gleason 8 - it was as successful to give him hormone therapy and radiotherapy and spare him the operation! thanks for all Julie",

      "Content": "Hello again everyone, My Dad has just completed week 5 of radiotherapy for gleason 8 prostate cancer. Before this he was on HT injections for over a year. Psa went down from 9 to 0.02 during this time. Everything was going well until this week. Dad was still walking a couple of miles every day and is always a 'glass half full' type of guy. In the last few days that has changed - he hasn't been able to stop crying and is suddenly very depressed. Not particularly aout having cancer or dying, but visiting dark times in the past and making big issues out of small things. Does anyonbe have any experience of this. Is it normal, he has been more tired this week also. I have told him to tell his doctor about this change of mood. Any advice would be much appreciated - it's awful to see such a positive person crumble like this. Julie x",

      "Content": "Hi everyone, My Father has had prostate cancer for around 4 years. He was diagnosed with a gleason of 8 and a psa of 8. Firstly he was perscribed bicalutanide which did not lower the psa sufficiently so he went on to get the hormone injections (Monthly). This successfully reduced his PSA and about a year and a half ago he had a course of radiotherapy. Since then his PSA has remained at an undetectable level and he continued to have the injections along withTamoxifen and Bicalutanide. Now after 1.5yrs the consultant has stopped the injections and the 2 medications mentioned above. I would like to know, in your experience - is this usual practice? I am terrified that it could be to do with NHS cut backs (Particularly the present situation here in N.Ireland). Any advice will be greatly appreciated Many thanks Julie (Anxious daughter!!) x",

      "Content": "Thanks so much for your kind replies guys. They are advising that he gets his PSA checked every 3 months - we will make sure of this. He is a bit stressed today as has had an xray for pain in his hips and the doctor has asked to see him and has requested blood tests. Hopefully just arthritis (Which I know is very painful). Hopefully it's not cancer - could his prostate cancer have spread when the PSA was so low? (His lymph glands were always clear). Many thanks Julie",

The injections have made him very tired with many weak turns! However he still plays golf and tries to keep fit! Just hoping that this quality of life will not deteriorate too much too soon. Hopefully the radiotherapy will do it's job and hold the cancer back for a while. Thanks again Thinking of you all as you face this difficult journey Julie xo",

He is due to start radiotherapy soon (external beam). I am just wondering what we can expect in terms of side effects. Dad is 71 and pretty fit. He walks 3 miles a day and is hoping to travel for treatment on the train alone. He has recntly had a procedure done to stretch the neck of the bladder, in an effort to reduce urinary problems during treatment. Would anyone mind sharing their experiences of treatment with me. Many thanks for all your support to date. Julie",
