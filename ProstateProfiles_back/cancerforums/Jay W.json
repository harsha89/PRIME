    "Content": "Hi, Folks. I had a radical prostatectomy 16 months ago. Four months after that, my PSA had dropped to <0.1. Five months later, it was up to 0.4. I had proton radiation treatment, and today, 3 months after the end of treatment, I got my first PSA. It's 0.88. I'm getting conflicting info about what this means. Please help. Thanks.",
