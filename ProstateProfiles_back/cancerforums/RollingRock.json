      "Content": "Originally Posted by HighlanderCFH Hi Rolling, Welcome to the forum. Did you have any PSA readings taken prior to 2014? Just curious, but it really does not matter at this point since they have established that you have PC. When you had the latest PSA test of 12.4, was this right after you saw the doctor? Anything that stresses the prostate in the 48-72 hours before taking the blood can put an artificial spike into the PSA number. This includes a digital rectal exam, sex, riding a bike, strenuous exercise, etc. With that said, a Gleason 6 is considered a \"low risk\" form of the disease. The \"best\" type you can have if you are going to get it. I agree with your first urologist that active surveillance is NOT wise in your situation. The general guidelines (not set in stone, of course) are: * no more than 2 positive cores * no more than 50% involvement in either positive core * nothing higher than Gleason 6 * PSA under 10 Basically, the 4 cores would suggest that you need treatment and should NOT do any \"wait and see\" things. I say this because about 20% of 12-core biopsies miss other tumors that are also in the prostate. The thing about this is that any undetected tumor could be of a HIGHER Gleason score, which puts a more serious light on things. With the jump in your PSA, it is \"possible\" that there is another, more aggressive, tumor in there. The odds are with you against this being the case, but those odds are far from zero. Hence, you would want to begin thinking about treatment. Since your prostate apparently is of normal size, and the staging apparently suggests it is still confined to the prostate, radioactive seed therapy (brachy) would probably be a good choice. Probably this, or external beam radiation, or surgery, could cure you if there is nothing more than a Gleason 6. Having the MRI is probably a good idea, especially if it might be a 3T MRI. These sophisticated scans are not perfect, but can suggest whether other tumors might be present. This could have a bearing on the treatment type you ultimately select. Having another PSA test is also a good idea. You might also pick up a copy of the Guide to Surviving Prostate Cancer by Dr. Pat walsh. This will help answer many questions for you. And, of course, we are here to try and help with any of those questions. Good luck! Chuck Thank you, Chuck. In response to your questions: -- Prior to November 2014, I did NOT have any PSA readings. -- The latest PSA reading of 12.4 I got this morning was approximately 33 days after my biopsy. In the previous 72 hours I did not have any physical stress. Mentally, however, just before I got my bloodwork done, I did visit a friend in the hospital who is dying of cancer (lung). It was the first time I saw him in several years, and seeing him in the terrible physical condition he was in shook me up quite a bit, considering my diagnosis with PC. One other Forum Member did comment that the sharply elevated PSA score \"may\" be due from an infection from the biopsy. I assume that when I had the biopsy, the regimen of antibiotics the day before, the day of, and the day after the biopsy is typical. No antibiotics were prescribed beyond that. -- Yes, both urologists as well as my GP have said that my prostate is of a normal size based on their DREs. -- I am beginning to think about treatment, and your points are great. I'm wondering if a second biopsy sometime in the next few months might determine if a more aggressive tumor exists? -- I will say that while reviewing the pathology report with the first urologist, I did feel uncomfortable in the sense that it seemed he was suggesting surgery (as opposed to other options) rather quickly, which pushed me to immediately schedule for a second opinion. Basically, not having any PSA history prior to this past November, and given that the numbers rose quickly from 6.7 to 7.9 to 12.4 in three months, I am wondering if I just got \"lucky\" by happening to have a PSA reading when I did, although to me, those odds seem rather long. Just a ton of info to process in a short time since November, and, as your points and the comments of others suggest, the time to make a decision could be shorter than I thought.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by lancepeace Welcome. Sometimes PSA can jump from inflammation or infection. So the PSA rise might not necessarily be from cancer. Seed radiation, External Beam radiation, surgery all seem reasonable. You did not mention Gleason Score, assume it was a Gleason 6 if Active Surveillance was on the table. You are likely to live for a long time, especially with treatment. There are also new treatments being developed for the future. Good luck to you. Thank you. Yes, my Gleason score was a 3+3=6. I've added that to my stats. Appreciate your advice!",

      "Content": "Hello all, I first joined this forum in early 2015 when I was first diagnosed. I received a lot of good feedback on this forum, but chose Active Surveillance after getting a second opinion from Northwestern Memorial Hospital in Chicago. I have remained physically active, and over the past few years have whitewater rafted the mighty Gauley River in WV twice with my son. He and I also trekked and backpacked in Europe and north Africa for three weeks in 2016, and then did the same for six weeks in Southeast Asia and the Far East in 2017. At no point during any of these activities (or activities back home, or at any point whatsoever), have I felt a single symptom or problem. About a year ago, it came down to numbers (after a two-year leveling-off-and-lowering period, a rapidly rising PSA score occurred), and the results of a second biopsy were more serious. Numbers and results were telling me that I was \"sick\", yet I felt nothing wrong. CURRENT: Robotic-assisted (daVinci) surgery was performed two weeks ago on December 13, 2018, and as you can see from my results/history below, all looks good so far. However, I would like to hear your opinions and experiences regarding regaining continence. My catheter came out six days after surgery, and since then I have been a \"leaking machine\" 98% of the time. My surgeon gave me a sheet of information that said the leakage would be at its worst during the first 2-3 weeks after surgery, which I can deal with. However, in paying close attention, I don't even seem to have the slightest bit of improvement yet. I'm not worried yet, and I realize I could be incontinent for a long time, but I'm hoping some of you can share your \"incontinence time frames\" with me -- especially if you're within my age range (57 +/-). Obviously I have no choice right now but to be patient, which I shall do. In the meantime, it is not lost on me that I'm fortunate to have \"cancer-free\" results as of right now, and for that I breathe a huge sigh of relief -- at least until it's time for the post-op PSA tests, But this is the one area (incontinence) that has me a little unnerved, simply because I am active in a lot of ways. I've more or less confined myself to my home for now because of potentially embarrassing situations. Thank you in advance for anything you want to share -- your timeframes, tips, things or activities that benefited you, etc. ================================================== ====== * Current Age: 57 (b. 1961) -- 5'9\", 170 lbs. * First-ever PSA test in late 2014; result was 6.7 in Nov 2014. * Needle biopsy done Jan 2015. Four of 12 cores showed PCa with a Gleason score of 3+3=6. (Two cores <5%, one core <10%, one core <20%). Physician suggested treatment asap. * Got a second opinion and a review of the slides from another lab (Northwestern Memorial Hospital in Chicago). Active Surveillance was discussed as a viable option and I chose it. * During the remainder of 2015 my PSA climbed to as high as 9.2; however in three PSA tests in 2016 it lowered significantly and remained at the 6.0 area. * In late 2017, the PSA score started rising again -- rapidly this time to 8.6 and then to 11.7. * Returned to urological clinic but wanted to see a different urologist than in 2015. * 3T MRI-guided biopsy with ultrasound resulted in a Gleason score of 4+4=8. Bone scan was negative. Treatment was needed. * Went for a second opinion; this time a highly-recommended urologist in Evanston, IL, agreed with the results and recommendations. He also advised surgery over radiation for a variety of reasons, and also recommended that I begin taking Cialis immediately (not Viagra or Levitra) and continue to take it indefinitely after surgery. * My final PSA score before surgery was 14.0. All pre-op blood work/lab work/urinalysis was very normal with the exception of a slightly elevated blood-sugar level. * Underwent DaVinci surgery on December 13, 2018. Final pathology report downgraded the Gleason score to 3+4=7 (Grade Group 2). The tumor volume covered 30% of the prostate. It involved both lobes but the tumor was confined within the prostate. Seminal vesicles had \"no evidence of malignancy\". Samples of 15 lymph nodes and surrounding tissue came back as \"no evidence of malignancy\". All margins came back clear and free of tumor. Additionally, there was no sign of cancer on either of my two nerve bundles, so nerve-sparing surgery was performed. * First post-op physician meeting and PSA test scheduled for 1/30/19 [Canceled due to Polar Vortex.

      "Content": "I'm feeling somewhat overwhelmed not only by the choices of treatments, but also whether to get treated or not. How did you process all the information? I feel like I bounce back and forth after reading something new, i.e. \"Bracytherapy is best for me\"; \"No, active surveillance is best for me\"; etc. Spent many hours last night reading through this forum as well as excerpts and reviews from a couple of books mentioned in here (\"The Great Prostate Hoax: How Big Medicine Hijacked the PSA Test and Caused a Public Health Disaster\", \"Invasion of the Prostate Snatchers: An Essential Guide to Managing Prostate Cancer\"). Not sure how much credence to give these books, but I think it's pretty well accepted that the healthcare industry, like any other, is driven by money. Some of the facts(?) they mention are staggering. The one that struck me most is that only 1 out of every 50 men who are diagnosed and get treatment are \"saved\" from death within ten years, while the other 49 lived anyway, without treatment. A review in the NY Post summarized this: \"If you had a PSA test in 2009, and it led to a biopsy, a cancer diagnosis and treatment for that cancer, there is, according to Dr. Peter Bach, a health-care policy specialist at Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, a 1 in 50 chance that by 2019 or later, you will have been saved from dying of prostate cancer. But there is a 49 in 50 chance that you will have been treated unnecessarily.\" (NY Post, March 1, 2014) Of course, I realize these authors and their publishers are in the for-profit business also. Controversy and alternative viewpoints sell books. I'm not a conspiracy theorist, but after exhaustive reading it seems easy to see how an industry built upon the fear of the word \"cancer\", the potential misuse of PSA testing, and the profits involved in surgery and other treatments could lead to temptation and greed. Equally, if the facts presented are correct (i.e. 50% of men over 50 have some degree of prostate cancer anyway; the size of a man's prostate dictates how much PSA it puts out; the setting of the PSA number to schedule a biopsy (4.0>) was arbitrary; there is no \"normal\" PSA score; most prostate cancer in healthy men is harmless but treatment is encouraged anyway; etc.), well, this makes me feel more overwhelmed about how to proceed. My questions are: -- How did you guys process all the information prior to making a decision? -- Before treatment, did you ever doubt your decision to even get treated? -- After treatment, did you ever regret your decision to get treated? -- For those who have been treated and who are suffering with the side effects of impotency, incontinence, fatigue, anal leakage, etc., if you had to make your treatment decision over again, would you choose the same option? Would you choose not to get treated at all? Thank you.

      "Content": "Originally Posted by lancepeace Welcome. Sometimes PSA can jump from inflammation or infection. So the PSA rise might not necessarily be from cancer. Seed radiation, External Beam radiation, surgery all seem reasonable. You did not mention Gleason Score, assume it was a Gleason 6 if Active Surveillance was on the table. You are likely to live for a long time, especially with treatment. There are also new treatments being developed for the future. Good luck to you. Thank you. Yes, my Gleason score was a 3+3=6. I've added that to my stats. Appreciate your advice!",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by HighlanderCFH Hi Rolling, Welcome to the forum. Did you have any PSA readings taken prior to 2014? Just curious, but it really does not matter at this point since they have established that you have PC. When you had the latest PSA test of 12.4, was this right after you saw the doctor? Anything that stresses the prostate in the 48-72 hours before taking the blood can put an artificial spike into the PSA number. This includes a digital rectal exam, sex, riding a bike, strenuous exercise, etc. With that said, a Gleason 6 is considered a \"low risk\" form of the disease. The \"best\" type you can have if you are going to get it. I agree with your first urologist that active surveillance is NOT wise in your situation. The general guidelines (not set in stone, of course) are: * no more than 2 positive cores * no more than 50% involvement in either positive core * nothing higher than Gleason 6 * PSA under 10 Basically, the 4 cores would suggest that you need treatment and should NOT do any \"wait and see\" things. I say this because about 20% of 12-core biopsies miss other tumors that are also in the prostate. The thing about this is that any undetected tumor could be of a HIGHER Gleason score, which puts a more serious light on things. With the jump in your PSA, it is \"possible\" that there is another, more aggressive, tumor in there. The odds are with you against this being the case, but those odds are far from zero. Hence, you would want to begin thinking about treatment. Since your prostate apparently is of normal size, and the staging apparently suggests it is still confined to the prostate, radioactive seed therapy (brachy) would probably be a good choice. Probably this, or external beam radiation, or surgery, could cure you if there is nothing more than a Gleason 6. Having the MRI is probably a good idea, especially if it might be a 3T MRI. These sophisticated scans are not perfect, but can suggest whether other tumors might be present. This could have a bearing on the treatment type you ultimately select. Having another PSA test is also a good idea. You might also pick up a copy of the Guide to Surviving Prostate Cancer by Dr. Pat walsh. This will help answer many questions for you. And, of course, we are here to try and help with any of those questions. Good luck! Chuck Thank you, Chuck. In response to your questions: -- Prior to November 2014, I did NOT have any PSA readings. -- The latest PSA reading of 12.4 I got this morning was approximately 33 days after my biopsy. In the previous 72 hours I did not have any physical stress. Mentally, however, just before I got my bloodwork done, I did visit a friend in the hospital who is dying of cancer (lung). It was the first time I saw him in several years, and seeing him in the terrible physical condition he was in shook me up quite a bit, considering my diagnosis with PC. One other Forum Member did comment that the sharply elevated PSA score \"may\" be due from an infection from the biopsy. I assume that when I had the biopsy, the regimen of antibiotics the day before, the day of, and the day after the biopsy is typical. No antibiotics were prescribed beyond that. -- Yes, both urologists as well as my GP have said that my prostate is of a normal size based on their DREs. -- I am beginning to think about treatment, and your points are great. I'm wondering if a second biopsy sometime in the next few months might determine if a more aggressive tumor exists? -- I will say that while reviewing the pathology report with the first urologist, I did feel uncomfortable in the sense that it seemed he was suggesting surgery (as opposed to other options) rather quickly, which pushed me to immediately schedule for a second opinion. Basically, not having any PSA history prior to this past November, and given that the numbers rose quickly from 6.7 to 7.9 to 12.4 in three months, I am wondering if I just got \"lucky\" by happening to have a PSA reading when I did, although to me, those odds seem rather long. Just a ton of info to process in a short time since November, and, as your points and the comments of others suggest, the time to make a decision could be shorter than I thought.",

      "Content": "Hello all, I first joined this forum in early 2015 when I was first diagnosed. I received a lot of good feedback on this forum, but chose Active Surveillance after getting a second opinion from Northwestern Memorial Hospital in Chicago. I have remained physically active, and over the past few years have whitewater rafted the mighty Gauley River in WV twice with my son. He and I also trekked and backpacked in Europe and north Africa for three weeks in 2016, and then did the same for six weeks in Southeast Asia and the Far East in 2017. At no point during any of these activities (or activities back home, or at any point whatsoever), have I felt a single symptom or problem. About a year ago, it came down to numbers (after a two-year leveling-off-and-lowering period, a rapidly rising PSA score occurred), and the results of a second biopsy were more serious. Numbers and results were telling me that I was \"sick\", yet I felt nothing wrong. CURRENT: Robotic-assisted (daVinci) surgery was performed two weeks ago on December 13, 2018, and as you can see from my results/history below, all looks good so far. However, I would like to hear your opinions and experiences regarding regaining continence. My catheter came out six days after surgery, and since then I have been a \"leaking machine\" 98% of the time. My surgeon gave me a sheet of information that said the leakage would be at its worst during the first 2-3 weeks after surgery, which I can deal with. However, in paying close attention, I don't even seem to have the slightest bit of improvement yet. I'm not worried yet, and I realize I could be incontinent for a long time, but I'm hoping some of you can share your \"incontinence time frames\" with me -- especially if you're within my age range (57 +/-). Obviously I have no choice right now but to be patient, which I shall do. In the meantime, it is not lost on me that I'm fortunate to have \"cancer-free\" results as of right now, and for that I breathe a huge sigh of relief -- at least until it's time for the post-op PSA tests, But this is the one area (incontinence) that has me a little unnerved, simply because I am active in a lot of ways. I've more or less confined myself to my home for now because of potentially embarrassing situations. Thank you in advance for anything you want to share -- your timeframes, tips, things or activities that benefited you, etc. ================================================== ====== * Current Age: 57 (b. 1961) -- 5'9\", 170 lbs. * First-ever PSA test in late 2014; result was 6.7 in Nov 2014. * Needle biopsy done Jan 2015. Four of 12 cores showed PCa with a Gleason score of 3+3=6. (Two cores <5%, one core <10%, one core <20%). Physician suggested treatment asap. * Got a second opinion and a review of the slides from another lab (Northwestern Memorial Hospital in Chicago). Active Surveillance was discussed as a viable option and I chose it. * During the remainder of 2015 my PSA climbed to as high as 9.2; however in three PSA tests in 2016 it lowered significantly and remained at the 6.0 area. * In late 2017, the PSA score started rising again -- rapidly this time to 8.6 and then to 11.7. * Returned to urological clinic but wanted to see a different urologist than in 2015. * 3T MRI-guided biopsy with ultrasound resulted in a Gleason score of 4+4=8. Bone scan was negative. Treatment was needed. * Went for a second opinion; this time a highly-recommended urologist in Evanston, IL, agreed with the results and recommendations. He also advised surgery over radiation for a variety of reasons, and also recommended that I begin taking Cialis immediately (not Viagra or Levitra) and continue to take it indefinitely after surgery. * My final PSA score before surgery was 14.0. All pre-op blood work/lab work/urinalysis was very normal with the exception of a slightly elevated blood-sugar level. * Underwent DaVinci surgery on December 13, 2018. Final pathology report downgraded the Gleason score to 3+4=7 (Grade Group 2). The tumor volume covered 30% of the prostate. It involved both lobes but the tumor was confined within the prostate.

      "Content": "Hello all, I first joined this forum in early 2015 when I was first diagnosed. I received a lot of good feedback on this forum, but chose Active Surveillance after getting a second opinion from Northwestern Memorial Hospital in Chicago. I have remained physically active, and over the past few years have whitewater rafted the mighty Gauley River in WV twice with my son. He and I also trekked and backpacked in Europe and north Africa for three weeks in 2016, and then did the same for six weeks in Southeast Asia and the Far East in 2017. At no point during any of these activities (or activities back home, or at any point whatsoever), have I felt a single symptom or problem. About a year ago, it came down to numbers (after a two-year leveling-off-and-lowering period, a rapidly rising PSA score occurred), and the results of a second biopsy were more serious. Numbers and results were telling me that I was \"sick\", yet I felt nothing wrong. CURRENT: Robotic-assisted (daVinci) surgery was performed two weeks ago on December 13, 2018, and as you can see from my results/history below, all looks good so far. However, I would like to hear your opinions and experiences regarding regaining continence. My catheter came out six days after surgery, and since then I have been a \"leaking machine\" 98% of the time. My surgeon gave me a sheet of information that said the leakage would be at its worst during the first 2-3 weeks after surgery, which I can deal with. However, in paying close attention, I don't even seem to have the slightest bit of improvement yet. I'm not worried yet, and I realize I could be incontinent for a long time, but I'm hoping some of you can share your \"incontinence time frames\" with me -- especially if you're within my age range (57 +/-). Obviously I have no choice right now but to be patient, which I shall do. In the meantime, it is not lost on me that I'm fortunate to have \"cancer-free\" results as of right now, and for that I breathe a huge sigh of relief -- at least until it's time for the post-op PSA tests, But this is the one area (incontinence) that has me a little unnerved, simply because I am active in a lot of ways. I've more or less confined myself to my home for now because of potentially embarrassing situations. Thank you in advance for anything you want to share -- your timeframes, tips, things or activities that benefited you, etc. ================================================== ====== * Current Age: 57 (b. 1961) -- 5'9\", 170 lbs. * First-ever PSA test in late 2014; result was 6.7 in Nov 2014. * Needle biopsy done Jan 2015. Four of 12 cores showed PCa with a Gleason score of 3+3=6. (Two cores <5%, one core <10%, one core <20%). Physician suggested treatment asap. * Got a second opinion and a review of the slides from another lab (Northwestern Memorial Hospital in Chicago). Active Surveillance was discussed as a viable option and I chose it. * During the remainder of 2015 my PSA climbed to as high as 9.2; however in three PSA tests in 2016 it lowered significantly and remained at the 6.0 area. * In late 2017, the PSA score started rising again -- rapidly this time to 8.6 and then to 11.7. * Returned to urological clinic but wanted to see a different urologist than in 2015. * 3T MRI-guided biopsy with ultrasound resulted in a Gleason score of 4+4=8. Bone scan was negative. Treatment was needed. * Went for a second opinion; this time a highly-recommended urologist in Evanston, IL, agreed with the results and recommendations. He also advised surgery over radiation for a variety of reasons, and also recommended that I begin taking Cialis immediately (not Viagra or Levitra) and continue to take it indefinitely after surgery. * My final PSA score before surgery was 14.0. All pre-op blood work/lab work/urinalysis was very normal with the exception of a slightly elevated blood-sugar level. * Underwent DaVinci surgery on December 13, 2018. Final pathology report downgraded the Gleason score to 3+4=7 (Grade Group 2). The tumor volume covered 30% of the prostate. It involved both lobes but the tumor was confined within the prostate. Seminal vesicles had \"no evidence of malignancy\". Samples of 15 lymph nodes and surrounding tissue came back as \"no evidence of malignancy\". All margins came back clear and free of tumor. Additionally, there was no sign of cancer on either of my two nerve bundles, so nerve-sparing surgery was performed. * First post-op physician meeting and PSA test scheduled for 1/30/19 [Canceled due to Polar Vortex. Candyasses ] * Surgeon started me on 50MG of Imipramine per day (in addition to the Oxybutynin CL 10MG I've been taking since the surgery) * First post-op PSA result week of January 28 -- <.008 ng/ml",
