There are three I know of but they all have exceeded their resources. There is a site needymeds.com or .org that has a list of some of the funds. Don't give up on these funds sometimes they open - and can close quickly.",

      "Content": "I waited after initial treatment to start hormone therapy. Every decision from now on will be difficult. I restarted hormone therapy at PSA 19. We were waiting for PSA to go to 10. This is a good example of how fast the cancer can grow. I suspected this jump was a bone met. It was. Switched to Dana Farber and went into multi agent treatment protocol. Lupron, Taxotere, Avastin. Six cycles. PSA 0.03. But it didn't stay low for too long. So, my opinion is fight hard but this is long battle, save as much ammunition as possible. With 4 New treatments in the market in 4 years. Comtreq a year or so away. New technologies are making progress, combo therapies, 2nd generation immunology. You'll be on this board a long time. GL",

More pain than I had experienced. Last two weeks I feel good. Regaining strength, sleeping is still erratic but will stabilize once I find the right dose of pain killers. My opiate intake has decreased by 50% in last two weeks. My main comment on X is Don't panic if PSA is not much lower or the same. X did not show great effect in the P3 trial. GL",
