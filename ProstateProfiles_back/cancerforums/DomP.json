      "Content": "Hi, new to all of this 40 year old male here, been using propecia for hairless for about 12 years. No side effects other than a I have kept my hair... When I was 38 previous Dr. did a full blood work up as part of a physical said I couldn't be in better health no issues... Well he just retired, new Dr did the routine bloodworm a few weeks ago, told me everything looked great PSA good but never gave me a #... Today I picked up my medical records from the old Dr's office and noticed 2 years ago when they did my prostate bloodworm my PSA .70 My Free PSA was 16 and my free PSA percent was 23%... So I get they were all normal, yet if I double my PSA as suggested for being on Propecia its more like 1.40. Is that a # that causes alarm at 38 years of age or is it still in the normal range and I should not worry. Have an appointment today to hope new Dr will give me the actual #s other than it looks good...",
