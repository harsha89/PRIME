      "Content": "Thanks for replying ,Chuck. I was diagnosed as Stage 2B . I asked the urologist if it ia possible the PC has spread to the lymph nodes and would a CT scan pick that up and he said no. Should I request a CT scan anyway and would it pick up anything in the tissues or seminal vessels? I am being a sponge right now absorbing info .Look forward to your reply Regards, Ron",
