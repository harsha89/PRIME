    "Content": "PSA of 5.9, Free of 0.6, Free % of Total 10.17%=Pretty Good Chance of Prostate Cancer Or at least that\u0092s what I\u0092m reading online. I have no symptoms. Doctor took the test a couple of weeks ago. Says I should wait 2 weeks and get retested. No ejaculation for 48 prior. My PSA levels have always been in the 4.1, 4.2 range. From what I\u0092m reading online, the fact that my free percentage is 10.17% range puts me around the 55% to 60% that I have prostate cancer. I am 52 years old.",
