      "Content": "Gleason 7 (dr. said on the more aggressive end). Cancer found in various places but not anywhere other than the prostate. I'm 62, run 15-30 miles a week (run two marathons a year), and lift weights - very healthy. I have no other conditions. One doctor says I should get Robotic Surgery. The other says I should do hormones, radiation and seeds (all three). Thoughts? Don't know how to decide.",
