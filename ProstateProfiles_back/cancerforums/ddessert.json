      "Content": "Although I was disheartened by the incremental progress immunotherapy seems to offer prostate cancer as of yet, there was an interesting (to me, at least) option of a double-blind clinical trial in California and Johns Hopkins for prostate cancer patients undergoing active surveillance [Gleason <= (3+4), Stage <T2a]. All patients continue active surveillance, while 1/2 patients receive PROSTVAC & 1/2 patients get a placebo. The webinar presenters did not claim that PROSTVAC cures anyone, but the data seems indicate it can delay the progression. By engaging patients earlier (lower tumor burden), they'd like to see if the progression can be delayed even longer or halted altogether. If you're already committed to active surveillance, this might be an option to advance the science and possibly help yourself at the same time. Clinical Trials Link: https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT02326805 The clinical trials website says they are not yet enrolling, but the presenters today indicated that it has started.",

      "Content": "I got my MRI result for pancreatic cancer recurrence and everything is all clear there. However, there was this impression from the radiologist for the MRI of my abdomen: Heterogeneous low signal in the peripheral zone of the prostate unchanged since the prior examination (May 2014). Correlate with PSA and if elevated consider dedicated prostate MRI. Another relevant piece of information is my BRCA2 mutation that increases my lifetime risk of prostate cancer and often the more aggressive kind. Also, I have an uncle with the same mutation and prior prostate cancer. The doctors did not mention this result to me during the after-scan meeting (probably concentrating on non-recurrence of PanCan?). I only noticed it myself when getting the radiologist report. So my next step would seem to be to get a PSA test. Should I just ask my primary care physician for that test? Should I be more aggressive in checking this out by getting an appointment with a specialist?",

I'll also note that the MRI scans are reviewed by two different radiologists, primarily looking for recurrence or metastases of pancreatic cancer. The MD Anderson radiologist has never noted anything about the prostate. The Johns Hopkins radiologist has pointed out the \"heterogeneous signal\" in May and Nov. I know this is sequence is not normal (MRI first, then PSA), and I'm wondering how much weight to place on the two conflicting findings? I could schedule the appointment with a urologist anyways, but would I just be wasting their time?",

      "Content": "I came from a hereditary cancer conference this weekend and there was a presentation (link) from Dr. Bruce Montgomery at Fred Hutchinson in Seattle. Dr. Montgomery talked specifically about how BRCA2 mutation carriers are 2.5-4X more likely to have prostate cancer and that is also more likely to be aggressive (8X more likely to die) so waiting and watching is not appropriate. However, these BRCA2 prostate tumors are also quite sensitive to platinum chemotherapies (Carboplatin, Cisplatin, Oxaliplatin) and PARP inhibitors that could substantially improve outcomes. As these are not standard prostate cancer treatments, you would only get these if you are tested and found to have BRCA2 mutation. ~12% of men with prostate cancer have inherited a BRCA2/ATM/other mutation. These can be found through germline genetic testing using blood or saliva (don't use 23&Me for this). Most urologists are unaware of the BRCA2/prostate cancer link. You may need to bring the studies cited in the linked presentation and force your urologist to read through this to get these treatments. BRCA2/ATM/other mutations are found in 25-30% of prostate tumors (about 1/2 these were inherited). These mutations are found by genetic testing of the tumor itself (somatic testing). Sometimes the tumors develop these types of mutations on their own and are their Achilles heel is platinum and/or PARPi. Platinum chemotherapy and PARP inhibitors for prostate cancer are only available off-label in a study. This is another reason you'll need an oncologist that is aware of this research. Response rates to platinum/PARP inhibitors in these men is 80-90%. The current NCCN guidelines state that all metastatic prostate cancer patients should be tested for BRCA2 mutations. For any man with metastatic prostate cancer, the University of Washington and Fred Hutchinson are offering free germline genetic testing though their GENTLEMAN study. They will send you a kit to collect your spit and you'll have the results back in 4-6 weeks. You'll find out if you have a mutation that may point to more effective treatment options. The kit is also offered direct to consumers through Color Genomics, but the study is picking up the cost in exchange for getting better population risk data for metastatic patients. If you don't want this study to have your information, you could just order the same test yourself. Dr. Montgomery argues that BRCA2 mutation carriers without tumors should be much more aggressive in PSA level triggers for action (because it is usually more aggressive). If you already know that you've inherited a BRCA2 mutation, his age-specific PSA (ng/mL) Thresholds for action are: Action <45 45-49 50-59 60-69 Biopsy and/or MRI 0.45 - 1.0 0.60 - 1.5 0.80 - 2.0 1.25 - 2.5 Dr. Montgomery is aware that his recommendations here are more aggressive than anyone is used to seeing. Keep in mind this only applies to the ~12% of men who inherited a BRCA2 mutation. But these treatments have been shown to be very effective (in many types of cancers) in BRCA2 tumors and that actions like this will help a lot of men. His clinic is full of men (he is not accepting any new patients) with advanced prostate cancer who did not have this information. Good Luck to All David",
