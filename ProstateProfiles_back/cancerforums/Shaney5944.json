    "Content": "Scared to death! I've had symptoms of burning with urination, increased frequency only in daytime and never get up at night. Some testicular pain. This has occurred 3 x in 5 years and this time had strep throat for first time 3 months ago as it went away my urinary symptoms started. Saw urologist who first diagnosed me with urethritis and tried rapaflo w no success after 1 mo of Uribel I'm 95% symptom free only prop is I'm 41 and first psa came back as 2.1. My uro did another and said if it's above one he wants to biopsy. I'm scared to death. Any feed back would settle my nerves I think. Thanks in advance DRE. NORMAL SHANEY5944",
