      "Content": "I am new to the forum and have a question. I am 46 years old and had a grandfather die of prostate cancer. I just recently went to a urologist and had a work up done on me. My PSA went from a 1.5 to 3.5 in just a couple of visits and my free PSA level was 11. They did a prostate biopsy and I got the results back today. They want to repeat the biopsy in 6 weeks because 4 out of the 12 samples came back atypical. What does that mean and what should I expect?",

      "Content": "Most of you know my situation and since I have been diagnosed with low grade PC I have decided to seek a second opinion. I have an appointment 7-1-15 with a urologist with the Winship Cancer Group at St Joseph in Atlanta. I have had all my records and results sent to them to look over. I hope to go the AS route at this time. Since this is all new to me what can I expect on my first visit? Will they just take the other doctor's word and results for it or will they do their own examinations and battery of tests? Thanks ya'll have been so helpful!!",

      "Content": "Some of you have read my previous posts and saw my situation. I am researching all my options and am leaning heavy toward HDR Brachytherapy. I have an appointment with Dr Peter Rossi at Emory next Thursday 03-17-16 to discuss it. For those of you that have had HDR Brachy and or have heavily researched it I have a question. I know this is a pretty straight forward question but here goes. Can you still ejaculate after HDR therapy? I know with surgery there is still orgasm's but they are dry. I have heard there is still a possibility that you still can after HDR. Is this true? I know that to some this is a vain reason but that is one thing that has me leaning toward HDR since it and surgery have close to equal cure rates. That may not mean much to some but at 49 without that I feel like I am being put out to pasture.",

      "Content": "After my third prostate biopsy in 2 years I was finally found to have PCA and was told 2 days ago 06-18-15. My cancer was a 6 on gleason score and still contained within the prostate. I had only one core come back positive. I am only 48 and they did not recommend me use the \"wait and see\" approach but rather gave me the option of surgery, or seed implantation. I am going back in 3 weeks to give them my decision and I am right now leaning toward the seeds. PLEASE advise me if I am taking the wrong route or making a bad decision. My main concern is if cancer comes back later in life what are my options then. I have heard that surgery is no longer an option and cannot be done after seed therapy. Is this true???",
