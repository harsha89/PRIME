    "Content": "For those of you who have been diagnosed with prostate cancer and are in the decision making process I highly suggest the book Surviving Cancer with Proton Therapy-Road to Nami Island... This book serves as a guide for those who are researching prostate treatment options and other localized cancers. The book is based on actual cases and provides many research sources for cancer treatment and the decision to use proton beam therapy treatments. Link removed as per forum policy. Please read the rules and comply. Pm this poster if interested but google should find it.",
