    "Content": "Guys: Looking for some input on what went wrong with my surgery. I was diagnosed with prostate cancer in early 2015, T2c, Gleason 3+4. I was 52 years old, exceptional shape, biking over 7000 miles a year and no other known health issues. I had a robotic prostatectomy in July of 2015 with an extremely skilled surgeon outside of New York City. I was supposed to be the ideal candidate. Nerve sparing surgery with all nerve bundles saved. Everything was confined to the capsule, and subsequent PSA testing is 0.1 each time. Doctor says I am in the clear. Here is the problem. Since the surgery, I am completely impotent. Nothing, no nocturnal movement, not even a whisper. I tried all of the drugs, with no movement in the slightest. I am also incontinent, leaking about 3 to 5 ounces, by weight of urine every 24 hours. I did 6 months of PT with an excellent therapist, which helped with the leaking marginally. Interestingly, I do not leak at night, only during the day and with certain activities. The only way I can have sex is using a product called Erektor, combined with a vacuum pump. Results are just passable, nothing more. i am seeing my urologist next week for a cystoscopy, urodynamics and a nerve conduction study. My question is first, what went wrong, and at this point what can I do to fix it? Is there any additional testing that should be done at this point? I love my uro and my surgeon, and both are stumped. All suggestions are appreciated.",
