    "Content": "I am 64 this month. My PSA was always normal until 2015 when it registered 8 from a 4. I get an annual physical every year. I took antibiotic and it jumped to 12. Did the biopsy and found Gleason 6 and was put on active servalience. PSA then went back down to 8. Physical in 11/2017 showed PSA at 17. Did MRI and biopsy and then rated Gleason 7 3+4. Doctor is recommending treatment of surgery or radiation High Dose Rate Prostate Brachytherapy Treatment (which requires no hormones). I have also researched a new procedure by Dr. Sperling which treatment is done by laser. (which looks very promising). My local friends that I have talked with were Gleason 8 or higher and with PSA of 43 or better. Plus some had treatments over 10 years ago which are not very relevant to my situation. I am interested in hearing from others who have had more recent treatments.",
