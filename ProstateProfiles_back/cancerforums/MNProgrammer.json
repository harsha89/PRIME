      "Content": "Originally Posted by DjinTonic Excellent, TM! Your primary treatment is over with a great first PSA. Given your EPE+ and SVI+ path report, you may want to ask your doc about following your PSA with a 2- or 3- decimal uPSA test. Are you on a 3-month test schedule? Djin Yes, three month schedule. Thanks for the suggestion. I will mention the more sensitive test before my next appointment. I am just going to put it out of my mind for a couple of months. TM",
