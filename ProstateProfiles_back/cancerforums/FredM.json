      "Content": "First, some quick background on my situation: I'm 43, had an abnormal DRE with a nodule, a low PSA (0.4), and a normal size prostate. Urologist wanted to do a biopsy but I was concerned about side effects. I felt that with a low PSA, cancer was unlikely, but I did read that certain high grade cancers can have a very low PSA. I have another post where I describe this in detail. There was a lot of disagreement in the replies to that post about whether I should get a biopsy or an MRI, so I'd like to share my experience. I asked my urologist about alternatives to biopsy and he offered a 3T MRI. He said things are \"trending this way\". He said that these MRIs are not perfect, they could miss a cancer, but that they are especially good at detecting high grade cancer. He felt confident that if there was a high grade cancer, we would know with near certainty from the MRI. He also said that biopsies aren't perfect either. They are better at determining if something is cancer, but they can only make that determination on the sample they take, which is a small portion of the prostate. I did not do a biopsy. Instead, I ended up getting a multi parametric 3T MRI with and without contrast. Here is the exact description of the MRI from the Radiologist's report: Technical Information: Examination was performed on a 3.0 Tesla magnet. High resolution T1 axial, T2 axial, T2 FSE sagittal, and T2 FSE coronal images were obtained through the prostate gland and seminal vesicles. Diffusion images were obtained in the axial plane. 15ml Omniscan was injected with dynamic enhanced images of the prostate gland in the axial plane. T1 fat saturation sagittal and coronal images were obtained post injection. Images were analyzed using a separate DynaCAD workstation. I received a CD with all of the MRI images. In total there were at least a dozen different series of images, each with many slices. I also got a copy of the detailed report front he radiologist. Before I get to the results of the MRI, here is how these MRIs are scored. Each lesion found by the radiologist is scored on a scale of 1-5 based on a complicated synthesis of all information from the different image series. The scoring is as follows: 1 = clinically significant disease is highly unlikely to be present 2 = clinically significant cancer is unlikely to be present 3 = clinically significant cancer is equivocal 4 = clinically significant cancer is likely to be present 5 = clinically significant cancer is highly likely to be present Summary of results from radiologist: 1. Prostate volume is 20.88 mL, with no significant prostate hemorrhage 2. Where my urologist felt the nodule on the original DRE, the radiologist noted a \"mild contour bulge\". The report goes into a lot of technical information on this. It did not have any of the characteristics of cancer, so he didn't even score it. 3. He found a lesion in the anterior transitional zone of the prostate. My understanding is that this is an area that cannot be reached from the DRE. He ended up scoring this as a 3 (equivocal), and suggested further evaluation of this area. 4. He also noted a lot of other areas of my pelvic anatomy that are normal and a couple that were abnormal but not a big deal (e.g., diverticulosis without diverticulitis) Based on the MRI, my urologist was comfortable that the original nodule he felt on the DRE was probably nothing to worry about. He was somewhat concerned about the lesion in the anterior transitional zone (#3 above). He was comfortable with not doing a biopsy on it and just monitoring PSA in another 3-6 months. He did say that if my anxiety level was high, a biopsy would not by inappropriate. I decided to wait. I'm glad I chose the MRI rather than the biopsy for the following reasons: 1. The MRI gives me comfort that the original nodule is probably ok. The biopsy probably would have told me the same information. 2. The MRI found the lesion in the anterior transitional zone, which likely would have been missed by the biopsy because it would have been targeted mostly toward the original nodule from the DRE. 3. Since I now know about the anterior transitional zone lesion, my urologist will know where to target a future biopsy if my PSA starts to rise. 4. There were no lesions in the MRI scored as a 4 or 5. Based on this my urologist feels very comfortable that I do not have a high grade cancer. Recall that with my low PSA, this was my initial concern. 5. The MRI was relatively quick and painless with no side effects. 6. The biopsy was going to cost over $3000, when the cost of the pathology is included. I think the MRI imaging, along with the radiologist will end up being less. I have not verified this yet, though. The downside of the MRI is that there is no certainty. It can't look at actual cells and determine if they are cancer. On the other hand, from everything I've read about biopsies, there is really no certainty there either. With a biopsy there might be certainty about the tissue you look at, but there is another kind of uncertainty because you are not looking at all of the tissue. In my case, with a low PSA, I think it makes sense to do an MRI first and I'm glad that's what I did.",

And I agree that there is a risk that an MRI can miss a cancer. But biopsies can miss cancers too. They both provide information, and in both cases the information is imperfect.

I made the decision to do the initial MRI in consultation with my urologist. My urologist said that 3T MRIs are especially good at finding \"high grade cancers which are the ones that matter\" (his words).
