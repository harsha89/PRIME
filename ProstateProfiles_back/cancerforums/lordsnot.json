      "Content": "Forgive me if there are threads covering all this but I am 44 and a bit freaked out. I just had my first PSA test back and the PSA was 3.5 and the percent free was 9%. Dr said this is very concerning but doesn't want to do biopsy yet, rather repeat test in 4 months. 4 months seems like forever right now. Question - what would you do? (second opinion, etc?) Would you tell your wife? I am already miserably ill from a variety of maladies - Chron's disease, ulcerative colitis, irritable bowel syndrome, Hiatal Hernia, Barretts Esophagus, Severe Sleep apnea, been a smoker most of my life.

      "Content": "I have had a steady rise in PSA over the years from 3 to 6.6 Additionally I have experienced gradually worsening ED to the point of impotence. I learned about 15 months ago I had extremely low T, I wanted to go on TRT but my Uro did a biopsy first which was negative. The TRT helped for like a month. Then limpy returned. Increased amount of T, helped a bit. Nocturnal issues returned, went on Cialis which helped a bit with both nocturnal and ED. Several weeks ago I went through a dreadful couple of weeks where I was suffering from tenesmus combine with persistent urge to pee as well. I assumed it was a UC flare (I have Ulcerative Colitis), I started smoking cigarettes again and the symptoms went away in two days. Less than a week after the symptoms subsided I had a blood draw. PSA was 14.4!!! I am scared $hitless and my follow up with my Dr isnt for another two weeks (he's away for vacation). Could I have prostatitis?",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by Pratoman You don\u0092t say when your last PSA, the 6.6 result was. If it was in the last year or 18m9nths, it\u0092s possible, even probable that it\u0092s prostatitis. Or BPH or both. PSA is not a test for cancer, it\u0092s a test that tells you if there is something going on with the prostate. Typically, from my experience at least, but also from what I\u0092ve read here and elsewhere, PC will cause a slow but steady rising trend in PSA over time, a spike like this is often in fact, Prostatitis. Thank you for your response. The 6.6 was in May",
