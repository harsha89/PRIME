      "Content": "My post RALP PSA was <0.1 on two consecutive tests. I have since undergone 37 days of RT ending on 7/20/2018. Next PSA test is 9/7/2018. I see a lot of posts with PSA's of e.g. 0.06, etc. Does my <0.1 PSA mean its still detectable but not rising? Can PSA hover and then rise?",

When I had my catheter removed, I had the worse burning I ever felt when I emptied my bladder. I hope that doesn't happen to you. Now I have almost total control, I can live with the occasional leak. We'll seen how that is after my radiation starts. Best of luck, Chris",

      "Content": "Hi guys, I had RP in Feb. 2018 and just completed EBRT (37 days worth). Pre-surgery, My Gleason was 9, my PSA was 8.7. Post surgery I had PSA 0.1, pathology said positive perinueral invasion, positive seminal vesticle involvement and multiple positive margins. No lymph node involvement, Stage T3b. I talked to other RP guys who were also doing RT with me and one had a recurrence after 5 years, another after 10 years. My research indicates I have a 70+% chance of BCR (bio-chemical recurrence). I'm trying to remain positive, but I can't help but worry about my next PSA test in Sept. 2018. Any advise would be helpful.",
