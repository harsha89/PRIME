      "Content": "Age 57 Routine Checkup. 3/6 PSA 4.95 Recheck 3/11 PSA 3.69 Referred to Urologist. Recommend Biopsy. Due to reading and family history. (father he was 94 at time, pasted 3/31 unrelated to his prostate cancer.) Instructions: 4/8 Ciprofloxacin take two, day prior, two day of and two day after. Enema night before and 2 hours morning before procedure. 4/9 Biopsy This consisted of shot in hip (antibiotic). Then laying on table while doctor inserted ultrasound in rectum. Two numbing shots were administrated, one left and one right. Then 18 samples were taken, 9 on left and 9 on right. Main reason for writing this was I came to the forum prior to procedure so I wanted to share. The insertion of ultrasound was the most uncomfortable part. The needle samples for me were like someone thumping me. No blood in urine or bowels that I noticed. Told to refrain from sex for 48 hours. Noticed blood in semen. 4/16 Test result were negative. Was told it possible that it could be there. Its possible your high PSA might just be a high PSA. I know I was very nervous, so I hope this alleviate or at least put some positive if you going in for a biopsy and let you know what to expect.",

      "Content": "I only have had one prior PSA. They were as follows. 2/24/14 2.93 , 3/6/15 4.95 3/11/15 3.69 The uro did a DRE no lump, the day of biopsy ultrasound I ask and he said didn't see any \"area's of concerns\". He commented during ultrasound that his DRE estimate looked to be about the same. I went in with the notebook others mentioned but when we (had wife with me) heard news. I forgot all about recording details. Recall him saying prostate was \"in line with age, slightly enlarged but inline.\" Otago - You are correct I should have had a retest at a much later date than 5 days. Nurse mention they do about two per week. ddayglo- I saw MRI video on youtube, when ask why not use MRI mention very expensive, groups using them custom (which I took meant not main stream) Michael F- I've got female PCF assigned to me. The second one I've had and no DRE from this one either. I saw where activity might elevate test. I had been exercising but no bike riding (German Study) but I do in the summer, sex can't remember but will curtail before next test for sure.",
