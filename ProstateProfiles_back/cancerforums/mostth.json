Had blood work a my annual exam 1/21 they found PSA at 7.5 so doc referred me to a urologist and got DRE, he didn't like what he felt so an MRI was scheduled with a biopsy to follow. MRI a week ago showed me as a PI-RADS level 5 Which I am sure you all know is not good but had the biopsy Friday and now waiting for all the wonderful news that it is going to bring. I guess while I start searching for answers in the forum if anyone has recommendations for possible surgeons if and when needed in the Midwest? I live in North Central Missouri.

      "Content": "Originally Posted by HighlanderCFH Welcome to the forum. We're glad you found us. Remember that ONLY the biopsy can tell if you have prostate cancer. As the old saying goes, you do NOT have cancer until the doctor says you do. So let's hope that your biopsy manages to turn out negative. Did the doctor characterize what was felt during the DRE? For example, if you were told it was enlarged, this, alone, could account for your elevated PSA. But IF the biopsy should reveal cancer, your single digit PSA \"suggests\" that it is very likely still contained in your prostate. Hence, it can be cured by either surgery or radiation. But types of treatments are equally curable. While it might still be a bit premature, you'll find lots of valuable PC info in the 4th edition of Dr Pat Walsh's Guide to Surviving Prostate Cancer. In the meantime, can you tell us your age and PSA history, any family history of PC, etc? Good luck! Chuck DOB 9/6/59 I believe PSA last year was 2.7 elevated to 7.5 3 weeks ago. Don't really have any family history because my Biological father left me and my mom before I was 6. I know he passed several(20 something) years ago but was never told how. Results of the MRI read Large ovoid area of somewhat amorphous low T2 signal, demonstrating restricted diffusion/low ADC signal and enhancement involving the majority of the left prostate gland involving the left aspect of the central zone, posterior lateral transition zone and left peripheral zone. This measures 3.2x2x2.1 cm and is highly concerning for a clinically significant PCa There is an additional smaller area of abnormally low signal and restricted diffusion and enhancement within the posterior medial aspect of the right peripheral zone extending from the apex to the base 1.4x.5x1.8 cm. additional area of intermediat T2 signal within the lateral aspect of the right peripheral zone within the right glnd at the mid aspect and towards the bladder base measuring 10x 12 mm. Extraprostatic extension: The lesions more so on the left have broad based areas of capsular contact with extracapsular extension difficult to exclude towards and into left seminal vesicle.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by HighlanderCFH Hi, Looks like the MRI is definitely suggesting some possible trouble spots. But remember that ONLY the biopsy can tell for sure. If the biopsy should reveal PC, we can have high hopes that the Gleason score(s) is not highly aggressive and that a cure is a possibility. Pretty frustrated now as the waiting will continue, called the dr office to ask for results of biopsy , no answer then the nurse called back couple hours later and says 5 of 13 cores were cancerous. I ask what the Gleason score and she wouldn't give it to me but be sure to have plenty of questions for the doc at the appointment which is scheduled for next Tues. I told her that I could come better prepared if I knew the Gleason score and more info but would not give over the phone or in an email or fax.",

This measures 3.2x2x2.1 cm and is highly concerning for a clinically significant PCa There is an additional smaller area of abnormally low signal and restricted diffusion and enhancement within the posterior medial aspect of the right peripheral zone extending from the apex to the base 1.4x.5x1.8 cm. additional area of intermediat T2 signal within the lateral aspect of the right peripheral zone within the right glnd at the mid aspect and towards the bladder base measuring 10x 12 mm. Extraprostatic extension: The lesions more so on the left have broad based areas of capsular contact with extracapsular extension difficult to exclude towards and into left seminal vesicle.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by HighlanderCFH Hi, Looks like the MRI is definitely suggesting some possible trouble spots. But remember that ONLY the biopsy can tell for sure. If the biopsy should reveal PC, we can have high hopes that the Gleason score(s) is not highly aggressive and that a cure is a possibility. Pretty frustrated now as the waiting will continue, called the dr office to ask for results of biopsy , no answer then the nurse called back couple hours later and says 5 of 13 cores were cancerous. I ask what the Gleason score and she wouldn't give it to me but be sure to have plenty of questions for the doc at the appointment which is scheduled for next Tues. I told her that I could come better prepared if I knew the Gleason score and more info but would not give over the phone or in an email or fax.",

      "Content": "As much as I hate to, I am here looking for help, advice, or any words of wisdom. Had blood work a my annual exam 1/21 they found PSA at 7.5 so doc referred me to a urologist and got DRE, he didn't like what he felt so an MRI was scheduled with a biopsy to follow. MRI a week ago showed me as a PI-RADS level 5 Which I am sure you all know is not good but had the biopsy Friday and now waiting for all the wonderful news that it is going to bring. I guess while I start searching for answers in the forum if anyone has recommendations for possible surgeons if and when needed in the Midwest? I live in North Central Missouri. Thanks for any info.",

      "Content": "Just got the call from dr and he says I should be happy for now as the report is as good as my type of cancer could be. The true test will be the repeated PSA tests and if they show up good and don't rise I should be fine. The only negative he had to give me was that since upgraded to G 8 and pT3b and the seminal vesicles were included in tumor although removed and margin clear, the chance for reoccurance is higher. So we will have to see but I am happy for now. Just to get the catheter out THURS WILL BE A PLUS.",

      "Content": "As I am in the very near future to get my prostate removed, I keep hearing and seeing talk of positive or neg. margins. I hate to feel dumb but what margins are we talking about if the prostate is removed entirely? My thoughts are that the only margins would be where the urethra is cut above and below the prostate. Am I missing something? Also if the nerve bundles are saved or not, in any videos I have seen they are \"wiped away but if they are to work what are they reattached to. To me if they are no longer attached to the missing prostate how are they to ever function just dead ending?",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by DjinTonic Welcome to the Forum, mostth! A few suggestions. If possible, take a spouse, partner, or other family member to your visits. It's hard to remember all the information you will get. Keep a written list of questions to bring to each visit. Take notes or consider recording your visits. Don't worry if you feel overwhelmed at first--we all were at some point. Take one step at a time! Make sure you get a written copy of your full biopsy report (and all future test results). This report is a very important document. If your cancer is low-risk, ask if you are a candidate for active surveillance (AS). If your cancer requires treatment, you will have plenty of time to think, research, ask questions, and consult with other docs (such as a surgeon, radiation oncologist) before deciding how you want to treat. Depending on your biopsy results, your doc may want to do some imaging, such as a bone scan and CTs to have an indication whether your cancer is prostate-confined. Get back to us with your age, PSA & family history, any DRE findings, and your detailed biopsy results. As you get more informations about your cancer, you will see the choices you have more clearly. Your questions will be more focused onced you are passed the diagnosis phase. An excellent book to read is Walsh's Guide to Surviving Prostate Cancer, 4th edition. We're all here to help and support you! Let's see what other Forum Brothers suggest. Djin Thanks for the responses, This is what I know from tests so far in addition to the 5 of 13 cores showing some form of cancer that was not given to me or the % of cores positive. DOB 9/6/59 I believe PSA last year was 2.7 elevated to 7.5 3 weeks ago. Don't really have any family history because my Biological father left me and my mom before I was 6. I know he passed several(20 something) years ago but was never told how. Results of the MRI read Large ovoid area of somewhat amorphous low T2 signal, demonstrating restricted diffusion/low ADC signal and enhancement involving the majority of the left prostate gland involving the left aspect of the central zone, posterior lateral transition zone and left peripheral zone. This measures 3.2x2x2.1 cm and is highly concerning for a clinically significant PCa There is an additional smaller area of abnormally low signal and restricted diffusion and enhancement within the posterior medial aspect of the right peripheral zone extending from the apex to the base 1.4x.5x1.8 cm. additional area of intermediate T2 signal within the lateral aspect of the right peripheral zone within the right gland at the mid aspect and towards the bladder base measuring 10x 12 mm.
