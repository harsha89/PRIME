    "Content": "I had my nerve sparing surgery almost 1 year ago and so far I am still am not able to really get an erection. I am taking 50mg of sildenafil citrate each night & due the pump here and there. At 59, I never had an issue with ED before the surgery. Does using the pump really help? I've heard it can take 18 months to 3 yrs for things to improve. Maybe I am just impatient. Any advice?",
