    "Content": "Hi first post in this form, first I had EBT eight years ago for prostate cancer. my PSA 6.5 and gleason score was 8,do not remember other details. Go once a year now for PSA check with family DOC . My PSA fell to .1 ng/ml last check it went to .2 is this reason for concern. MY family doctor said this was fine check it again in a year, or should I go back to the doctor that did the treatment for 2nd opinion. Had cancer at young age 49 now 57. thanks for help on my concern.",
