      "Content": "I have to dig out the records - but here's was I recall: My PSA went from 1.8 to 3.6 in one year - which prompted the biopsy. My biopsy Gleason score was 8-9. 16 samples showed cancer in 8 of the samples. Surgery removed the prostate, seminal vesticles, lymph nodes, etc. Don't remember that they ever told me about a post-surgery Gleason. The post surgery pathology showed negative margins - and no cancer in any of the other organs removed. Originally Posted by HighlanderCFH Hi, Sorry to hear that the PSA is going up. Can you give us your post-op pathology report? Gleason Score, staging, how the lymph nodes were, seminal vesicles, extraprostatic tissue, etc? If the cancer has returned, and is around the prostate bed, you could be looking at what they call \"salvage radiation,\" which is so-termed because its purpose is to finish the cure that the surgery started. We can tell you more if we have more details. Good luck to you! Chuck",

      "Content": "I had a DaVinci prostatectomy in January, 2008 (5.5 years ago). The surgery was successful, and the pathology showed negative margins. Subsequent PSA tests (every 3 months at first, then every 6 months after 2 years) came back as : Year 1 Undetectable Year 2 .02 Year 3 .04 Year 4 .06 After each of these tests, both the forums and my GP told me - in effect - \" don't worry about anything under .10 because anything below .10 could be a test anomaly\". I just got home from Mayo Clinic for a full blown physical (no problems - just the best physical you can get), and my PSA is at .18! It has tripled in the last year - and now I have to deal with this issue. What am I looking at in terms of options at this point? I thought this nonsense was behind me, but apparently this devil cancer has other ideas. Any experiences from those of you who have had a similar reoccurance would be helpful. Thanks",
