      "Content": "My husbands PSA has been going up. The first time he was checked his PSA was 2.6 on 1-11-16. The next year 3.4 2/27/17. This year 4.1 6-12-18. His DRE the Urologist said he didn\u0092t feel any lumps or harden areas. The Dr did a K4 test and the blood work should be back next week. The Urologist recommends a Biopsy that is scheduled for July 10 due to the PSA numbers.My husband has no symptoms other than ED once in while. The Urologist said from the exam that he estimates my husbands prostate to be a 35 cc. My husband has been having low back pain for a while. By my husbands PSA numbers is this a slow or rapid rise? Could this just be BPH ? Thanks for any responses",

That he could wait 6 months and re-check PSA levels and do the biopsy then. What do you think should we wait? I\u2019m worried that waiting is not a good idea. I would rather know now than later. I also think 6 months is a long time to re-check PSA. My husband doesn\u2019t want to do the biopsy now since the DR seems not too worried. Any advice would really be approached.",
