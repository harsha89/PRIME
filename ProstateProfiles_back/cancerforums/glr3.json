      "Content": "Background: I am 59 and overweight and my PSA has risen to 5.2 from 4.2 in one year. My general practitioner wants to see me next week for my follow-up to the PSA test which was part of my annual physical. BTW - after reading several other threads, I realized that I had the DRE before the blood was drawn for the PSA test - comments indicate that the DRE might raise the PSA level, but I don't know if it would increase it any significant level. I am a pro-active type of person so I have started researching PSA and PC. I find one aspect VERY puzzling. It seems that the first course of action is to biopsy the prostate. However, my research indicates that the highest chance of the biopsy actually finding cancer is 35% when the PSA is between 5 and 10! Saying that another way, there is a 65% or greater chance that the cancer will be missed by the biopsy. Since I want to know whether or not I have cancer, this does not appear to be a very effective method for making that determination! And yet, it is always the primary \"go to\" test. I have read about the endo-rectal MRI, and it appears to have a much better result in actually determining if cancer is present in the prostate - or even if it has migrated out of the prostate as well. Why is this procedure not used first to determine if there is cancer since it is more effective in actually determining its presence, and the results could be used for biopsy purposes for grading of the cancer? Is it purely a money thing? Also, are there any other tests that can better determine if cancer is present in the prostate? As I said - I want to KNOW what I am dealing with and I don't want to rely on a test as inaccurate as the standard biopsy to bet my life on. Thanks for any comments or suggestions.",

That will determine whether I go directly to urologist or if I wait 3 months for a follow-up PSA (alone) test. One reassuring factor - my family physician just had prostate surgery and I will be referred to that same urologist.",

It is not that I do not want to undergo a biopsy, I understand that getting the samples under the microscope is the only true determinate. But I also don't want a false sense of \"security\" if the samples come back negative for cancer because of a high likelihood that the sampling missed the cancer. In reading other threads on the Forum, there are numerous posts about men having gotten numerous biopsies over many years - all coming back negative for cancer. And then another biopsy is taken and cancer is found in a late stage and has possibly spread. That is the scenario I want to avoid. I am merely seeking the best answers to the question - do I have cancer? The following progression seems to make the most sense to me: 1) PSA test, 2) free PSA test, 3) endo-rectal (coiled) MRI, 4) Biopsy guided by MRI results. Obviously I will discuss all of this with the urologist when I go. I am just trying to gather as much information as possible so that I can discuss this with the doctor. Again, any comments are appreciated. Thanks.",
