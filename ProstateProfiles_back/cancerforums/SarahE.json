      "Content": "Hello. I am from the UK but I am currently in Florida for a few months. My husband had a prostatectomy 3 months ago in Scotland and his surgeon requested that we get a PSA test at the 3 month mark, which is about now. He told us it had to be a 'super sensitive' or 'ultra sensitive' test, rather than a regular PSA, but the clinics here don't seem to have heard of the test I am requesting. Perhaps your standard test is already super-sensitive? The results need to be 3 digits, ie 0.04 rather than 0.1 so can anyone tell us if a 3 digit result is standard here? If not, does anyone know what a 'super sensitive' PSA would be called here? Any advice appreciated. Thank you.",
