My situation has perineural invasion, so it's possible that surgery has affected the nerves alongside the prostate. Hey ho, we'll see in time, maybe. Congrats on your zero club membership, mate.

      "Content": "Thanks for the replies, lads. Much appreciated. To Chuck, the radiation was suggested post-op, by the surgeon, who said,'don't worry, we have a few tricks up our sleeve to treat you'. He then said I'd be up for RT as soon as my full continence returned. To Djin, after the DRE, the urologist said, ' well, that's pretty irregular, brother'. My post-op PSA is 0.2, after a follow-up check. RT was suggested the day after surgery, when the surgeon was doing his summing-up in my hospital room. I've got my report in front of me, and it says : Part A material reveals extensive bilateral involvement of the prostate gland by adenocarcinoma. There is extension outside the capsule proper. Seminal vesicles extension. Tumour extends to the margins of resection and blocks A2, A3, A4, A6 and A23. Perineural invasion is readily identified. Part B reveals lymph node with sinus histiocytosis. No metastatic lesions are noted. Part C reveals a lymph node with histiocytosis. No metastatic carcinoma is noted. Extraprostatic extension: Present, focal left base, seminal vesicles soft tissue. Bladder neck invasion : Present. Margins involved by invasive carcinoma. Apex, base margin, left base. Margin positivity in area of extra-prostatic extension : Present, left base. To RobLee, I wore an adult diaper for a few days, then switched to 'Always' pads for around a month. After that, I decided to go without. I only leak now(microscopically!), if I sigh deeply or jump up out of a chair too quickly, and even then, only about half the time. I have 100% ED, and may have kissed goodbye to that little pleasure. I've tried Viagra, but everything's blue, headaches abound, and, well, it just hasn't worked. Also, when it comes to pretty decent endowment, I no longer swing like king of the jungle. It's a serious comment, because I'd like to know if anyone else has noticed that, or is it just me ? The radiation oncologist said he was considering HT, alongside RT, but would talk with the surgeon first. I'm presently doing just RT, so they obviously decided to go with RT for now. The RT machine is one that rotates around me, not sure what type that is...just trying to give as much info as I can. I hope this answers a few questions...I apologise for the long-windedness. Wishing you all good luck with our shared inconvenience, and thank you again for the welcome and good wishes.",
