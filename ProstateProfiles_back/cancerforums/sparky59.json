To ASA, I think the information about the spiking may be very relevant to PSA activity in the male species. I know the velocity is not as important as it used to be. I'd rather be proactive than surprised. This is just all pretty new to me. To hear this is comforting. I will ask for the extra testing to cover the bases/basis of it all. To Rob Lee, yes I'll keep on top of this. I'm not going to turn a blind eye, yet I don't want to overthink this. (too late). I just know that it will be something I will always consider in my health. It has taken center stage at this juncture. I would believe if my PSA goes up more, it would be wise to do testing rather than a biopsy. But I'm not sure if my Uro is biopsy hungry or over agressive. We shall see. To Jim, I hope it's non apparent. And to the fact of fearing, I think this to be normal. I've had some pretty bad experiences in where there should only be 'slight discomfort' where I came off the table. Yikes. I do have a very good URO, js. To the stones report, I was in the hospital to have a 3.5 cm stone removed last year. It was suppose to be a one day stint, which turned into 4 days due to bleeding. Oh, well, such is life. I'm a kidney stone factory. I would think I would have to live on millet and porridge to have the proper diet. That's not going to happen too soon! Thanks all!",

      "Content": "Hello all, I'm a 57 caucasion with an elevated psa of 2.7. My last reading was 1.8 32 months ago or a .9 increase in 32 months. Through much research I have found that my velocity would be .3% yearly. I had a DRE a month ago along with the psa result of 2.7. I have no family history of PC. I do have symptoms of BPH. I just received a report from my GP along with blood work and suggestions. What I was troubled with is that he recommended I go see my urologists NOW. I found this alarming. Yes, I will go see my wonderful 30 yo urologist which I have intimate relations only a professional level on various kidney stone occasions. I won't ask, 'should I be worried?' for of course it is a bit alarming. Yet, through all the study the velocity seems quite low. I do know that you can have the dreaded C at any level. btw, he did not state or seemed alarmed in any way on the DRE. And wouldn't any prostate infection show in a urinalysis? He did not mention that there was a positive. I'm looking more for a sounding board and support through a process and road I have less traveled. Oh, the ode to maleness. Any thoughts on this? Thanks all.",

      "Content": "Well, I got my results for the last blood work and my PSA is 2.9. It's gone up .2 in 6 weeks. We're waiting another 6 weeks to do another test. This is not a big jump, but I was surely hoping for a lower score rather than higher. I'm wondering if my urologist is considering a biopsy at such a low score. I do know that the PSA is just an indicator of many variables and it's better safe that sorry. I just don't want to go down a rabbit hole chasing squirrels. I have no history in my family of PC and my urologists suggested that the PSA fluctuates for many reasons. That being said, I'm still troubled and a big kid when it comes to unnecessary pain in testing, ie the biopsy fear. Thus my velocity is from 33% to 39% with this last reading. Any similar experiences or thoughts? signed, a cautious & nervous bystander....",
