    "Content": "Hi, I turned 70 February 2018. I have been healthy all my 70 years. I had my yearly Medicare medical exam and my PSA was 6.5. I was referred to a Urologist and had a second PSA test done which came back 6.9 so a biopsy was performed on on 5/8/2018. The results were 4 out of the 12 cores taken showed adenocarcinoma, two with a Gleason grade of 4+4, cancer in one of one cores, involving 10% of needle core tissue and measuring less than 1 MM in length, one with Gleason grade of 3+3 and one that was Gleason grade of 5+4=9. 27% of needle core tissue, and measuring 3 MM in length, discontinuous foci. Negative for perineural invasion. I was told the last core was aggressive. I had a CT and bone scan that showed no issues with the prostate cancer spreading from the prostate but the CT scan showed a 6.9 X 5.9 x 7.6 CM heterogeneous, centrally necrotic mass arising from the anterior midpole of the left kidney. I am having the kidney removed on July 16th. I am leaning towards having my prostate removed when I heal from the kidney surgery. I would like any comments from anyone who has had one or both of these organs removed. I am more concerned about the prostate and what the side effects might be initially and long term. My Doctor, when giving me the prostate results, did say if you had a life expectancy of less than 10 years I will say do nothing but he expects me to live longer than that. I found that interesting since he told me my Gleason 9 was aggressive which makes me think fast growing. Again, appreciate any feedback on anything I put in this thread. Thanks, AlanR70",
