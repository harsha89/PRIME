      "Content": "I know I might be jumping ahead a little but am concerned about my husband's latest PSA level of 15. He is to be retested tomorrow but the levels have been going up over the past few months at am alarming rate. He will have a biopsy if the levels are indeed high. My first thought was that if he has pc, then surgery would be the best way to go, but now I am reading that high numbers suggest it might have spread and that radiation is more effective. My concern about this is that he had rectal cancer 6 1/2 years ago and had radiation at that time too. As the prostate and rectum are not that far apart, it is possible for him to get more radiotherapy in that area? He is still affected by the treatment for the rectal cancer. 10 years ago, he had a biopsy when his PSA was 12 and the result was that he had BPH, but he has since had a turp to reduce the size of the prostate, so I feel it is unlikely to be BPH again. He is 71 years old. Any input would be much appreciated.",

      "Content": "I see what you mean from those links to reports which I have skimmed through but I also see someone on this forum with a similar Gleason Score but not such a high PSA having had the Hifu treatment. It is so interesting to see people coming here to the Bahamas for treatment when it is usually the other way round! Our problem is that I am concerned about more radiation to that area when he already was radiated for rectal cancer over 6 years ago and there is definitely damage to the rectum. We are presently waiting for the treatment plans and summaries from the UK where he received the radiation last time to see if more radiation is a viable option. So we might just be left with brachytherapy as that appears less damaging to the surrounding organs. From what I have read briefly, that would entail a short stay in hospital or outpatient treatment? I wonder how soon we could travel back home here after the procedure? Of course, he would also be receiving hormone therapy. Any advice would be appreciated.",

      "Content": "Thanks for the response. We live in a small country, on an even smaller island and there are only four oncologists in total, so none specialize in any particular cancer. The same oncologist who treated my husband's rectal cancer, treated my lymphoma. The urologist is the one who deals with prostate cancer here and has given us the options. External radiation can be done here, but the seed implantation would have to be done in the US. We are not sure what the actual Stage is because of the previous turp surgery which removed a good bit of the prostate. The urologist feels it is most likely a 2, rather than 1. The cancer has shown up in three areas, all with a gleason score of 5+4. The percentage of the left apex is 90% and in the left base and left periphery 1, 60%. That is all I get from the pathology report.",
