      "Content": "I haven't posted much but did learn a lot when my husband was diagnosed. He had Davinci last Feb and recoverd very well with no after effects. My question is he has developed what we believe to be a Hernia where the laparoscopic hole is where the take out the prostate. We see our surgeon in two we but have been told to see a general surgeon. Can these hernias be repaired laparoscopically or do they do an open surgery. Does anyone know the medical term for this particular hernia. Thank.",

His report went down and we would never have had knowledge if he had chosen radiation. He also wanted the option of radiation for the future if the need ever came up. For him the surgery was easy went home after 24 hours with cath and drain ,they came out at 1 week.Now has undetectable PSA and all his path was contained. Good luck. I think you have made.

      "Content": "My hubby was diagnosed early January with almost the same numbers as you and he chose surgery. His surgery was feb 20 th and it went very smooth. He had Davinci, 1 night in the hospital. 1 week with catheter and drain. Almost continent except for dribbles when straining. His pathology came back lower than original numbers. I do agree with the other post about your surgeon being very experienced. Our surgeon had done around 1200 so we were very comfortable . The thing we liked about the surgery for us was we felt we had a more accurate diagnoses and it was gone. Good luck. My friend.",
