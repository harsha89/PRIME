      "Content": "I'll post my history later but would the ones of you that have prostate cancer that has spread to the bones tell me about how long it took from diagnose to the time it showed up in the bones. And what does the pain feel like. Is it a stabbing pain or like a dull tooth ache. Is it there all the time or just when you moved around. Is it in the back or hips. Did the pain come on gradually or suddenly. Mine is off and on",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by cvictim Not going into great detail here, but I started Hormone therapy about a month ago, side effects vary from person to person. The best thing to say is I'm on a level now, it takes about 20-30 days or so for the drugs to kick in. Just getting some minor hot flashes now, a little insomnia, some tiredness. I would possibly consider Castration on a second go around of the drugs for the simple fact that castration has fewer side effects than the drugs. My doctor tells there are drugs to use after Castration if high PSA levels return. I would think castration would be the way to go but from what i have read the side effects could be the same as with the drugs, then what do you do. With the drugs you can stop but there is no going back with castration. I talked to a friend of mine who had one ball removed due to cancer and he said he does not have any side effects. Maybe it's like a kidney, as long as you have one that's enough.",
