      "Content": "Greetings \u0096 Hello and my name is Joe from Florida. I am 56 years old with a PSA reading of 10.5 and a family history of prostate cancer. The DRE was negative, PSA reading has been rising for the past few years and my first biopsy two years ago was negative. This Friday I received another 12 core biopsy and after the test, I asked my urologist his opinion if I had any prostate cancer. The urologist believed it \u0093may\u0094 be negative as my prostate was large at 95 grams and he provided no guidance and told me to wait for the results. I\u0092d sincerely appreciate any guidance anyone here may provide with the probability of prostate cancer based upon the information provided. Thanks Joe Florida",

      "Content": "Hello- I was scheduled to consult with my urologist this Friday exactly one week after my biopsy regarding my results. Before my appointment, I received a phone call from the urologist\u2019s office indicating that my biopsy results were delayed pending further investigation by the pathologist. Obviously, I am obviously somewhat concerned. Has this ever happened to anyone and does a urologist normally make a phone call to the patient if the biopsy results are positive ? Thanks Joe",

      "Content": "Hello Chuck and thanks for the quick response. My PSA history is as follows- ( all DRE's negative ) 04/14 second biopsy ( results pending ) 02/14 10.5 06/13 8.9 01/13 7.2 05/12 6.5 and first negative biopsy 08/11 5.9 Additionally, my grandfather, father and uncle had PC in their later years in life. My concern with my high PSA levels is that I am both overweight and taking medication that normally lowers one\u2019s PSA readings. Thanks for your help---",

      "Content": "I sincerely appreciate everyone\u2019s opinion here and allow me to better explain myself. My wife is a physician and she spoke with two other physicians that are \u201cNOT\u201d urologist she personally knows that have already dealt with their own prostate cancer issues. Both advised that they were concerned regarding the PSA reading and the velocity of the PSA readings. Both also advised that my prescribed medications and my weight should in fact lower my PSA (Zetia & Exforge & Aspirin) and both extrapolated an \"approximate\" true PSA reading approaching 11, even taking into account the size of the prostate. Both advised for multi-core biopsy in three months if the results are negative and if warranted to remove the prostate and some surrounding tissue as this was the \u201cgold-standard\u201d for prostate cancer. Unfortunately both also strongly recommend to seek another urologist if surgery were indicated as they didn\u2019t have a lot of faith in my current urologist regarding surgical matters.",
