There may be higher Gleason that is undetected. With this disease success is achieved with early detection and early treatment. What treatment options are available to you? Thank you for your response! Yes I know that is Not a good idea to have antibiotice that is Why I immediatly went on doing MRI. I will request a second opinion regarding pathological report. there is clearly a discontinuity between existing data. I was planned to go for Da Vinci surgery in Germany. In our country have Da Vinci surgery available but with no much experience. But right now I don\u0092t know is the right way to action. Thank you again.",
