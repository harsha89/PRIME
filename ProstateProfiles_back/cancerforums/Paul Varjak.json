      "Content": "The day after my house and car were engulfed in a tidal surge I suffered acute urinary retention, which required the fitting of an emergency catheter. The catheter was removed on 6 January after but it had to be re-inserted on 8 January as I went into acute urinary retention again. I still have the catheter today. Last week I had a PSA test which gave a reading of 285. I have not had any infection for three weeks so, I guess, the abnormally high reading cannot be explained by a UTI. With such a high reading does anyone know the likelihood that the PSA reading is due to cancer? The consultant suggested that it was abnormally high and could not be explained by BPH, UTI or any other cause, other than prostate cancer.",

      "Content": "The day after my house and car were engulfed in a tidal surge I suffered acute urinary retention, which required the fitting of an emergency catheter. The catheter was removed on 6 January after but it had to be re-inserted on 8 January as I went into acute urinary retention again. I still have the catheter today. Last week I had a PSA test which gave a reading of 285. I have not had any infection for three weeks so, I guess, the abnormally high reading cannot be explained by a UTI. With such a high reading does anyone know the likelihood that the PSA reading is due to cancer? The consultant suggested that it was abnormally high and could not be explained by BPH, UTI or any other cause, other than prostate cancer.",

      "Content": "I am told the results will be through in a few days and I will be given those results at the next appointment, which will probably be in 10 days. I just wish now that I took heed of those occasional symptoms of urinating difficulties on getting up in the morning. But it really was only occasional and only when my bladder was particularly full.
