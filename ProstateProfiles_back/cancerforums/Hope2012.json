      "Content": "So by the sounds of it your doctor isn't raising alarm bells. By all means if you want a dre then get it done! And I commend you on paying for the PSA test as well. Get the testing done so you can hopefully put it out of your mind. Anxiety and stress if severe enough can cause or add to pains you are feeling in your body. I've been where you are. I had a suspected \"melanotic lesion\" removed from my eye and sent for a biopsy. The wait drove me crazy and I imagined all kinds of aches and pains in my head. I was convinced I had a brain tumour. Once I received the news he lesion was benign the pains went away. And I mean that same day they disappeared. I'm not saying yours are phantom pains, but anxiety can definitely add to them. Good luck!",

      "Content": "Google is the worst place to go when looking up symptoms. For every person who ends up with PC with those symptoms, I'm sure there are thousands who don't. You have done the right thing and have seen the doctor. Your bloods came back normal and from what I can tell, your PSA levels are not indicative of cancer. Don't make the jump to the worst case scenario....and stop googling...all it does is add to your stress. I'm curious, what did the doctor say when you shared your concern about prostate cancer? I'd trust a doctor's opinion more than a bunch of strangers on an Internet forum. We are not doctors here and we can not diagnose or speculate without it being a reckless thing to do. Keep up with your tests and doctor visits. If things turn out badly and there is a diagnosis, this community is here to support you. Good luck and good health!",
