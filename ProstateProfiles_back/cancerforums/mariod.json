      "Content": "Originally Posted by HighlanderCFH Hi there, While your PSA is somewhat of a concern, a Gleason 6 almost never spreads to other parts of the body. In fact, in a study involving 17,000 G6 surgeries at Johns Hopkins, the number of cases where it had spread to other areas was ZERO. So you are in no need of any panic. You should have plenty of time to determine what you want to do. With a PSA of over 10, you will probably need to do some form of treatment, whether it is surgery or radiation. Also, keep in mind that the biopsy report is only an estimate -- an educated guess -- of the actual situation within the prostate. In about 30% of surgical cases, the final pathology report differs from the biopsy report. Many of them end up being WORSE than suggested by the biopsy -- and also many of them end up being BETTER than what the biopsy suggested. You will find many people here who will chip in with additional information, experiences, advice, etc. Keep in mind that we are not doctors, but we do have experiences & some knowledge. My recommendation to you would be to have at least two consultations: 1- with a HIGHLY experienced urologist/surgeon and, 2- with a HIGHLY experienced radiation oncologist. Get the pros & cons of both forms of treatment, or whatever else they may recommend. Can you give us your age? Also what stage the biopsy report gave? Good luck! Chuck Hi, thanks for your reply . I am 61. The meeting was a blurr, I was in shock I guess. I will take notes the next time.",
