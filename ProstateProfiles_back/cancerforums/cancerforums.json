    "Content": "I am very depressed and putting a lot of pressure on my family because of it. I feel as though my \"manhood\" has been taken away from me and I do not know who to blame. I know it is something to be thankful for that I still have my life, but I feel as though going through the DeVinci robotic procedure, I was not fully informed as to how post-op would be. Has anyone been able to find alternative ways (besides pumps, pills, or shots) to help me get my manhood back?",
