      "Content": "I really dont want to travel into Manhattan every day for SRT for 8 weeks, so i contacted the local \"suburban\" treatment center of MSKCC on Long Island and asked them about the equipment they use. Curious if anyone can offer input/info They have 2 machines. one is a Varian True Beam. The second is a Varian EX-1. The woman i spoke with told me that she believes that the EX-1 is what they use for Prostate Cancer specifically, most of the time. It was installed about 3 years ago. The True Beam was installed a bit longer than 3 years ago. She's not a clinician but seemed pretty knowledgeable Anybody have any knowledge about whether these are good, most up to date machines that will offer lowest chance of permanent side effects in SRT? I was also told that if i decided to do the treatments out on Long Island, i could have everything done up to and including the simulation, in Manhattan, with Dr Zelefsky, then when i am ready to start treatment, i would get transferred out to the island for my daily sessions. The RO there has a primary focus on Prostate Cancer, almost exclusively. So that gives me some more confidence. Anyway, if anyone has knowledge about the machines, much appreciated. Garyi, no wiseass comments please.",

      "Content": "Haven't been around the last 10 days or so, was in Florida enjoying new home. But while there we got results of wifes ct scan taken 5 weeks after end of chemo for Ovarian Cancer. Abdomen and Pelvic scans were completely clean. 2 days later we get results of chest ct. CT Scans done 2 weeks ago, 5 weeks after chemo ended. Pelvic and Abdominal CT showed no sign of residual or recurrent disease, all clean. 2 days later, get an email, ct scan of chest report is available in the portal. It showed 1. 3 mm nodule in lung, referred to as \"tiny\" recommended monitoring 2. 21x17mm enlarged INTERNAL MAMMARY LYMPH NODE, which is on the same side as mastectomy 28 years ago. I'd be curious if anyone has any thoughts, comments, or similar experiences. I'm thinking it makes no sense that Frontline treatment for OC would clean everything up and drive down ca 125 to almost zero, except that 1 lymph node would be recurrence. So that leads me to think, maybe its BC recurrence? But does it make sense that after 28 years, there would be a LOCAL recurrence? She had Mastectomy 28 years ago, no recurrence since, although marker has been rising very slowly from low 30's to 50 over 8-9 years, dr said its just her new normal. I'm confused, a little scared, hoping its just lymph node inflamation resulting from lung collapse, and hoping the 3mm nodule on lung is nothing, i know they are pretty common and that is very small. Or maybe its just wishful thinking. Seeing Dr later this week, guessing he might want to biopsy lymph node if its reachable. Any thoughts appreciated. We've been through so much, and thought we were done for a while. now this. I know this isnt a breast or Ovarian cancer forum, but the BC and OC forums here are pretty inactive, and we've all had experiences. PS. AT this point, i dont even care to retest my PSA which was wrongly tested with standard test.",

I thought about an MO in addition, not in place of, only because an MO will not have a bias towards radiation. With that said, if you go to MSKCC for an RO consult, try to see Dr Zelefsky, my understanding is that he is the best RO for PC in the business.

I did that before i decided on surgery, and spoke with Mark Scholz, the Medical Director of the practice. They are MOs totally focused on PC, and they do phone consults. I sent them all of my records, and then we did a 45 minute phone consult, they charged me $675. After that, follow up calls are $75 for a 15 minute call.

It's the lymph node I worry about, but yeah, got to just wait to speak to Dr at visit on Wednesday. Of course he's a gyn onc so I'm guessing he'll either want to biopsy it or send us to a breast specialist. But who knows. I guess I just have to wait. The lymph node apparently was there on the last scan, about 5 or 6 months ago (wasn't mentioned to us till now) and back then it was 19 mm by 17 mm, now it is 21mm x 17 mm. 2 mm is tiny, so I don't know if that's considered stable or not but the report stated \"not largely changed from prior image\"",

      "Content": "Haven't been around the last 10 days or so, was in Florida enjoying new home. But while there we got results of wifes ct scan taken 5 weeks after end of chemo for Ovarian Cancer. Abdomen and Pelvic scans were completely clean. 2 days later we get results of chest ct. CT Scans done 2 weeks ago, 5 weeks after chemo ended. Pelvic and Abdominal CT showed no sign of residual or recurrent disease, all clean. 2 days later, get an email, ct scan of chest report is available in the portal. It showed 1. 3 mm nodule in lung, referred to as \"tiny\" recommended monitoring 2. 21x17mm enlarged INTERNAL MAMMARY LYMPH NODE, which is on the same side as mastectomy 28 years ago. I'd be curious if anyone has any thoughts, comments, or similar experiences. I'm thinking it makes no sense that Frontline treatment for OC would clean everything up and drive down ca 125 to almost zero, except that 1 lymph node would be recurrence. So that leads me to think, maybe its BC recurrence? But does it make sense that after 28 years, there would be a LOCAL recurrence? She had Mastectomy 28 years ago, no recurrence since, although marker has been rising very slowly from low 30's to 50 over 8-9 years, dr said its just her new normal. I'm confused, a little scared, hoping its just lymph node inflamation resulting from lung collapse, and hoping the 3mm nodule on lung is nothing, i know they are pretty common and that is very small. Or maybe its just wishful thinking. Seeing Dr later this week, guessing he might want to biopsy lymph node if its reachable. Any thoughts appreciated. We've been through so much, and thought we were done for a while. now this. I know this isnt a breast or Ovarian cancer forum, but the BC and OC forums here are pretty inactive, and we've all had experiences. PS. AT this point, i dont even care to retest my PSA which was wrongly tested with standard test.",

      "Content": "Thanks guys. The lung nodule doesn't scar me much, I've read that over 50% of chest Ct scans show lung nodules and most under 3 cm are benign. It's the lymph node I worry about, but yeah, got to just wait to speak to Dr at visit on Wednesday. Of course he's a gyn onc so I'm guessing he'll either want to biopsy it or send us to a breast specialist. But who knows. I guess I just have to wait. The lymph node apparently was there on the last scan, about 5 or 6 months ago (wasn't mentioned to us till now) and back then it was 19 mm by 17 mm, now it is 21mm x 17 mm. 2 mm is tiny, so I don't know if that's considered stable or not but the report stated \"not largely changed from prior image\"",

But also worth looking up the guidelines yourself via google. FWIW, my surgeon, Ash Tewari, has told me that after one year of 3 month PSA tests, assuming they continue undetectable, he will move me to 6 months for the next year, then to annual. This is with a G7 (3+4) SO WIth a G6, you should be comfortable with annuals, i would think. On the other hand, if you prefer to be cautious, get it done at six month intervals",

But PC grows slower than other cancers, even G8, and with only one core positive, it sounds like there isn\u2019t any great danger. I just want to make one comment, with some hesitation. This is just me...I would not be real comfortable with a surgeon that\u2019s only done 240 RALPS. Studies, as u probably know, show that the learning curve flattens at 300. Nevertheless, I\u2019d want more than even 300. But it\u2019s a very personal decision, just something to consider.",

I have to say, your Uro's explanation is counterintuitive, but makes sense on some level. And yet, i have what all indications are, an UNagressive cancer, g7(3+4) and a low risk Decipher score (.37), but my PSA is rising very slowly. (.068 after starting to rise 18 months ago) So who knows. Since the medical profession doesn't have black and white answers in a recurrence setting, we just have to make decisions based on 1. what facts we know 2. how aggressive we are by nature 3. how lucky we feel. Its great that you made yours and have a clear path forward. It must be a relief, just like the feeling of having made a firm decision on primary therapy",

So give yourself as much time To heal as possible. Any improvement of incontinence and erectile function, is frozen once you start radiation.

I have to say, your Uro's explanation is counterintuitive, but makes sense on some level. And yet, i have what all indications are, an UNagressive cancer, g7(3+4) and a low risk Decipher score (.37), but my PSA is rising very slowly. (.068 after starting to rise 18 months ago) So who knows. Since the medical profession doesn't have black and white answers in a recurrence setting, we just have to make decisions based on 1. what facts we know 2. how aggressive we are by nature 3. how lucky we feel. Its great that you made yours and have a clear path forward. It must be a relief, just like the feeling of having made a firm decision on primary therapy",

      "Content": "I really dont want to travel into Manhattan every day for SRT for 8 weeks, so i contacted the local \"suburban\" treatment center of MSKCC on Long Island and asked them about the equipment they use. Curious if anyone can offer input/info They have 2 machines. one is a Varian True Beam. The second is a Varian EX-1. The woman i spoke with told me that she believes that the EX-1 is what they use for Prostate Cancer specifically, most of the time. It was installed about 3 years ago. The True Beam was installed a bit longer than 3 years ago. She's not a clinician but seemed pretty knowledgeable Anybody have any knowledge about whether these are good, most up to date machines that will offer lowest chance of permanent side effects in SRT? I was also told that if i decided to do the treatments out on Long Island, i could have everything done up to and including the simulation, in Manhattan, with Dr Zelefsky, then when i am ready to start treatment, i would get transferred out to the island for my daily sessions. The RO there has a primary focus on Prostate Cancer, almost exclusively. So that gives me some more confidence. Anyway, if anyone has knowledge about the machines, much appreciated. Garyi, no wiseass comments please.",

I have to say, your Uro's explanation is counterintuitive, but makes sense on some level. And yet, i have what all indications are, an UNagressive cancer, g7(3+4) and a low risk Decipher score (.37), but my PSA is rising very slowly. (.068 after starting to rise 18 months ago) So who knows. Since the medical profession doesn't have black and white answers in a recurrence setting, we just have to make decisions based on 1. what facts we know 2. how aggressive we are by nature 3. how lucky we feel. Its great that you made yours and have a clear path forward. It must be a relief, just like the feeling of having made a firm decision on primary therapy",

      "Content": "Haven't been around the last 10 days or so, was in Florida enjoying new home. But while there we got results of wifes ct scan taken 5 weeks after end of chemo for Ovarian Cancer. Abdomen and Pelvic scans were completely clean. 2 days later we get results of chest ct. CT Scans done 2 weeks ago, 5 weeks after chemo ended. Pelvic and Abdominal CT showed no sign of residual or recurrent disease, all clean. 2 days later, get an email, ct scan of chest report is available in the portal. It showed 1. 3 mm nodule in lung, referred to as \"tiny\" recommended monitoring 2. 21x17mm enlarged INTERNAL MAMMARY LYMPH NODE, which is on the same side as mastectomy 28 years ago. I'd be curious if anyone has any thoughts, comments, or similar experiences. I'm thinking it makes no sense that Frontline treatment for OC would clean everything up and drive down ca 125 to almost zero, except that 1 lymph node would be recurrence. So that leads me to think, maybe its BC recurrence? But does it make sense that after 28 years, there would be a LOCAL recurrence? She had Mastectomy 28 years ago, no recurrence since, although marker has been rising very slowly from low 30's to 50 over 8-9 years, dr said its just her new normal. I'm confused, a little scared, hoping its just lymph node inflamation resulting from lung collapse, and hoping the 3mm nodule on lung is nothing, i know they are pretty common and that is very small. Or maybe its just wishful thinking. Seeing Dr later this week, guessing he might want to biopsy lymph node if its reachable. Any thoughts appreciated. We've been through so much, and thought we were done for a while. now this. I know this isnt a breast or Ovarian cancer forum, but the BC and OC forums here are pretty inactive, and we've all had experiences. PS. AT this point, i dont even care to retest my PSA which was wrongly tested with standard test.",

      "Content": "Thanks guys. The lung nodule doesn't scar me much, I've read that over 50% of chest Ct scans show lung nodules and most under 3 cm are benign. It's the lymph node I worry about, but yeah, got to just wait to speak to Dr at visit on Wednesday. Of course he's a gyn onc so I'm guessing he'll either want to biopsy it or send us to a breast specialist. But who knows. I guess I just have to wait. The lymph node apparently was there on the last scan, about 5 or 6 months ago (wasn't mentioned to us till now) and back then it was 19 mm by 17 mm, now it is 21mm x 17 mm. 2 mm is tiny, so I don't know if that's considered stable or not but the report stated \"not largely changed from prior image\"",

      "Content": "I would like to correct a fallacy that's been stated here a number of times.. It is incorrect to say that surgery cannot be done after radiation. There are surgeons who do it, and some specialize in it. For example. The surgeons at MSKCC do it. Specifically, Dr James Eastham, you can go to his website and see that it's an area that he specializes in. It is clearly more difficult after radiation, and side effects Alan be more severe, but it can be done. Called Salvage surgery. I discussed this with my RO, in our consult. Also, there are other alternatives if brachybor EBRT fail, such as cryosurgery, and other treatments . So to say surgery is not an option after radiation is not correct. It's not as straightforward , but can be and is, done. Also, in my consult with the RO at MSKCC, he explained that salvage radiation, after failed surgery, is only successful 50% of the time.",

      "Content": "Thanks for your comments Jim. Regarding having to travel for salvage surgery, that's probably correct. I would think though, that it's done at all of the major NCCN Cancer Centers like MSKCC, Cleveland Clinic, etc, so probably available within 500-1000 miles of most. Being in the NYC area, I know of at least 3 surgeons who do it. Like I said though, it's no fun, very complicated and SEs are more severe Regarding the 5o% success rate, I have not researched this, as I said, it's a stat that was told to me by the RO at MSKCC, chief of RAd Oncology, at one of their suburban complexes. He could be wrong, and frankly, I sure hope he is. I should probably mention, that while I've learned so much in the last few weeks (not by choice) from this and other forums, reading studies n pubmed, and reading 2 going on 3 books, I'm far from an expert. So everything I say should be taken as opinion, not fact",

      "Content": "Haven't been around the last 10 days or so, was in Florida enjoying new home. But while there we got results of wifes ct scan taken 5 weeks after end of chemo for Ovarian Cancer. Abdomen and Pelvic scans were completely clean. 2 days later we get results of chest ct. CT Scans done 2 weeks ago, 5 weeks after chemo ended. Pelvic and Abdominal CT showed no sign of residual or recurrent disease, all clean. 2 days later, get an email, ct scan of chest report is available in the portal. It showed 1. 3 mm nodule in lung, referred to as \"tiny\" recommended monitoring 2. 21x17mm enlarged INTERNAL MAMMARY LYMPH NODE, which is on the same side as mastectomy 28 years ago. I'd be curious if anyone has any thoughts, comments, or similar experiences. I'm thinking it makes no sense that Frontline treatment for OC would clean everything up and drive down ca 125 to almost zero, except that 1 lymph node would be recurrence. So that leads me to think, maybe its BC recurrence? But does it make sense that after 28 years, there would be a LOCAL recurrence? She had Mastectomy 28 years ago, no recurrence since, although marker has been rising very slowly from low 30's to 50 over 8-9 years, dr said its just her new normal. I'm confused, a little scared, hoping its just lymph node inflamation resulting from lung collapse, and hoping the 3mm nodule on lung is nothing, i know they are pretty common and that is very small. Or maybe its just wishful thinking. Seeing Dr later this week, guessing he might want to biopsy lymph node if its reachable. Any thoughts appreciated. We've been through so much, and thought we were done for a while. now this. I know this isnt a breast or Ovarian cancer forum, but the BC and OC forums here are pretty inactive, and we've all had experiences. PS. AT this point, i dont even care to retest my PSA which was wrongly tested with standard test.",

I don\u2019t remember the limit if detectionfir Auxumin, but I think i recall reading it to be 1.0 or 5.0, either way, it would work for you at least inregards to your PSA. With that said, and I\u2019m no expert, itvwould seem to me, that with a PSA of 10, it\u2019s unlikely that it\u2019s a node or two, or a spot or two, that could be radiated, it would probably be multiple mets that would require systemic therapy. But others, like Djin Tonic, Another, Allmo, Micheal F et al, will probably chime in, they know more",

This is with a G7 (3+4) SO WIth a G6, you should be comfortable with annuals, i would think. On the other hand, if you prefer to be cautious, get it done at six month intervals",

I would think though, that it's done at all of the major NCCN Cancer Centers like MSKCC, Cleveland Clinic, etc, so probably available within 500-1000 miles of most. Being in the NYC area, I know of at least 3 surgeons who do it. Like I said though, it's no fun, very complicated and SEs are more severe Regarding the 5o% success rate, I have not researched this, as I said, it's a stat that was told to me by the RO at MSKCC, chief of RAd Oncology, at one of their suburban complexes. He could be wrong, and frankly, I sure hope he is. I should probably mention, that while I've learned so much in the last few weeks (not by choice) from this and other forums, reading studies n pubmed, and reading 2 going on 3 books, I'm far from an expert.

I would think though, that it's done at all of the major NCCN Cancer Centers like MSKCC, Cleveland Clinic, etc, so probably available within 500-1000 miles of most. Being in the NYC area, I know of at least 3 surgeons who do it. Like I said though, it's no fun, very complicated and SEs are more severe Regarding the 5o% success rate, I have not researched this, as I said, it's a stat that was told to me by the RO at MSKCC, chief of RAd Oncology, at one of their suburban complexes. He could be wrong, and frankly, I sure hope he is. I should probably mention, that while I've learned so much in the last few weeks (not by choice) from this and other forums, reading studies n pubmed, and reading 2 going on 3 books, I'm far from an expert. So everything I say should be taken as opinion, not fact",

      "Content": "I would like to correct a fallacy that's been stated here a number of times.. It is incorrect to say that surgery cannot be done after radiation. There are surgeons who do it, and some specialize in it. For example. The surgeons at MSKCC do it. Specifically, Dr James Eastham, you can go to his website and see that it's an area that he specializes in. It is clearly more difficult after radiation, and side effects Alan be more severe, but it can be done. Called Salvage surgery. I discussed this with my RO, in our consult. Also, there are other alternatives if brachybor EBRT fail, such as cryosurgery, and other treatments . So to say surgery is not an option after radiation is not correct. It's not as straightforward , but can be and is, done. Also, in my consult with the RO at MSKCC, he explained that salvage radiation, after failed surgery, is only successful 50% of the time.",

      "Content": "Thanks for your comments Jim. Regarding having to travel for salvage surgery, that's probably correct. I would think though, that it's done at all of the major NCCN Cancer Centers like MSKCC, Cleveland Clinic, etc, so probably available within 500-1000 miles of most. Being in the NYC area, I know of at least 3 surgeons who do it. Like I said though, it's no fun, very complicated and SEs are more severe Regarding the 5o% success rate, I have not researched this, as I said, it's a stat that was told to me by the RO at MSKCC, chief of RAd Oncology, at one of their suburban complexes. He could be wrong, and frankly, I sure hope he is. I should probably mention, that while I've learned so much in the last few weeks (not by choice) from this and other forums, reading studies n pubmed, and reading 2 going on 3 books, I'm far from an expert. So everything I say should be taken as opinion, not fact",

      "Content": "Mike I think you are spot on. Most, not all, guys who've had a good outcome, with no recurrence, no side effects, tend to hang around for a few months, or a year or two, after treatment, then they move on. There are those however, and I've seen a number of them, do hang around for a long time, or at least drop in every now and then, to pay it forward, and help the new guys. This is something I've brought up, and has been discussed, on another forum I am on. And it's funny you brought this up, I was on that forum last night and saying to myself, how is it that PC is so often referred to as the \"good\" cancer (which I hate), when there re so many guys here who have or are recurring? But I knew the answer, and you just gave it. Selective bias.",

With no sign of recurrence. In my dream I didn't have a result of the January upcoming PSA, but my readings up till now have all been zero's, and the Dr has told me I've gotten a less than 5% chance of needing any additional treatments. And even if I did have a rise in PSA in January, he would want a retest before recommending treatment. In my dream, I started looking for a Medical Oncologist for a second opinion. It was so realistic, that it spooked me. I remember that yesterday, in another forum, I read of 2 guys with my post surgical Gleason and negative margins, that had a recurrence. I'm sure that's what precipitated this. I'm stating to think I'm spending too much time on prostate cancer Internet forums.",

And yup, when it's not a good outcome, it sticks in my craw. I notice them much more than I notice the good outcomes. I guess another thing to keep in mind is that larger percentage of the good outcomes tend to disappear from the forums, while the ones who have less favorable outcomes are the ones that tend to stick around.

PSA has been slowly trending up last few years, from .7 in 2006 to 2.8 today. 6 months ago, at 2.2, biopsy was done and negative for PCa but positive for HI Grade PIN, in one core of 14. At todays visit, i was told of the 2.8 PSA, which Doc said he wouldn;t consider a significant rise (although it seems to me that it reconfirms the trend). But i was also told that Free PSA was 11 (i assume 11%). So my question is - how much do i need to worry? What are the chances that this is the beginning of my joining the club? Doc did a PCa3 today and ordered an MRI of prostate. Ugh. Here we go again.",

I've been taking it every other day, but I am probably going to stop as I think I'm getting a grip. Some depression is common even after surgery, depending on a persons makeup. I am a glass half empty type, but I am going to try to fight it off by speaking with others who've gone thru it. I don't think anti depressant drugs can be good for you, but would take them if absolutely necessary. I'd rather take an occasional Xanax as needed. JMHO",

      "Content": "Welcome lismil . You've gotten good advice above, and your question has been answered. I'll add that in the case of gynelogic cancers, it's different. Gynecologists are not as experienced in radical surgeries, and treating gyn cancers is very complex surgery, my wife just recently finished frontline treatment and surgery for ovarian cancer with a gyn onc, which has shown to have better outcomes than being treated by a gynecologist. Re your husband... I would normally say, first thing is to send the biopsy slides for a second opinion. But with so many positive cores, even if it's downgraded to Gleason 6, he'd still need treatment, so i don't think is necessary to do that. Chuck is correct, if you do surgery, 300 is about where the learning curve flattens out, according to studies. Still, I would want more experience. At the time of my surgery, my Dr had done about 4000 robotic prostatectomies. Among your list of questions for interviewing Surgeons, are How many ops have you done (using the method you recommend) What is your rate of positive surgical margins What is your rate of full recovery of continence? And erectile function? What are my chances of ACHIEVING THOSE TWO GOALS Do you do frozen section of intra-operative margins during surgery, to increase the chance of attaining negative margins? Should I hve n MRI to determine the chances that the OC might hve escaped the capsule? You should also interview MULTIPLE RO's who specialize in different forms of radiation therapy as primary treatment. Brachytherapy, both LDR (seeds) and HDR, the newer form of Brachy that is showing good results. And take a close look at SBRT, AKA Cyberknife, which is showing excellent results 9 years after it became approved. The more you know, the better informed decision you will make. And it's up to you guys to be your own advocate. Never forget that this is big business , and urologists like to cut, while radiation oncologists like to burn. If you do your due diligence, you'll never look back and say woulda shoulda coulda, because you'll know you've made an informed decision. Good luck and keep us posted",

I guess another thing to keep in mind is that larger percentage of the good outcomes tend to disappear from the forums, while the ones who have less favorable outcomes are the ones that tend to stick around.

But i did take a Xanax before i left the house to go to the dr. and then another when i got to the waiting room, no doubt that helped. But as was already stated, the waiting was the harder part for me. I was a basket case for a week leading up to the biopsy, not knowing what to expect, and then after about a day or two of feeling relieved that it was over, i was a basket case again for 10 days waiting for the results.",

And yup, when it's not a good outcome, it sticks in my craw. I notice them much more than I notice the good outcomes. I guess another thing to keep in mind is that larger percentage of the good outcomes tend to disappear from the forums, while the ones who have less favorable outcomes are the ones that tend to stick around. It's a tough mind game that we tend to play with our own brains.",

      "Content": "Hi Chuck - thanks for the reply. Not meaning to be redundant posting on both forums but i am sure there are some folks that are on one forum or another and trying to get as much perspective as I can, being the worry wart that i am..... To answer your Q's, I am age 62, never had anything but a normal DRE. On this visit, the doc did what i would call the most vigorous DRE that i have ever had, i almost pee'd. I believe this was partly because he was doing the PCA3 right after that, which required such a DRE. After the DRE, he told me that it was totally normal, no nodules, no firmness. As far as BPH, in my TRUS biopsy 5 months ago they measured the prostate and it was 38 CCs, the biopsy report said there was some BPH, the Doc said there was, but it wasn't very bad, pretty much \"normal for my age\". Thanks for the info and article. i know the slow rise in Total PSA could be caused by mild BPH its the 11% Free PSA that is making me nervous.",

      "Content": "More good news. I had my slides sent to Johns Hopkins/Dr Epstein for a second opinion. He downgraded my G8 to a G6. So I am now G6 10%, G6 20% AND G6 80%. Changes things quite a bit. I actually got to speak to Dr Epstein, and he was very emphatic that it was a G6 and that I had months to decide on how to proceed. He also commented that I would be a very good candidate for surgery. So all in all, in the context of my \"new world\" I finally had a great day. I am still bummed that I have PC, but its now something I an handle. BTW the call of the G8 being a G6, was not based on a subjective eyeballing of the cells. It was based on his disagreeing with the premise noted in the original path report, used in the g8 call. Complicated to expain, but clear to me. I asked Dr Epstein to confirm that my understanding of this was correct, and he agreed.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by lzicc That is great news. Please keep us updated. What is the next step now? Izicc, next step is final decision on treatment. I am heavily leaning towards surgery, but will meet with all disciplines and listen with an open mind. Unfortunately everyone is a salesman and I've learned that PC is a big business, so I will listen more to other patients that I speak to (I know a lot of people who've had the surgery, and also do my own research on the numbers. I've met with one surgeon, have an appointment with another this week. Both high profile guys. The one I met with was very arrogant, but at the same time seemed confident and caring, and his staff seems terrific, called me back when I had additional questions. Also meeting this week with my Uro whom I have not spoken to since he called me on the biopsy results, to discuss all options. Pretty sure he is going to push me towards Cyberknife, and meeting with his RO. I will meet with his RO BUT ALSO WANT TO SEE if I can get an appointment with a surgeon and an RO at MSKCC, as well as a surgeon that was recommended to me at Cornell-Weill, who I was told will give me an honest assessment of what my best option is, even if he thinks it's not surgery. As you can see I'm very skeptical of them all. I need to find on I trust. I have an appointment with a surgeon in my suburban area as well, but may cancel. He did a friend of mine who was very happy with him, but I don't know, I feel like I want to be in a major Manhattan hospital setting, don't know if that has any validity.",

That is one of my concerns , the apex is where there is the highest chance of positive margins and escape from capsule, as well as making it difficult to save the nerves. So if I am reading your signature block correctly that's fantastic. I have one core in the apex which is 80% G6.

At the very least, ask your urologist to do a PHI Blood test which is a more advanced and better test than PSA. Or ask for a free psa and PCA3. Then go from there.

And there is no doubt, that your son would not want you to delay, because you need to be around to see his grandchildren",

      "Content": "Since the surgery is next week, i\u0092d Say the one thing he should do if he hasn\u0092t done it already, is start kegels. As far as after surgery First make sure you have all the supplies you need. If you have a recliner, position it in front of the tv. And if you don\u0092t, rent one. Get an oval bucket to Carry the catheter around in, depends briefs, get a chuck to cover the bed just in case he leaks while sleeping. Get some ky jelly to keep the tip of his penis lubricayed where the catheter goes in. Gauze and surgical tape, for changing the dressing where the drain was. Get some sweatpants that have button down sides if you can find them, to accommodate the leg bag/catheter. You\u0092ll need a laxative, like Dolcolax, but the Drs office will tell you what kind they prefer. The hospital will probably have him up and walking the day or night if the surgery. If they don\u0092t then bug them. It\u0092s important to start moving ASAP. Laps around the hospital floor. And when he gets home, walk as much as possible, even if it\u0092s just around the house. It\u0092s the most important thing. Walk walk walk. They will pump gas/air into his abdomen to widen the field in which they work. For this reason, he may have gas pains. I had it really bad for a week, if I wasn\u0092t told to expect it, I would have thought I was having a heart attack. But many others have less of a problem. Anyway, the way to get rid of the gas AND get his bowls moving or at least get him farting again, is to walk as much as possible. I was doing a mile a day on the treadmill with the catheter still in at the end of the first week (walking slowly, not running lol) Others will be along with all the things I forgot. Good luck, keep us posted.",

      "Content": "I would agree with Chuck, dont wait. Most important, you need to get to the bottom of what caused all that blood to come from your Urethra. Prostate cancer isnt usually a rush to treat kind of situation. But with that said, there is no reason to delay and find yourself behind the 8 ball. At the very least, ask your urologist to do a PHI Blood test which is a more advanced and better test than PSA. Or ask for a free psa and PCA3. Then go from there. Those tests will give you a better idea of whether you are dealing with PC. I have a feeling you are not. But what do i know. As far as the wedding, i empathize.

My understanding is that a saturation biopsy is still a blind biopsy, but with many more cores, so we are playing with and increasing our odds. Vs an MRI guided which, from my understanding will give you a 90% + chance of finding anything that is hi gleason cancer. Which is more of a concern that G6. So why go through the (I assume) added pain of a saturation biopsy if you can accomplish at least the same thing with an MRI guided and less cores. anyone PLEASE CORRECT ME IF I AM WRONG, OR MISINFORMED.",

Prostate cancer isnt usually a rush to treat kind of situation. But with that said, there is no reason to delay and find yourself behind the 8 ball. At the very least, ask your urologist to do a PHI Blood test which is a more advanced and better test than PSA. Or ask for a free psa and PCA3. Then go from there. Those tests will give you a better idea of whether you are dealing with PC. I have a feeling you are not. But what do i know. As far as the wedding, i empathize. My wife was diagnosed in September with Ovarian Cancer, and my daughter is getting married a week from tomorrow. She had to go through surgery and 18 weeks of chemo (which she has 4 weeks left) but shes doing well, and feeling great, ready to party. These things have a way of working themselves out. And there is no doubt, that your son would not want you to delay, because you need to be around to see his grandchildren",

      "Content": "Hi Chuck, I probably mis-stated what I intended to mean. I think they would be equally effective at finding any high grade cancer. My understanding is that a saturation biopsy is still a blind biopsy, but with many more cores, so we are playing with and increasing our odds. Vs an MRI guided which, from my understanding will give you a 90% + chance of finding anything that is hi gleason cancer. Which is more of a concern that G6. So why go through the (I assume) added pain of a saturation biopsy if you can accomplish at least the same thing with an MRI guided and less cores. anyone PLEASE CORRECT ME IF I AM WRONG, OR MISINFORMED.",

      "Content": "Felix, I think the second part for your statement is sort of correct, getting an immediate drop (hopefully) in PSA is a big reason that people choose surgery. It was a consideration for me. The first part though, is not so. If the Cancer has a high chance of not being organ confined, (which is blessed assessed with a 3 Tesla mpMRI ) then it might steer many away from surgery. On the other hand , if there is evidence of a lot of Cancer in the Prostate, there are some who think surgery is worthwhile, not to cure the Cancer but yo debulk it. This would be followed by additional therapy, hormone therapy, radiation etc, depending on the specific circumstances. There are many factors that go into deciding on surgery, including age and physical health, how the patient feels about side effects, which are different, sometimes more severe with surgery vs radiation., etc Did you get a second opinion on the slides? This is something you should do as a first step, with a lab / that specializes in Prostate cell pathology, like dr Epatein and Johns Hopkins , or David Bostwick, at bostwic laboratories. I don't knwo of any website that posts collectively, the data you are looking for.",

No pain just a little annoying during the procedure, and after the procedure i had some discomfort up my butt, but that seems to be subsiding. I am confused about something, and it is concerning me, i am hoping someone can shed some light. He did a DRE, before he started the procedure, that was fine. I asked him about the ultrasound, if it showed anything, and he said no, everything looked 'pretty much\" normal. Of course i asked him what pretty much meant and he just said it looked fine, no abnormalities. But what i forgot to ask, was the size. So i called his office on the way home, and got a call back from the nurse. She told me the size was 22. I assume she meant CCs. She said he marked the report \"normal size\". This concerns me for two reasons. 1. if its normal size, that lowers the chance of BPH raising my PSA. (although with a %fPSA of 12 and a Total of 4.3 and PCA3 of 26, maybe thats irrelevant) 2. AND THIS IS WHATS REALLY CONCERNING AND CONFUSING - I looked at my path report from my last biopsy 2 years ago, and it showed a size of 38 CCs. How can this hapen? Can a prostate shrink by 40% from age 62, to 64, with no medication? 3. I read that studies have been done showing that smaller prostates tend to have higher gleason scores and higher chances of being out of the prostate, on post RP inspection. Can anyone comment on these issues? Especially the 2nd? Its just made me more frantic The other thing is, he told me to call him in a week for results. After thinking about it, with a high possibility of cancer (he told me, north of 50%, in response to my asking him) i think i would rather get the results in a face to face meeting. Would it be inappropriate to call tomorrow and ask for a meeting to get the results despite what he told me?",

AND THIS IS WHATS REALLY CONCERNING AND CONFUSING - I looked at my path report from my last biopsy 2 years ago, and it showed a size of 38 CCs. How can this hapen? Can a prostate shrink by 40% from age 62, to 64, with no medication? 3. I read that studies have been done showing that smaller prostates tend to have higher gleason scores and higher chances of being out of the prostate, on post RP inspection. Can anyone comment on these issues? Especially the 2nd? Its just made me more frantic The other thing is, he told me to call him in a week for results. After thinking about it, with a high possibility of cancer (he told me, north of 50%, in response to my asking him) i think i would rather get the results in a face to face meeting. Would it be inappropriate to call tomorrow and ask for a meeting to get the results despite what he told me?",

      "Content": "Thanks Newporter. That would make more sense. From 38 CCs to 32ccs could just be a variation in the machine. And if my prostate was 22ccs, which is low end of normal size, I would still be pissing like a racehorse, which I don't anymore. So your comment makes a lot of sense. Oh, I said that already... I'm not losing my mind or anything, while on biopsy watch. Now that you've relieved my cncern about Prostate size, I can go back to freaking out about the 6 month rise in my PSA from 3.1 to 4.3. If you have anything on that item that might make me feel better I'd appreciate hearing it, because I'm all but convinced that it means a Gleason 9 . Seriously, it's gonna be hard getting thru this weekend. And thanks for the good luck wishes.",

I can tell you that I had surgery 8 months ago, and all is well, and while some are not as lucky when it comes to side effects, but these days the odds are with you, as long as you have a competent, experienced surgeon. As far as the cance goes, with a G6 the odds ore OVERWHELMINGLY with you. I know of many guys who've had great results with the various modern forms of radiation as well. So the best thing I can tell you, is there is life after Prostate Cancer. You'll get through this fine, and at some point, it will likely be a distant memory. Educate yourself, look at all of your options, including Active Surviellance, and make an educated decision as to how to move forward. Then don't look back. And stick around here, it's a great group, you'll get plenty of support.",

Prostate cancer isnt usually a rush to treat kind of situation. But with that said, there is no reason to delay and find yourself behind the 8 ball. At the very least, ask your urologist to do a PHI Blood test which is a more advanced and better test than PSA. Or ask for a free psa and PCA3. Then go from there. Those tests will give you a better idea of whether you are dealing with PC. I have a feeling you are not. But what do i know. As far as the wedding, i empathize. My wife was diagnosed in September with Ovarian Cancer, and my daughter is getting married a week from tomorrow. She had to go through surgery and 18 weeks of chemo (which she has 4 weeks left) but shes doing well, and feeling great, ready to party. These things have a way of working themselves out. And there is no doubt, that your son would not want you to delay, because you need to be around to see his grandchildren",

      "Content": "I would agree with Chuck, dont wait. Most important, you need to get to the bottom of what caused all that blood to come from your Urethra. Prostate cancer isnt usually a rush to treat kind of situation. But with that said, there is no reason to delay and find yourself behind the 8 ball. At the very least, ask your urologist to do a PHI Blood test which is a more advanced and better test than PSA. Or ask for a free psa and PCA3. Then go from there. Those tests will give you a better idea of whether you are dealing with PC. I have a feeling you are not. But what do i know. As far as the wedding, i empathize. My wife was diagnosed in September with Ovarian Cancer, and my daughter is getting married a week from tomorrow. She had to go through surgery and 18 weeks of chemo (which she has 4 weeks left) but shes doing well, and feeling great, ready to party. These things have a way of working themselves out. And there is no doubt, that your son would not want you to delay, because you need to be around to see his grandchildren",

      "Content": "Thanks Newporter. That would make more sense. From 38 CCs to 32ccs could just be a variation in the machine. And if my prostate was 22ccs, which is low end of normal size, I would still be pissing like a racehorse, which I don't anymore. So your comment makes a lot of sense. Oh, I said that already... I'm not losing my mind or anything, while on biopsy watch. Now that you've relieved my cncern about Prostate size, I can go back to freaking out about the 6 month rise in my PSA from 3.1 to 4.3. If you have anything on that item that might make me feel better I'd appreciate hearing it, because I'm all but convinced that it means a Gleason 9 . Seriously, it's gonna be hard getting thru this weekend. And thanks for the good luck wishes.",

One thing that's weird is that 3 times in the last 7 months (which is how long I've been fully continent) I've woken up to find I seriously pissed while sleeping. Last time it happened was about 7 weeks ago. Don't understand why that happens. Last night I slept 7 straight hours. My bladder felt like it was about to burst when I woke up, but I had no problem. Re kegels, I'm still doing them 4-5 sets a day, 10 reps per set. This thread is making me wonder whether I should just slack off a bit, either cut down to 3 sets a day, or maybe every other day",

I was pretty down after surgery, for a couple of months, and I didn't have those complications. So I would say it's pretty normal to feel the way you do. But it will pass. Eventually, all the complications will be resolved, you will FULLY recover, and move on with your life. PC will always be in the back of our minds, but over time, it will recede really deep into the back.and only surface around PSA time. So hang in there, and yeah, you need to be patient, so I guess, learn a. New skill - being patient LOL. Seriously, I'm just like you, a young active 64, so I understand. As far as PSA goes, with a 3+4, even with a small focal margin, your odds are good of joining the undetectable club, good luck at your Dr visit and hang in there.",

I was pretty down after surgery, for a couple of months, and I didn't have those complications. So I would say it's pretty normal to feel the way you do. But it will pass. Eventually, all the complications will be resolved, you will FULLY recover, and move on with your life. PC will always be in the back of our minds, but over time, it will recede really deep into the back.and only surface around PSA time. So hang in there, and yeah, you need to be patient, so I guess, learn a. New skill - being patient LOL. Seriously, I'm just like you, a young active 64, so I understand. As far as PSA goes, with a 3+4, even with a small focal margin, your odds are good of joining the undetectable club, good luck at your Dr visit and hang in there.",

I can tell you that I had surgery 8 months ago, and all is well, and while some are not as lucky when it comes to side effects, but these days the odds are with you, as long as you have a competent, experienced surgeon. As far as the cance goes, with a G6 the odds ore OVERWHELMINGLY with you. I know of many guys who've had great results with the various modern forms of radiation as well. So the best thing I can tell you, is there is life after Prostate Cancer. You'll get through this fine, and at some point, it will likely be a distant memory. Educate yourself, look at all of your options, including Active Surviellance, and make an educated decision as to how to move forward. Then don't look back. And stick around here, it's a great group, you'll get plenty of support.",

      "Content": "Mikek - yes you are definitely getting ahead of yourself. Wait for the biopsy. And if it does come back positive (which i believe it very possibly WILL NOT, considering your almost non existent PSA), you should look at all options, surgery, Brachytherapy (seeds), and other possible treatment options, like SBRT ,Proton, etc. Do this so that you can go into whatever treatment you decide on, with a clear head, knowing that you did your homework, this way, you will never look back and wonder if you made a good decision With that said, if you do end up needing a surgeon, in NYC, i used Dr Ash Tewari. Very well known, highly regarded, Chief of Urology at Mount Sinai, and has done over 6000 RALP's. My results were very good, no ED, no incontinence after week 4 or 5 (dont remember exactly, but it was def within that time frame), negative margins, no escape from Prostate, and so far, undetectable PSA. But seriously, wait for the biopsy results, you are way ahead of yourself. Good luck",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by Michael F Prato: Chill way down........this stress will be bad for your overall health. Stay focussed on the fact that you are in the care of a top URO Surgeon and have seen a top RO. Regardless of 0.1 or 0.07, you are not near that level. The 0.033 from a different lab may well be an outlier data value. A friend of mine (intact prostate) recently had his annual MD exam. All was well EXCEPT his PSA (run at LabCorp) came back 10.0 It had never been > 2.0 His MD had it retested at Quest and it was < 2.0. (Not sure why his MD didn't ask LabCorp to re-run the sample?!?!?) Anyway, he had some unnecessary anxiety for a few days due to lab error. Enjoy the summer and don't even think about uPSAs until after Labor Day! MF Michael, I'm with you, as i said, i am not as frazzled as it may appear. It will be on my mind, can't help that, but I'm not crazed about it. I will be the week of my next PSA but not until then. Re lab error, i know, i had a similar situation. After being undetectable <.02 for a year, i had my 3 month test and it came back 3.8 !!!!! They wouldn't retest without the request coming from the Dr, but i just went to the Drs office and had him test at his lab, it came back <.02. I contacted Quest and made a lot of noise. I got a call from the Senior VP of Oncology Testing and Development, who told me they redid the test multiple times, all came back undetectable they couldn';t reproduce the 3.8 result. They checked the machines, they spoke to the technicians and he told me he was sorry but they could not come up with an explanation for the error. I know what the explanation was, some idiot doing input gave me some poor shmucks results and he got mine. So he was walking around thinking he was undetectable, and i was ready to jump off the Brooklyn Bridge. Never went to Quest again for PSA, since then",

At my worst, i went through 2 pads a day, that lasted about a week or two (dont remember, and i'm happy about that), and was wearing nothing within 5 weeks. But i do have a friend who was fully continent from almost the moment that the catheter was pulled out, so indeed, its possible, and congratulations to you. Re the golf thing - i was worried about the same thing. I played golf for the first time about 5 months after surgery. Lo and behold, i gripped it, and ripped it, but i didnt drip it at all. I thought about wearing a shield just in case, but decided to be brave and i walked off the 18th green dry as a bone. I didnt even pee until the 5th hole, then went into the woods twice after that. That was truly a great day for me.",

      "Content": "I am on so many damn forums i dont remember what i post from one forum to the next any more, so i'll start from the beginning here.... So after 2 years of undetectable <.02, at my two year mark last January i got a .02 result, without the <. Then on May 26th, i got a .033 (different lab). My Uro/Surgeon, Dr Tewari, said not to worry, they dont do anything until it hits .1, and i may just be seeing noise Being the nutjob that i am, i couldn't leave it alone, so i made an appointment with Dr Zelefsky at MSKCC, the rock star RO for Prostate Cancer. I just wanted his take. so i'll paste below what i posted elsewhere, just to save time. Apologies to those who've seen this elsewhere. So i had my meeting with Dr Zelefsky, it was pretty much what i expected. I think the most important thing that i accomplished was establishing myself as a patient in his office, so that if and when i do need SRT, i will hit the ground running. So his basic comment on my situation was that he thinks its possible that i am recurring (nothing i didnt know) but he wouldn't go so far as to say that its probable, YET. He wants to see a series of rises, and right now my PSA is too low, and only one rise, after the first one. He said that he is not a believer in the magic number being .1 for starting treatment. If he sees 3-4 rises in a row, and I'm .07, he will likely recommend we get started. Regarding my \"How the F does this happen with my pathology?\" rant, he commented that while i had negative margins, the fact that i had a positive frozen section, that was then turned into a negative FINAL margin, tells him that my negative margins could be \"questionable\" Regarding HT in conjunction with SRT, my impression was, probably not, but that could change. He was sort of non commital, he said that generally they use HT with SRT with higher PSA's (Not sure if he was referring to my presurgery PSA of 4.3, or the fact that we are on it currently and would hit it early, if it kept going up. But he also said, there are ongoing studies in this regard. I told him i was surprised that the nomograms showed that my chance of success was 53% without HT, but 73% with HT. He commented that he doesnt put a lot of faith in the nomograms, because for example, its only a small number of men in the database that have the same exact stats as me, same G, same pathology, same PSA, etc. So its not that meaningfrul to an individual The one action item he suggested is that i get an MRI in the next month or so, to have as a baseline . Which i will do. Aside from that , he suggested i continue to be followed by Dr Tewari, my surgeon, who he spoke very highly of, and that we keep an eye on things, and another couple of rises, i should come back and see him. Oh, and he did a DRE, which he said felt \"smooth\" and unremarkable (my word). Dayum, i thoughti was done with that SH!T!!!!! He didnt do a PSA though. So i guess nothing more to do but retest as scheduled in August, and otherwise just sit back and relax. And continue to worry I'm nervous that at the current rate, two more PSA's take me to November and if they both rise, i will need treatment in January, which will screw up my plan to spend the winter at my new home in Florida. That would REALLY SUCK. Ok, now i'm just venting, so I'll stop.",

      "Content": "Struggling with this decision. G 6 3/12 cores positive, one or two (not sure) in right apex, all pos cores on 1 side. Age64, good physical condition. Very nervous type. All scientific data shows results are same both ways, 95% cure rate in my situation, either tx. SEs less with Brachy, although some show up years later in small %. But clearly less trauma to body. Advantage of surgery, quick drop in PSA vs slow fall with Brachy,along with possible bounces along the way (remember I'm nervous type of personality). Other advantage is final pathology? That would be good for me mentally, if it's good news, but either way, would it affect my Tx? I don't buy into the idea that surgery not an option if Brachy fails. You can do salvage surgery, it's done at MSKCC m although I probably wouldn't do it, too difficult. But there is Cryo ablation, HT, Chemo, and other types of radiation. So logically it seems Brachy might make more sense, but my gut tells me cut it out. With either option, I have Drs lined up whom I've consulted on surgery and one who I would be referred to on Brachy, who are both rock stars in their worlds. I've read all the studies. I've talked to patients who've gone thru both. It seems not only are Drs biased towards their own specialty, but so are patients biased towards what the chose. I'm Very conflicted.

      "Content": "The numbers by themselves dont look so great, fPSA of 12% is not a good number, neither is PSA 8.3. With that said, the jump from 3.9 to 8.3 in a short time (ignoring the first reading of 8.4) leads me to ask - has he been given a course of Cipro - antibiotic to see if it brings the the PSA down, which would be a sign that the problem might be a prostate infection, a fairly common cause of elevated PSA. Another thought - if you dont ignore the first reading of 8.4, and compare it to the current 8.3, you could consider his PSA stable. On the other hand, the meds he is taking for BPH might, i mean MIGHT, be lowering, i.e. masking, his PSA, so in reality it might be higher. I'm not that sure about the last point on meds, but others more knowledgeable will surely chime in, so keep checking back. At the end of the day though, i think you have to go with the Drs suggestion that due to the recent colonoscopy, hemmerroid repair, etc, he should wait. The biopsy needles go through the colon wall, so i am sure there is good reason for the Drs suggestion. You might want to let him know that you guys want the biopsy done as soon as is safely possible (assuming your husband agrees). Good luck, and keep us posted.",

But I know he has some sort of process for doing the surgery that is low tension (whatever that means) and avoids heat being applied to the urethra He told me to not even think about incontinence, that while it may not happen immediately, it won't be an issue. Regarding the ED, i asked him what he considered success in that department, he responded by saying \" full erection, sufficient to achieve penetration. Good enough for me. Dunno, spteh idea of surgery just \"feels\" better to me. Maybe it's not logical.",

      "Content": "Struggling with this decision. G 6 3/12 cores positive, one or two (not sure) in right apex, all pos cores on 1 side. Age64, good physical condition. Very nervous type. All scientific data shows results are same both ways, 95% cure rate in my situation, either tx. SEs less with Brachy, although some show up years later in small %. But clearly less trauma to body. Advantage of surgery, quick drop in PSA vs slow fall with Brachy,along with possible bounces along the way (remember I'm nervous type of personality). Other advantage is final pathology? That would be good for me mentally, if it's good news, but either way, would it affect my Tx? I don't buy into the idea that surgery not an option if Brachy fails. You can do salvage surgery, it's done at MSKCC m although I probably wouldn't do it, too difficult. But there is Cryo ablation, HT, Chemo, and other types of radiation. So logically it seems Brachy might make more sense, but my gut tells me cut it out. With either option, I have Drs lined up whom I've consulted on surgery and one who I would be referred to on Brachy, who are both rock stars in their worlds. I've read all the studies. I've talked to patients who've gone thru both. It seems not only are Drs biased towards their own specialty, but so are patients biased towards what the chose. I'm Very conflicted.

      "Content": "WW, I am a little hesitant to answer, as I'm no expert on Chemo. But I'll take a stab at it with that understanding. My understanding is that Hormone Therapy can easily put one into remission, and wipe out all evidence of cancer on. bone scan. However two things to keep in mind 1. Unfortunately, even if the scan shows nothing it does not rule out the possibility, that there are PC cells circulating in the blood or lymph system, or that there could be mets too small to be seen on the scan (micro mets) that are being controlled by the HT (and Chemo) 2. PC cells can, over time, become Hormone Resistant. I think, but I'm not sure, that it's the same thing for Chemo. It could be months before that happens, BUT it can also be many many years. So I would take the great news for what it is, great news. Hopefully it lasts a long long time, and allows for a really good quality of life for a decade or more. If something changes, deal with it then. (I know, easy to say, hard to do) Someone please correct me if I'm wrong, as I said, I'm not an expert in treatments beyond primary treatment.",

      "Content": "I had an issue with my Uro, in terms of communications, after a biopsy (issue in my mind, not his) that has been resolved, in that i had the conversation i needed to have, but after more time had passed than i wanted to. Spoke to a friend who is the head administrator at a major cancer center. Asked him his opinion. His response was that not getting to a doc when you felt you needed to have a conversation was very common at major centers, particularly teaching hospitals, as they are always busy, not only with patients, but with research, teaching, etc. But that the quality of the docs and care, often superior. So if you think you have a doc who knows his stuff, you have to weigh that with your lack of satisfaction on the service/communications side. Curious to get others thoughts on this. I think the guy is good, all i have to go on is credentials, the hospital he is associated with and practices in (he works at the hospital, not private practice), and the good experience i had in him doing the biopsy (very little blood afterwards, careful about respecting my fear of pain, and not causing a lot of pain). So i assume he is top notch. But like i said, it was hard to get to him after the (negative) biopsy, which when i spoke to him i found out, showed 1 core of HG PIN. Sometimes i think maybe i should find a more local practice, via a referral (someone i have in mind, who a friend had RP DaVinci with and was very happy). Like i said, i would be curious to hear what approach some of you would take to this decision.",

Knowing that my friends Uro is close in proximity to me, compared to Columbia, where my Uro practices, along with my friends very positive result, and the fact that his Uro actually put him out completely for the biopsy, tempts me to go to him. But i think every case is different, and i have to start to build a history with whomever i work with. So i think i will probably stay with my current (new) uro. No rush i guess, there is really nothing more to do until May, when i need to see him again and get PSA done.",

      "Content": "Sorry about your dad. G10 is tough, but he can manage this disease as chronic for many many years. Established treatments can put him into remission, and as others have said, there are new treatments being approved very frequently. An example is Erleada, which has shown much promise in men who have developed a resistance to standard hormone therapy, which itself could work for years. Re PSA, 400 - yeah thats pretty high. But we've seen much higher. There is a member here who shows up once in a while, Todd1963, who was diagnosed 12 years ago with a PSA of 3200, (No typo) and he is, last i heard (very recently) in remission with a PSA that is undetectable. And he is enjoying life. He didnt have a g10 gleason score, it was g7 i think, but still it shows that even advanced cancer of the Prostate can be managed for years. Just make sure he gets to the right doctors, hopefully at a major Teaching Hospital . Regarding life insurance - doubt anyone will underwrite him now. The important thing thats already been mentioned by Michael, is that he have good health insurance. Good luck keep us posted.",

It is probably the constant nagging inside your head that finally wears you down. I also think about cancer ALL the time. I probably could never go for AS, it is just not for me. Thanks for your reply, sometimes I guess it is just good to hear that there are others with the same issues. I will now watch \"Guardians of the Galaxy\" and not think of cancer for a while. Good luck to you also! Interesting concept. I'm in the Northeast so can be pretty cold here too. I wonder at what temperature Urine freezes ?",

      "Content": "I've been on Lovaza which is a prescription drug, an dis purified fish oil/omega 3, for 4 years now, due to high triglycerides. I have had low but rising trend of PSA, for about 5 years, and was diagnosed with high grade pin last year, after a biopsy. So now i am left to wonder if there is a connections. I lost a lot of weight over the last year, and my trigycerides (Tgl) got under control. 5 MONTHS ago, i convinced doc to cut the Lovaza dose in half from 2000 to 1000 mg a day. I retested 3 months later, and my Tgl was lower still. But he wouldn;t change the medication. I am also on 2 other meds for Tgl. I've never done this before, but after this new study, I am not asking the doc, i am taking myself off the Lovaza altogether. I'll maintain my better eating habits and then go re-test the Tgl in 3 months. If its up I'll deal with it, but I'm not playing with fire if i dont have to. I dont know if this study is convincing enough or valid from a scientific point of view, but I dont want to take any chances.",

Make sure the slides are sent to a pathology dept that specializes in prostate cells. You should use either Dr JOn Epstein at Johns Hopkins or David Boatwick, at Bostwick Labs. Prostate is all they do and they are the foremost experts. If the G6 holds, you can possibly do AS. This doesn't mean just watch and wait. It means what it says ACTIVE Surveillance. YOU WANT TO GET Ainto a structured program, with preset protocols for regular PSA checks, biopsies, and MRI. I could be wrong, but I think Johns Hopkins which is one of the more stringent as to guidelines for AS, would not accept you into their program due to cancer in both lobes.

      "Content": "Originally Posted by Michael F Hi Pratoman! At least be very pleased with the fact that your missing \"<\" has returned!!! Now a decimal point has gone AWOL! Try to loosen up & laugh at this crazy situation! You simply can't win at getting a correct post RP uPSA. I recall the horrible scare you had when the Quest uPSA was erroneously reported to be \"3.something\" Sorry for this latest SNAFU but remain confident that you will get is straightened out. I'm sure that my Forum Family is tired of my constant \"Same Lab Same uPSA Methodology\" & \"Get a Copy of The Original Lab Report\" mantras! But yours is a case where your Lab switched from Quest to LabCorp and you would have never known this except for the fact that your latest PSA result was from a \"Standard\" PSA Assay. Had they run a uPSA, your LabCorp result could not be compared (to detect a change) to your previous Quest uPSA result. Double check if your Jan & Feb uPSAs were done by LabCorp (or ask when LabCorp bought your current lab). Same thing happened at my local hospital lab where I have my uPSAs drawn. I always ask the phlebotomist to show me the Lab requisition sheet that has my name and the \"exact\" uPSA test before I'll allow them to draw the blood sample. LabCorp picks up from the hospital and the sample is run in their Birmingham, AL facility each time. FYI: I am \"permanently married\" to: LabCorp Test Number: 140731 = Prostate-specific Antigen (PSA), Ultrasensitive This must be on my requisition sheet. My \"co-pay\" is $12. Good luck in quickly getting back BOTH your missing < & your 2nd Decimal! I am certain that you will find both of them huddled closely together on your next uPSA Lab report! Hang in there & Good Luck my friend! MF Michael, just to claify. I haven't had my PSA done at Quest since that one time tht they screwed it up and it came back at 3.8. I'll never use them for PSA again unless I have no choice. My test since then has always been done at the hospital lab itself. Now, the hospital lab has been bought by labcorp. And what's messed up, to your point, is no matter what I do, I'm going to have to start all over again, with a new lab, probably new assay. So none of my future tests will relate to my past tests. UGH! my first few tests after surgery all came back at 0.00. Then, the next few came back at <.02. Yup, you guessed it, they changed the assay, I looked at the reports and compared them. Then I got the .02 three months ago, but it was the same assay. Now I get to start all over again. Oh crap",

Everyone is different, but I'm aggressive with my health, and particularly with prostate issues, if it is cancer, even though most prostate cancers grow slowly, you want to catch it early for the best shot at a one and done treatment. The fact that your PSA has actually trended down is a good sign. But better safe than sorry. And the fusion targeted biopsy is state of the art, shows you've got a very competent urologist, rrust his judgement.

      "Content": "chiguy, welcome to the forum, sorry about your diagnosis. First of all, yes, getting a second opinion is one of the most important things you can do. Make sure the slides are sent to a pathology dept that specializes in prostate cells. You should use either Dr JOn Epstein at Johns Hopkins or David Boatwick, at Bostwick Labs. Prostate is all they do and they are the foremost experts. If the G6 holds, you can possibly do AS. This doesn't mean just watch and wait. It means what it says ACTIVE Surveillance. YOU WANT TO GET Ainto a structured program, with preset protocols for regular PSA checks, biopsies, and MRI. I could be wrong, but I think Johns Hopkins which is one of the more stringent as to guidelines for AS, would not accept you into their program due to cancer in both lobes. I could be wrong, if I am, someone will correct me Besides seeds, there is other type of radiation. SBRT and its cousin Cyberknife, HDR Brachytherapy (like seeds/LDR but implants are temporary, high dose for only a few hours. And other options. Make sure you explore them all, Surgery and radiation will both likely cure you. One thing to be aware if, the advantage of surgery is confirmation of your Gleason scores. In 20-49% of cases, Gleason score is upgraded after surgery. Mine was G6 then after surgery upgraded to G7(3+4). You don't have to rush, sounds like your case is not serious. It's always scary to get a cancer diagnosis, but MOST PC is easily curable or manageable, especially G6 and g7(3+4). So the urge to \"do something\" or \"get it out\" quickly, is PROBABLY misguided although understandable. One more thing... (In before Highlander LOL). Do yourself a favor, go to Amazon and buy the book \"Surviving Prostate Cancer\" by Patrick Walsh. Make sure you get the third edition.although adbpvancements are coming so fast. That even that is outdated a bit. Also, for a different perspective (Dr Walsh is a surgeon), by the book \"Invasion of the Prostate Snatcherz\" by Dr Mark Scholz. He's a big fan of AS when appropriate. These two books will give you a balanced view. Above all, educate yourself thoroughly.Be your own advocTe. Most Drs, with good intentions , are biased towards their own specialty. Surgeons want to cut, radiation oncologists want to burn. So you need to make the decision on what's best for you Good luck, you will be ok, breathe. Ken",

So, after losing my \"<\" and going from <.02 to .02 three months ago, my test today came back and <.1.... Thats right, <.1, without any zeros. They proceed to explain to me that they did the standard test, not the uPSA this time. Why, i asked. Well, because our lab at the hospital was bought by LabCorp and they changed it. OK, I responded, but i know LabCorp does uPSA and in fact goes to 3 decimal places. The NP responds by telling me that i am correct, but the uPSA is not on their requisition list. Are you f***ing kidding me? They are working on getting the uPSA, and in the meantime, if i'd like, they can send me a scrip for a uPSA that i can get on my own from Quest (no thank you) or a local Labcorp facility. So bottom line, i know nothing, its like i never got the test. All i know is that i'm less than .1 . I could be <.02 again, or i could be stable at .02. Or i could be unstable, at .03, .05, .08 or .09. What a joke. NP said it doesnt really matter, because they wouldnt do anything till it hit .1 anyway. Guess what. I would. If it hits .05, i'm interviewing RO's. I'm sure the guys that rail against the uPSA to begin with, are gonna have a field day with this. It doesn't matter to me. Now that i've had the uPSA, and lost my <, the cats out of the bag. And i need to know. So i will discuss with the Dr (Tewari) tomorrow, after telling him i think what they did to me is idiotic because there was no reason to do the test in the first place, except to get some billing in for the month.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by Michael F Hi Pratoman! At least be very pleased with the fact that your missing \"<\" has returned!!! Now a decimal point has gone AWOL! Try to loosen up & laugh at this crazy situation! You simply can't win at getting a correct post RP uPSA. I recall the horrible scare you had when the Quest uPSA was erroneously reported to be \"3.something\" Sorry for this latest SNAFU but remain confident that you will get is straightened out. I'm sure that my Forum Family is tired of my constant \"Same Lab Same uPSA Methodology\" & \"Get a Copy of The Original Lab Report\" mantras! But yours is a case where your Lab switched from Quest to LabCorp and you would have never known this except for the fact that your latest PSA result was from a \"Standard\" PSA Assay. Had they run a uPSA, your LabCorp result could not be compared (to detect a change) to your previous Quest uPSA result. Double check if your Jan & Feb uPSAs were done by LabCorp (or ask when LabCorp bought your current lab). Same thing happened at my local hospital lab where I have my uPSAs drawn. I always ask the phlebotomist to show me the Lab requisition sheet that has my name and the \"exact\" uPSA test before I'll allow them to draw the blood sample. LabCorp picks up from the hospital and the sample is run in their Birmingham, AL facility each time. FYI: I am \"permanently married\" to: LabCorp Test Number: 140731 = Prostate-specific Antigen (PSA), Ultrasensitive This must be on my requisition sheet. My \"co-pay\" is $12. Good luck in quickly getting back BOTH your missing < & your 2nd Decimal! I am certain that you will find both of them huddled closely together on your next uPSA Lab report! Hang in there & Good Luck my friend! MF Michael, just to claify. I haven't had my PSA done at Quest since that one time tht they screwed it up and it came back at 3.8. I'll never use them for PSA again unless I have no choice. My test since then has always been done at the hospital lab itself. Now, the hospital lab has been bought by labcorp. And what's messed up, to your point, is no matter what I do, I'm going to have to start all over again, with a new lab, probably new assay. So none of my future tests will relate to my past tests. UGH! my first few tests after surgery all came back at 0.00. Then, the next few came back at <.02. Yup, you guessed it, they changed the assay, I looked at the reports and compared them. Then I got the .02 three months ago, but it was the same assay. Now I get to start all over again. Oh crap",

OK, I responded, but i know LabCorp does uPSA and in fact goes to 3 decimal places. The NP responds by telling me that i am correct, but the uPSA is not on their requisition list. Are you f***ing kidding me? They are working on getting the uPSA, and in the meantime, if i'd like, they can send me a scrip for a uPSA that i can get on my own from Quest (no thank you) or a local Labcorp facility.

Or i could be unstable, at .03, .05, .08 or .09. What a joke. NP said it doesnt really matter, because they wouldnt do anything till it hit .1 anyway. Guess what. I would. If it hits .05, i'm interviewing RO's. I'm sure the guys that rail against the uPSA to begin with, are gonna have a field day with this. It doesn't matter to me. Now that i've had the uPSA, and lost my <, the cats out of the bag. And i need to know. So i will discuss with the Dr (Tewari) tomorrow, after telling him i think what they did to me is idiotic because there was no reason to do the test in the first place, except to get some billing in for the month.",

Stage 3 means it's escaped the capsule. If the Eligard stops working and your PSA goes up and that's the only sign, another treatment, like chemo (taxotere?) can often stop the cancer from progressing And I may be wrong, but isn't it possible that eligard could be effective for more than 2 years?",

My dad went to ED doc (in the same location as Dr.T's office) in Feb and he did his psa ( as per my advice after your post about loss of < ) and he was <.02 but on May 15 he will have 2 years after his surgery. He did his psa today and he will see Dr. T tomorrow. LUKACS, I too, will see Tewari tomorrow, (morning) so we may in fact cross paths. I was told that they are working to get the uPSA back, and that Tewari is not happy about having to use the standard test.",

      "Content": "chiguy, welcome to the forum, sorry about your diagnosis. First of all, yes, getting a second opinion is one of the most important things you can do. Make sure the slides are sent to a pathology dept that specializes in prostate cells. You should use either Dr JOn Epstein at Johns Hopkins or David Boatwick, at Bostwick Labs. Prostate is all they do and they are the foremost experts. If the G6 holds, you can possibly do AS. This doesn't mean just watch and wait. It means what it says ACTIVE Surveillance. YOU WANT TO GET Ainto a structured program, with preset protocols for regular PSA checks, biopsies, and MRI. I could be wrong, but I think Johns Hopkins which is one of the more stringent as to guidelines for AS, would not accept you into their program due to cancer in both lobes. I could be wrong, if I am, someone will correct me Besides seeds, there is other type of radiation. SBRT and its cousin Cyberknife, HDR Brachytherapy (like seeds/LDR but implants are temporary, high dose for only a few hours. And other options. Make sure you explore them all, Surgery and radiation will both likely cure you. One thing to be aware if, the advantage of surgery is confirmation of your Gleason scores. In 20-49% of cases, Gleason score is upgraded after surgery. Mine was G6 then after surgery upgraded to G7(3+4). You don't have to rush, sounds like your case is not serious. It's always scary to get a cancer diagnosis, but MOST PC is easily curable or manageable, especially G6 and g7(3+4). So the urge to \"do something\" or \"get it out\" quickly, is PROBABLY misguided although understandable. One more thing... (In before Highlander LOL). Do yourself a favor, go to Amazon and buy the book \"Surviving Prostate Cancer\" by Patrick Walsh. Make sure you get the third edition.although adbpvancements are coming so fast. That even that is outdated a bit. Also, for a different perspective (Dr Walsh is a surgeon), by the book \"Invasion of the Prostate Snatcherz\" by Dr Mark Scholz. He's a big fan of AS when appropriate. These two books will give you a balanced view. Above all, educate yourself thoroughly.Be your own advocTe. Most Drs, with good intentions , are biased towards their own specialty. Surgeons want to cut, radiation oncologists want to burn. So you need to make the decision on what's best for you Good luck, you will be ok, breathe. Ken",

      "Content": "chiguy, welcome to the forum, sorry about your diagnosis. First of all, yes, getting a second opinion is one of the most important things you can do. Make sure the slides are sent to a pathology dept that specializes in prostate cells. You should use either Dr JOn Epstein at Johns Hopkins or David Boatwick, at Bostwick Labs. Prostate is all they do and they are the foremost experts. If the G6 holds, you can possibly do AS. This doesn't mean just watch and wait. It means what it says ACTIVE Surveillance. YOU WANT TO GET Ainto a structured program, with preset protocols for regular PSA checks, biopsies, and MRI. I could be wrong, but I think Johns Hopkins which is one of the more stringent as to guidelines for AS, would not accept you into their program due to cancer in both lobes. I could be wrong, if I am, someone will correct me Besides seeds, there is other type of radiation. SBRT and its cousin Cyberknife, HDR Brachytherapy (like seeds/LDR but implants are temporary, high dose for only a few hours. And other options. Make sure you explore them all, Surgery and radiation will both likely cure you. One thing to be aware if, the advantage of surgery is confirmation of your Gleason scores. In 20-49% of cases, Gleason score is upgraded after surgery. Mine was G6 then after surgery upgraded to G7(3+4). You don't have to rush, sounds like your case is not serious. It's always scary to get a cancer diagnosis, but MOST PC is easily curable or manageable, especially G6 and g7(3+4). So the urge to \"do something\" or \"get it out\" quickly, is PROBABLY misguided although understandable. One more thing... (In before Highlander LOL). Do yourself a favor, go to Amazon and buy the book \"Surviving Prostate Cancer\" by Patrick Walsh. Make sure you get the third edition.although adbpvancements are coming so fast. That even that is outdated a bit. Also, for a different perspective (Dr Walsh is a surgeon), by the book \"Invasion of the Prostate Snatcherz\" by Dr Mark Scholz. He's a big fan of AS when appropriate. These two books will give you a balanced view. Above all, educate yourself thoroughly.Be your own advocTe. Most Drs, with good intentions , are biased towards their own specialty. Surgeons want to cut, radiation oncologists want to burn. So you need to make the decision on what's best for you Good luck, you will be ok, breathe. Ken",

Stage 3 means it's escaped the capsule. If the Eligard stops working and your PSA goes up and that's the only sign, another treatment, like chemo (taxotere?) can often stop the cancer from progressing And I may be wrong, but isn't it possible that eligard could be effective for more than 2 years?",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by Michael F Hi Pratoman! At least be very pleased with the fact that your missing \"<\" has returned!!! Now a decimal point has gone AWOL! Try to loosen up & laugh at this crazy situation! You simply can't win at getting a correct post RP uPSA. I recall the horrible scare you had when the Quest uPSA was erroneously reported to be \"3.something\" Sorry for this latest SNAFU but remain confident that you will get is straightened out. I'm sure that my Forum Family is tired of my constant \"Same Lab Same uPSA Methodology\" & \"Get a Copy of The Original Lab Report\" mantras! But yours is a case where your Lab switched from Quest to LabCorp and you would have never known this except for the fact that your latest PSA result was from a \"Standard\" PSA Assay. Had they run a uPSA, your LabCorp result could not be compared (to detect a change) to your previous Quest uPSA result. Double check if your Jan & Feb uPSAs were done by LabCorp (or ask when LabCorp bought your current lab). Same thing happened at my local hospital lab where I have my uPSAs drawn. I always ask the phlebotomist to show me the Lab requisition sheet that has my name and the \"exact\" uPSA test before I'll allow them to draw the blood sample. LabCorp picks up from the hospital and the sample is run in their Birmingham, AL facility each time. FYI: I am \"permanently married\" to: LabCorp Test Number: 140731 = Prostate-specific Antigen (PSA), Ultrasensitive This must be on my requisition sheet. My \"co-pay\" is $12. Good luck in quickly getting back BOTH your missing < & your 2nd Decimal! I am certain that you will find both of them huddled closely together on your next uPSA Lab report! Hang in there & Good Luck my friend! MF Michael, just to claify. I haven't had my PSA done at Quest since that one time tht they screwed it up and it came back at 3.8. I'll never use them for PSA again unless I have no choice. My test since then has always been done at the hospital lab itself. Now, the hospital lab has been bought by labcorp. And what's messed up, to your point, is no matter what I do, I'm going to have to start all over again, with a new lab, probably new assay. So none of my future tests will relate to my past tests. UGH! my first few tests after surgery all came back at 0.00. Then, the next few came back at <.02. Yup, you guessed it, they changed the assay, I looked at the reports and compared them. Then I got the .02 three months ago, but it was the same assay. Now I get to start all over again. Oh crap",

      "Content": "The business of medicine, is a clown show. We are all just numbers. I got the result. They always call between 9am and 9:45AM, this time i didnt hear from them, and my mind was running wild, so i called them at 11:30AM, and didnt hear back until 2PM. So, after losing my \"<\" and going from <.02 to .02 three months ago, my test today came back and <.1.... Thats right, <.1, without any zeros. They proceed to explain to me that they did the standard test, not the uPSA this time. Why, i asked. Well, because our lab at the hospital was bought by LabCorp and they changed it. OK, I responded, but i know LabCorp does uPSA and in fact goes to 3 decimal places. The NP responds by telling me that i am correct, but the uPSA is not on their requisition list. Are you f***ing kidding me? They are working on getting the uPSA, and in the meantime, if i'd like, they can send me a scrip for a uPSA that i can get on my own from Quest (no thank you) or a local Labcorp facility. So bottom line, i know nothing, its like i never got the test. All i know is that i'm less than .1 . I could be <.02 again, or i could be stable at .02. Or i could be unstable, at .03, .05, .08 or .09. What a joke. NP said it doesnt really matter, because they wouldnt do anything till it hit .1 anyway. Guess what. I would. If it hits .05, i'm interviewing RO's. I'm sure the guys that rail against the uPSA to begin with, are gonna have a field day with this. It doesn't matter to me. Now that i've had the uPSA, and lost my <, the cats out of the bag. And i need to know. So i will discuss with the Dr (Tewari) tomorrow, after telling him i think what they did to me is idiotic because there was no reason to do the test in the first place, except to get some billing in for the month.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by Michael F Hi Pratoman! At least be very pleased with the fact that your missing \"<\" has returned!!! Now a decimal point has gone AWOL! Try to loosen up & laugh at this crazy situation! You simply can't win at getting a correct post RP uPSA. I recall the horrible scare you had when the Quest uPSA was erroneously reported to be \"3.something\" Sorry for this latest SNAFU but remain confident that you will get is straightened out. I'm sure that my Forum Family is tired of my constant \"Same Lab Same uPSA Methodology\" & \"Get a Copy of The Original Lab Report\" mantras! But yours is a case where your Lab switched from Quest to LabCorp and you would have never known this except for the fact that your latest PSA result was from a \"Standard\" PSA Assay. Had they run a uPSA, your LabCorp result could not be compared (to detect a change) to your previous Quest uPSA result. Double check if your Jan & Feb uPSAs were done by LabCorp (or ask when LabCorp bought your current lab). Same thing happened at my local hospital lab where I have my uPSAs drawn. I always ask the phlebotomist to show me the Lab requisition sheet that has my name and the \"exact\" uPSA test before I'll allow them to draw the blood sample. LabCorp picks up from the hospital and the sample is run in their Birmingham, AL facility each time. FYI: I am \"permanently married\" to: LabCorp Test Number: 140731 = Prostate-specific Antigen (PSA), Ultrasensitive This must be on my requisition sheet. My \"co-pay\" is $12. Good luck in quickly getting back BOTH your missing < & your 2nd Decimal! I am certain that you will find both of them huddled closely together on your next uPSA Lab report! Hang in there & Good Luck my friend! MF Michael, just to claify. I haven't had my PSA done at Quest since that one time tht they screwed it up and it came back at 3.8. I'll never use them for PSA again unless I have no choice. My test since then has always been done at the hospital lab itself. Now, the hospital lab has been bought by labcorp. And what's messed up, to your point, is no matter what I do, I'm going to have to start all over again, with a new lab, probably new assay. So none of my future tests will relate to my past tests. UGH! my first few tests after surgery all came back at 0.00. Then, the next few came back at <.02. Yup, you guessed it, they changed the assay, I looked at the reports and compared them. Then I got the .02 three months ago, but it was the same assay. Now I get to start all over again. Oh crap",

      "Content": "Gsteve....funny you should ask. I saw my Uro/surgeon today. My PSA after surgery was <.02, than at the two year mark it was .02. Retested two weeks later , .02. Then retested 4 months later, DIFFERENT LAB. .033. Because of differences in testing, .033 at this lab, could be the same as .02 at the previous lab. I'll never know. Retested last week, again, .033. Today I asked my urologist, the big question, which I'm sure you will be interested in.... \"If not recurrence, what the hell is causing this admittedly small amount of PSA in my blood.\" His response was, that it could be cancer cells. But it could also be the fact that the Cowpers Gland, which is left in, is producing some PSA. And male breasts are also known to produce PSA. So it could be a sign of approaching recurrence. Or it could be nothing. He said he sees pops,in PSA that end up just leveling off and becoming the new normal all the time. So chill. Or try to. I'm going to post in another thread about today's Dr visit, so I don't hijack yours....good luck. As we used to say in Brooklyn, fuggetaboutit, just retest in 3 months.",

      "Content": "Newporter - so here is the story - The nurse didnt give me details, she just said the report looks great, no EPE, negative Margins, SV, LN, Upgrade from G6 to G7 (3+4) but since its organ confined, no big deal. and positive PNI which almost every one has. 5 % of organ involved by tumor. She did not tell me about the original Apex margin being positive. I learned this from my wife. The Surgeon (Dr Ash Tewari, great surgeon) called my wife during the surgery, and told her that they got the results of the frozen section and it showed positive margin, so he had to take off some more, and then got negative margin. I also read the path report, and it clearly said, referring to that sample \"right apex positive margin, see notes\", then underneath the note said right apex, final margin negative for carcinoma\" So thats what it is. But still, as you said, I'm a worrier, and i need a couple of zero PSAs, before i can stop worrying about my damn Apex! So it sounds like you are saying that i probably dont need to worry about it if the case is that i have stated?",

So far no troubling side effects. Some \"warm flashes\" that make me sweat, not profusely, maybe just a few times a day, but today seems to be less, nothing troubling. And it seems that my Erectile Function is suddenly about 30% of what it was. Not sure if thats the Firmagon, i know a lot of guys on ADT that dont have erectile disfunction ,just a lack of interest. Today i had my simulation. MRI, CT Scan they will fuse the two images together and use the result to plan the treatments. They made a mold of my body from my abdomen to my junk, that will fit over me and secure me to the gurney, so i dont move when they are zapping me. For some reason they also did an EKG. It all went smoothly. Then they scheduled me for my 40 treatments. Starting on Sept 24th, and ending on Nov 16th, a day that i hope will make me very happy. Just in time for thanksgiving, followed by, hopefully, if i am in decent shape, the drive down to Florida for the winter. I'll keep you guys posted in this thread, for any new guys that might follow me (i hope none).",

      "Content": "My PC, dominant tumor was in the right Apex. My surgical pathology was negative for EPE, as well as negative, LN, SV, and Margins. My initial margin at the Apex was positive, this was the frozen section done while I was still on the Operating Table. When it came back positive, the Surgeon cut more, and sent it for Frozen Section and it came back Negative. So they stopped cutting. They didn't take any of my nerve bundles (near the Apex, I believe). I always knew that PC at the Apex produced more + margins than any other area (51% of all + margins are at the Apex). But the more I read and find out other stuff, like there is no capsule at the Apex, so its the easiest place for escape, etc, the more nervous I get. In two weeks I have my first post surgery PSA test (6 weeks after surgery) And my mind is starting to race. Anybody have any insight on this. Is my chance of biochemical recurrence a lot higher with cancer at the Apex, even if I had negative final margins and no Extra Prostatic Extension? Or does all the good stuff in the path report balance it out? My final Gleason was 7 (3+4). My PSA when I was diagnosed was 4.3. Very nervous about the first PSA, and this Apex issue.",

      "Content": "My attention had been diverted for a while so i have been MIA from here for a few days. Figured i would post an update.... Today is three weeks since my first Firmagon shot. So far no troubling side effects. Some \"warm flashes\" that make me sweat, not profusely, maybe just a few times a day, but today seems to be less, nothing troubling. And it seems that my Erectile Function is suddenly about 30% of what it was. Not sure if thats the Firmagon, i know a lot of guys on ADT that dont have erectile disfunction ,just a lack of interest. Today i had my simulation. MRI, CT Scan they will fuse the two images together and use the result to plan the treatments. They made a mold of my body from my abdomen to my junk, that will fit over me and secure me to the gurney, so i dont move when they are zapping me. For some reason they also did an EKG. It all went smoothly. Then they scheduled me for my 40 treatments. Starting on Sept 24th, and ending on Nov 16th, a day that i hope will make me very happy. Just in time for thanksgiving, followed by, hopefully, if i am in decent shape, the drive down to Florida for the winter. I'll keep you guys posted in this thread, for any new guys that might follow me (i hope none).",

I don\u2019t have to arrive with a full bladder, but I do have to arrive 1 hour before my appointment each day. When I arrive, they have me empty my bladder fully, and they give me one cup of water to drink. Wait 45 minutes and start treatment, This assures, they say, that the bladder will be in the exact same state, and I assume, position, each day. They still look at it though daily, with a ct scan before zapping commences, to be sure. Getting there an hour earlier than my 7:20am appointment will be a PITA for sure. But I like the approach, relieves me of one headache (no pun intended)",

      "Content": "NRHK, sorry for your dads diagnosis, I'm not sure what value the second opinion would have since he's already had primary treatment of some sort, although I might be wrong about that. But To get a second opinion you would need to have the biopsy slides sent to Epstein or Bostwick. I used Epstein and after I got the results, I tried to call him, he actually got on the phone and spent 10 minutes talking to me. He also was very good about answering a few questions that came up afterwards, via email. I was not covered for insurance for the second opinion service. The total cost was just $250.00. Lot less than $30,000 LOL. But a different kind of service. I'm not sure of the mechanics of getting the slides from India specifically. But here is a link to Dr Epsteins web page. If you scroll down, you will see phone numbers, and address where to send the slides, all the information you need to proceed... http://pathology.jhu.edu/department/...s/urologic.cfm Also, another thing you might consider, which I did.... In Marina Del Rey, Calufornia, there is an oncology practice that is focused solely on prostate cancer. They are highly regarded Medical Oncologists, with no ax to grind. In other words they don't do surgery, or radiation, they manage and treat prostate cancer mostly when it advances. They will do a telephone consultation with you, after they receive all the records, that lasts about 1 hour, and give you their thoughts on the best way to proceed. It lasts about 1 hour ( at least in my case) and the cost is $600. They will do follow ups for $75 for a $15 minute call. I did a consult with Dr Scholz, the medical director, who also wrote a well known book titled \"invasion of the Prostate Snatchers\" (basically about over treatment, Scholz is a big advocate of Active Surviellance, but obviously not in your dads case). The other Drs, Dr Lam and Turner, are also very excellent from my understanding. To access their info, go to their website at http://www.prostateoncology.com Good luck to you and your dad. He is very lucky to have you as his advocate.",

I don\u2019t have to arrive with a full bladder, but I do have to arrive 1 hour before my appointment each day. When I arrive, they have me empty my bladder fully, and they give me one cup of water to drink. Wait 45 minutes and start treatment, This assures, they say, that the bladder will be in the exact same state, and I assume, position, each day. They still look at it though daily, with a ct scan before zapping commences, to be sure. Getting there an hour earlier than my 7:20am appointment will be a PITA for sure. But I like the approach, relieves me of one headache (no pun intended)",

      "Content": "Gsteve....funny you should ask. I saw my Uro/surgeon today. My PSA after surgery was <.02, than at the two year mark it was .02. Retested two weeks later , .02. Then retested 4 months later, DIFFERENT LAB. .033. Because of differences in testing, .033 at this lab, could be the same as .02 at the previous lab. I'll never know. Retested last week, again, .033. Today I asked my urologist, the big question, which I'm sure you will be interested in.... \"If not recurrence, what the hell is causing this admittedly small amount of PSA in my blood.\" His response was, that it could be cancer cells. But it could also be the fact that the Cowpers Gland, which is left in, is producing some PSA. And male breasts are also known to produce PSA. So it could be a sign of approaching recurrence. Or it could be nothing. He said he sees pops,in PSA that end up just leveling off and becoming the new normal all the time. So chill. Or try to. I'm going to post in another thread about today's Dr visit, so I don't hijack yours....good luck. As we used to say in Brooklyn, fuggetaboutit, just retest in 3 months.",

      "Content": "I'm no expert, and not a doctor, just a guy on the Internet, but I'll venture a guess that some Gleason grade 4 cells had already left the prostate and taken up residence in a distant place away from the prostate. PSA of 23 is pretty high, pre treatment. We're bone scan and Ct scans done at time of diagnosis? If they were negative, he could still have had mets that were too small to detect. He should not have a PSA of 100 after treatment. I'm a bit surprised that his doc was only checking PSA once a year so soon after treatment. Not what you wanted to hear, I know. But there are many treatment options available after fails BRachytherapy, if that's what this is, that can control the cancer for a long time. If I were your dad, I would find a good MEDICAL ONCOLOGIST that has a focus on Prostate Cancer, and make him or her a part of your dads team. Don't depend on just the urologist.

Keep in mind, that PSA is not really a test for cancer, certainly not a conclusive one. A high PSA just means that more investigation is warranted. If it does come back positive, there will be steps you will want to take, before making any decisions, first of which will probably be getting a second opinion on thte biopsy slides. But thats getting way ahead of ourselves, so for now, lets keep our fingers crossed that the result is negative.",

      "Content": "Mary, welcome, and hope you are just passing through, and that you get a negative result on the biopsy. Its a big plus that the DRE/physical exam, seemed unremarkable. Keep in mind, that PSA is not really a test for cancer, certainly not a conclusive one. A high PSA just means that more investigation is warranted. If it does come back positive, there will be steps you will want to take, before making any decisions, first of which will probably be getting a second opinion on thte biopsy slides. But thats getting way ahead of ourselves, so for now, lets keep our fingers crossed that the result is negative.",

      "Content": "Rocky, great synopsis I'm three weeks out of surgery, today is my three week \"anniversary\" I still have some blood in urine, but very little, if I don't look for it at the end of the stream I wouldn't notice it. One or two drops of pink. But I do have mini blood clots, little black flecks coming out with my piss. But getting better, and I think its just a sign of healing. My pain after surgery was almost exclusively from the gas they pump in you. That took a week to dissipate, and it was only because I did my walking. Currently walking 2 miles a day on the treadmill at a pace of 3.2-3.3 mph. Its a big help The catheter, as you said, wasn't painful, just annoying. And seeing blood come out was disturbing. But knew it was normal. I'm down to 1-2 guards per day, no more full Depends briefs. Usually only 1 guard, I weigh my pads, and am leaking about 1-1.2 ounces per 24 hour period. I'm not up and about all day, but I do spend 34-40 minutes a day on the treadmill, that's when I leak more. Good luck with your continued recovery.",

She did not tell me about the original Apex margin being positive. I learned this from my wife. The Surgeon (Dr Ash Tewari, great surgeon) called my wife during the surgery, and told her that they got the results of the frozen section and it showed positive margin, so he had to take off some more, and then got negative margin. I also read the path report, and it clearly said, referring to that sample \"right apex positive margin, see notes\", then underneath the note said right apex, final margin negative for carcinoma\" So thats what it is. But still, as you said, I'm a worrier, and i need a couple of zero PSAs, before i can stop worrying about my damn Apex! So it sounds like you are saying that i probably dont need to worry about it if the case is that i have stated?",

Last week I got results of my 3rd PSA test, since surgery, at the 6 month post op mark. And it was undetectable. It will be a tough two weeks or So, after surgery, but manageable. And after two weeks things will improve very rapidly. I still can't believe how good I feel now, it's like I never had surgery. So try to relax, it will be manageable, and likely will all turn out well. Get a 5 gallon oval shaped bucket for him to carry the catch bag in. Recliner if you don't have one you can rent it,for a week. Get an inflatable donut for him to sit on for the ride home from the hospital. Hang in there, keep the faith",

      "Content": "Wam, After re-reading your original post, I have to say this.... If your dad had a PSA OF 3 a year after treatments after reaching a nadir of 1 (not even sure 1 is considered a nadir) he should have been re-tested in a month. To wait a year, and then save a 7, and still do nothing? For another year? Do I understand correctly that this is what happened? I hesitate to say this under most circumstances, but in this case, I feel compelled - I think this borders (or maybe not borders but is) on the verge of malpractice. I would be asking that doctor a lot of hard questions. Your dad is in a tough spot, but he can be helped, the disease can likely be managed. Just keep that in mind. But again I can't stress enough for the sake of other men who see this doc, I would be asking some really hard questions about now.",

      "Content": "Daughter, so sorry for your dads diagnosis. I\u2019m not very well versed in advanced prostate cancer, but I can tell you, it\u2019s not likely to be months, unless he has a poor response to the Lupron, which is unlikely. I\u2019m going to leave the rest to other more knowledgeable guys. But I just want to relate to you, a case that might give you hope. There is a member of another forum (he shows up here occasionally too), screen name is Todd1963. He was diagnosed at age 42, with a PSA of 3200, and had multiple bone mets. That was 11-12 years ago, and last time I saw him post, within the last few months, his PSA was undetectable. Sure he\u2019s gone through a lot. But he is living large. If you are interested, here is a link to his blog... http://toddseals63.blogspot.com Again, I am not as knowledgeable technically as guys like DjinTonic and Another, Micheal, and others here, but I hope Todd\u2019s story takes you at least a step away from panic mode.",

      "Content": "Welcome to the forum, sorry you need to be here. But you will get a lot of support and education here. I am not the most knowledgeable guy here, but I've been through it and educated myself with the help of guys here and elsewhere. First thing I would say is its clear that he needs treatment and probably shouldn't wait too long, with the G8 cores. But with that said don't rush, or get pushed, into anything. I would get a second opinion on the biopsy slides from a highly respected lab. The two always mentioned are Johns Hopkins, Dr Jonathan Epstein, and Bostwick Labs/David Bostwick. But I would imagine if you are going to MD Anderson, they will look at the slides and they are world class. Surgery may well be the right option, but keep in mind there are other alternatives. And Prostate Cancer is unfortunately, big business. Talk to a surgeon, (like your urologist) they will want to cut. Talk to a Radiation Oncologist, they will want to radiate. At MD Anderson you will probably be referred to a team that will together help you make a decision. If the cancer has escaped the prostate capsule, surgery may not be the best option. You can never know for sure, but you can get a good idea, by asking for a 3 tesla, multiparametric MRI, (think Hi Def MRI). I'm sure MD Anderson will recommend that. Armed with the information it will yield, you can make an intelligent decision. Whatever you choose, make sure you hire a doctor who has a good track record and is highly experienced in whatever treatment he does. Last thing - buy the book - How To Survive Prostate Cancer by Dr Patrick Walsh. Its the definitive guide, and will give you a good education. Just keep in mind Walsh is a surgeon, and so his POV is a bit biased, naturally. But its a great easy read. Make sure you purchase the 3rd edition. You can buy it here.... http://www.amazon.com/Patrick-Walshs...+patrick+walsh Good luck, it sounds like your husband has a good advocate.",

Last week I got results of my 3rd PSA test, since surgery, at the 6 month post op mark. And it was undetectable. It will be a tough two weeks or So, after surgery, but manageable. And after two weeks things will improve very rapidly. I still can't believe how good I feel now, it's like I never had surgery. So try to relax, it will be manageable, and likely will all turn out well. Get a 5 gallon oval shaped bucket for him to carry the catch bag in. Recliner if you don't have one you can rent it,for a week. Get an inflatable donut for him to sit on for the ride home from the hospital. Hang in there, keep the faith",

Keep in mind, that PSA is not really a test for cancer, certainly not a conclusive one. A high PSA just means that more investigation is warranted. If it does come back positive, there will be steps you will want to take, before making any decisions, first of which will probably be getting a second opinion on thte biopsy slides. But thats getting way ahead of ourselves, so for now, lets keep our fingers crossed that the result is negative.",

When you get there, immediately ask for the nurse that told you \"no it was .1\". When she comes out to greet you, punch her in the face.

      "Content": "Red bull, for the constipation, my surgeon had me on 3 Colace a day and I continued that for about 2-3 weeks, then cut back to two a day. Then a week later, I cut it back to one every evening. I am six weeks post op (tomorrow) and a couple of days ago I cut back to 1 every other day, so far so good. As far as recovery, my experience was things started to speed up after the catheter came out (10 days post op), but there was enough bothering me, like leakage, and just not feeling right, for the next 10 days or so that I was feeling better but frustrated. Probably a result of my impatient nature. But then at about week4, things really started getting better fast. When I look back now to three weeks ago, I can't believe the difference Good luck, it gets better from here for you.",

      "Content": "a few days ago, I read a great poem on another PC forum. One of the lines was \" I wish to be normal again\" . It hit me right between the eyes. I got past the PC and then got hit with Coronary Artery Disease. A punch in the stomach. My research in how to stop progression led me to a new Cardioogist who practices integrative medicine and he did advanced blood tests on me, one of which was off the charts and indicates very high risk for a cardiac event in the next one to six months, according to the research I've read. Needless to say, I didn't take this well. The Dr wants me to retest and said if it comes back with the same result it may or may not be heart related, it could be something else. I have no knowledge of what he is thinking and I don't think I want to know. I am hoping it's just a lab error, and that I'm just presisposed to labs screwing with my head. Not counting on it though, since I'm such an \"optimist\" Anyway, the point is, back to that poem, I really just want to be normal again. I wake up each morning and go to my iPad to log on here, and to another PC forum, then to a heart health forum. I listen to Doctor Radio on Sirius XM in ten car on my way to work. I think about my health 24/7. I doubt I'll ever be normal again, but I gotta try. I know a lot of folks especially many here, have it way worse than I do. That's not lost on me.

I have read of others who traveled home with the cath, I personally wouldn't want to do it. But that's me. You should talk to your surgeon about follow ups. You won't want to drive 4-5 hours ape very few months, so you should probably find a local urologist with experience who is willing to take your partner on as a patient, monitor his PSA, and deal with any issues that might come up.",

This summer i skipped it, as i wanted to do Alaska (cant do that in the winter) so i went last week. First time since my surgery. It was truly, GFMPH. I never appreciated this trip mre than this year. The day before i left, i was walking down the aisle of the drug store. It was a year ago, that i was shopping for supplies before my January 2015 surgery. It occured to me...here i am, shopping for suntan lotion. A year ago, i was walking down the aisles of this same drugstore, with tears, shopping for diapers. What a difference a year makes. I've been very lucky SO FAR. (Dont want to jinx myself before my 1 year PSA next month). Zero PSA, no incontinence, and a bonus, no issues with ED. Of course, i have been taking Cialis, so never knew if i was good on the ED without drugs. I did switch from daily Cialis to every other day this past summer and everything seemed fine. So i decided, on my vacation, when i was pretty relaxed, to take a shot. I stopped Cialis altogether. After three days, i did the deed, and everything worked fine. Mrs Pratoman makes me take her on vacation if i want sex, so this was my opportunity LOLOL. As the week progressed, all was good. On the 8th day, i still had no problem, and did the deed. Not only effortless, but it was probably the best orgasm i've had since surgery. Hopefully this continues. I do find, that even WITH Cialis, at times when i need to \"take care of my own business\" it is often not as easy to maintain an erection. But otherwise, I'm grateful. Now i just need to get a zero on my 1 year PSA test. Keeping my fingers crossed",

You were staged T2c due to the fact that they found Cancer lesions on both lobes of the Prostate. g6. , however, is a slow growing cancer type, many studies have shown that it does nit spread to other parts of the body. 30-40% of patients have their GLeason scores upgraded to a more aggressive score after surgery when they examine the entire Prostate after it's been removed. One of the first things you should do is request that your Dr arrange to have your pathology slides sent out for a second opinion, to either Drs john Epstein at Johns Hopkins , or Davd Bostwick at Bostwick labs, two of the leading pThologists on Prostate cells. This is done routinely it's very simple, and you should get that second opinion.

Of course, the MRI (i assume 3T?) could tell you alot. And BTW, if it IS cancer, just be aware, I've seen guys with PSA at diagnosis in the THOUSANDS, as i high as 5200, that have been treated successfully, and while undergoing continuous treatment, are living long and enjoyable lives.

      "Content": "Sorry you found your way to this place, but u will get good information from others that have gone thru it. You were staged T2c due to the fact that they found Cancer lesions on both lobes of the Prostate. g6. , however, is a slow growing cancer type, many studies have shown that it does nit spread to other parts of the body. 30-40% of patients have their GLeason scores upgraded to a more aggressive score after surgery when they examine the entire Prostate after it's been removed. One of the first things you should do is request that your Dr arrange to have your pathology slides sent out for a second opinion, to either Drs john Epstein at Johns Hopkins , or Davd Bostwick at Bostwick labs, two of the leading pThologists on Prostate cells. This is done routinely it's very simple, and you should get that second opinion. If you provide more details, it will help others possibly give you more detailed information, but remember nobody here is a doctor we are patients and you need to be writing do questions for your doctors.",

Great on the erections, and if you only have dribbles at this point, you will continue to improve quickly Best of luck with your recovery, and your PSA which will likely be undetectable.",

Of course, the MRI (i assume 3T?) could tell you alot. And BTW, if it IS cancer, just be aware, I've seen guys with PSA at diagnosis in the THOUSANDS, as i high as 5200, that have been treated successfully, and while undergoing continuous treatment, are living long and enjoyable lives.

The good news is that after a couple of months, and more so as some time passes, you are going to be surprised at how the \"new\" normal, is really not a whole lot different than the old normal. Especially with your pathology. Re the prep - i was told that i could have a light breakfast the day before surgery, if i did so early in the morning, like 8AM. After that, i was restricted to liquids, took some prep drink at about 4pm, (forgot what it was, probably because i want to) then the fleet enema in the morning.",

At 4 weeks I was just wearing a shield, one a day, and at 5 or 6 weeks I wasn't wearing anything. At 5 montHs, I still have an occasional squirt at odd times, like when I grab my wife's ass (serious) but not enough to show, and not enough tO have to wear any pads. Some guys recover slower, some faster. But my doc said I will continue to see improvement. So don't cheat yourself out of what might be months of enjoying life. You are so early in the game that you shouldn't even be thinking about being dry yet. Just keep doing your Kegels, it works, and you will eventually be dry.",

I don't really want to consider radiation I'm young and ther wise healthy (age 64), and I want to get it out , and as quickly as possible, considering a g8 with 70% involvement. I am going to see two other surgeons, one of them being Dr Ash Rewai, who is in the same elite group as Samadi, because I want yo be complete on my due dilligence. If there is a reason, I can always cancel what I scheduled, if one of the other doctors says something that makes me want to do so. But I liked Samadi a lot. He seems very positive, and easy to talk to, and I know his reputation as a top guy Next step is to get the scans done.",

Here are the results.... PROBABILITY OF REMAINING RECURRENCE-FREE AFTER SURGERY 2 YR97% 5 YR92% 7 YR90% 10 YR86% 15-YEAR PROSTATE CANCER-SPECIFIC SURVIVAL 98% When I changed the input to POSITIVE margins, the 15 year PC specific survival rate was STILL 98%. What is interesting to note is that angiolymphatic Invasion was NOT one of the input criteria. Which means it's not considered a major determining factor. As I mentioned in another post, I'm waiting for a PSA result 2 1/2 years after surgery, after having a slight rise at 2 years. I'm nervous about it, sure, but when I find myself getting down, I remind myself that no matter what, the odds of PC getting me in the next 15 years, are infinitesimal.

I don't really want to consider radiation I'm young and ther wise healthy (age 64), and I want to get it out , and as quickly as possible, considering a g8 with 70% involvement. I am going to see two other surgeons, one of them being Dr Ash Rewai, who is in the same elite group as Samadi, because I want yo be complete on my due dilligence. If there is a reason, I can always cancel what I scheduled, if one of the other doctors says something that makes me want to do so. But I liked Samadi a lot. He seems very positive, and easy to talk to, and I know his reputation as a top guy Next step is to get the scans done.",

Also reading about monitoring blood sugar, among other things. No doctor ever mentioned this to me, including my RO. Have you done any of that, or anything else to monitor overall health while on ADt? Has your dr recommended any if it? Is it important for short course ADT or only if you are on it more than a year? Drs tend to treat their specialty, maybe my RO is only concerned about the treatment he offers, I don\u0092t want to be left out there to figure this out myself.

At the same time, it's not easy, and it seems like depression and worry are fairly common after initial treatment. It makes sense that there would be a lot more G7s that HQVE been cured and moved on, than stay here on the forum. Looking at the NOMOGRAMS, showing chance of no BCR in the 90sand even after ten years, 82%, is probably what one should focus on",

      "Content": "Welcome to the club. If you can handle it mentally, Active Surviellance is a great option for you with 2 cores gleason 6, low tumor volume, both on 1 side, and low PSA. One thing though - you mentioned the words \"wait and see\". That implies do nothing for now and see what happens. Maybe an occasional PSA test. Which seems to be what your Urologist is implying. DONT DO THAT!!!! Get into a solid, structured, program of Active Surviellance. This means regular DRE's and PSA's at specific intervals, and regular MRIs, probably annually, with Biopsies every few years. And a pre-determined metric that will mean you take action. i.e. treatment. If you get into a structured program like this, it will give you a very high likelihood of taking action before its too late to cure, if and when the time comes. Active Surviellance is not for everyone, but if you can handle it mentally, its probably your best option. You'd be cured in all probability with surgery or radiation. But neither of those is a hell of a lot of fun.",

      "Content": "Dave, I'm on Medicare. I know it's probably not what you meant. But effectively, it is a single payer system, md a form of socialized medicine. I would imagine, that if we ever got to a point in the US, where we went to a single payer system, it would be modeled on the Medicare system. In fact, we've all heard the campaign phrase in the past (Bernie Sanders) , \"Medicare for all\" So in my experience, as stated in another thread, it's been terrific. I've not been refused any treatments, and no payment has been declined with me held responsible. I've had a few instances where a service was declined as not covered with the notation \"because you were not made aware that this service is not covered, you re not responsible to pay anything. However if this service is rendered agin, it will be your responsibility\". But nothing major. The big question I would have, is how quick and efficiently does Medicare add newly (FDA) approved treatments to the list of covered expenses. I haven't gotten to that stage. Yet.",

      "Content": "Welcome to the club. If you can handle it mentally, Active Surviellance is a great option for you with 2 cores gleason 6, low tumor volume, both on 1 side, and low PSA. One thing though - you mentioned the words \"wait and see\". That implies do nothing for now and see what happens. Maybe an occasional PSA test. Which seems to be what your Urologist is implying. DONT DO THAT!!!! Get into a solid, structured, program of Active Surviellance. This means regular DRE's and PSA's at specific intervals, and regular MRIs, probably annually, with Biopsies every few years. And a pre-determined metric that will mean you take action. i.e. treatment. If you get into a structured program like this, it will give you a very high likelihood of taking action before its too late to cure, if and when the time comes. Active Surviellance is not for everyone, but if you can handle it mentally, its probably your best option. You'd be cured in all probability with surgery or radiation. But neither of those is a hell of a lot of fun.",

When I started, they tested PSA and Teststosterone before giving me the shot, and will test again every month when I get each ahot. 1. If my PSA on the day of my first Firmagon shot was .08, and Firmagon should drop my T down to castrate levels within 3 days (it\u2019s been two weeks and I\u2019ve got no side effects), then a month later they retest PSA, which they will just before my second shot, what should I expect/hope for? Should my PSA be undetectable? If it\u2019s not (MSKCC tests down to .05) does that mean I\u2019ve got a problem ? 2. I\u2019m not sure how much <.05 means to me, being accustomed to the 3 digit Labcorp uPSA. Would anyone suggest testing simultaneously at Labcorp to be sure it\u2019s really I undetectable, if that\u2019s what it\u2019s supposed to be, at my expense of course? If say, my PSA went down to .03, or .04, this showed undetectable with the MSKCC Test that only measures down to .05, should I know if it\u2019s not truly undetectable, I.e. <.006? With ADT?",

      "Content": "Ive been doing some reading and it seems like it\u0092s recommended that if you go on ADT, you should do a bone density test, and if you are losing bone density go on fosomax or something. Also reading about monitoring blood sugar, among other things. No doctor ever mentioned this to me, including my RO. Have you done any of that, or anything else to monitor overall health while on ADt? Has your dr recommended any if it? Is it important for short course ADT or only if you are on it more than a year? Drs tend to treat their specialty, maybe my RO is only concerned about the treatment he offers, I don\u0092t want to be left out there to figure this out myself. I tested Blood sugar today, and it\u0092s alraedy up",

      "Content": "Dave, I'm on Medicare. I know it's probably not what you meant. But effectively, it is a single payer system, md a form of socialized medicine. I would imagine, that if we ever got to a point in the US, where we went to a single payer system, it would be modeled on the Medicare system. In fact, we've all heard the campaign phrase in the past (Bernie Sanders) , \"Medicare for all\" So in my experience, as stated in another thread, it's been terrific. I've not been refused any treatments, and no payment has been declined with me held responsible. I've had a few instances where a service was declined as not covered with the notation \"because you were not made aware that this service is not covered, you re not responsible to pay anything. However if this service is rendered agin, it will be your responsibility\". But nothing major. The big question I would have, is how quick and efficiently does Medicare add newly (FDA) approved treatments to the list of covered expenses. I haven't gotten to that stage. Yet.",

      "Content": "Welcome to the club. If you can handle it mentally, Active Surviellance is a great option for you with 2 cores gleason 6, low tumor volume, both on 1 side, and low PSA. One thing though - you mentioned the words \"wait and see\". That implies do nothing for now and see what happens. Maybe an occasional PSA test. Which seems to be what your Urologist is implying. DONT DO THAT!!!! Get into a solid, structured, program of Active Surviellance. This means regular DRE's and PSA's at specific intervals, and regular MRIs, probably annually, with Biopsies every few years. And a pre-determined metric that will mean you take action. i.e. treatment. If you get into a structured program like this, it will give you a very high likelihood of taking action before its too late to cure, if and when the time comes. Active Surviellance is not for everyone, but if you can handle it mentally, its probably your best option. You'd be cured in all probability with surgery or radiation. But neither of those is a hell of a lot of fun.",

      "Content": "Searcher, welcome and sorry to hear about you joining our club. Your biopsy results are relatively good, you are in the low risk group. You could go on active Surviellance, but it sounds like you are wanting to treat and that\u2019s ok. I had surgery, it wasn\u2019t as bad as it sounds. A rough 10mdays but then recovered quickly. Chance of incontinence is small. As far as ED, everyone is different so it\u2019s hard to say. Your best bet is to find an experienced surgery who has done at least (in my opinion) 1000 surgeries (some say 300, it\u2019s just me). And make sure it\u2019s someone who is current ask how many they currently do a month on average, As far as radiation, there are 2ntypes of Brachytherapy, LDR (permanent seeds) and HDR (newer, temporary radiation inserted). But there is also SBRT sometimes known as Cyberknife. In Gleason 6 and 7 it\u2019s got a great 10myear track record. Make sure you speak to a specialist in each of these methods. As far as radiation or surgery, either one will likely cure you. The side effects tend to be more immediate with surgery, and ED is more of a possibility On the other hand with surgery, you will know for sure what your Final Gleason score is. 30% of the time, Gleason can be upgraded when the pathologist examines the entire prostate. And with surgery, you should see your PSA drop to undetectable within a couple of months, where with radiation it is a gradual drop, with some bounces along the way, and it can take up to a couple of years to reach nadir (low point, it willl usually not go to undetectable, because you will still have a prostate. It\u2019s a tough decision that only you can make. But the good news is whatever you decide, it won\u2019t be a wrong decision, as long as u educate yourself about each option p,uses and minuses. Good luck and keep us posted",

      "Content": "Asa , interesting video to watc, even though it was a commercial for the radiation oncologist who did the interview. I think the perils of Robituc Surgery were greatly exaggerated by Curtis Sliwa, it was only his personal experience. With today\u2019s technology, and a skilled surgeon, it\u2019s a small percentage of men who have permanent incontinence. With that said, I (and probably many here) have a pretty good idea who the surgeon was, that he had operate on him. And if it\u2019s who I think it was, I have no doubt he was told what he says he was told. I saw that surgeon 3 days after my diagnosis, he had me booked for surgery 5 weeks later, before I walked out the door. Thank goodness I came to my senses and cancelled, a week later after I saw Dr Tewari, who finally did the surgery. Aside from that, Sliwa\u2019s case seems like a classic case of overtreatment.",

      "Content": "Chasisme - I too was diagnosed in November - November 10th. I am scheduled for Surgery Jan 6th . My understanding is that you cant do the surgery till at least 6 weeks after biopsy anyway. I don't know about how long you can wait, but I do know that if you were a gleason 8 or higher, the urgency would be a lot higher. With that said, the fact that you had all 12 cores positive, indicates you shouldn't wait TOO long, but still, slow down just a bit and get your facts and due diligence done. The only bad decision is one made without knowing all the relevant facts - about your pathology, about side effects and cure rates of various treatment options, about the experience of the surgeon or radiation oncologist that you choose to treat you, etc. The first thing I think you should do is send your biopsy slides for a second opinion to a high level pathology lab that has pathologists who look at prostate slides all day long. The local Pathologist might look at your slides, but also the same day looked at breast slides, colon slides, and who else knows what. And prostate grading (gleason) is a very subjective thing. So call your urologist on Friday, and tell them (don't take any pushback) that you want your slides sent to Jonathan Epstein at Johns Hopkins or David Bostwick at Bostwick Labs. They will know these people, they get this request all the time. And just so you know, my biopsy was graded 3 cores positive, Gleason 6, gleason 6, and gleason 8. When I sent the slides to Epstein, they downgraded me to Gleason 6 x 3. And that was later reconfirmed by pathologists at Memorial Sloan Kettering. So do it. Then with the facts, make sure you see at least a few surgeons and a few Radiation Oncologists and one medical oncologist, with no skin in the game. What I mean by that is that Surgeons will recommend surgery, Radtiation oncologists will generally recommend radiation, and Oncologists don't have any dog in that fight. Learn all you can about side effects, upside and downside of all treatment options available to you, and only then, should you make a decision. If you are near a major cancer center of great repute, like Johns Hopkins, Mayo, Cleveland Clinic, MSKCC, all the better, because to me at least, those guys seem to be above the fray, and you can arrange to consult with a team, whom together, will probably give you a joint assessment. If you tell us what major city you are closest to, perhaps someone here will be able to recommend a Dr or Center. Good luck",

I want to wait till my follow up with Dr which is tomorrow, I don't want to do it too soon and blow up my junk. And 2. I'm afraid.

      "Content": "Searcher, welcome and sorry to hear about you joining our club. Your biopsy results are relatively good, you are in the low risk group. You could go on active Surviellance, but it sounds like you are wanting to treat and that\u2019s ok. I had surgery, it wasn\u2019t as bad as it sounds. A rough 10mdays but then recovered quickly. Chance of incontinence is small. As far as ED, everyone is different so it\u2019s hard to say. Your best bet is to find an experienced surgery who has done at least (in my opinion) 1000 surgeries (some say 300, it\u2019s just me). And make sure it\u2019s someone who is current ask how many they currently do a month on average, As far as radiation, there are 2ntypes of Brachytherapy, LDR (permanent seeds) and HDR (newer, temporary radiation inserted). But there is also SBRT sometimes known as Cyberknife. In Gleason 6 and 7 it\u2019s got a great 10myear track record. Make sure you speak to a specialist in each of these methods. As far as radiation or surgery, either one will likely cure you. The side effects tend to be more immediate with surgery, and ED is more of a possibility On the other hand with surgery, you will know for sure what your Final Gleason score is. 30% of the time, Gleason can be upgraded when the pathologist examines the entire prostate. And with surgery, you should see your PSA drop to undetectable within a couple of months, where with radiation it is a gradual drop, with some bounces along the way, and it can take up to a couple of years to reach nadir (low point, it willl usually not go to undetectable, because you will still have a prostate. It\u2019s a tough decision that only you can make. But the good news is whatever you decide, it won\u2019t be a wrong decision, as long as u educate yourself about each option p,uses and minuses. Good luck and keep us posted",

      "Content": "Chasisme - I too was diagnosed in November - November 10th. I am scheduled for Surgery Jan 6th . My understanding is that you cant do the surgery till at least 6 weeks after biopsy anyway. I don't know about how long you can wait, but I do know that if you were a gleason 8 or higher, the urgency would be a lot higher. With that said, the fact that you had all 12 cores positive, indicates you shouldn't wait TOO long, but still, slow down just a bit and get your facts and due diligence done. The only bad decision is one made without knowing all the relevant facts - about your pathology, about side effects and cure rates of various treatment options, about the experience of the surgeon or radiation oncologist that you choose to treat you, etc. The first thing I think you should do is send your biopsy slides for a second opinion to a high level pathology lab that has pathologists who look at prostate slides all day long. The local Pathologist might look at your slides, but also the same day looked at breast slides, colon slides, and who else knows what. And prostate grading (gleason) is a very subjective thing. So call your urologist on Friday, and tell them (don't take any pushback) that you want your slides sent to Jonathan Epstein at Johns Hopkins or David Bostwick at Bostwick Labs. They will know these people, they get this request all the time. And just so you know, my biopsy was graded 3 cores positive, Gleason 6, gleason 6, and gleason 8. When I sent the slides to Epstein, they downgraded me to Gleason 6 x 3. And that was later reconfirmed by pathologists at Memorial Sloan Kettering. So do it. Then with the facts, make sure you see at least a few surgeons and a few Radiation Oncologists and one medical oncologist, with no skin in the game. What I mean by that is that Surgeons will recommend surgery, Radtiation oncologists will generally recommend radiation, and Oncologists don't have any dog in that fight. Learn all you can about side effects, upside and downside of all treatment options available to you, and only then, should you make a decision. If you are near a major cancer center of great repute, like Johns Hopkins, Mayo, Cleveland Clinic, MSKCC, all the better, because to me at least, those guys seem to be above the fray, and you can arrange to consult with a team, whom together, will probably give you a joint assessment. If you tell us what major city you are closest to, perhaps someone here will be able to recommend a Dr or Center. Good luck",

      "Content": "Asa , interesting video to watc, even though it was a commercial for the radiation oncologist who did the interview. I think the perils of Robituc Surgery were greatly exaggerated by Curtis Sliwa, it was only his personal experience. With today\u2019s technology, and a skilled surgeon, it\u2019s a small percentage of men who have permanent incontinence. With that said, I (and probably many here) have a pretty good idea who the surgeon was, that he had operate on him. And if it\u2019s who I think it was, I have no doubt he was told what he says he was told. I saw that surgeon 3 days after my diagnosis, he had me booked for surgery 5 weeks later, before I walked out the door. Thank goodness I came to my senses and cancelled, a week later after I saw Dr Tewari, who finally did the surgery. Aside from that, Sliwa\u2019s case seems like a classic case of overtreatment.",

It doesn't matter, you know you will find things to depress you, but they are just statistics, and they dont apply to indivduals. Your survival could be shorter, but it could be much much longer. Have you confirmed the G10 with a second opinion? If not it would be worth doing. Check out the second opinion service at Johns Hopkins, Dr Jonathan Epstein. He is one of the worlds formost experts on Prostate Pathology. Gleason 10 is rare. It might just be a 9, or even an 8. Still aggressive but manageable. I would think G10 MIGHT be manageable as well, if caught at a relatively early stage. Have you determined with an MRI if there is escape from the capsule? If you could post your stats in a signature (create it in your profile) it would help others come up with some more specific information.",

      "Content": "Ok, I have a question for the surgery guys. Not one I'd want to ask anywhere but an Internet forum. And one I'm not even sure I want to know the answer to. I seem to be lucky in that I can get erections and I'm 6 weeks past surgery today.but I haven't used it yet, because, 1. I want to wait till my follow up with Dr which is tomorrow, I don't want to do it too soon and blow up my junk. And 2. I'm afraid. So that leads me to ask, after RP, what was your experience in having sex the first time or two. Was it very painful? Anything I should know, other than no ejaculate?",

      "Content": "The new data you refer to is not new data, but a new opinion. The AUA announced that they no longer recommend testing for all men over 50 (i think 50). They are now recommending that under 50 and above 70 should not be tested except for under 50 with high risk factors like family history. And i think they said that between 50 and 70 should be tested every two years, rather than ever year, in the absence of any test results that indicate otherwise. My numbers may be off a little, but thats the gist of it. I think its ridiculous. Sure, testing causes unnecessary biopsies, but it also saves lives. I do not understand the motivation for this decision. Maybe if the Urologists that the AUA represents would take care to look at the PSA test in perspective and along with other tests and observations, to make biopsy decisions, it would be a better solution to the problem, rather than throwing the baby out with the bathwater.",

Also remember that SOMETIMES, at 6 weeks, there might still be a trace of PSA remaining in the blood. Probably won't happen, but if it does, its not reason to flip out. Re your science project - awesome news. I had the same experience and asked the same question, how is this possible. The answer is 'dont look a gift horse in the mouth\". Its a great sign, that Johnny will be soon actively engaged in fun and games, not for the sake of science, but for the sake of fun and games. Yeah, the continence issue can be frustrating. But within the first year, i think something like 97% of guys with a good surgeon, and you obviously had one, regain full continence. Just remember, it takes time, and its none linear, there will be good days and bad days, two steps forward one step back. What i did was i weighed my pads (used an old Weight Watchers food scale, so i had to buy a new one) and logged them every 24 hour period. This helped me track my progress week to week, month to month, rather than day to day, which will only frustrate the hell out of you. Welcome to life post surgery, and good luck with a continued speedy recovery. Oh, and i too, worried about blowing up my junk if i started the fun and games too soon. I waited until about 8 weeks after the cath came out, only because i was scared. And i took care of business myself the first one or two times, i ddint want it to blow up inside someone.",

The biggest question I have of the RO is, \u201chow confident are you that it\u2019s in the prostate bed\u201d @Michael - I\u2019ve mentioned this before but to refresh your memory, my Surgeon does frozen sections intraoperatively. In my case I had a positive margin, I believe at the Apex, that was 3+4. When that came back positive, the surgeon went back and did further resection of the tissue, and obtained what the pathologist referred to as a negative \u201cFINAL\u201d margin. When I consulted with an RO at Cleveland Clinic he said that the surgeon probably got everything he could see but left a few cells that were cancerous, that was missed on the final pathology, and they\u2019ve now grown to put out PSA. In addition, Dr Zelefsky, the RO at MSKCC, who o am seeing on Tuesday, when I saw him last July, referred to my negative margin status as \u201cquestionable\u201d which he thinks may be the source of the PSA. So while on the surface my pathology is pristine, it\u2019s a bit of an odd situation. We shall see what Zelefsky says on Tuesday.",

But I was lucky and you should understand that everyone is different. If I were you, I would send the slides for a second opinion to an expert who on,y reads prostate slides. dr Jon Epstein at Johns Hopkins is who I used. Also, seek out a great, not good, but great surgeon. Even if you have to travel. You only get one shot at this. DaVinci is great but if you find a solid great surgeon that does open, then remember the skill of the surgeon, rather than the method, is paramount. You should also meet with a good Radiation oncologist or two. Explore Brachytherapy (seeds) both LDRR and HDR (2 different methods) and SBRT, (sometimes goes under the brand name Cyberknife) Explore all of your options even if you decide you are more or less set on surgery, so that when it's over, you will not have any regrets, knowing that you did your due diligence. Good luck and keep us posted. This is a treatable disease that in all likelihood, won't kill you.",

      "Content": "Tara, sorry you and your family are going through this. PSA of 400 is not what you want to hear. You are right, I would think (and keep in mind I'm not a doctor, just a guy on the Internet) there is a high chance of metastasis. Best thing you can do is 1. Don't anticipate. Wait for the results, we all know it's agonizing, 2. learn as much as possible about various treatments in case it is a positive diagnosis 3. Try to keep your dads mind ff it with talk about other things, while waiting. Also keep in mind, HIGH PSA is not a sign of. Cancer, per se, but a sign that something is going on, it could be something else. But with a PSA of 400, yeah there is a good chance.... Assuming it is advanced cancer, keep in mind it's still highly treatable, and he will likely live many years with proper treatment. There is another forum I am on, and a guy there was diagnosed. At age 42 with PSA of 3200 and multiple mets. A few months ago he celebrated his 51st birthday, with I believe, undetectable PSA SO KEEP CALM AND KEEP THE FAITH",

Not enough to bother me or even to need to wear a pad, but i'd sure like it to stop.Still doing kegels Re the ED issue - i'm surprised your doc didnt put you on 5 mg daily cialis from the start, and you should ask him about it. My understanding is that most docs do that, as a matter of standard practice, and the reason is not just to get you an erection, but it promotes blood flow to the pecker, which is needed to keep the tissues healthy while waiting for the nerves to wake up. I've been on it, since 3 days after the catheter came out, and from the beginning i was getting erections. I have more sex now than before the surgery because i play the cancer card and tell my wife that its important to keep things going, and also to \"make sure i can still do it. ))",

Not enough to bother me or even to need to wear a pad, but i'd sure like it to stop.Still doing kegels Re the ED issue - i'm surprised your doc didnt put you on 5 mg daily cialis from the start, and you should ask him about it. My understanding is that most docs do that, as a matter of standard practice, and the reason is not just to get you an erection, but it promotes blood flow to the pecker, which is needed to keep the tissues healthy while waiting for the nerves to wake up. I've been on it, since 3 days after the catheter came out, and from the beginning i was getting erections. I have more sex now than before the surgery because i play the cancer card and tell my wife that its important to keep things going, and also to \"make sure i can still do it. ))",

      "Content": "The new data you refer to is not new data, but a new opinion. The AUA announced that they no longer recommend testing for all men over 50 (i think 50). They are now recommending that under 50 and above 70 should not be tested except for under 50 with high risk factors like family history. And i think they said that between 50 and 70 should be tested every two years, rather than ever year, in the absence of any test results that indicate otherwise. My numbers may be off a little, but thats the gist of it. I think its ridiculous. Sure, testing causes unnecessary biopsies, but it also saves lives. I do not understand the motivation for this decision. Maybe if the Urologists that the AUA represents would take care to look at the PSA test in perspective and along with other tests and observations, to make biopsy decisions, it would be a better solution to the problem, rather than throwing the baby out with the bathwater.",

You are right, I would think (and keep in mind I'm not a doctor, just a guy on the Internet) there is a high chance of metastasis. Best thing you can do is 1. Don't anticipate. Wait for the results, we all know it's agonizing, 2. learn as much as possible about various treatments in case it is a positive diagnosis 3. Try to keep your dads mind ff it with talk about other things, while waiting. Also keep in mind, HIGH PSA is not a sign of. Cancer, per se, but a sign that something is going on, it could be something else. But with a PSA of 400, yeah there is a good chance.... Assuming it is advanced cancer, keep in mind it's still highly treatable, and he will likely live many years with proper treatment. There is another forum I am on, and a guy there was diagnosed. At age 42 with PSA of 3200 and multiple mets. A few months ago he celebrated his 51st birthday, with I believe, undetectable PSA SO KEEP CALM AND KEEP THE FAITH",

I seem to wander back here whenever i get close to my next PSA test and URO visit, i guess because i assume the worst, even though i have not been diagnosed or \"joined the club\" (yet), as you can see from my stats. I'm very curious about something. For those of you in your early sixties (even mid and late sixties), I'm sure a lot of you feel the way i do, that 60 today, isn't what 60 was when our parents turned 60. I feel much younger, and i live as though i was younger. My mindset is that i am not old. If you feel this way, or felt this way, and then you got diagnosed, did it change? Did your mindset change as a result of diagnosis? Or after surgery, if you had surgery, as a result of having to deal with side effects. Hope i am not out of line asking this question. If so, i apologize. I am very afraid of losing that younger mindset, and the ability to lead as active a life as i do now.",

The one thing I wasn't thrilled about was that when he took blood for PSA he did a DRE first and when I asked about it he said that their group doesn't believe it makes that much diffence. S that it me thinking. So when it was time for a follow up, I found that Dr Aron Katz who was one of the top docs at Columbia, had left to become chairman of Urology at Winthrop, a hospital much closer to me. I believe that it's not just the hospital or departments rep, but also the doc, and Katz , has an excellent rep as a top urologist, from everyone I've spoken to So now I am under his care. And believe me, I WILL be staying close to him, and on top of this. If I am diagnosed, ll do everything possible to get it early. One other point, I am thinking if and when the time comes, and I do get DX, I would probably look to go to Johns Hopkins, or Mayo. If I can Sorry, I realize now that I'm all over the place and probably hijacking my own thread",

The data only goes back 7 years. And I want more than 7 years of data before deciding that a treatment is right for me. I met with 2 ROs one who does almost exclusively Cyberknife (which is just a brand name for SBRT) and another, at MSKCC, who recommended LDR Brachy as my best option, primarily for the reason I mentioned. His comments to me were that he has been very impressed with the data published so far and thinks that over time it will become treatment of choice for many, but there is not enough data available yet for him to make it his best option recommendation. BTW, at his facility he does not do Brachy, he would refer me to an RO at MSKCC'S main campus. (I saw him at a suburban campus) and yet he still recommended it, which impressed me as no agenda, other than what was best for the patient.",

Walk a lot, that helps make you belch and fart. And also, I took GasX strips and Tums which I think also helped. After the cath comes out, within a week, you will be amazed how the pace of your recovery accelerates.",

Also there was a comment, which wasnt mentioned by uro when i spoke with him, that said \"each slide contained a single needle core biopsy of prostate. Major feature is benign hyperplasia. There are scattered small foci of atrophy and acute and chronic inflammation. \" It also noted volume of prostate at 38 CC My PSA was 2.2 a month prior to the biopsy, although the doc that did the biopsy took his own blood test a week before the biopsy and it was 2.7. I dont think that matters it was a different lab. Curious if any of the more expert guys here have any thoughts. Apparently i have BPH, which could be the reason for the psa rising over the last three years. But then again, they found a HGPIN. Not sure what to make of it.",

      "Content": "Thanks Ed. I am in NY and when this all first started and a biopsy was recommended, I decided to leave my local urologist and go t a doc at Columbia Presbyterian, which is a top 5 ranked urology center. That's where I had the biopsy. The one thing I wasn't thrilled about was that when he took blood for PSA he did a DRE first and when I asked about it he said that their group doesn't believe it makes that much diffence. S that it me thinking. So when it was time for a follow up, I found that Dr Aron Katz who was one of the top docs at Columbia, had left to become chairman of Urology at Winthrop, a hospital much closer to me. I believe that it's not just the hospital or departments rep, but also the doc, and Katz , has an excellent rep as a top urologist, from everyone I've spoken to So now I am under his care. And believe me, I WILL be staying close to him, and on top of this. If I am diagnosed, ll do everything possible to get it early. One other point, I am thinking if and when the time comes, and I do get DX, I would probably look to go to Johns Hopkins, or Mayo. If I can Sorry, I realize now that I'm all over the place and probably hijacking my own thread",

      "Content": "Valar, Very sorry you need to be here, with such news. It clearly sounds as though your husbands situation needs to be dealt with sooner rather than later. Some important points, with an understanding that I, and everyone else here, are not doctors, we are just a bunch of guys on the Internet who have out of necessity, educated ourselves as best as possible 1. There is some controversy as to whether surgery is the best option when the Cancer has already escaped the Prostate capsule. 2. A big reason for that is that if its escaped, there is a good chance that surgery won't offer a cure 3. If he needs radiation after surgery, why not have radiation as the primary treatment (not saying that is what he should do, just something to consider) the side effects can be worse after both treatments vs radiation or surgery alone) 4. He should request a 3tesla MUltiparametric MRI which may be more definitive as to whether the Cancer escaped the capsule. Which leads me to ask, how did the urologist come to the conclusion that it's escaped. 5 you should probably ask that the slides be sent to a lab that focuses on PC for a second opinion. Either dr Jonathan Epstein at Johns Hopkins, orDavid Boatwick at Bostwick Labs. Others may want to chime in here, as I'm not sure if it would change treatment options. 6. Meet with other surgeons who have done at least 500-1000 radical prostatectomies, and get familiar with the various types of surgery (open,robotic, etc) 7. Also meet with a good radiation Oncologist to learn about alternatives to surgery as primary treatment. 8. Read \"Surviving Prostate Cancer\" by Dr Patrick Walsh which you can buy or download here....I would get a hard copy , easier to use as a reference. http://www.amazon.com/Patrick-Walshs.../dp/1455504181 We've all been where you and your husband are right now, that panicky dark place. The way to get out if it is to educate yourself and take charge, and not just depend on the DRs. Surgeons will want to cut, and radiation oncologists will want to radiate. You have to ask the right questions to come to the best conclusion, which may be different for you guys than for others, depending on your preferences and priorities. And please understand that Prostate cancer is usually a slow growing Cancer, unlike lung, breast and colon cancers, and your husband will likely live many years with proper treatment, even decades. Good luck and stick with us there is a lot of knowledge AND support here.",

      "Content": "Apologies to those who may have seen this posted in another forum, I know there is some overlap...... So,I had my meeting with my surgeon/urologist, today. (Post op PSA's in my signature). Takeaways... He still calls recurrence at .2! He is aware of the studies that point to .03, which I printed out and brought with me. But his comment was there is no evidence that starting earlier, affects final the outcome (meaning survival). The fact that my PSA is up doesn't concern him right now, but based on that, AND based on the fact that my final negative margin was preceded by a positive intra-operative margin, is why he wants to have me back in three months. Even if I had a slight rise at the next visit , he would not call it a clear trend He thinks it was a smart thing that I went to see Zelefsky, (RO at MSKCC) on my own, and that a baseline MRI was done. He still thinks there is a good chance that I don't recur, ever. His best advice to me for now is to eat healthy, watch weight, exercise, and calm my brain (I'm actually reading a book by that title right now) He said he is a big believer that inflammation in the body can produce increase in PSA. (I think he meant can produce recurrence.) and he is also a big believer that anxiety will cause inflammation. And my big picture question.... if not from cancer recurrence, where is this minute (.033) amount of PSA coming from? His answer was it could be cancer cells, or could be produced by the cowpers gland or male breasts. Lastly, he told me about a 2 day symposium at Mt Sinai (his hospital and that he put together), that takes place next week. Said speakers will be The Who's who of prostate cancer from all over the world. Suggested I register and gave me a brochure. It is targeted to medical professionals. But he clearly saw that I was more knowledgeable than his average Joe patient, and that I was hungry for knowledge and answers. I'm tempted, but I think I'm gonna pass. I really and truly need a mental health break from cancer. Too much of it going on between me and others in my family (which means I might disappear for a while, this time for real lol) Anyway that's what I got. It was a fruitful meeting. But I'm thinking that AS LONG AS MY PSA REMAINS STABLE, assuming it does, I might just get the tests done and not keep going back for visits unless I have more specific questions. Oh, just an aside... Had a new PA today. Very hot. Short skirt, heels . Comes in before the doc. Sits on the examining table, and does \"the pose\" you know, the one where they lean to one side, with arm supporting them, and crossed legs. No effort to pull down skirt.

I am also at .06 but have been having ultrasensitive tests all along and at the two-year mark I started a steady rise from .02. You might want to take a look at My post in the thread I started yesterday titled \u201cearly salvage radiation\u201c. In the thread I mentioned that the chairman of radiation oncology at Cleveland clinic in Florida recommended that I treat now and he cited this study\u2026 https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jam...?redirect=true It showed a significant improvement in outcome for patients with adverse pathology who treated below .1. I also saw Michael Zelefsky at MSKCC who said he does not believe in waiting for some target number, he prefers to treat when he sees a clear trend. I\u2019m seeing him again next month and think he will say time to treat, You are right, the data is all over the place. IMO if I hear \u201ctime to treat\u201d from 2 highly respected RO\u2019s at major research institutions, I believe it\u2019s time to treat. I think you need another couple of uPSA\u2019s before making that decision, you don\u2019t know if it\u2019s been .06 all along (which can and does happen). Good luck, keep us posted.",

      "Content": "Hi Dave, sorry to see you\u2019ve joined me in no mans land. It seems that that\u2019s exactly where the ultra sensitive test takes us more often than not. I am also at .06 but have been having ultrasensitive tests all along and at the two-year mark I started a steady rise from .02. You might want to take a look at My post in the thread I started yesterday titled \u201cearly salvage radiation\u201c. In the thread I mentioned that the chairman of radiation oncology at Cleveland clinic in Florida recommended that I treat now and he cited this study\u2026 https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jam...?redirect=true It showed a significant improvement in outcome for patients with adverse pathology who treated below .1. I also saw Michael Zelefsky at MSKCC who said he does not believe in waiting for some target number, he prefers to treat when he sees a clear trend. I\u2019m seeing him again next month and think he will say time to treat, You are right, the data is all over the place. IMO if I hear \u201ctime to treat\u201d from 2 highly respected RO\u2019s at major research institutions, I believe it\u2019s time to treat. I think you need another couple of uPSA\u2019s before making that decision, you don\u2019t know if it\u2019s been .06 all along (which can and does happen). Good luck, keep us posted.",

And I think if it's very early on in the process, good diet and low inflammation can help the immune system fight off the changes. But if course, I don't know for sure, it's just a layman opinion. Groom, thanks. That's quite an upgrade you got after surgery. But the fact that you were <.01 after surgery, and I assume, since then, bodes well for you. I agree though, if I were you, I would want to test more often tan every 6 mo this with a g9. Maybe every 3, or 4. Just to keep an eye on things.",

      "Content": "Valar, Very sorry you need to be here, with such news. It clearly sounds as though your husbands situation needs to be dealt with sooner rather than later. Some important points, with an understanding that I, and everyone else here, are not doctors, we are just a bunch of guys on the Internet who have out of necessity, educated ourselves as best as possible 1. There is some controversy as to whether surgery is the best option when the Cancer has already escaped the Prostate capsule. 2. A big reason for that is that if its escaped, there is a good chance that surgery won't offer a cure 3. If he needs radiation after surgery, why not have radiation as the primary treatment (not saying that is what he should do, just something to consider) the side effects can be worse after both treatments vs radiation or surgery alone) 4. He should request a 3tesla MUltiparametric MRI which may be more definitive as to whether the Cancer escaped the capsule. Which leads me to ask, how did the urologist come to the conclusion that it's escaped. 5 you should probably ask that the slides be sent to a lab that focuses on PC for a second opinion. Either dr Jonathan Epstein at Johns Hopkins, orDavid Boatwick at Bostwick Labs. Others may want to chime in here, as I'm not sure if it would change treatment options. 6. Meet with other surgeons who have done at least 500-1000 radical prostatectomies, and get familiar with the various types of surgery (open,robotic, etc) 7. Also meet with a good radiation Oncologist to learn about alternatives to surgery as primary treatment. 8. Read \"Surviving Prostate Cancer\" by Dr Patrick Walsh which you can buy or download here....I would get a hard copy , easier to use as a reference. http://www.amazon.com/Patrick-Walshs.../dp/1455504181 We've all been where you and your husband are right now, that panicky dark place. The way to get out if it is to educate yourself and take charge, and not just depend on the DRs. Surgeons will want to cut, and radiation oncologists will want to radiate. You have to ask the right questions to come to the best conclusion, which may be different for you guys than for others, depending on your preferences and priorities. And please understand that Prostate cancer is usually a slow growing Cancer, unlike lung, breast and colon cancers, and your husband will likely live many years with proper treatment, even decades. Good luck and stick with us there is a lot of knowledge AND support here.",

      "Content": "Idmeanl, sorry for your troubles. While there are never guarantees, prostate cancer usually causes a slow and steady rise in PSA, not a big jump like yours, especially 5 points in 6 weeks. Most of the time, with a jump like that, it\u0092s due to Prostatitis. The biopsy will tell you more. Prostatitis is sometimes hard to treat, but you might want to try a round of antibiotics first to see if it drops the PSA. If it does, it\u0092s probably Prostatitis and a biopsy might not Ben necessary. Also, you could ask your Uro for a PHI (prostate Health Index)test (it\u0092s a blood test), it incorporates PSA and other factors as well and has been shown to be more accurate than PSA alone. If these measures could help you avoid a biopsy, that would be a good thing",

I am also at .06 but have been having ultrasensitive tests all along and at the two-year mark I started a steady rise from .02. You might want to take a look at My post in the thread I started yesterday titled \u201cearly salvage radiation\u201c. In the thread I mentioned that the chairman of radiation oncology at Cleveland clinic in Florida recommended that I treat now and he cited this study\u2026 https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jam...?redirect=true It showed a significant improvement in outcome for patients with adverse pathology who treated below .1. I also saw Michael Zelefsky at MSKCC who said he does not believe in waiting for some target number, he prefers to treat when he sees a clear trend. I\u2019m seeing him again next month and think he will say time to treat, You are right, the data is all over the place. IMO if I hear \u201ctime to treat\u201d from 2 highly respected RO\u2019s at major research institutions, I believe it\u2019s time to treat. I think you need another couple of uPSA\u2019s before making that decision, you don\u2019t know if it\u2019s been .06 all along (which can and does happen). Good luck, keep us posted.",

It would be good if you could ask the Uro about a 3Tesla mpMRI, rather than biopsy. It may help you avoid a biopsy altogether, and if not it would help the URO target certain areas of the Prostate iif they look suspicious, for more accuracy.

Did the surgeon give you any assessment after the surgery or did he jus say you need to wait for the pathology? Did you get the final pathology back? (May have missed that if you mentioned it in another thread, if so, sorry) Did you do Kegels or other exercise before the surgey? I've been doing 3 sets of 10-12 per day (some days I forget and do 2 sets.) and I've been walking 3-4 miles a day 5-6 days a week. I'm scheduled at Mt Sinai in NY with dr Tewari January 6th.",

But everyone is different At the very least, if you want to do AS, you should get a Parametric 3T MRI which will show with some reliability whether there is something more lurking that was not picked up by the biopsy.

I've got a PSA check coming up end of this month, after 2 small rises this year. Then a few weeks later, see my PCP, Who is also my cardiologist. 6 months after RP, I was blindsided by the need for 2 stents, and a diagnosis of coronary artery disease, so seeing the cardio guy is always an adventure. And week after next, my wife has her second checkup at 6 weeks, and now at 3 m0nths, since finishing surgery and chemo for ovarian cancer. So I know how you feel. Lots that can go south in the next month. Let's hope we both have all good news when we are done. We both need to get in shape for the Patriots and the Jets. As for my boys, #tanktheseason",

For Brachytherapy, Dr Michael Zelefsky, without a doubt, at MSKCC.

And hopefully reduce over treatment. But at the same time, hopefully the Drs using it will take care to not lead patients yo decisions that result in under treatment either",

I slept in it the first two nights then started sleeping in my bed. I didnt have one, but I RENTED ONE, FOR ABOUT $275 for 7 days. It was worth it.

I slept in it the first two nights then started sleeping in my bed. I didnt have one, but I RENTED ONE, FOR ABOUT $275 for 7 days. It was worth it.

I had one, very well know, tell me i could do AS. I wouldn't, i'm not wired to go through tests and worry that its still in me, so I'm likely getting surgery done next month. But everyone is different At the very least, if you want to do AS, you should get a Parametric 3T MRI which will show with some reliability whether there is something more lurking that was not picked up by the biopsy. If there is, then you should not do AS.",

Feel bad about it, but it is what it is. I'm still spending to much time on forums, so I may cut back more. But I miss you guys, and I hope everyone here is doing well. On a positive note, I got results this week n my 18 month post Davinci PSA, and the answer IS.....<.02. So that's a good thing. I wanted to post to encourage any new guys here. And repeat what is often said...there is life after PC, and it can be good. I've got no incontinence issues, and while little Johnny doesn't play as hard and fast as he used to, without meds, he's been a more than adequate tool, and I'm enjoying sex as much as I always did. With meds, he's still playing hard and fast. Same without, but it just takes a little more time and effort. So all good on my end, and again, hope it's the same for you guys. Ken",

Creek, I think you meant CT scan, right? Bone scans show mets to bone. CT scan would show something on the kidney or other surrounding tissue and glands",

      "Content": "Dave, we are in a similar boat, as you likely realize (actually its uncanny how similar our circumstances are). 2 YEARS undetectable followed by a slowly rising PSA which now at 3 1/2 years post op is .068. I met with the Rad Onc last week, he said that at G7(3+4) (which describes us both) he would be ok with no HT, as long as my PSA was under .1. Once it got close to .1, he would rather I do HT, but if i didnt want it, it would be my choice. This was Zelefsky, top RO at MSKCC. I also, last month, met with Chairman of Rad Onc at Cleveland Clinic in Florida. He told me that he would not recommend HT, and that is based on my Gleason, more than on the PSA. FWIW, while i had a negative final margin (positive frozen section, which led to the surgeon cutting more tissue to get negative finaL) they both think that my negative margin is not really negative, but that a few cells were left behind. So i dont think there is one answer. I hope this experience i have had helps you, since our situations are really similar.",

I've got a PSA check coming up end of this month, after 2 small rises this year. Then a few weeks later, see my PCP, Who is also my cardiologist. 6 months after RP, I was blindsided by the need for 2 stents, and a diagnosis of coronary artery disease, so seeing the cardio guy is always an adventure. And week after next, my wife has her second checkup at 6 weeks, and now at 3 m0nths, since finishing surgery and chemo for ovarian cancer. So I know how you feel. Lots that can go south in the next month. Let's hope we both have all good news when we are done. We both need to get in shape for the Patriots and the Jets. As for my boys, #tanktheseason",

However, if it continues, based on the pain level you describe, I would contact the surgeons office, maybe they can adjust the med dosage, or give him some other med. I'm sure they've run across this before. After this type of surgery, I think we should have no hesitation in calling the doc with an inquiry, no matter how seemingly small.

I sometimes wonder if they measure lower but don\u2019t report that unless it\u2019s .05 or higher, thinking that anything below .05 is meaningless.

At that time PCa was not really on my mind, and he sent me to a website to purchase a supplement (might have been the same website, don't remember) but i didnt do it, because i felt i was taking enough pills. (meds for lipids, etc). Can't believe a top doc would want to profit from me spending $300 a year on pills, but i guess they are like everyone else. On the other hand, there must be some valid theory behind some of these supplements. Probably worth doing some reading on it, which i will google.",

He is still associated with Columbia Presbyterian, and teaches there. There is no doubt in my mind that he is a legitimate Doc, i did not mean to give the impression otherwise. My curiosity is in the efficacy of these herbal supplements, and dietary changes. This Docs traditional specialty, is, i believe Cryosurgery. As i said, i have not been diagnosed as yet, but signs are pointing to a storm possibly brewing, so i have been spending time on this forum, and another, to start educating myself. And i felt, going to this doc, perhaps there would be something available that he was onto, tha might at least lessen my chances of being diagnosed. I know that having high grade PIN, even though it was only in one core, is not a good sign, nor is the slow steady rise in PSA, even though it is still low in absolute numbers.

      "Content": "Warning and apology: this turned into a long post. Didn't know how to do it otherwise, wanted to explain my whole story. The thread by Skizman, on his pathology report, took a turn towards dietary issues near the end, and made me think, i would just like to get others take on this. Not to repeat myself, some of you may recall, but just in case, i had my first biopsy in November and it was negative for PCa, but one core out of 14 showed HI Grade PIN. Leading up to the biopsy, i had a steadily rising PSA that went from .7 in 2008 (or 2009, dont remember) to 1.1, to 1.7, then 6 months later 2.2, then 6 months after that (just last month) 2.8. The last time around, in April, i also had a FPSA, which came in at 11, (NOT so good) and a PCA3, of 15 (not so bad) I may have the numbers mixed up on the FPSA & PCA3, but they were definitely not so bad and not so good respectively. All negative DREs and the prostate at time of biopsy was 38 CCs . I'm 62 years old, father had PC. Based on the test results he wanted to do an MRI but the insurance co wouldnt authorize it. I told him i would pay for it if he thought it was critical, but he said no, just come back for follow up and retest in 4 months instead of 6. So i will go back to him in August. Anyway, to the point, this last set of tests, i decided to see another Urologist. He is Chairman of Urology at Winthrop University Hospital on Long Island, joined them 2 years ago, formerly with Columbia Presbyterian, so very good cred. The reason i wanted to see him, is that he is known for his approach of combining traditional medicine with herbal and alternatives. He asked me if i had changed my diet at all. Gave me a cheat sheet with dietary suggestions. The usual stuff, stay away from red meat, lots of vegetables, protein, exercise, etc. He also, and this is what i am curious about, told me to purchase two supplements online - from a company called Designs for Health. I had to apply for a password, with the name of my doc, then wait a few days to get an email with a password. The two supplements are \"Brocco-Protect\" and Inflammatone. The Brocco is a Broccoli extract of some sort, and the inflammatone, i dont know really. Also, on my own, i upped my Vitamin D from 2000 ius daily to 5000. (just from my reading) The thing that peaked my interest in all this is that i know someone who was diagnosed 11 years ago with gleason 9, had the surgery, it had escaped the capsule and he was given a very poor prognosis. He started taking supplements on his own, and has been fine for the last 11 years. Just now, his PSA has started to rise. Anyway, do you guys have any opinions on this stuff? No doubt there will be another biopsy in my future. The slow steady rise in PSA is troubling to me, and tells me something is brewing. But I'm hoping some of these supplements might prevent the hi grade pin or anything else from becoming PCa",

      "Content": "SW, its noted in your first post that he has already started treatment, based on the spot on his pelvic bone being a met. That does NOT mean its too late for him to get the slides reread and possibly the spot on the scan biopsied. I would at least ask the uro why the spot was NOT biopsied. If the comments here turn out to be prescient, you an change course (and urologist) on the treatment that was started. Think about it, even though its a tough and awkward position to be in. Its that important to your husband.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by ASAdvocate Pratoman, That calculator has Dr. Tewari's photo on its cover page, and says that it is based on his research. It would seem to me that there should not be such a great difference in what he, as your surgeon, told you, and what this calculator gave you. You might want to ask him about the calculator. Meanwhile, it doesn't appear that credible. I didn't notice that, interesting. I will ask him at my next follow up in 3 months. Now I'm nervous again. Edit: I took a closer look at that page, it refers to Dr Tewari as being with Cornell - Weill , which he left 3 years ago. So I'm thinking while it's sloppy, it's probably a site owned by the hospital that a they never took down or updated. More important, it states that the data was taken from a cohort of patients that had surgery between 1992-1999. That was a loooonnngggg time ago, and there have been huge advances made. There was no robotic surgery back then, and I'm sure results were very different. In addition, Dr Tewari himself didn't have the experience he has now. I'm surprised the calculator is still online.",

      "Content": "Mary, I ran my numbers in that calculator. The first thing that struck me is it does not differentiate between G7 (3+4) and G7(4+3). Studies have shown there is a big difference. The second thing I noticed is that the PSA range you (and I) have to choose is 4-9.9. Your husbands PSA is 5.27, mine is 4.3 (pre surgery) . That's a lot different than 9.9. If you notice, the part in tables have much narrower ranges. So before I even ran the numbers, I felt a lack of credibility Secondly, it showed I , like your husband, have a 58% chance of treatment success, in other. Words, no PSA failure. My surgeon told me that my chance of no further treatment needed is 95%. So I then went to the MSKCC Nomograms (link provided above by George) and it showed chance of no PSA failure at 97, 92, 88 and 83%, for w, 5, 7 and 10 years respectively. Basically a lot closer to my surgeons comment, than that other calculator. So if I were you I wouldn't get to freaked out over the results of that calculator",

I will say, that if your husbands experience is anything like mine, you will both be surprised at how manageable the recovery is, considering the extent and seriousness of the surgery. The worst part for me was the gas pains from the CO2 they use to blow up your abdominal cavity. i had it in my chest and shoulders, and for the first few days, or maybe a week, it hurt like hell, and I'm glad i knew to expect it, or i might have thought it was a heart attack. Aside from that, it was fairly easy. Catheter was a PIA, but not nearly as bad as i anticipated. I had somewhat low energy levels which took time to come back. Had blood clots in my urine for about 6 or 8 weeks. Other than that, uneventful, i was walking on the treadmill (slowly) the first week (i live in the Northeast and with the surgery in January, the treadmill was a godsend.) Just be prepared, read the stickies, make sure you stock up on depends, get a bucket to hold the catheter, think about renting a recliner for a week (easier to sleep in, than getting in and out of bed), lubricant for the tip of the penis where the catheter goes in (i used lidocaine, given to me by the hospital.) It will be nowhere near as bad as what you are anticipating.",

Waited 3 months and at the beginning of May, retested, and turns out the idiots at my Drs office ordered a standard PSA, not ultra sensitive, so it came back <.1. I guess you could say I got my < back, but the reality is, it could be anywhere from .02 to .099. So now I wait, and am real nervous, that it will come back at .03, or .06 or even .09. Next few days will be long Only thing that gives me comfort is my Decipher (genomics) test came back with a score of .37, with anything below .45 being low risk of recurrence.

      "Content": "Mary, I ran my numbers in that calculator. The first thing that struck me is it does not differentiate between G7 (3+4) and G7(4+3). Studies have shown there is a big difference. The second thing I noticed is that the PSA range you (and I) have to choose is 4-9.9. Your husbands PSA is 5.27, mine is 4.3 (pre surgery) . That's a lot different than 9.9. If you notice, the part in tables have much narrower ranges. So before I even ran the numbers, I felt a lack of credibility Secondly, it showed I , like your husband, have a 58% chance of treatment success, in other. Words, no PSA failure. My surgeon told me that my chance of no further treatment needed is 95%. So I then went to the MSKCC Nomograms (link provided above by George) and it showed chance of no PSA failure at 97, 92, 88 and 83%, for w, 5, 7 and 10 years respectively. Basically a lot closer to my surgeons comment, than that other calculator. So if I were you I wouldn't get to freaked out over the results of that calculator",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by ASAdvocate Pratoman, That calculator has Dr. Tewari's photo on its cover page, and says that it is based on his research. It would seem to me that there should not be such a great difference in what he, as your surgeon, told you, and what this calculator gave you. You might want to ask him about the calculator. Meanwhile, it doesn't appear that credible. I didn't notice that, interesting. I will ask him at my next follow up in 3 months. Now I'm nervous again. Edit: I took a closer look at that page, it refers to Dr Tewari as being with Cornell - Weill , which he left 3 years ago. So I'm thinking while it's sloppy, it's probably a site owned by the hospital that a they never took down or updated. More important, it states that the data was taken from a cohort of patients that had surgery between 1992-1999. That was a loooonnngggg time ago, and there have been huge advances made. There was no robotic surgery back then, and I'm sure results were very different. In addition, Dr Tewari himself didn't have the experience he has now. I'm surprised the calculator is still online.",

I sometimes wonder if they measure lower but don\u2019t report that unless it\u2019s .05 or higher, thinking that anything below .05 is meaningless.

The medhelp forum doesn't seem active, I posted there a week ago, and bumped it up yesterday, I got no responses other than an email from some nutjob recommending that I pray, and that I see an African Doctor. I'll check out the webmd forum. As I said it amazes me that an active forum doesn't exist. I'm sick over this. Ina way, more so than when I was diagnosed with PC, because this is something that can't be cured, only held at bay, with MAYBE a slight regression, but I'll always be high risk.im having a tough time dealing with it, I guess it's also the trauma of first PC followed swiftly by heart disease, after never having been sick Beiderbecke in my 64 years.

I always assumed it was just fullness due to the 5mg Daily Cialis. But I had to go off the Cialis 5 weeks ago, and after a few weeks it got MORE noticeable. I thought maybe it was tissue dying to to lack of blood flow without the Cialis, maybe causing the tissue to drop down (makes no sense I know). But I can still get an erection so that can't be it. I went back on Cialis this week, but every other day, rather than daily. Everything works fine. It's just bigger, when soft.. (Same size when hard) I'm not complaining or worried, or anything like that. Just puzzled. Anybody ever hear of this",

There are lots of guys here in our 60s and 70s, and I would imagine lots who have some type of heart disease, like me.

I stuck to decaf for a few days, but really missed the caf, so i switched to half-caf Keurig cups. I still usually drink half caf, and its fine, doesn't really bother the bladder at all. For me at least. So maybe try that and see how it goes, once the cath comes out.",

Yes, the HW forum is quite useless when it comes to the heart disease section Chuck thank you. The medhelp forum doesn't seem active, I posted there a week ago, and bumped it up yesterday, I got no responses other than an email from some nutjob recommending that I pray, and that I see an African Doctor. I'll check out the webmd forum. As I said it amazes me that an active forum doesn't exist. I'm sick over this. Ina way, more so than when I was diagnosed with PC, because this is something that can't be cured, only held at bay, with MAYBE a slight regression, but I'll always be high risk.im having a tough time dealing with it, I guess it's also the trauma of first PC followed swiftly by heart disease, after never having been sick Beiderbecke in my 64 years.

I've been looking for a place like this for Heart Disease, and while Otago and others have been very helpful, I really could use a dedicated ACTIVE heart disease forum right now. But while I've found multiple forums on the subject, none of them are active. That's crazy to me, considering how widespread Heart disease is in the developed world. There are lots of guys here in our 60s and 70s, and I would imagine lots who have some type of heart disease, like me. So I just want to put it out there and ask if anyone happens to know of a site that provides the same kind of support, and quick response that we do here.

I had intra-operative positive margin at the apex, and so the surgeon cut more, and ended up with negative FINAL margins. Sometimes though its not possible. Yes i think (i'm not an expert) you could have undetectable PSA. You probably need to be rather vigilant though in regular PSA testing.",

So yeah, it scares the crap out of me. I had 2 stents inserted last June, just as i was getting over the idea of having PC. It scared the crap out of me, and i am really taking care of myself now, including complete diet change. I am low carb, low sugar, and moving slowly towards more of a vegan style diet.

      "Content": "So I had my blood draw Friday for PSA, and now, once again, I wait. Ugh. Backstory is 2 years of <.02, then at the two year mark I lost the < and was .02. Retest 3 weeks later came back the same, .02. Waited 3 months and at the beginning of May, retested, and turns out the idiots at my Drs office ordered a standard PSA, not ultra sensitive, so it came back <.1. I guess you could say I got my < back, but the reality is, it could be anywhere from .02 to .099. So now I wait, and am real nervous, that it will come back at .03, or .06 or even .09. Next few days will be long Only thing that gives me comfort is my Decipher (genomics) test came back with a score of .37, with anything below .45 being low risk of recurrence. I'd feel better if it was deeper into low risk territory, like .2. Anyway, just venting, I woke up this morning very nervous about it for some reason.",

But maybe I'll hear sooner. I keep trying to focus on the Decipher test results, and I also try to think, well, if it's up again, at least I'll know that I'm headed towards SRT, and I'll get through it. Thanks again.",

      "Content": "Sorry you need to be here, but welcome. The g7 (4+3) isn't ideal, but it's also not terrible. It's considered intermediate risk. G8-10is what's considered aggressive. The negative lymph nodes is SUPER GOOD NEWS!!! I'm not sure what Equivocal margins means, but after googling, I thing it means tumor was found up to the edge of the gland just at the margins , so positive,, nut just barely. Again, I am not sure, maybe someone more knowledgeable will,chime in. The comment about extra capsular extension was also vague, it seems to say it wa sun determined if the tumor had escaped the capsule. Seminal vesicles invasion is not so great but they took it out, again , I'm not sure, sorry. I've not seen a path report with so many vague comments, but as I said I'm not that knowledgeable, maybe some one else can give more info I think overall, it's not the path report you would wish for, but not terrible either, and. The G7 is way better than G 8 or higher. Gleason score is one of the most important factors. For now, focus on helping your husband heal, and be very patient. He may be depressed for a while, maybe not. The next couple of weeks will,be a little tough, but now that the cath is out, he will improve quickly. In a couple of months you and he won't believe how much better he feels. He should be doing a lot of walking, 3-4 even 5 miles a day (not necessarily in one session. And he should do Kegels (see the sticky above, although I'm sure the surgeon went over that with him. The continence will improve (if it's a problem for him, which it is for most men just out of surgery), but it will not be a linear improvement. He will have good days and bad days, measure progress week to week, not day to day. I used a food scale to weigh my pads and kept a daily log, so I could compare and measure progress, it kept me positive . I am 4 months out of surgery, I feel like nothing even happened. I hit some golf balls ltwo weeks ago and am playing in an outing next week. I just returned from a week In Vegas. There is life after prostate cancer. Even if he has a rise in PSA, and ends up needing some radiation treatments,he has a good chance for cure, with clean lymph nodes. Just try to reassure him,be patient, and show him posts that you find encouraging. He will be fine. A Gleason7 rarely takes a life, Tell us a but more, how old is your husband, where did he have surgery? Stick around here there is plenty of support. I was crazed when I was diagnosed, but Chuck and this forum and another really helped me get perspective.",

      "Content": "If you are going to go to the trouble of getting a second opinion, which in most cases you should, have it done by the best. As good as UWM Pathology probably is they do not specialize in prostate cancer. And PC grading is very subjective. The two foremost experts in the WORLD in Prostate pathology are Jonathan Epstein at Johns Hopkins and David Bostwick, at Bostwick Labs. They both have second opinion services. I used Epstein, and in addition to being reasonably timely in getting me the report, he is extremely responsive. I actually got him on the phone and had a detailed conversation with him. I followed that up with an additional question via email and he got back to me the same day. So again, I'm sure UMW is good, but use one of the world famous PC pathology specialists, as long as they are available to you, which they are.",

      "Content": "Bees wife, It's highly doubtful that the surgeon, any surgeon, would preserve the nerve bundles if it lessened the chance of a cure, or heightened the chance of recurrence. As I mentioned earlier, being a little depressed after surgery is totally normal, I experienced that and many others do. I think a lot of it is a sense that before surgery, you feel ok, I'm doing something, doing my research, creating a plan of attack, I'm taking control. Then after the surgery, you spend more time waiting and hoping. The depression will likely subside over time, he needs to work thru the fact that he had to go thru this . I haven't had radiation and am no expert, but from what I've read, when you start radiation treatments, your progress on the continence issue pretty much freezes most of the time. Whatever progress you've made, is pretty much it. So you want him to be as close to continent as possible, before starting radiation. From most people's experiences that I've read about, the big side effect of radiation is fatigue, which can set in about half way thru treatments. Others who've gone thru it will come in soon with more first hand knowledge and experience. But hey, you guys are not there yet. Wait for the first PSA test, he may not need it for a while. Or maybe never. Keep the faith.",

      "Content": "Now What, good luck to you and your husband on the surgery. Note that you can rent a recliner for a week from many hospital supply stores for about $175. It will come in useful, as it's very hard to get in and out of bed the first few days and also easier to sleep in with the catheter. In addition, it's a good change of pace since he'll be home fr a while Also, push him(if you have to) to walk. And then walk kore. And more. And more. It will help speed his recovery. Also, having Robotic, they will pump CO2 into his abdominal area to give the surgeon room to work. As a result, he will possibly have pain in his abdomen , shoulders, chest. Some have it bad others not. Just be prepared so if he does have it bad, you don't freak out. I had it so bad, that if the guys here didn't warn me about it, I would have thought I was having aheartattack. The walking will help a lot as moving around moves the gas, and when he passes it he will feel better. It took me about a week which I think is longer than most. Have some Gasx in the house it will help.",

Those things are, from what I understand , about 90% accurate in picking up more aggressive tumors.if you have it done by a skilled radiologist. So it's a good sign that it picked up nothing You should talk to your URO about getting a saturation biopsy which takes many more samples with lower chance of missing something. Don't be too lax on this, being vigilant can make the difference between catching something in time, or not. But again, negative MRI is a good sign. More accurate than a CT scan",

However when it came to 2, 5, 7, and 10 year Biochemical recurrence free rate, the numbers for 10 year where in the low 90% range, on the CC and JH Nomograms, but 81% on the MSKCC website. Anybody have any thoughts on this? As good as my pathology report was, with no ECE, positive margins, or lymph nodes, it is bothering and concerning me that the GLeason was upgraded to a G 7 (3+4) , and it was at the apex.

There are all kinds of variations from the mean when it comes to numbers, averages etc. I know of one patient, diagnosed at Stage 4, Gleason 9, with extensisve mets, and a PSA of 5100. He was 41 years old. He will soon be celebrating his 52nd birthday, and last i heard, just a few months ago, his PSA was undetectable.

Those things are, from what I understand , about 90% accurate in picking up more aggressive tumors.if you have it done by a skilled radiologist. So it's a good sign that it picked up nothing You should talk to your URO about getting a saturation biopsy which takes many more samples with lower chance of missing something. Don't be too lax on this, being vigilant can make the difference between catching something in time, or not. But again, negative MRI is a good sign. More accurate than a CT scan",

Jimbow, just a guess, but i wonder if that <.01 was a lab error. Not to make you nervous, but i'd consider it suspect. And i would NOT wait 6 months I'd want a retest in 2 months, and if its up again, start looking for a good RO, to at least start a conversation. Probably, you wont begin SRT at .06, but probably around .1, not .2. And you dont want to first start looking for someone at .1, you want to have someone lined up so you can spring into action. I too was G(3+4) after surgery. I had negative FINAL margins, but margin was positive at the apex intra-operativly, so they cut more to get negative final margin. So my understanding is, that is better than positive margin, but not quite as good as intra operative positive, FINAL negative. I was <.02 till my 2 year PSA in Jan, when it was .02, and that was reconfirmed in February. I should know more in May, when i retest, Dr told me to retest in 3 months. He told me that at .1 is when they start talking about treatment. But i dont know that i will want to wait that long. Lets hope this is a false alarm for both of us.",

There are all kinds of variations from the mean when it comes to numbers, averages etc. I know of one patient, diagnosed at Stage 4, Gleason 9, with extensisve mets, and a PSA of 5100. He was 41 years old. He will soon be celebrating his 52nd birthday, and last i heard, just a few months ago, his PSA was undetectable.

Many years ago, in my 40's way before I dealt with PCa, I had an episode of bloody ejaculate and it really freaked me out. My PCP sent me to a urologist, who examined me and told me that it was likely a broken blood vessel from a particularly strong orgasm (which I did have). It only happened once. Call the Doc to be safe, but I'm guessing it's nothing, especially if it doesn't continue.",

Works in Manhattan so was taking the train. Me on the other hand, i have a 15 minute drive to my office and i do no physical labor, all computer and phone work. Andi didnt go back until week 4, and that was part time. And the reality is, i was somewhat fatigued until about 2-2 1/2 months out of surgery. So everyone is different.",

I have a friend, who had the catheter out on day 8 and went back to work on day 9 post surgery. He just couldn't stand staying home, so he started going back i think about 5 hours a day. Works in Manhattan so was taking the train. Me on the other hand, i have a 15 minute drive to my office and i do no physical labor, all computer and phone work. Andi didnt go back until week 4, and that was part time. And the reality is, i was somewhat fatigued until about 2-2 1/2 months out of surgery. So everyone is different.",

I eliminated a lot of my supplements, I only take the magnesium and d3 now because when I test for those the labs come back low, once I started taking them, I got into the normal range. I stopped taking a multi vitamin two years ago, my nutritionist said with the amount of vegetables I consume, I really don\u2019t need it. I love onions, (as my breath shows is evident LOL) , so I hope I don\u2019t have a problem with that. I\u2019m probably ok with magnesium and d3, but I\u2019ll ask the question in the MSKCC patient portal and a radiation nurse will get back to me tomorrow. Thanks again for the response.

So don't worry, things may look dark now, but you WILL get your life back. One suggestion.... It would be worthwhile, for you to request that your slides be sent to Dr Jonathan Epstein at Kohns Hopkins, (or David Bostwick, at Bostwick Labs) for a second look. The reading of prostate cells, and Gleason grading, can be very subjective, and usually local pathologists read all kinds f slides. Epstein and Bostwick are the acknowledged foremost e parts in prostate pathology, and it would be worth getting their opinion, so you have a better chance f knowing that you are dealing with Gleason 6. (Although even if it was G7, it wouldn't mean that you don't have a high chance of cure). Your job now is to get educated, take Chucks (highlander) advice and read the book, it's excellent, and meet with Drs from the various radiation treatments as well as surgeons. Getting educated will make you feel like you are back on firm footing. And when you finally make a decision on a treatment, it will be a big relief. Good luck, hang in there, and keep,us posted.",

It will come in useful, as it's very hard to get in and out of bed the first few days and also easier to sleep in with the catheter. In addition, it's a good change of pace since he'll be home fr a while Also, push him(if you have to) to walk. And then walk kore. And more. And more. It will help speed his recovery. Also, having Robotic, they will pump CO2 into his abdominal area to give the surgeon room to work. As a result, he will possibly have pain in his abdomen , shoulders, chest. Some have it bad others not. Just be prepared so if he does have it bad, you don't freak out. I had it so bad, that if the guys here didn't warn me about it, I would have thought I was having aheartattack. The walking will help a lot as moving around moves the gas, and when he passes it he will feel better. It took me about a week which I think is longer than most. Have some Gasx in the house it will help.",

It was good to see your report on the continence issue, as I am 3 weeks out of surgery and still wearing a pad, generally leaking about .7 ounces a day, (except for last night I had a bad night for some reason).

      "Content": "Moss, for what its worth, i waited to tell my children, both in their early, mid 30's. I wanted to know exactly what the pathology was, second opinion and all, what the initial prognosis was, and i wanted to wait till i decided exactly what treatment i would go with. Once i had that information and all the facts, i waited for the opportunity to tell them face to face (which i realize might be difficult for you in your situation.) I wanted to tell them while they looked at me and saw my (fake) positivity, and saw that i was not afraid. (i was, but we do anything for your kids, dont we?) After i told my son, i had to tell my daughter, but when i was ready, she was a few days away from leaving for a Carribean vacation, and i didnt want to ruin it for her. So i waited until she returned, and told her on Thanksgiving Day. Hardest conversation i've ever had to have with both of them. But they drew strength from seeing my attitude. And it all worked out. Just my opinion, and my approach, we are all different, as are all of our family dynamics.",

Just as another datapoint to add to your hapiness - my pathology was exactly like yours, upgrade to 7(3+4) from G6, negative everything, except pni. Only difference was 5% prostate involved by tumor, VS your 2% which is better by a hair. And my surgeon told me to celebrate. He said with that pathology, the chances of needing additional treatment or anything in the future are less than 5%. So happy day for you, put on a diaper (because alcohol will irritate your bladder) and drink your face off this weekend",

      "Content": "Question for the surgery guys. How did or do you feel 2-3 months past RALP.Aside from feeling fine, do you feel like everything is \"the same down there\" ? The more I think about it, I don't. It's hard to describe, but I feel different For one, I always feel something in my penis like there is urine collecting, or like I just pissed, even if I didn't. For another, at the end of a pee, I get a little pain just below the pubic bone. Maybe not pain, maybe a straining feeling, Also, and this is not a bad thing, except it doesn't make much sense - whereas I used to be semi constipated, having hard bowel movements and not always regular, since the surgery I have a large bowel movement pretty much every morning, and it is no longer hard. Like when I was in my 20s. I've been off Colace for 2 months. I don't think I'm fully explaining this feeling, I don't know how, I just know everything feels different down there, not bad, but not YHE same, and it's making me nervous . thinking about it. So I'm curious to know if others have somewhat different sensations in the area, both front and back a few months out. I would think, after 10 weeks, I'm pretty much healed by now, inside.",

      "Content": "1. No, the cancerous cells are looked at under. Microscope and identified at a cellular level. With that said, it is somewhat subjective, which is why a second opinion from a prostate specialist is so important in these cases 2. I don't think urologists generally request it, patients (knowledgeable ones) do 3. Never heard of Cytoscopy as routine pre surgical procedure. MRI more suitable I think. I'd run the other way, honestly, it's a needless painful invasive procedure in my opinion, (but I'm not a Dr) 4. Not sure about what % of second opinions are contrary to the first opinions. It's customary I believe , to send only the slides that were identified as containing cancer. That's what my pathology dept did as well. 5. Probably not first line automatically, although you could request it 6. Not sure. Just a guess. The first pathologist will defer to Epstein. Epstien is the Gold Standard. 7. Surgery that results in a final pathology does happen, but it's VERY rare. 8. I also got two opinions - from two urologists. Is the RO one who specializes in treating prostate cancer? If not, I'd go with urologist opinion. 9.just my opinion, but under the circumstances, I think 6 months is prudent. Maybe even 3. It's just a blood test Good luck, it's good that you are Ming slowly and deliberately on this. Stay on top of it though",

      "Content": "I got my PCa3 results today and it came back at a 26. The nurse told me, as a different nurse did 2 years ago, that the cutoff is 25, so i am on the cusp. Two years ago, it was 13. She also told me its not necessarily an indication of cancer, its a test that shows whether i have inherited the PC gene, much like the gene for Breast Cancer . I thought it was a test for presence of a genetic material given off by cancer cells, WHEN THEY ARE PRESENT. So i am confused. Because 1. i was pretty sure that i was right regarding what it showed, but the nurse seems pretty knowledgeable 2. from what i've read online, and what i got from a member of another forum, the normal cutoff is 35 not 25, but two nurses told me it was 25. Anybody know the right answers? If this is high, combined with a jump in my PSA from 3.1 to 4.3 over 6 months and a %fPSA of 12, i think i am screwed. Biopsy is tomorrow. I already have it in my mind to get appointments with Samadi and Tewari. UGH",

Will I get to a point where clamping off leaks comes without thinking, as a natural reflex, rather than feeling I have to make a conscious effort; the answers, and there were many, were a resounding yes, and they proved to be accurate. There are occasions where I leak a bit, but not enough to bother me and certainly not so much that I need to wear a pad. In fact, proud to say, I wear boxers LOL. I was 90% at about 8-10 weeks, but I continuously improved incrementally, for about 10-12 months. I tell you my experience, only to give you an idea what to expect, and to reassure you that indeed, you re doing great and ultimately, you will find yourself thinking less and less about this issue.",

You can probably get one (called a \"chuck\") or actually a handful, from the hospital before you check out. Good luck, stick with us, and keep us posted. Edit: P.S. - as you probably know, with a G6, assuming that holds, you will likely do really well as far as cancer elimination is concerned. Also, just curious - you said you reviewed the slides yourself - are you a pathologist?",

He is not just a surgeon,he is , to use a fellow members words to me, a scientist. And he is not only highly skilled, he is compassionate and has a terrific staff (very important when working with a high volume surgeon as a lot of your post op interaction will be with the staff, I.e.

Asks me if I drink alcohol (I don\u2019t aside from an occasional drink when I go out to dinner, but almost never). You know it\u2019s my second day of treatment. Why are you asking me about urinary issues? Then the RO Comes in. First time I\u2019ve met him, my RO is on vacation. this guy really had nothing to say and seemed totally disinterested. They had me drinking one 8 ounce cup of water before treatment. That had my bladder 2/3 full yesterday, which the tech said is fine but they don\u2019t want it to be less full than that. So today they upped me to 1 1/4 cups. They said it was a good result.",

I eliminated a lot of my supplements, I only take the magnesium and d3 now because when I test for those the labs come back low, once I started taking them, I got into the normal range. I stopped taking a multi vitamin two years ago, my nutritionist said with the amount of vegetables I consume, I really don\u2019t need it. I love onions, (as my breath shows is evident LOL) , so I hope I don\u2019t have a problem with that. I\u2019m probably ok with magnesium and d3, but I\u2019ll ask the question in the MSKCC patient portal and a radiation nurse will get back to me tomorrow. Thanks again for the response.

With those two answers no doubt you'll get many recommendations While I have seen the studies showing that after 250 surgeries the learning curve flattens, I believe that in this case, more is better. I would look for 1000 plus. I would highly recommend the surgeon I used, Dr Ash Tewari, in NYC. He's done over 6000 RALPS, and is highly regarded by his peers in PC world. He is not just a surgeon,he is , to use a fellow members words to me, a scientist. And he is not only highly skilled, he is compassionate and has a terrific staff (very important when working with a high volume surgeon as a lot of your post op interaction will be with the staff, I.e. RN, NP, PA. Also, there are fine surgeons at Mayo, Chuck can give you a name, and Cleveland Clinic. And Johns Hopkins is highly regarded as one of the best centers of care for Prostate Cancer. I'm sure others will follow. But seriously post your general location, and folks will Ero in. How to find the right surgeon? I used this and another forum to decide on the right guys to talk to before making my decision. Good luck",

Also a protective pad will probably be a good safety net, just in case, unless you dont care about your car seats. You can probably get one (called a \"chuck\") or actually a handful, from the hospital before you check out. Good luck, stick with us, and keep us posted. Edit: P.S. - as you probably know, with a G6, assuming that holds, you will likely do really well as far as cancer elimination is concerned.

He makes a point, you seem to have already made up your mind not to treat, in which case, there is no real advice that is actionable, that we can offer. You are in a tough situation. I think a positive mindset might help you however tough that might be. And the point made, of WHAT IF they come up with advances that can prolong quality of life in dementia patients, or even reverse the effects of dementia, is a good one. The advances being made today in modern medicine are astounding, and its quite possible that you will live with a good QUALITY OF LIFE for a much longer time than you susptect. Wouldn't it be a shame, if you decided not to treat your Prostate Cancer, and you remained fully competent mentally, but ended up dying a miserable death from PC that could have been prevented? I suggest that asking you, to ask yourself that question, is probably the best advice we can offer here. Unless and until you decide to treat In whatever you decide, I'm sure i speak for all here in wishing you the best of luck, and we hope you decide to get the biopsy done at the very least, and stick around here for help, advice and support.",

But they\u0092re all we\u0092ve got, at least as far as pure numbers go) I would discuss this with your doc, and maybe see an RO it\u0092s better to discuss with an RO than a surgeon. Ask questions like, how much added risk am I taking if I am undetectable and decide to wait.",

With those two answers no doubt you'll get many recommendations While I have seen the studies showing that after 250 surgeries the learning curve flattens, I believe that in this case, more is better. I would look for 1000 plus. I would highly recommend the surgeon I used, Dr Ash Tewari, in NYC. He's done over 6000 RALPS, and is highly regarded by his peers in PC world. He is not just a surgeon,he is , to use a fellow members words to me, a scientist. And he is not only highly skilled, he is compassionate and has a terrific staff (very important when working with a high volume surgeon as a lot of your post op interaction will be with the staff, I.e. RN, NP, PA. Also, there are fine surgeons at Mayo, Chuck can give you a name, and Cleveland Clinic. And Johns Hopkins is highly regarded as one of the best centers of care for Prostate Cancer. I'm sure others will follow. But seriously post your general location, and folks will Ero in. How to find the right surgeon? I used this and another forum to decide on the right guys to talk to before making my decision. Good luck",

      "Content": "Welcome Dan. Sounds like you are in a good position all things considered. You've gotten great advice above. Two things I would add... 1. Ask that your slides be sent for a second opinion, preferably to Dr Jonathan Epstein at Johns Hopkins. Reading prostate slides is. Tricky thing, very subjective and you want them read by a pathologist who only looks at prostate slides. Your local pathologist likely looks at all kinds of cells. 2. Chucks suggestion of 300 procedures is a minimum. Science backs up the fact that the learning curve starts to flatten after 250 procedures. But IMO, and it's only my opinion, is I want A recognized expert to do the surgery with at least 1000 surgeries under his belt. My surgeon, in NY had done over 6000 robotic surgeries at the time I had mine. Also, that 15 year survival doesn't mean much. If you are a true Gleason 6, you'll likely live way longer than that if something els doesn't kill you. I think thy might not even track stats after 15 years.",

      "Content": "Question for the surgery guys. How did or do you feel 2-3 months past RALP.Aside from feeling fine, do you feel like everything is \"the same down there\" ? The more I think about it, I don't. It's hard to describe, but I feel different For one, I always feel something in my penis like there is urine collecting, or like I just pissed, even if I didn't. For another, at the end of a pee, I get a little pain just below the pubic bone. Maybe not pain, maybe a straining feeling, Also, and this is not a bad thing, except it doesn't make much sense - whereas I used to be semi constipated, having hard bowel movements and not always regular, since the surgery I have a large bowel movement pretty much every morning, and it is no longer hard. Like when I was in my 20s. I've been off Colace for 2 months. I don't think I'm fully explaining this feeling, I don't know how, I just know everything feels different down there, not bad, but not YHE same, and it's making me nervous . thinking about it. So I'm curious to know if others have somewhat different sensations in the area, both front and back a few months out. I would think, after 10 weeks, I'm pretty much healed by now, inside.",

Just as another datapoint to add to your hapiness - my pathology was exactly like yours, upgrade to 7(3+4) from G6, negative everything, except pni. Only difference was 5% prostate involved by tumor, VS your 2% which is better by a hair. And my surgeon told me to celebrate. He said with that pathology, the chances of needing additional treatment or anything in the future are less than 5%. So happy day for you, put on a diaper (because alcohol will irritate your bladder) and drink your face off this weekend",

I decded to seek a second opinion, and 2 weeks later, i saw a doc in Manhattan at Columbia Presbyterian. He retook the PSA which got me to 2.7 but it was a different lab The PSAs were all 1 year (approx) apart, until it got to 2.7. At that point i had the biopsy, then changed doctors agai, because a prominent doc from Columbia moved to Long Island to become chairman of Winthrop Urology. , and the rest of the PSAs were all 6 months apart. The reason i had the biopsy at 2.7 was due to 1. consistent rise, EVERY time i had the test, and 2, family history (MY DAD). Did this after getting the same reco from 2 docs.",

      "Content": "ddayglo, thanks for responding. I have Walshs book, I bought it (and read much of it) at the time of my first biopsy two years ago. It was recommended to me by a family member who had the surgery done, by Dr Walsh. Re Vitamin D, I did have a vitamin D deficiency, which was resolved a few years ago with taking Vit D pills daily. Re MRI, my Uro mentioned it last visit, but for whatever reason this time he felt a biopsy was called for. So I'm going with it. He's pretty well known with good crews, and is Chairman of Urology at a major hospital Center, am Nd also clinical professor at Columbia Prysbetrian. So I've got to ask some questions, but have faith in what he thinks. So, anyone know, are the odds pretty high in my situation, that biopsy will be positive?",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by Walnut First of all, maybe your family history is a positive thing. If your dad was old enough to have dementia when he was diagnosed he must have been pretty old. Doesn't that give you hope that your cancer may be a non-aggressive type that may not require treatment? In my case, as I was in my late sixties, my doctor said that at my age I probably had prostate cancer because so many men have it at that age (this was early in the process, before I was diagnosed). The only question was......does it need treatment or is it better left alone because it will never impact your life? That's the question for you, I think. Treatment surely will impact your life.....perhaps severely. I suggest a LOT of research before doing anything you can't take back. My dad had dementia which was a result of something going wrong with anesthesia in open heart surgery, and passed in his mid 70's Question (for anyone): PSA GOING FROM 2.7 TO 3.1, TO 4.3 IN 18 MONTHS -Is that considered a rapid rise that might be a sign of AGGRESSIVE DISEASE? This is a big worry i have Thanks in advance",

      "Content": "Thanks for responding, Otago.... I think that the reason he is wanting to do a biopsy now is 1. the free psa of 12, 2. the bigger jump than in the past, and 3. t he hi grade pin, found in my first biopsy. The latter is probably the more important reason. As far as my dad is concerned, i am ashamed to say, i do not know his psa or gleason. I left it to his wife, although i did go to some of the appointments with him, i just didnt know anything and didnt even know what questions to ask. But i do know that he died of prostate cancer. His situation at diagnosis was that he was not healthy, had dementia, had recently had triple bypass and serious kidney problems, and was not a candidate for surgery, so he went right to shots (hormone therapy i believe). At that point he was already in a nursing home, and they just did the best they could. I regret to this day that i did not get more involved in his care",

      "Content": "PSA has been steadily rising over the last 5 years or so, startingat .7, (age 5, to 3.1 six months ago (age 64 -about to turn 64). The rises have been slow, .7, 1.1, 1.7, 2.1, 2.7, 2.9,2.7, then 3.1 six months ago. Went to uro doc today, got results - 4.3. Seems like a bigger jump than in the past. Also my fPSA was 12. and free to total ratio was 8.6. Had biopsy two year ago, which was negative for PC but showed Hi Grade Pin, in one of 14 cores. So between the large jump, the hi grade pin, and the low free psa, combined with my family history of PC (father), i am pretty much convinced that bad news is on the way. I am scheduled for biopsy next week. UGH. Am i wrong to think the odds of a negative biopsy are very much stacked against me here?",

I decded to seek a second opinion, and 2 weeks later, i saw a doc in Manhattan at Columbia Presbyterian. He retook the PSA which got me to 2.7 but it was a different lab The PSAs were all 1 year (approx) apart, until it got to 2.7. At that point i had the biopsy, then changed doctors agai, because a prominent doc from Columbia moved to Long Island to become chairman of Winthrop Urology. , and the rest of the PSAs were all 6 months apart. The reason i had the biopsy at 2.7 was due to 1. consistent rise, EVERY time i had the test, and 2, family history (MY DAD). Did this after getting the same reco from 2 docs.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by Walnut First of all, maybe your family history is a positive thing. If your dad was old enough to have dementia when he was diagnosed he must have been pretty old. Doesn't that give you hope that your cancer may be a non-aggressive type that may not require treatment? In my case, as I was in my late sixties, my doctor said that at my age I probably had prostate cancer because so many men have it at that age (this was early in the process, before I was diagnosed). The only question was......does it need treatment or is it better left alone because it will never impact your life? That's the question for you, I think. Treatment surely will impact your life.....perhaps severely. I suggest a LOT of research before doing anything you can't take back. My dad had dementia which was a result of something going wrong with anesthesia in open heart surgery, and passed in his mid 70's Question (for anyone): PSA GOING FROM 2.7 TO 3.1, TO 4.3 IN 18 MONTHS -Is that considered a rapid rise that might be a sign of AGGRESSIVE DISEASE?

I am scheduled for biopsy next week. UGH. Am i wrong to think the odds of a negative biopsy are very much stacked against me here?",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by Walnut First of all, maybe your family history is a positive thing. If your dad was old enough to have dementia when he was diagnosed he must have been pretty old. Doesn't that give you hope that your cancer may be a non-aggressive type that may not require treatment? In my case, as I was in my late sixties, my doctor said that at my age I probably had prostate cancer because so many men have it at that age (this was early in the process, before I was diagnosed). The only question was......does it need treatment or is it better left alone because it will never impact your life? That's the question for you, I think. Treatment surely will impact your life.....perhaps severely. I suggest a LOT of research before doing anything you can't take back. My dad had dementia which was a result of something going wrong with anesthesia in open heart surgery, and passed in his mid 70's Question (for anyone): PSA GOING FROM 2.7 TO 3.1, TO 4.3 IN 18 MONTHS -Is that considered a rapid rise that might be a sign of AGGRESSIVE DISEASE? This is a big worry i have Thanks in advance",

      "Content": "Jim, I had the 2.1 reading, with the local Uro i had been seeing all along. When it went to 2.1 he recommended biopsy. I decded to seek a second opinion, and 2 weeks later, i saw a doc in Manhattan at Columbia Presbyterian. He retook the PSA which got me to 2.7 but it was a different lab The PSAs were all 1 year (approx) apart, until it got to 2.7. At that point i had the biopsy, then changed doctors agai, because a prominent doc from Columbia moved to Long Island to become chairman of Winthrop Urology. , and the rest of the PSAs were all 6 months apart. The reason i had the biopsy at 2.7 was due to 1. consistent rise, EVERY time i had the test, and 2, family history (MY DAD). Did this after getting the same reco from 2 docs.",

Even if he did not, it is possible (less likely, but possible) that he may get back some function. And even if he doesn't, many couples find other ways of enjoying each other, ways that include orgasm by both parties. If he did have nerve sparing surgery, How do you know, 3 weeks post op, that your sex life wont be the same? It is way too early to come to such a conclusion. Most guys dont have Erectile Function right away. Sure, some guys dont get it back. Many though get it back in 6 months to a year. In fact, i read a post in another forum yesterday, about a guy who finally, without pills, injections or anything, suddenly experienced a return to somewhat normal function, 2 years after surgery. I think now is a good time to take one day at a time. Its way too early. And if he doesn't get it back, there are choices.",

When you do hve the biopsy, be prepared for some blood in urine for probably a few days, and bloody semen for a while, that eventually turns from red to brown. Nothing to be alarmed about.

      "Content": "EaScott, staging from. Biopsy is called clinical staging, vs staging after all tests and surgery if you have it, which is more definitive and called pathological staging. I assume he is ordering bone and CT scans? Which would be standard. Probably will show nothing, in which caseyoeuatage would remain T1, and I assume that's based on negative DRE, In other words, nothing felt on the digital rectal exam. If they find a spread outside the area, it old be upgraded (if that's the right word) to Stage t2a, assuming no lymph node involvement. You should request that your slides from BIopsy be sent to another lab that specializes in PC. Either Dr JOn Epatein at Johns Hopkins or David Bostwick at Bostwick laboratories. Also, that G8 (3+5) is unusual. I had one core labeled that way and it was downgraded to g6(3+3) by Epstein at Johns Hopkins Second opinion is almost a must, and it's easy, your Urologist gets these requests all the time, just tell them where you want it sent. If you say Epstein r Bostwick, that's all they will need, they have the information. Start doing your own research, the docs will usually oush their specialty, surgeons red SURGER Radiation Oncologists rec radiation. Your age might lean you towards surgery though, I think , not sure, that 70 is sort of borderline for SURGER. Others might know better than I. Sorry you need to be here dealing with this, but stick around and ask a lot of questions,you will learn plenty. Good luck",

      "Content": "On another forum there is a robust discussion about test sensitivity, and it was mentioned by one poster that his Dr told him that lately, they have seen a lot of guys coming back wh were formerly undetectable, with.1 readings, specifically from Quest Diagnostics. In the posters caw, I think he said he came back with .1, then tested at Labcorp, and it came back undetectable. I'm curious if guys here have either experienced this or heard anything about it. Obviously there are variations from lab to lab. But uPSA fluctuations between <.01 and .1 is more than noise. I'm concerned about this, because I had my 9 month blood draw today at Quest labs, and will now be on edge for a week, waiting for results. If it comes back detectable, let alone .1, I'll likely fall down and break my skull",

Even if he did not, it is possible (less likely, but possible) that he may get back some function. And even if he doesn't, many couples find other ways of enjoying each other, ways that include orgasm by both parties. If he did have nerve sparing surgery, How do you know, 3 weeks post op, that your sex life wont be the same? It is way too early to come to such a conclusion. Most guys dont have Erectile Function right away. Sure, some guys dont get it back. Many though get it back in 6 months to a year. In fact, i read a post in another forum yesterday, about a guy who finally, without pills, injections or anything, suddenly experienced a return to somewhat normal function, 2 years after surgery. I think now is a good time to take one day at a time. Its way too early. And if he doesn't get it back, there are choices.",

      "Content": "mjim, welcome, sorry you have to be here. Well the good news is, Gleason 6 is not a very aggressive cancer. In fact, many Drs will recommend Active Surviellance rather than surgery or radiation, with a G6. Although, the fact that you had positive samples from both sides of the prostate might disqualify you from some AS programs. Question: Did you investigate other options besides surgery? I dont want to put a monkey wrench in your plan, and keep in mind, I'm a surgery guy, and was succesfully (so far) treated, with no long lasting side effects. But i think its really important to look at all options before cutting. Also did you ask a lot of questions about the experience and results of your surgeon? Robotic? Open? How many surgeries under his belt (my opinion is you want at least 1000, some say 300). Whats his % of positive margins, what % of his patients regain full continence, full erectile functions. The reality is that most urologists surgeons, and they will recommend surgery. But there are many other options (brachy (seeds or HDR), sbrt (Cyberknife cousin), etc. Even if you want surgery, you should explore them. If you do this you will be more confident in your final decision. There is no rush with a G6. Although keep in mind that 30% of surgery cases have their Gleason score upgraded on final pathology after surgery (i was, and thats why i chose surgery, i wanted to know the real pathology). There are two books you should read, \"Surviving Prostate Cancer\" by Dr Patrick Walsh, and Invasion of the Prostate Snatchers\" by Dr Mark Scholz. The first is written by a world reknowned surgeon, and the second by a Dr who is a big proponent of not overtreating, and doing AS where it makes sense. If you read both books it will give you not only a good education, but both points of view, and it will help you make good decisions I hope i have not clouded your thought process and your decisiveness, i am hoping to just be sure you have thought this through, and done your due dilligence.",

      "Content": "On another forum there is a robust discussion about test sensitivity, and it was mentioned by one poster that his Dr told him that lately, they have seen a lot of guys coming back wh were formerly undetectable, with.1 readings, specifically from Quest Diagnostics. In the posters caw, I think he said he came back with .1, then tested at Labcorp, and it came back undetectable. I'm curious if guys here have either experienced this or heard anything about it. Obviously there are variations from lab to lab. But uPSA fluctuations between <.01 and .1 is more than noise. I'm concerned about this, because I had my 9 month blood draw today at Quest labs, and will now be on edge for a week, waiting for results. If it comes back detectable, let alone .1, I'll likely fall down and break my skull",

      "Content": "mjim, welcome, sorry you have to be here. Well the good news is, Gleason 6 is not a very aggressive cancer. In fact, many Drs will recommend Active Surviellance rather than surgery or radiation, with a G6. Although, the fact that you had positive samples from both sides of the prostate might disqualify you from some AS programs. Question: Did you investigate other options besides surgery? I dont want to put a monkey wrench in your plan, and keep in mind, I'm a surgery guy, and was succesfully (so far) treated, with no long lasting side effects. But i think its really important to look at all options before cutting. Also did you ask a lot of questions about the experience and results of your surgeon? Robotic? Open? How many surgeries under his belt (my opinion is you want at least 1000, some say 300). Whats his % of positive margins, what % of his patients regain full continence, full erectile functions. The reality is that most urologists surgeons, and they will recommend surgery. But there are many other options (brachy (seeds or HDR), sbrt (Cyberknife cousin), etc. Even if you want surgery, you should explore them. If you do this you will be more confident in your final decision. There is no rush with a G6. Although keep in mind that 30% of surgery cases have their Gleason score upgraded on final pathology after surgery (i was, and thats why i chose surgery, i wanted to know the real pathology). There are two books you should read, \"Surviving Prostate Cancer\" by Dr Patrick Walsh, and Invasion of the Prostate Snatchers\" by Dr Mark Scholz. The first is written by a world reknowned surgeon, and the second by a Dr who is a big proponent of not overtreating, and doing AS where it makes sense. If you read both books it will give you not only a good education, but both points of view, and it will help you make good decisions I hope i have not clouded your thought process and your decisiveness, i am hoping to just be sure you have thought this through, and done your due dilligence.",

      "Content": "Well, my biopsy was done this morning, and it was not even close to as bad as i expected. The Uro saw i was really nervous (and looped from the Xanax) and i told him i had a low pain threshold and had heard some horror stories. And i asked him if he could just make sure to wait until the lidocaine really kicked in before getting into his shoot-em-up with the gun, it would be appreciated. He was really good. Very careful, went in slow as promised, and i really felt no pain at all, only, as someone here said, a little annoyance. So thank God thats over. I have a little of my sanity back, even though still out of it from the Xanax. I think i can stay relaxed until early next week, as I get closer to getting the results. Doc is out next week, so i asked him to call me with results rather than make an appointment and having to wait two weeks. I asked his assistant to email me when the results come in, and give me an idea of when i will get the call. I would hate to be sitting at lunch with a client and get a call from the doc telling me i have cancer. From the Biopsy itself, he said my prostate was 33 grms, (i think its grams), higher than the \"normal\" 20 gms, but normally bigger for my age. So i am hoping that could be the reason for the PSA rise. Also he said that there was nothing abnormal that he saw in the ultrasound, and re-iterated that my DRE last week was totally normal. So i am cautiously optimistic. Interesting point: last week he did the DRE before sending me for psa bloodwork, and it jumped to 2.7 (from 2.2 a week earler). I know it might be attributed to different lab, and normal fluctiations, but i also asked him today if it could be a result of the DRE being done prior to the PSA. His response surprised me - he said that they don;t really believe, like many do, that PSA is elevated if done after a DRE. From all I've read here, i would scratch my head. But this place is one of the top 5 urology hospitals in the U.S. And the doc has great credentials, is published, does a lot of research etc. Wierd. Anyway, nothing to do now but wait a week or 10 days.",

      "Content": "When he says hard 7, he is referring to the (4+3), which means it was Gleason 7, made up of a majority of grade 4 cells, with grade 3 (the indolent kind) being anywhere from 5-49% of the core. This is, as opposed to a Gleason 7 (3+4) which tends to be less aggressive, as the majority of cells in that core would have been grade 3, less aggressive. In either case, stay positive, because you were not a gleason 8, 9 or 10, which are way more aggressive. What you want to know is after surgery and after examinging the entire prostate, are you still G7 (4+3) OR were you upgraded to a higher gleason, which happens about 30% of the time (i was upgraded), or were you downgraded to a G6 which happens less frequently but does happen (and would be fantastic news) And as others have said, were your margins negative was there any evidence of escape from the prostate capsule, was there any lymph node involvement, seminal vesicle involvement. Also did the surgeon leave the nerve bundles (controlling ED) intact, or did he have to take part or all of them. Keep in mind that he most important thing aside from Gleason score, is negative margins, i think even more important than escape from the prostate. You could have cells that have escaped from the prostate, but still have negative margins and that would be good.",

I'm not complaining about my situation, a lot of guys here have it way worse than me, and even with a probable recurrence, i know i am in a decent position. Its just taking a mental toll on me.

      "Content": "Ernest, sorry to see your PSA jumping around like that. I'm in a \"similar, but not quite the same\" boat. Surgery January 2015, by Tewari, rock star surgeon at my Sinai in NYC. Undetectable at <.02 until the 2 year mark when I hit .02 (no <). Five months later, May 2015, .033 (different lab). Next test coming up in a few weeks. Like your surgeon mine said he's not worried. I told him if it was his prostate cancer I wouldn't be worried either. He said they do nothing until it hits .1, at which time he would do imaging, which I don't understand because at .1 most conventional imaging won't show anything. I took it upon myself to go and see Dr. Zelefsky , vice chair of radiation oncologyat MSKCC , and really well known and respected for PC. He told me that at this point he would not call it a probable recover expect a possible tou he told me that at this point he would not call it a probable recurrence only a POSSIBLE recurrence. Said he is not inclined to wait for some magic number, like .1, he would treat as soon as a clear trend was evident. There have been numerous studies showing that earlier Salvage radiation treatment successful when surgery fails If I were in your shoes, I would start testing more frequently and if it keeps rising, hit it. Regarding your second question, I wouldn't depend on my surgeon for ADT. ID want that decision made by a medical oncologist, or in the case of add as an adjunct to Salvage radiation, I'd depend on the radiation oncologist. Let's hope neither of us ever identifies a clear upward trend. I truly hope your PSA drops at the next test if it doesn't I'd start considering treatment. Keep us posted",

It stands to reason the more biopsies you have the more total cores looked t, so the odds do go down somewhat. But of course you can never be sure (you can never be sure.....the curse of all types of cancer) I believe I recall in one of our conversations that you had decided no more biopsies if your PSA remained more or less stable. If I'm correct, is there something that's making you change your thoughts on that?",

      "Content": "Another, you make an excellent point. When I lost my \"<\" and went from <.02 to .02, my Dr said \"I'm not worried at this point\". Guess what. I wouldn't worry if it was HIS prostate either. I would hve rather heard \"this may or may not be a precursor to BCR. If it turns out to be the latter, here's what might happen/here are your options. I think also, a part of the problem, at least for the guys who had surgery, is the Dr. who does the PSA and then naturally, has the discussion (or non discussion) with you, is a surgeon. Not an MO, or RO. If I see my next test or two continue to trend up, or it gets to .04, m not waiting for .1 or .2. I'm not asking my surgeon what happens next. I'm headed to the best RO I can find to at least discuss, then I'm contacting an MO that specializes in PC for guidance. It's all on us, we need to decide what should prompt action. Not the Drs.

      "Content": "Well, my biopsy was done this morning, and it was not even close to as bad as i expected. The Uro saw i was really nervous (and looped from the Xanax) and i told him i had a low pain threshold and had heard some horror stories. And i asked him if he could just make sure to wait until the lidocaine really kicked in before getting into his shoot-em-up with the gun, it would be appreciated. He was really good. Very careful, went in slow as promised, and i really felt no pain at all, only, as someone here said, a little annoyance. So thank God thats over. I have a little of my sanity back, even though still out of it from the Xanax. I think i can stay relaxed until early next week, as I get closer to getting the results. Doc is out next week, so i asked him to call me with results rather than make an appointment and having to wait two weeks. I asked his assistant to email me when the results come in, and give me an idea of when i will get the call. I would hate to be sitting at lunch with a client and get a call from the doc telling me i have cancer. From the Biopsy itself, he said my prostate was 33 grms, (i think its grams), higher than the \"normal\" 20 gms, but normally bigger for my age. So i am hoping that could be the reason for the PSA rise. Also he said that there was nothing abnormal that he saw in the ultrasound, and re-iterated that my DRE last week was totally normal. So i am cautiously optimistic. Interesting point: last week he did the DRE before sending me for psa bloodwork, and it jumped to 2.7 (from 2.2 a week earler). I know it might be attributed to different lab, and normal fluctiations, but i also asked him today if it could be a result of the DRE being done prior to the PSA. His response surprised me - he said that they don;t really believe, like many do, that PSA is elevated if done after a DRE. From all I've read here, i would scratch my head. But this place is one of the top 5 urology hospitals in the U.S. And the doc has great credentials, is published, does a lot of research etc. Wierd. Anyway, nothing to do now but wait a week or 10 days.",

      "Content": "Thanks everyone for the hopeful comments, and for the warm welcome back. Intellectually I know that it could very well be a statistical anamoly. Emotionally though, as I'm sure everyone here knows, it's a killer of a thing to anticipate. It could go either way as we all know. The question is what was the last result 6 months ago? Was the true number .001? Or was it .019. I can't know that because the assay only measures to anything .02 or higher, thus the result <.02. If the true number was .001, I've got a problem. If it was .019, then a move to .020 is insignificant for sure. Then if it's positive again, and turns out it's a Recurrence, how do I know when it recurred. Might have been w months ago. Do we assume it was 2 years, since the test was done 2 years post RALP? Or could it have started soon fire my last test 6bmonths ago? Unknowable. The NP when she called with the result 3. Weeks ago told me they still consider it undetectable. But the fact is, it was measurable. I was told they don't really worry bout it until it hits .1. If in fact this is a recurrence, I don't plan on waiting that long. If it gets to .05, maybe .04, I'm off to see the nuke specialist. Which, from what I understand has a lower chance of working, when you had positive margins. So you can see, my head, which had been fairly com up until a day or two, is spinning. @ron, Chuck, I her you on the uPSA vs STANDARD PSA. But I think once you start with uPSA, it's hard to go back. And I would want to know sooner, if it's creeping up. @Micheal - my first few tests were done at Quest, and were all <.02. Then I had. 3 month test come back at 3.8 (no typo) which was an error that the Senior VP of oncology testing could not figure out how it happened, (I had a phone call with him because I was pissed) and I lost confidence in their process no started testing at my DRs (Tewari) hospital lab , mt Sinai in NY. The first two of those tests came back at 0.00, that's how they report it. Then the next two came back at <.02. I scrutinized those reports and found that the two 0.00's were a different assay than the last two. Now, the .02 reading without the <, was done on the same assay as the last two <02's. So I don't think it's the assay. I guess I'll know more tomorrow, seeing the Dr at 11am, but will likely get a phone call with the results by 9:30-9:45. I'll report back Thanks again.",

Until 3 weeks go t my 2 year test, when it came back at .02. Nurse practitioner called me with results NS told me it's still considered undetectable. But clearly, it was measurable, unlike previous tests. They suggested retest at my Drs appointment which is scheduled for this Friday. I am going in tomorrow for the blood draw so he has the results when I see him. I know it could be a blip. Or maybe not. Shitting bricks tonight. Ken",

Don\u2019t forget, the last couple of weeks you may be fatigued. And I don\u2019t recall but if you are doing HT, even tougher. I am planning on doing an hour commute each way, which I anticipate to be a grind, but I\u2019ll take public transportation, and probably do it only w-4 days a week, stay at a friends apartment the other two days. If you can afford the most comfortable option, I\u2019d look for a hotel, maybe an extended stay place, like Residence Inn by Marriott. In fact, ask the hospital you get treated at, they may have some options for out of town patients, or a deal for patient discounts with local hotels.",

Reading prostate slides is very subjective, and should be done by a prostate expert. Most local pathologists read many different types of slides. Even if they specialize in Genoutory pathology, they look at prostate, bladder, kidney, ovarian, etc.",

I would retest PSA to make sure the .12 is not lab error. Once you rule that out, I think you should get started with SRT as soon as feasible. But I\u2019m not a doctor. Or even one of the more knowledgeable guys here. Did the Dr mention hormone therapy with the SRT?",

But with favorable intermediate risk of g7(3+4), and a PSA thatbis still relatively low, you can probably avoid HT for now. Just my opinion, like I said I\u2019m not a doc. Qualifier....my RO at MSKCC said with my current PSA at .07, he would be comfortable with me not doing HT with SRT. But if I waited until my PSA got to .1, he would be \u201cmuch less comfortable\u201d. (I too, am g7(3+4) That\u2019s his opinion, and while he\u2019s a top RO, there is no black and white answer, it\u2019s all a judgement call.",

      "Content": "Thanks everyone for the hopeful comments, and for the warm welcome back. Intellectually I know that it could very well be a statistical anamoly. Emotionally though, as I'm sure everyone here knows, it's a killer of a thing to anticipate. It could go either way as we all know. The question is what was the last result 6 months ago? Was the true number .001? Or was it .019. I can't know that because the assay only measures to anything .02 or higher, thus the result <.02. If the true number was .001, I've got a problem. If it was .019, then a move to .020 is insignificant for sure. Then if it's positive again, and turns out it's a Recurrence, how do I know when it recurred. Might have been w months ago. Do we assume it was 2 years, since the test was done 2 years post RALP? Or could it have started soon fire my last test 6bmonths ago? Unknowable. The NP when she called with the result 3. Weeks ago told me they still consider it undetectable. But the fact is, it was measurable. I was told they don't really worry bout it until it hits .1. If in fact this is a recurrence, I don't plan on waiting that long. If it gets to .05, maybe .04, I'm off to see the nuke specialist. Which, from what I understand has a lower chance of working, when you had positive margins. So you can see, my head, which had been fairly com up until a day or two, is spinning. @ron, Chuck, I her you on the uPSA vs STANDARD PSA. But I think once you start with uPSA, it's hard to go back. And I would want to know sooner, if it's creeping up. @Micheal - my first few tests were done at Quest, and were all <.02. Then I had. 3 month test come back at 3.8 (no typo) which was an error that the Senior VP of oncology testing could not figure out how it happened, (I had a phone call with him because I was pissed) and I lost confidence in their process no started testing at my DRs (Tewari) hospital lab , mt Sinai in NY. The first two of those tests came back at 0.00, that's how they report it. Then the next two came back at <.02. I scrutinized those reports and found that the two 0.00's were a different assay than the last two. Now, the .02 reading without the <, was done on the same assay as the last two <02's. So I don't think it's the assay. I guess I'll know more tomorrow, seeing the Dr at 11am, but will likely get a phone call with the results by 9:30-9:45. I'll report back Thanks again.",

On the other hand, with a G9 positive margin, i guess it makes sense. I think the most important thing you can do is find the most experienced, well reputed, RO you can find to do the job, assuming you go ahead with it. Also consider consulting with a medical oncologist. Suggestion - Prostate Oncology Associates in Marina Del Rey California. I did a phone consult with them. They get all yoru records, and then do a one hour phone call for $600. Drs Scholz (wrote the book \"invasion of the Prostate Snatchers\", Dr Turner, and Dr Lam, all have great reps and all they do is prostate cancer.",

      "Content": "I am 38000 feet up, on my way home from a 10 day trip to Baton Rouge, Orlando, and Lake Worth, Florida, all for different reasons. While I was gone, I didn't spend as much time on this forum, the other PC forum I'm on, or the ovarian cancer forum I'm on. Not completely off the forums, but much less, mostly because I was very busy. I have to say, it was a great respite. I thought less about cancer. Which was nice, because lately it seems like cancer has occupied my thoughts more than any other topic. Which truly sucks. Anyone else feel this way? Anyway, my respite is about to end. I'll be back at work on Monday, and on Friday I have an appointment with my urologist. Which means -on Tuesday, Wednesday or Thursday, (haven't decided yet) I'll go for my blood draw for PSA. January was 2 years since surgery, and up till then I was <.02. But in January, then again in February I lost the <, and I was .02 both times. So this 3 month test is a big one for me, and I'm starting to sweat. On top of that, my wife is having a CT Scan on Friday, 1st one since finishing chemo for ovarian cncer, 5 weeks ago. She won't get the results for 10 days, when she sees the Dr. But I'll get my results the next day. So I don't know if I should have the blood draw 1, 2 or 3 days before the appointment. The only reason I'm c0nsidering Tuesday is because I have to be in Manhattan that day for business, and it would save me a Trip. But if I do it Tuesday, I will get the results Wednesday, and if it's higher (showing a trend) then I have to wait 2 days to see the Dr and have him talk me off the ledge. What to do, what to do. Just venting, thanks for listening. I really really don't want to recur.😰 (call me Captain Obvious)🙄",

So there\u2019s that. As I said to Roblee, I\u2019ll probably pull the trigger, I\u2019m aggressive by nature, but I may want my surgeon and RO to discuss it among themselves first. They know each other as they travel in the same circles and I\u2019m told they work well together (by the surgeon).

At the reco of a friend/member here, I met today with the chair of RAd Onc at Cleveland Clinic in Florida. It was a long meeting, and very informative. The short version is.... He recommends treating soon (to review, I was undetectable until the 2 year post op mark, then .02, .033, .033, .046, 060, see signature below) he cited this study... /jamanetwork.com/journals/jamaoncology/article-abstract/2670381?redirect=true A multi institutional study with n=1566, it showed an advantage to treating below .1, vs treating .1 - .5. The entire cohort was adverse pathology. While I had negative final margins, the RO felt that because my frozen section intraoperative margin was positive, and at the apex, my negative final margin was questionable, and he placed a high probability on the PSA coming from cells left in the prostate bed, thus a relatively high probability of a good result. He said if I wanted to wait a few months he didn\u0092t think it would put me at increased risk. He didn\u0092t put too much weight into my low Decipher score, saying I could be one of the 3% that has recurrence, nor did he put much weight in the oncoDx Grid report that predicted poor response to SRT, saying there was not enough data to validate it yet, too small a sample. I also asked him what he thinks might happen if I decided to do nothing. His response, a 50% chance that 10 years from now I would be living a happy life with no issues related to PC. And a 50% chance that I\u0092d have some serious problems in 10 years. I don\u0092t like those odds. He said with their machine, Varian Edge, I think, the chance of permanent side effects was less than 5% (but I should expect transient side effects) I am meeting with Dr Zelefsky, RO at MSKCC, mid June. I will have one more PSA before that meeting. I am inclined to look fir one more increased PSA after the Zelefsky meeting, then taking action, although that also depends on what the pre-Zelefsky PSA shows. I\u0092ve pretty much tossed aside my Surgeons advice to do nothing until/unless i get to .2. I wish their was a black and white answer, but there apparently is not. So the beat goes on. One thing I did not ask, is whether Medicare would approve early Salvage . Anybody know the answer from experience?",

Until 3 weeks go t my 2 year test, when it came back at .02. Nurse practitioner called me with results NS told me it's still considered undetectable. But clearly, it was measurable, unlike previous tests. They suggested retest at my Drs appointment which is scheduled for this Friday. I am going in tomorrow for the blood draw so he has the results when I see him. I know it could be a blip. Or maybe not. Shitting bricks tonight. Ken",

There was even a small wet spot in the blanket covering me. WTH? I had a strong urge to pee, and got up, was able to control it, then, when in the bathroom,took the longest pee I've taken since the catheter came out No idea where this came from, I guess I'm not really continent.

In fact there's a good chance that something else will do you in other than prostate cancer, which is usually a slow growing, highly treatable disease. Did you get the pathology report? What was your Gleason score/Grade? As far as biopsy, you've had an unfortunate experience to say the least, and a highly unusual one. What does the urologist say about it? I truly hope your symptoms resolve. Generally speaking, biopsy should be a fairly benign procedure, without such extreme consequences. And unfortunately, it's the only way to get a definitive diagnosis, so often, it's necessary. Wishing you best of luck, hope you recover from this and have many years left to enjoy life.",

But that might change if/when I actually say to the doc \u201clet\u2019s do this\u201d. Your comment about no black and white answers is spoken for truth. That\u2019s what makes this so hard. My surgeon says he\u2019s seen many guys go to .1, even .2 and either drop or level off. So that gives me pause. But I tend to be aggressive in my approach so I\u2019ll probably move on this sooner than .2 Hope you and the Mrs are doing well.",

I should clarify - when the doc said the DRE was normal (he actually used the word 'fine\") i believe what he meant was (based on our conversation from the last visit) that there were no lumps and it was soft.

Also, Highlander, no i have no urinary symptoms. I get up once at night, SOMETIMES, but i do dring a ton of water, even at night. I dont have dripping. My stream is not what i would consider weak, although i dont piss like a racehorse the way i did in my 30's. So I am pretty much asymptomatic.

Curious - i mentioned also in a previous post, when i asked my current doc about pain management he seemed rather flip about it, he said its no big deal, he just gives \" a little lydocaine around the area of the prostate\" , and when asked said he doesnt numb the area prior to the lydocaine injection. No gel either. Is that standard? Should i be looking for something different? I don't have a great tolerance level for pain. Thanks again, in advance to everyone.

Doc did digital rectal exam, prostate felt normal. Gave me choice - biopsy now, or wait 3 months. Told me, while you can never be sure, he feels 3 months wait would not present any real risks. I asked what he would do if it was him - he said he would do the biopsy, and he has, in a similar situation. Said the threshold at my age is 3.5, but rising level, with family history is cause for concern. I found an online calculator that showed the velocity is .37, not sure of the exact dates i put in but they weren't far off. I've read that there is controversy about how important velocity is. I told the doc i would come back in three months for retake but i dont know if i am doing the right thing I am in NY area, i hear Columbia Presbyterian has high reputation docs for this. Should i 1. do the biopsy 2. wait the three months and retake PSA 3. retake PSA in a month or two (doc didn't date the scrip) 3. get a second opinion immediately Also, do any docs put you to sleep for the biopsy? I've heard it is pretty painful. Very nervous, any guidance would be really appreciated.",

My primary care doc, who is a cardiologist, said i should do the biopsy, but i'm ignoring him on this one, he's the type that if i show up at his office with a cold, he sends me for a brain scan. Update - i called the urologist back, and asked him some questions (below with his responses) . I got the questions from readin this forum, and he said they were great questions, all the right one's, so thank you. i asked 1. should we do free psa, psa3, before doing a biopsy. His response was he generally does those tests when the PSA is above 4. Since my PSA is 2.2, he thinks the results wouldn't be useful 2. What about CIPRO? - His response was that he uses CIPRO alot, but its more likely to be an infection, when there is a sudden spike, as opposed to my situation which has been trending up over a few years, slowly 3. Would doing a biopsy with what might be such an apparently very early stage situation increase the chances of false negative? He said it wouldn't 4. does he use ultrasound to guide the biopsy - he said yes 5. what does he do about pain management - he said it wasn't really necessary, he just uses a little lydocaine around the prostate. I followed up with a question about gel to numb the area before the lydocaine injection, he said he doesnt use it , there is not that much pain frmo the lydocaine injection. He said regarding teh cipro, even though my situation was not typical of an infection it was worth a try (why didnt he try it before i brought it up?) So he gave me a prescription and said to retake in a month. I said ok. Last thing i told him was that he shouldn't be surprised if i request the records because i would go for a second opinion before i do anything invasive (like a biopsy). He was totally cool with that (as he should be, it wouldn't matter to me if he wasnt) So that leads me to my next move. I contacted a Doc who was recommended to me at Columbia Presbyterian, Dr DeCastro, for a second opinion, i am going to see him next Friday. Maybe I am wrong, but it bothers me that the doc i am seeing is a one doc practice in a small local office. He was recommended to me by my Primary Care Doc,but you know how that goes, they are all buddies. So i have no way of knowing who is good, but i figure at Columbia, they are well known in Urology, i think on a par with Hopkins, and why not consult with the best. So we'll see. I will be pretty nervous until this is resolved one way or the other, even though i know that if it turns out to be a problem, it is in all likelyhood very early and curable. I can't even imagine having an \"i have cancer\" conversation with my 29 - 30 year old kids, no matter how good the prognosis. I think thats what scares me most. It will be a long week.

You should def send your slides to dr Jonathan Epstein, at Johns Hopkins for 2nd opinion, he is the worlds recognized expert in prostate cancer pathology. Your Dr will know him, and you might be able to just ask your Drs office to arrange it. Otherwise, here\u0092s a link with info and instructions.... http://pathology.jhu.edu/department/...ondopinion.cfm Look at all options, surgery, and different types of radiation, SBRT (Cyberknife), LDR Brachytherapy (seeds), HDR Brachytherapy, even IG-IMRT. THEY WILL ALL LIKELY CURE YOU. ITS IMPORTANT TO SPEAK TO AN EXPERT IN EACH OF THESE METHODOLOGIES. They will all favor their own. Get educated then make up your own mind. You should have an open mind to Active Surveillance. But if you are not wired for it, totally understandable. Genomic testing might make you more comfortable with it. Or less. Walsh\u0092s book is an excellent start to your education. You are in a good position. Stay calm, learn and you have plenty of time to decide. There is no wrong decision here.",

      "Content": "Chuck, i could be wrong, apologies if thats the case. But my understanding is that after RP surgery, they consider a BCR/Bio Chemical Recurrence, to be a rise to .1, followed by a second reading at that number or higher. After radiation, it would be a rise from nadir, followed by 2 consecutive rises after that. To Thewife - your husband is lucky to have you as his advocate. I AGREE with you that waiting 6 months is too long. If i were you i would ask him what the number is that he uses to signal BCR, and at what point he would recommend SRT. And i would also insist on a PSA retake sooner than 6 months. In fact, i would be asking for a retake in 2 months, 3 max. Also, there have been studies done that have shown in certain situations, the max benefit from SRT comes if its started earler, as early as PSA of .03. I do not recall 100%, but i think that was a study done specifically on G8-10 patients, so if thats the case, it may not apply. Good luck, please keep us posted",

      "Content": "Tony, most doctors recommend Hormone Therapy IN CONJUNCTION WITH SRT these days, especially with g7 (4+3) or greater. But with favorable intermediate risk of g7(3+4), and a PSA thatbis still relatively low, you can probably avoid HT for now. Just my opinion, like I said I\u2019m not a doc. Qualifier....my RO at MSKCC said with my current PSA at .07, he would be comfortable with me not doing HT with SRT. But if I waited until my PSA got to .1, he would be \u201cmuch less comfortable\u201d. (I too, am g7(3+4) That\u2019s his opinion, and while he\u2019s a top RO, there is no black and white answer, it\u2019s all a judgement call.",

Tendency to recommend SRT much later than RO\u2019s. I\u2019m guessing it\u2019s becuase RO\u2019s tend to read more about the latest data pointing to the benefits of Starting SRT earlier. I think I mentioned in your previous thread, I\u2019ve seen one RO who recommended I start SRT now, or soon, and my PSA is at .06. And I\u2019m seeing another RO who after seeing my last two psa\u2019s, .046 and .06, had his secretary call me and say he wants to see me to discuss treatment. Meanwhile my surgeon, well known and world reknowned, tells me to wait till .2, then we\u2019ll do imaging. So it\u2019s a quandary, but my gut tells me that we both should put more weight in what the ro\u2019s Say. This sure does suck. But it is what it is. We aren\u2019t gonna die from this crap.worst case, it makes our life miserable for a while. But we soldier on",

      "Content": "Stuntmole, one of the most frustrating parts of recovery is the urinary leakage, at least for me.but it gets better. Everything you describe, sounds normal, including the burning while peeling . The day I got the catheter out, I remember having yo walk up,and down the halls after drinking water, so they could see me pee on my own before letting me go home. I remember walking back and forth fro about 3 hours, then I sat down for a few minutes as my legs needed a rest. When I got up, I noticed the chair was soaking wet. After feeling my sweatpants, I realizedthey were soaked. I would keep doing the Kegels. I started 4 times a day, each time was one set of 10 reps, holding 10 seconds, followed by 10 seconds f rest. I'm finally seeing progress, no,leaking In tHE LAST 36 hours, and last night I slept almost 6 hours without waking up to pee. That was the first time I went more than 3 hours of straight sleep since the surgery. So my point is, I went through the same frustatrayions as you are, but if you are diligent about Kegels, you will likely do well.",

      "Content": "Samie, lots of good advice above. Especially from those who told you in one way or another that all is not lost. Has he had an MRI? A 3 Tesla Multiparametric MRI will show with 95% accuracy, whether the cancer has left the prostate capsule. I think that is what you should be looking to find out. If it hasnt its clearly curable with surgery. Even if it has, it might be. But if its contained, its a strong case for surgery. Also, consider sending the biopsy slides for a second opinion to either Dr Jonathan Epstein at Johns Hopkins or David Bostwick at Bostwick Laboratories. Both are experts in prostate pathology, as opposed to most local pathologists who look at all kinds of slides. It is not unusual to have a gleason score changed on second opinion, reading those slides is very subjective. If you were to be downgraded to a gleason 6 (3+3) it would change everything. Of course the PSA of 39 is troubling. But its not the end all. It could be partially attributed to infection or inflammation of the prostate.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by mstevens7878 I've had 2 prostatectomies, the last about a year ago. I am 64, and after the second one really had to rely on ED drugs completely. I did experience negative side effects at first (flushed face, back/leg soreness, headaches, dry mouth, stuffy nose) but most of the time even a half dose would seem as effective and really cut down on the side effects. I'm not making alot of money right now, so I have been ordering generic versions from this site http://goo.gl/oNqHkh, my insurance that covers everything else will not cover ED meds at all (I am prescribed to both Cialis & Viagra) and this pharmacy ships to me, and is way cheaper. The drugs are in the same amounts and seem to work exactly the same. Has anyone here had any experience with the \"generic\" versions that are available? How on earth did you have TWO prostatectomies?",

But the authors say it isn\u0092t clear whether reduced screening is responsible. What other thing could be responsible? The weather? This task force is horrible.

Everything you describe, sounds normal, including the burning while peeling . The day I got the catheter out, I remember having yo walk up,and down the halls after drinking water, so they could see me pee on my own before letting me go home. I remember walking back and forth fro about 3 hours, then I sat down for a few minutes as my legs needed a rest. When I got up, I noticed the chair was soaking wet. After feeling my sweatpants, I realizedthey were soaked. I would keep doing the Kegels. I started 4 times a day, each time was one set of 10 reps, holding 10 seconds, followed by 10 seconds f rest. I'm finally seeing progress, no,leaking In tHE LAST 36 hours, and last night I slept almost 6 hours without waking up to pee. That was the first time I went more than 3 hours of straight sleep since the surgery. So my point is, I went through the same frustatrayions as you are, but if you are diligent about Kegels, you will likely do well.",

      "Content": "Welcome to the place that nobody wants to be, but some of us need to. First thing I'd recommend is get a second pinion on your pathology. Tell your urologists office that you want the slides sent to Dr JOnatjan Epstein at Johns Hopkins, or Davd Bostwick at Bostick Labs, for second opinion. They will do it, they get this request all the time from knowledgeable patients who are wanting to be their own best advocate. My GLeason was G8, then downgraded on second and third opinion to G6, and this changed everything Second, on what basis is your urologist recommending radiation therapy? Is that what he does? And on what basis is he saying you have a 40% chance that the Cancer is not organ confined? Not saying he is wrong, but I'd be curious, with a 5.9 PSA (not crazy high) Third, with radiation, you will have more ejaculate than with surgery (with surgery you will have none, and a 60-80% chance of return of sexual function (erection good enough for penetration) , with radiation I have been told (with BRachy/seeds) it would be 65% without drugs, and 80-85% with EDdrugs. But be aware that you will produce LESS ejaculate than before. Also, with Surgery, side effects tend to come early and improve over time, while with radiation they tend to be milder, and eventually disappear, but over a period of years, may return. You should visit with more than one surgeon, and more than one radiation oncologist. Educate yourself, then, make the decision that you. Feel most comfortable with. If a second opinion downgrades you to G6 you might even be able to consider active surveillance. Aside from that, both surgery and radiation work well, in most cases of locally confined disease. Good luck",

U will learn to automatically Kegel at the right times, like getting out of bed for example, to prevent leaks. It will become an automatic reflex, no thinking involved. It will just take time. Also, don't expect improvement to be linear. It will happen, with two steps forward one step back. Yesterday for example, I had my first 24 hour (ending yesterday morning) leak free period. But today, I weighed my pad this morning and had a leakage over 24 hours of .3 ounces. So don't get discouraged, it will all get amazingly better over time.",

U will learn to automatically Kegel at the right times, like getting out of bed for example, to prevent leaks. It will become an automatic reflex, no thinking involved. It will just take time. Also, don't expect improvement to be linear. It will happen, with two steps forward one step back. Yesterday for example, I had my first 24 hour (ending yesterday morning) leak free period. But today, I weighed my pad this morning and had a leakage over 24 hours of .3 ounces. So don't get discouraged, it will all get amazingly better over time.",

      "Content": "Welcome to the place that nobody wants to be, but some of us need to. First thing I'd recommend is get a second pinion on your pathology. Tell your urologists office that you want the slides sent to Dr JOnatjan Epstein at Johns Hopkins, or Davd Bostwick at Bostick Labs, for second opinion. They will do it, they get this request all the time from knowledgeable patients who are wanting to be their own best advocate. My GLeason was G8, then downgraded on second and third opinion to G6, and this changed everything Second, on what basis is your urologist recommending radiation therapy? Is that what he does? And on what basis is he saying you have a 40% chance that the Cancer is not organ confined? Not saying he is wrong, but I'd be curious, with a 5.9 PSA (not crazy high) Third, with radiation, you will have more ejaculate than with surgery (with surgery you will have none, and a 60-80% chance of return of sexual function (erection good enough for penetration) , with radiation I have been told (with BRachy/seeds) it would be 65% without drugs, and 80-85% with EDdrugs. But be aware that you will produce LESS ejaculate than before. Also, with Surgery, side effects tend to come early and improve over time, while with radiation they tend to be milder, and eventually disappear, but over a period of years, may return. You should visit with more than one surgeon, and more than one radiation oncologist. Educate yourself, then, make the decision that you. Feel most comfortable with. If a second opinion downgrades you to G6 you might even be able to consider active surveillance. Aside from that, both surgery and radiation work well, in most cases of locally confined disease. Good luck",

      "Content": "Thanks all, for your responses, all very helpful, and Otago - thank you very useful, I appreciate the information. So i got home an hour ago, very uneventful. They found nothing. He told me that the stents were in place and working just the way we want them to, and they found nothing significant that needed to be stented. I asked, in that case, how should we approach the fact that i did have a positive echo stress test. He told me that the positive aspect of the stress test were not that significant, so just dont worry about it. I know that about 30% of stress tests are false positives. Also it was only the EKG that was abnormal, the images looked very good. So hopefully thats the end of it and i can move on. I'll talk with my cardiologist later today or tomorrow. Otago, you've given me some great questions to ask the cardiologist, expecially about whether to exercess through what appears to be stable angina (or my defective brain, not sure which. So now i get to lay around all day and ask my wife to make me lunch, do this, get me that. And actually get away with it, without hearing \"go f yourself, do it yourself?

I would get a second opinion, on your issue, pm me if you want a name, I am in NYC I saw Samadi, and if he hadn't trash talked my urologist , who he used to work with at another hospital, , AND the hospital he was associated with, , I would have gone ahead with the surgery, with him. But the lack of professionalism he exhibited left me with no confidence. I should thank him for acting the way he did, because I left the meeting with him, with my surgery scheduled, and if was only after I thought it through, that I decided against going with him",

I am not going anywhere, i like the people on this board (and the other one i found) and feel like i have really gotten help here, so if i can hang around and occasionally post something that helps someone else who might be a few steps behind me, i'd like to do that. Regarding the subject at hand, HI Grade PIN, i think i have sort of convinced myself that there is a high probability that over the next few years, i will be diagnosed and become a full fledged member of the club. Maybe I'm wrong, hope so, but from the reading i have been doing, it almost seems like a forgone conclusion. I guess its good that they found pin in only one core out of 12 (actually i think its was 14), but still, its HGPIN. Time will tell. Sometimes i wonder if its really a good thing, all these \"advances\" they make in diagnosis and identifying precursors, etc. Its like gene testing in breast cancer - do you really want to know?",

      "Content": "John, welcome. I had surgery as my primary treatment. And most of us have a bias towards whatever treatment we chose. With that caveat, I'll say I'm not sorry. Uneventful, full recovery, no incontinence, and with Cialis no issues with turning little John into Big John. Hve you looked at SBRT (AKA Cyberknife)? It's got a very good 10 year track record now, I think IMRT for primary is old school, and what's more common these days is SBRT and HDR Brachytherapy, which leads me to my next question. You mentioned brachytherapy, but didn't differentiate between HDR and LDR. HDR is the newer and I think more state of the art form. Rectestosterone, I'm no expert, but I think there's a lot of scientific evidence that supplements don't promote PC growth. It's counterintuitive, I know, but that's what I read. Good luck and keep us posted",

I guess i just have to adjust my mindset, and remember that it doesnt always lead to PC, and if it does it can take many years. Hey, if i can get to 70 before being diagnosed (I'm age 62 now) , then maybe i can get away with no treatments. If anyone else here now or in the future is looking for info on PIN, as i am, note that i found a couple of pages of good information in very simple terms, in Dr Walshs book (page 179), along with a link to FAQs on Prostate Pathology, including on PIN. the link is..... http://adasp.org/FAQs/03-prostate.htm Hope it helps someone.",

I had 3 consecutive undetectable PSAs after surgery with very favorable pathology and similar results on the MSKCC Nomogram as your dads. And then my fourth PSA test came back at 3.88!!!!! I had it retested at another lab, it came back undetectable, and the first lab then confirmed that after retesting the same blood they too got an undetectable. So yes, its possible that its a lab error, get a retest.",

      "Content": "I think the nomograms are fairly accurate, they are based on actual data, actual experience of actual patients. However two things to keep in mind One, they are somewhat of a lagging indicator, so fir example if a nomograms is based on 10,000 patient experiences diagnosed between 2006 thru 2016, you have many patients diagnosed 8-9-10 years ago. No doubt as patients diagnosed today, the experience is better. Second, the nomograms are statistics. And statistics matter to a large group. It's like our friend Jim would tell you, if you sit at the blackjack table or stand at the craps table, the longer you play the truer the odds.sane thing holds for the nomograms. The larger the sample the truer the results. You are a cohort of 1. So the stats may tell us our chances individually, but they don't mean as much. Good luck with your surgery.",

First couple of days, maybe three, will be tough. Butvthen you will start to see big improvements each day for a week or two Assuming you are doin robotic, you will have gas pains in your chest shoulders back and neck, this is gas they pump in you to open up the area and give them more room to work. The only way to get rid of this a is to walk. So walk as much as you can every day. Try to walk within a few hours of getting out of recovery room. They will, push you to do that. Go with it. GasX and tums might help a bit too. The catheter is annoying, but not painful. But the day they take the catheter out, is a day that you will want to be declared as a national holiday, you will feel like q new man. To give you an idea of how quickly things will progress, I am 12 days past surgery and only 3 days past getting the catheter out. I walked three miles in an hour yesterday. I'm 64. Good luck, and please, when it's over come back and keep us posted. There is a lot of support for you here if you want it. See you on the other side.",

He told me that 1 sample (i think he took 14, at least thats how many of those little sample containers they wheeled in for the biopsy along with the tools) showed Hi Grade PIN. He explained that it used to be accepted that this was a precursor or hi predictor of future PC diagnosis, but that it is generally not so much universally accepted any more and they (he) believe that it is not necessarily a precursor. But he also said that there are doctors who will disagree. He suggested i not wait a year, retake PSA in 6 months. Well, that was definitive! Any thoughts?",

      "Content": "Not sure about that someone else may chime in. Often, if a urologist suspects infection as the cause of a PSA rise, they will put you on a course of Cipro, or other antibiotic, then retake PSA before doing a biopsy. But I suspect that your urologist skip that step due to the nodules Please stay focused on this fact: even if the news is bad you're not going to be in big trouble. It will be a bump in the road because PC is a slow-growing cancer compared to other types of cancers and most Prostate cancers are slow growing indolent cancers that don't spread to distant sites But let's hope your case but the biopsy shows no cancer",

      "Content": "Ian, I had a biopsy two years ago that was negative for PC but AHOWED one core out of 14 with hi grade pin. Dr said it was of no concern and just continue to test every six months which I dis. My PSA kept rising, but slowly. After nine months when my PSA went from 2.7 to 3.1 in only 6 months, I asked about a biopsy he said no because he was not concerned because the rate of rise was not fast enough. In early November I had another biopsy and if was positive, 3 cores, all G6 thankfully If I had to do if all over again, I would have pushed a little harder for the 2nd biopsy six months ago, and if the dr still wouldn't do it, I would have come back for another biopsy in three months instead of waiting the six months. If I were in your shoes, with a PSA of 8.9 I would retest very three months and insist on a repeat biopsy in a year. Unless the doc shows you on the path report that you've got a very large Prostate and has VERY good reason to not assume the Psa being that high is not attributable to BPH or some other benign issue. Hope this provides you with some perspective. HGPIN is known to not always, but OFTEN, turn into Cancer",

      "Content": "Not sure about that someone else may chime in. Often, if a urologist suspects infection as the cause of a PSA rise, they will put you on a course of Cipro, or other antibiotic, then retake PSA before doing a biopsy. But I suspect that your urologist skip that step due to the nodules Please stay focused on this fact: even if the news is bad you're not going to be in big trouble. It will be a bump in the road because PC is a slow-growing cancer compared to other types of cancers and most Prostate cancers are slow growing indolent cancers that don't spread to distant sites But let's hope your case but the biopsy shows no cancer",

Still hope for the best while YIU know its a possibility that the news won't be ideal. I'd say prepare for the worst, but the fact is, I don't think most people can be prepared for that call Still, it's possible it's an infection. My doc told me to call him in a wek for results, I knew it should take less than a week. And in fact he called me 3 business days later with the bad news . I think if it was good news he would have waited for me to call him. So each day that goes by without them calling you, is possibly something positive to hang on to. Keeping fingers tightly crossed that you get a negative biopsy result and disappear from here. If it's positive, come back here and ask a lot of questions, and start doing your research.

      "Content": "@Chuck, thanks for taking a stab at it. Your educated guess is what i am hoping to hear, but i can't seem to find anything on it when i do a google search, other than the general comment that fPSA is most helpful with total psa above 4. @Otago - thanks to you as well. You have a great attitude, i wish i could be as logical, unfortunately its never been in my nature to not assume the worst. I do try to change that but...... My dads PC was diagnosed in his late 60;s. Unfortunately, he was already ill from other issues, i.e. kidney, heart bypass, and mental issues that arose as a result of his hear bypass (dementia). So he was treated with hormone therapy (i believe, it was injections, his wife was overseeing it, and kept me informed, sorry to this day that i was not more proactive about being involved). They worked for a couple of years, but by then he was already in a nursing home, and over a period of two years or so, deteriorated generally, and passed. I never knew his Gleason score. I was a shmuck (NY word for idiot) When it was first recommended that i get a biopsy, it was recommended by my local Uro, and my PSA was 2.2, but had risen ever time it was taken over a multi year period, so despite the low absolute number and a negative DRE, it seemed to make sense. Nevertheless, i felt that if i was going to go that route, and do anything invasive, i wanted a top Doc doing the procedure and a good lab checking the samples. So thats when i went to Columbia Presbyterian for a second opinion before doing the biopsy. They are highly ranked in many areas including Urology. THAT Doc also said that a biopsy was a good idea in view of the steadily rising trend. And he did another PSA, that was the one two weeks later. I didnt realize until i got home, that he took the blood AFTER the DRE, because i was such a mental wreck. So yes, i do not place much importance on THAT 2.8 reading. But the next 2.8 reading was with my current (third URO) who is also a top guy, was with Columbia until Feb 2012 when he became Chairman of Uro at Winthrop, a large Long Island Hospital. (he still teaches at Columbia) So thats the entire story, sorry i realize you said you read my past posts. In any case, i wish i could find something that substantiates that the fPSA was not something to worry about with a 2.8 Total PSA. BTW, this last doc, in April, who i am going to see again in a couple weeks, also did a PCA3, which came in at 13, (under 25 is ok, as i understand it)",

      "Content": "Not sure about that someone else may chime in. Often, if a urologist suspects infection as the cause of a PSA rise, they will put you on a course of Cipro, or other antibiotic, then retake PSA before doing a biopsy. But I suspect that your urologist skip that step due to the nodules Please stay focused on this fact: even if the news is bad you're not going to be in big trouble. It will be a bump in the road because PC is a slow-growing cancer compared to other types of cancers and most Prostate cancers are slow growing indolent cancers that don't spread to distant sites But let's hope your case but the biopsy shows no cancer",

      "Content": "Thanks everyone for the hopeful comments, and for the warm welcome back. Intellectually I know that it could very well be a statistical anamoly. Emotionally though, as I'm sure everyone here knows, it's a killer of a thing to anticipate. It could go either way as we all know. The question is what was the last result 6 months ago? Was the true number .001? Or was it .019. I can't know that because the assay only measures to anything .02 or higher, thus the result <.02. If the true number was .001, I've got a problem. If it was .019, then a move to .020 is insignificant for sure. Then if it's positive again, and turns out it's a Recurrence, how do I know when it recurred. Might have been w months ago. Do we assume it was 2 years, since the test was done 2 years post RALP? Or could it have started soon fire my last test 6bmonths ago? Unknowable. The NP when she called with the result 3. Weeks ago told me they still consider it undetectable. But the fact is, it was measurable. I was told they don't really worry bout it until it hits .1. If in fact this is a recurrence, I don't plan on waiting that long. If it gets to .05, maybe .04, I'm off to see the nuke specialist. Which, from what I understand has a lower chance of working, when you had positive margins. So you can see, my head, which had been fairly com up until a day or two, is spinning. @ron, Chuck, I her you on the uPSA vs STANDARD PSA. But I think once you start with uPSA, it's hard to go back. And I would want to know sooner, if it's creeping up. @Micheal - my first few tests were done at Quest, and were all <.02. Then I had. 3 month test come back at 3.8 (no typo) which was an error that the Senior VP of oncology testing could not figure out how it happened, (I had a phone call with him because I was pissed) and I lost confidence in their process no started testing at my DRs (Tewari) hospital lab , mt Sinai in NY. The first two of those tests came back at 0.00, that's how they report it. Then the next two came back at <.02. I scrutinized those reports and found that the two 0.00's were a different assay than the last two. Now, the .02 reading without the <, was done on the same assay as the last two <02's. So I don't think it's the assay. I guess I'll know more tomorrow, seeing the Dr at 11am, but will likely get a phone call with the results by 9:30-9:45. I'll report back Thanks again.",

      "Content": "JLukas, you are a good son. I am, your dads age, 64, and I had surgery with Ash Tewari 2 weeks ago tomorrow. I would highly recommend him, and you may hear the same from another member soon NYCGman. I also used Jonathan Epstein at Johns Hopkins for 2nd opinion on the pathology slides, you should do it. As far as a radiation oncologist, one of the more well known in Nyc is dr Zelefsky, at MSKCC. HE specializes in Brachytherapy, which is radioactive seeds, but I'm sure he can talk to you about other types of radiation. I consulted with Dr Gewanter at MSKCC, AT THEIR Long Island Facility. Great professional, good man. Be aware, that before Dr ZELEFSKY will see you, he will require your slides, the pathology report, the discs from your dads bone scan and CT scan and you will have to have (your father I mean) a 3Tesla multiparametricMRI metric MRI done. (This is also done by Dr Tewari , required by him before surgery to help him plan. ) The MRI cannot be done for 6-7 weeks after biopsy, or it will be inaccurate.

Uneventful, full recovery, no incontinence, and with Cialis no issues with turning little John into Big John. Hve you looked at SBRT (AKA Cyberknife)? It's got a very good 10 year track record now, I think IMRT for primary is old school, and what's more common these days is SBRT and HDR Brachytherapy, which leads me to my next question. You mentioned brachytherapy, but didn't differentiate between HDR and LDR. HDR is the newer and I think more state of the art form. Rectestosterone, I'm no expert, but I think there's a lot of scientific evidence that supplements don't promote PC growth. It's counterintuitive, I know, but that's what I read.

      "Content": "JLukas, you are a good son. I am, your dads age, 64, and I had surgery with Ash Tewari 2 weeks ago tomorrow. I would highly recommend him, and you may hear the same from another member soon NYCGman. I also used Jonathan Epstein at Johns Hopkins for 2nd opinion on the pathology slides, you should do it. As far as a radiation oncologist, one of the more well known in Nyc is dr Zelefsky, at MSKCC. HE specializes in Brachytherapy, which is radioactive seeds, but I'm sure he can talk to you about other types of radiation. I consulted with Dr Gewanter at MSKCC, AT THEIR Long Island Facility. Great professional, good man. Be aware, that before Dr ZELEFSKY will see you, he will require your slides, the pathology report, the discs from your dads bone scan and CT scan and you will have to have (your father I mean) a 3Tesla multiparametricMRI metric MRI done. (This is also done by Dr Tewari , required by him before surgery to help him plan. ) The MRI cannot be done for 6-7 weeks after biopsy, or it will be inaccurate. What I did was, I immediately scheduled the surgery with dr Tewari at my first visit. It can't be done for at least 6-7 weeks after biopsy. I used that time to explore the other options. And I did the MRI at Mount SiNai, with prescription from Dr Tewari, and had a copy sent to dr Gewanter, the RO at MSKCC. THIS WAY, I DIDNT LOSE ANY TIME. Have your dad explore ALL options.

      "Content": "Trinity, i sent you a PM in response to your PM. I'll add to it here but just want to note that everyone here has confirmed what i said in my PM, that you need to address this, and need treatment, pending a second opinion on the slides, which you should get on immediately. I assume you are in the NY area based on who you said you are seeing in your PM. Based on that, you have plenty of good people to consult with. I would recommend my surgeon, (as I'm sure most everybody would, LOL) Dr Ash Tewari, in Manhattan. He's done over 6000 Robotic Prostatectomies. I specifically asked him if he does the entire surgery. He told me, that his assistants (Drs) position the arms of the robot, but he is the only one that ever touches the controls. Also, Dr James Eastham has a very good rep at MSKCC, i believe he does mostly open. Others will mention Samadi, i met with him, and thought he was pompous, he denegrated my urologist, Dr Aaron Katz, who does have a good rep, so i would never go near him, Just my opinion. You should also explore radiation - seeds (brachy), SBRT (Cyberknife) and external Beam radiation. I met with Dr Gewanter, who is at MSKCC on Long Island (on the campus of Mercy Hospital, but no affilaition). He was terrific. He is Cheif of radiation Oncology at MSKCC, LONG ISLAND DIVISION. He does not do Brachy, if you went that way, he would refer you to the manhattan LOCATION. Dr Zelefsky, who does Brach at MSKCC in Manhattan, is one of the best in the country. Of course, Dr Jon Haas, does Cyberknife at Winthrop. Back to surgery, if you prefer to see someone on Long Island, i would meet with Dr Felix Badillo. I know two people who had him do surgery and both were very happy. I met with him, nice man. I just wanted Tewari. Badillo is Chief of Urology at Saint Francis. Most important - you need to learn all you can about all the different options available to you. Everyone has different values, i, like most people had my priorities of cure, contincence and erectile function in that order. As i told my surgeon. At age 65, i piss 7 times a day, i have sex 7 times a year (exaggerating to make a point) so just make sure i am continent. Tewaris results are 97% fully continent within one year - his definition of continent (important question to ask) is no pads. Like i said, learn as much as possible, be your own advocate. If you look hard enough you might find a doctor that tells you what you want to hear, that AS is ok. (although maybe not, with a G8 )BUT You need treatment if in fact it is an 8. Sorry to ramble, but i wanted to give you as much help as possible. Again, I'm not a medical professional, just a guy who had his prostate taken out and is very happy with the result, and more knowledgeable for the experience. Good luck and keep us posted, and keep in touch",

Hopefully that < reappears or at least you get another .05. Should you get a rise, I would wait for one more rise, then consider acting. My Uro also recommended waiting till .2. But I\u2019m starting treatment this week, at .08 Anyway, we all have different situations, and different personalities and different pathologies. If your PSA stays low but stable it\u2019s good and you don\u2019t have to do anything. Good luck, we are looking forward to a good report,",

No real pain, just less stamina which will resolve with Time. I would schedule an appointment with Tewari, after you've had your bone andCT scans, although ithe scans are highly likely to be negative. Contact an RO as well.

      "Content": "JLukas, you are a good son. I am, your dads age, 64, and I had surgery with Ash Tewari 2 weeks ago tomorrow. I would highly recommend him, and you may hear the same from another member soon NYCGman. I also used Jonathan Epstein at Johns Hopkins for 2nd opinion on the pathology slides, you should do it. As far as a radiation oncologist, one of the more well known in Nyc is dr Zelefsky, at MSKCC. HE specializes in Brachytherapy, which is radioactive seeds, but I'm sure he can talk to you about other types of radiation. I consulted with Dr Gewanter at MSKCC, AT THEIR Long Island Facility. Great professional, good man. Be aware, that before Dr ZELEFSKY will see you, he will require your slides, the pathology report, the discs from your dads bone scan and CT scan and you will have to have (your father I mean) a 3Tesla multiparametricMRI metric MRI done. (This is also done by Dr Tewari , required by him before surgery to help him plan. ) The MRI cannot be done for 6-7 weeks after biopsy, or it will be inaccurate. What I did was, I immediately scheduled the surgery with dr Tewari at my first visit. It can't be done for at least 6-7 weeks after biopsy. I used that time to explore the other options. And I did the MRI at Mount SiNai, with prescription from Dr Tewari, and had a copy sent to dr Gewanter, the RO at MSKCC. THIS WAY, I DIDNT LOSE ANY TIME. Have your dad explore ALL options. I am a surgery guy, others would rather do radiation. The both have their upside and downside. You need to learn a lot, and make an informed decision. radiation Oncologists will tell you do radiation and surgeons will be biased towards surgery. Dr. Tewari at my first visit, encouraged me to consult with a radiation oncologist as well before making up my mind. If you have other questions and want to PM me for my email address I will be happy to try to help. Know one thing though - this is not a death sentence. When we are first diagnosed most of us are in a fog. But as we educate ourselves, we learn that this disease is curable, and for the minority of unlucky ones who cannot be cured, there is a lot that can be done to hold this beast at bay for many years, even decades. And your dads PSA would seem to indicate good chance that he has early stage/curable disease Last thing - the suggestion to buy and read dr Patrick Walshs book is a good one. Almost a must. Get the third edition, it's the most recent, you can buy or download it on amazon. You are not alone we are here and anxious to help.",

      "Content": "After being undetectable since surgery, including my last test 3 months ago, my 9 month post op PSA came back from Quest, at 3.38 (no typo, 3.3. Needless to say I am besides myself. Ingot the results online and have an appointment tomorrow at the surgeons office but not with the Dr., I am supposed to meet with his director of Wellness, who does the nutrition, and other holistic stuff. He said I didn't need to see him this visit . And I said, right, unless the PSA comes back detectable. He responded by telling me \"with your surgical pathology, it's not going to happen. So here I am looking 7 times to make sure I wasn't seeing things, at a 3.38. I called the office spoke to the PA, she said it's likely a mistake. Said to retest when I come in tomorrow, and they'd have the results Monday. But I didn't want to wait the weekend, in this mental state, so I asked if I could drive into the city (about an hour, and get the blood draw tonight, which I did. I'll have results tomorrow. My surgical pathology was (3+4), negative margins (1 positive intra operative margin so he cut more and got a negative final margin. No ECE, SV-, 9 lymph nodes all negative. So how can this happen. It's high probability it was an error by the lab. But doesn't make sense how do you make such an error? I called the lab and asked them to check and make sure I was given my results and not someone else's. They did so and confirmed it was mine. They said the blood tube is checked carefully so there cannot be a mixup in the blood, and when the girl drew my blood at the Quest Center, she put the label on the tube, and showed it to me with m name and had me initial . Even of it was a mistake, and someone entered 3.38, but should have been .338, that's a huge jump from <.02 3 months ago. I'm confused scared and in a panic",

      "Content": "JLukas, you are a good son. I am, your dads age, 64, and I had surgery with Ash Tewari 2 weeks ago tomorrow. I would highly recommend him, and you may hear the same from another member soon NYCGman. I also used Jonathan Epstein at Johns Hopkins for 2nd opinion on the pathology slides, you should do it. As far as a radiation oncologist, one of the more well known in Nyc is dr Zelefsky, at MSKCC. HE specializes in Brachytherapy, which is radioactive seeds, but I'm sure he can talk to you about other types of radiation. I consulted with Dr Gewanter at MSKCC, AT THEIR Long Island Facility. Great professional, good man. Be aware, that before Dr ZELEFSKY will see you, he will require your slides, the pathology report, the discs from your dads bone scan and CT scan and you will have to have (your father I mean) a 3Tesla multiparametricMRI metric MRI done. (This is also done by Dr Tewari , required by him before surgery to help him plan. ) The MRI cannot be done for 6-7 weeks after biopsy, or it will be inaccurate. What I did was, I immediately scheduled the surgery with dr Tewari at my first visit. It can't be done for at least 6-7 weeks after biopsy. I used that time to explore the other options. And I did the MRI at Mount SiNai, with prescription from Dr Tewari, and had a copy sent to dr Gewanter, the RO at MSKCC. THIS WAY, I DIDNT LOSE ANY TIME. Have your dad explore ALL options. I am a surgery guy, others would rather do radiation. The both have their upside and downside. You need to learn a lot, and make an informed decision. radiation Oncologists will tell you do radiation and surgeons will be biased towards surgery. Dr. Tewari at my first visit, encouraged me to consult with a radiation oncologist as well before making up my mind. If you have other questions and want to PM me for my email address I will be happy to try to help. Know one thing though - this is not a death sentence. When we are first diagnosed most of us are in a fog. But as we educate ourselves, we learn that this disease is curable, and for the minority of unlucky ones who cannot be cured, there is a lot that can be done to hold this beast at bay for many years, even decades. And your dads PSA would seem to indicate good chance that he has early stage/curable disease Last thing - the suggestion to buy and read dr Patrick Walshs book is a good one. Almost a must. Get the third edition, it's the most recent, you can buy or download it on amazon. You are not alone we are here and anxious to help.",

      "Content": "Tink, 1. Yes most doctors do the biopsy with the patient fully awake. They usually give local anesthetic, a shot of lidocaine to numb the prostate. It's usually not really painful, just a series of spring-loaded pin pricks. I took a couple of xanax before my biopsies, but that was it. 2. They take tiny samples from different areas of the prostate, not from other organs. 3. He will be sore for a couple if days, there will probably be some blood in his urine, usually for a couple of days. And he will have bloody semen which can last weeks. (Sorry, as his daughter/son, you Probably don't want to know that part ) 4. It takes a few days, sometimes up to a week, although that's unusual. Some doctors will call with the results, others will make an appointment at the time of biopsy, to give you the results about a week later. 5. If it's positive, a lot depends on the information in the biopsy. What is the Gleason score, or grade (aggressiveness), what is the volume % in each core, how many cores taken and how many positive. Etc. generally, a second opinion should be had on the slides, because it is subjective and you want a trained eye evaluating it. Most people use dr Jonathan Epstein at Johns Hopkins. He's the recognized expert in prostate pathology Then you will,need to learn about the different treatments, and make a decision. That's a long discussion, for a different time. If his cancer is advanced and aggressive though, he will probably have hormone therapy to start. If he chooses surgery, he is in the hands of a prostate surgeon/urologist If he chooses radiation he is in the hands of a radiation oncologist If he needs systemic treatment such as hormone therapy and/or chemo, he should see a medical oncologist with a focus on prostate cancer. Take cues from his urologist when he gets the results, but don't just listen to what he says without questioning and getting other opinions, Get a copy of the pathology report, and come back here with the details, you'll get lots of help on next steps.",

But for me, the highlight of the trip was a helicopter to the top of Taku Glacier, one of the four major Glaciers in the Juneau Icefield. When I got out of the heli, and stepped onto the Glacier, it was a real adrenalin rush. I walked over to a nearby Glacier Lake, got on my knees and drank from it! (But not too much, for fear of having to pee before I got back LOL)",

This was the first time I had a chance to speak/meet with him directly, since the surgery, so I got to ask all my questions It was a great meeting. My one concern was the upgrade from G6 to g7 (3+4). He told me with negative margins and everything, I should be celebrating. He said that of all his patients with the same pathology as me, less than 5% have needed further treatment, and he's never lost one. (whew, that's a relief) So all good. He also told me my follow ups would be every 3 months for the first year, then we go to every 6 months. That was good news, because I had thought it would be 3 month visits for 2 years. I told him I was so happy I chose surgery, and that I chose him as my surgeon, and I meant it. I walked out of there, feeling more confident about the future than I have since this whole shitstorm started.",

As far as different Drs , different systems, you will get a referral from the urologist to an oncologist, but you don't have to take it. You can see anyone you want. Try to be sure that whatever oncologist you see, has plenty of experience with aggressive prostate cancer. And don't be railroaded into one treatment or bother.

Reading prostate slides is very subjective, and should be done by a prostate expert. Most local pathologists read many different types of slides.

      "Content": "Thanks Michael. I did call Quest and asked questions. They checked and confirmed that the numbers posted on my account were in fact my numbers. And when I asked if it's possible that tubes of blood were mixed up, she said highly unlikely, as the tubes are meticulously identified at every step of the process. Also when they took the blood, at the local center, she showed me the tube right after taking my blood and asked me for confirmation that my name, etc w was correct. I asked her if there was any change in the testing assay method and she didn't even know what that meant, she also told me that the normal range was below 4, so it's not a result that should be questioned. At that point I corrected her and pointed out that under 4 is for someone with a. Prostate, and that the test ordered for me was a post prostatectomy test. But I realized that the person. Spoke to was an idiot. If this turns out to be an error, and I'm undetectable, trust me, the CEO is getting a letter from me via FedEx, not that it will matter. I just hope I get that opportunity. Hey,mlogically. Know it's an error in all likelihood. But emotionally I can't help but be a wreck. Even if the number is .338, rather than 3.38, that would be a huge jump in three months. The Xanax is kicking in (I hate taking that) so I guess I'll get through the night, then going yo Dr first thing in the AM PS, Iremember posting about problems with Quest, but never saw or heard of anything like this",

      "Content": "I have been away in the Wilderness, literally. I dont remember if i mentioned this upcoming trip, but i spent 3 days in Vancouver, a beautiful, and hip city, 8 days cruising Alaska, which was amazing, and then a 2 night stay in Seattle, another great place. Got back last night. While i did have internet access, i made it a point not to log on, i just felt i needed a rest. Between my RALP in January, and the stents and Coronary Artery disease in June, i was just worn out. So i tuned out. I have to say, this was the most timely vacation I've ever taken. I found myself not thinking about cancer (or heart disease) for days at a time, which was a new experience for me. I also found some perspective on life, i believe. I know that i will still be a lunatic if something else goes wrong. But for now, i feel more relaxed about things than i have in a long time. My reason for posting this, is for the new guys. I've noticed in the two weeks i am back, that a lot of new guys have shown up here, and while i dont like to have to welcome them to our reluctant brotherhood, its good for the forum, because we help them and they hopefully get through treatment and help the next group. So my message to the new guys, is there is life after PC, and a really good life. Stay positive, none of us want to be here but we are and there is a lot of life ahead of us to enjoy. Time heals. Take your time to be upset when newly diagnosed, its totally normal. Then get treatment, kick some ass, and take a long vacation. Stay positive",

      "Content": "Now that I've had the test, I did what I typically do, surfed the internet looking for data on the validity and utility of this fairly new genomic test. What it's done for me, having come back with a low risk score, if 37, is made me a bit less anxious about a VERY small rise in PSA. And also I think I might be less ggressive about looking at SRT at say .05, if I ever get there, vs the traditional, or as my Uro referred to it, \"gold standard\" for SRT, of .1. It seems also that this is a terrific tool for determining whether AS is a good idea after a biopsy that indicates low or intermediate risk cancer. Here's an article that I think is worth reading, for anyone struggling with a related issue. it's a discussion of a compendium of studies on the value of the test. https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4859922/",

I did experience negative side effects at first (flushed face, back/leg soreness, headaches, dry mouth, stuffy nose) but most of the time even a half dose would seem as effective and really cut down on the side effects. I'm not making alot of money right now, so I have been ordering generic versions from this site http://goo.gl/oNqHkh, my insurance that covers everything else will not cover ED meds at all (I am prescribed to both Cialis & Viagra) and this pharmacy ships to me, and is way cheaper. The drugs are in the same amounts and seem to work exactly the same. Has anyone here had any experience with the \"generic\" versions that are available? How on earth did you have TWO prostatectomies?",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by mstevens7878 I've had 2 prostatectomies, the last about a year ago. I am 64, and after the second one really had to rely on ED drugs completely. I did experience negative side effects at first (flushed face, back/leg soreness, headaches, dry mouth, stuffy nose) but most of the time even a half dose would seem as effective and really cut down on the side effects. I'm not making alot of money right now, so I have been ordering generic versions from this site http://goo.gl/oNqHkh, my insurance that covers everything else will not cover ED meds at all (I am prescribed to both Cialis & Viagra) and this pharmacy ships to me, and is way cheaper. The drugs are in the same amounts and seem to work exactly the same. Has anyone here had any experience with the \"generic\" versions that are available? How on earth did you have TWO prostatectomies?",

Actuarial five-year OS was 95.6 percent for the entire cohort. Actuarial five-year nadir+2 RFS was 97.1 percent for all patients, representing 97.3 percent of low-risk and 97.1 of intermediate-risk patients. Actuarial five-year ASTRO RFS was 92.3 percent and 91.3 percent for low- and intermediate-risk groups, respectively. Fewer than two percent of all patients experienced serious side effects in the five years following SBRT. Five grade three GU side effects were reported in four of the 309 study participants. There were no reported grade four or five toxicities nor any grade three GI toxicities.

      "Content": "I am 38000 feet up, on my way home from a 10 day trip to Baton Rouge, Orlando, and Lake Worth, Florida, all for different reasons. While I was gone, I didn't spend as much time on this forum, the other PC forum I'm on, or the ovarian cancer forum I'm on. Not completely off the forums, but much less, mostly because I was very busy. I have to say, it was a great respite. I thought less about cancer. Which was nice, because lately it seems like cancer has occupied my thoughts more than any other topic. Which truly sucks. Anyone else feel this way? Anyway, my respite is about to end. I'll be back at work on Monday, and on Friday I have an appointment with my urologist. Which means -on Tuesday, Wednesday or Thursday, (haven't decided yet) I'll go for my blood draw for PSA. January was 2 years since surgery, and up till then I was <.02. But in January, then again in February I lost the <, and I was .02 both times. So this 3 month test is a big one for me, and I'm starting to sweat. On top of that, my wife is having a CT Scan on Friday, 1st one since finishing chemo for ovarian cncer, 5 weeks ago. She won't get the results for 10 days, when she sees the Dr. But I'll get my results the next day. So I don't know if I should have the blood draw 1, 2 or 3 days before the appointment. The only reason I'm c0nsidering Tuesday is because I have to be in Manhattan that day for business, and it would save me a Trip. But if I do it Tuesday, I will get the results Wednesday, and if it's higher (showing a trend) then I have to wait 2 days to see the Dr and have him talk me off the ledge. What to do, what to do. Just venting, thanks for listening. I really really don't want to recur.😰 (call me Captain Obvious)🙄",

Example:,I enjoy a Fage zero fat Greek yogurt with fruit on occasion. We always thought that yogurt was good for you. And here we are being told that yogurt is not good. Not sure it apples to the fat free though. I I think I recall that reading it was originally though it was the fat in yogurt that was bad for PC, then I read that it was found that the calcium is what's bad. I have managed to cut back on red meat, but I do enjoy a good steak, only occasionally There have also been studies showing that vitamin D is important and needs to be kept at optimum levels. Then I read that there is a correlation between high Vit D and BCR. THE DIET THING IS ALL SO CONFUSING",

      "Content": "Chuck, i could be wrong, apologies if thats the case. But my understanding is that after RP surgery, they consider a BCR/Bio Chemical Recurrence, to be a rise to .1, followed by a second reading at that number or higher. After radiation, it would be a rise from nadir, followed by 2 consecutive rises after that. To Thewife - your husband is lucky to have you as his advocate. I AGREE with you that waiting 6 months is too long. If i were you i would ask him what the number is that he uses to signal BCR, and at what point he would recommend SRT. And i would also insist on a PSA retake sooner than 6 months. In fact, i would be asking for a retake in 2 months, 3 max. Also, there have been studies done that have shown in certain situations, the max benefit from SRT comes if its started earler, as early as PSA of .03. I do not recall 100%, but i think that was a study done specifically on G8-10 patients, so if thats the case, it may not apply. Good luck, please keep us posted",

Tonight, lying in bed, watching TV, I fell asleep for about 40 minutes. Suddenly, I woke up, and realized that I was wet. VERY wet. Soaked thru my briefs and gym shorts. There was even a small wet spot in the blanket covering me. WTH? I had a strong urge to pee, and got up, was able to control it, then, when in the bathroom,took the longest pee I've taken since the catheter came out No idea where this came from, I guess I'm not really continent.

      "Content": "Hello Guys, it\u0092s been a while. To those of you who have been here a while, it\u0092s good (sort of) to be back, although not for the reasons I\u0092m here. So it looks like I may very well be headed for radiation treatments. And it\u0092s been recommended I do so early. I\u0092m at .06 as of March, just to make it easy, I\u0092m going to cut and paste the post I put up on another forum, with the background, for the guys here that are new enough to not know my backstory....any comments are welcome and appreciated. At the reco of a friend/member here, I met today with the chair of RAd Onc at Cleveland Clinic in Florida. It was a long meeting, and very informative. The short version is.... He recommends treating soon (to review, I was undetectable until the 2 year post op mark, then .02, .033, .033, .046, 060, see signature below) he cited this study... /jamanetwork.com/journals/jamaoncology/article-abstract/2670381?redirect=true A multi institutional study with n=1566, it showed an advantage to treating below .1, vs treating .1 - .5. The entire cohort was adverse pathology. While I had negative final margins, the RO felt that because my frozen section intraoperative margin was positive, and at the apex, my negative final margin was questionable, and he placed a high probability on the PSA coming from cells left in the prostate bed, thus a relatively high probability of a good result. He said if I wanted to wait a few months he didn\u0092t think it would put me at increased risk. He didn\u0092t put too much weight into my low Decipher score, saying I could be one of the 3% that has recurrence, nor did he put much weight in the oncoDx Grid report that predicted poor response to SRT, saying there was not enough data to validate it yet, too small a sample. I also asked him what he thinks might happen if I decided to do nothing. His response, a 50% chance that 10 years from now I would be living a happy life with no issues related to PC. And a 50% chance that I\u0092d have some serious problems in 10 years. I don\u0092t like those odds. He said with their machine, Varian Edge, I think, the chance of permanent side effects was less than 5% (but I should expect transient side effects) I am meeting with Dr Zelefsky, RO at MSKCC, mid June. I will have one more PSA before that meeting. I am inclined to look fir one more increased PSA after the Zelefsky meeting, then taking action, although that also depends on what the pre-Zelefsky PSA shows. I\u0092ve pretty much tossed aside my Surgeons advice to do nothing until/unless i get to .2. I wish their was a black and white answer, but there apparently is not. So the beat goes on. One thing I did not ask, is whether Medicare would approve early Salvage . Anybody know the answer from experience?",

      "Content": "Thanks everyone for the hopeful comments, and for the warm welcome back. Intellectually I know that it could very well be a statistical anamoly. Emotionally though, as I'm sure everyone here knows, it's a killer of a thing to anticipate. It could go either way as we all know. The question is what was the last result 6 months ago? Was the true number .001? Or was it .019. I can't know that because the assay only measures to anything .02 or higher, thus the result <.02. If the true number was .001, I've got a problem. If it was .019, then a move to .020 is insignificant for sure. Then if it's positive again, and turns out it's a Recurrence, how do I know when it recurred. Might have been w months ago. Do we assume it was 2 years, since the test was done 2 years post RALP? Or could it have started soon fire my last test 6bmonths ago? Unknowable. The NP when she called with the result 3. Weeks ago told me they still consider it undetectable. But the fact is, it was measurable. I was told they don't really worry bout it until it hits .1. If in fact this is a recurrence, I don't plan on waiting that long. If it gets to .05, maybe .04, I'm off to see the nuke specialist. Which, from what I understand has a lower chance of working, when you had positive margins. So you can see, my head, which had been fairly com up until a day or two, is spinning. @ron, Chuck, I her you on the uPSA vs STANDARD PSA. But I think once you start with uPSA, it's hard to go back. And I would want to know sooner, if it's creeping up. @Micheal - my first few tests were done at Quest, and were all <.02. Then I had. 3 month test come back at 3.8 (no typo) which was an error that the Senior VP of oncology testing could not figure out how it happened, (I had a phone call with him because I was pissed) and I lost confidence in their process no started testing at my DRs (Tewari) hospital lab , mt Sinai in NY. The first two of those tests came back at 0.00, that's how they report it. Then the next two came back at <.02. I scrutinized those reports and found that the two 0.00's were a different assay than the last two. Now, the .02 reading without the <, was done on the same assay as the last two <02's. So I don't think it's the assay. I guess I'll know more tomorrow, seeing the Dr at 11am, but will likely get a phone call with the results by 9:30-9:45. I'll report back Thanks again.",

      "Content": "Thanks for all the responses. Much appreciated. @Featherboy - the doc i am working with is the urologist. My primary care doc, who is a cardiologist, said i should do the biopsy, but i'm ignoring him on this one, he's the type that if i show up at his office with a cold, he sends me for a brain scan. Update - i called the urologist back, and asked him some questions (below with his responses) . I got the questions from readin this forum, and he said they were great questions, all the right one's, so thank you. i asked 1. should we do free psa, psa3, before doing a biopsy. His response was he generally does those tests when the PSA is above 4. Since my PSA is 2.2, he thinks the results wouldn't be useful 2. What about CIPRO? - His response was that he uses CIPRO alot, but its more likely to be an infection, when there is a sudden spike, as opposed to my situation which has been trending up over a few years, slowly 3. Would doing a biopsy with what might be such an apparently very early stage situation increase the chances of false negative? He said it wouldn't 4. does he use ultrasound to guide the biopsy - he said yes 5. what does he do about pain management - he said it wasn't really necessary, he just uses a little lydocaine around the prostate. I followed up with a question about gel to numb the area before the lydocaine injection, he said he doesnt use it , there is not that much pain frmo the lydocaine injection. He said regarding teh cipro, even though my situation was not typical of an infection it was worth a try (why didnt he try it before i brought it up?) So he gave me a prescription and said to retake in a month. I said ok. Last thing i told him was that he shouldn't be surprised if i request the records because i would go for a second opinion before i do anything invasive (like a biopsy). He was totally cool with that (as he should be, it wouldn't matter to me if he wasnt) So that leads me to my next move. I contacted a Doc who was recommended to me at Columbia Presbyterian, Dr DeCastro, for a second opinion, i am going to see him next Friday. Maybe I am wrong, but it bothers me that the doc i am seeing is a one doc practice in a small local office. He was recommended to me by my Primary Care Doc,but you know how that goes, they are all buddies. So i have no way of knowing who is good, but i figure at Columbia, they are well known in Urology, i think on a par with Hopkins, and why not consult with the best. So we'll see. I will be pretty nervous until this is resolved one way or the other, even though i know that if it turns out to be a problem, it is in all likelyhood very early and curable. I can't even imagine having an \"i have cancer\" conversation with my 29 - 30 year old kids, no matter how good the prognosis. I think thats what scares me most. It will be a long week. Thanks for letting me vent 3.",

Doc did digital rectal exam, prostate felt normal. Gave me choice - biopsy now, or wait 3 months. Told me, while you can never be sure, he feels 3 months wait would not present any real risks. I asked what he would do if it was him - he said he would do the biopsy, and he has, in a similar situation. Said the threshold at my age is 3.5, but rising level, with family history is cause for concern. I found an online calculator that showed the velocity is .37, not sure of the exact dates i put in but they weren't far off. I've read that there is controversy about how important velocity is. I told the doc i would come back in three months for retake but i dont know if i am doing the right thing I am in NY area, i hear Columbia Presbyterian has high reputation docs for this. Should i 1. do the biopsy 2. wait the three months and retake PSA 3. retake PSA in a month or two (doc didn't date the scrip) 3. get a second opinion immediately Also, do any docs put you to sleep for the biopsy? I've heard it is pretty painful. Very nervous, any guidance would be really appreciated.",

Until 3 weeks go t my 2 year test, when it came back at .02. Nurse practitioner called me with results NS told me it's still considered undetectable. But clearly, it was measurable, unlike previous tests. They suggested retest at my Drs appointment which is scheduled for this Friday. I am going in tomorrow for the blood draw so he has the results when I see him. I know it could be a blip. Or maybe not. Shitting bricks tonight. Ken",

      "Content": "Went to Urologist today, PSA continues to rise - facts and numbers as follows: Age - just turned 62 Father had Prostate Cancer PSA Levels: 2009 - .7 2010 - 1.1 2011 - did not take April 2012 - 1.7 (or 1.6, not clear) Nov 2012 - 2.2 Got the 2.2 results today. Doc did digital rectal exam, prostate felt normal. Gave me choice - biopsy now, or wait 3 months. Told me, while you can never be sure, he feels 3 months wait would not present any real risks. I asked what he would do if it was him - he said he would do the biopsy, and he has, in a similar situation. Said the threshold at my age is 3.5, but rising level, with family history is cause for concern. I found an online calculator that showed the velocity is .37, not sure of the exact dates i put in but they weren't far off. I've read that there is controversy about how important velocity is. I told the doc i would come back in three months for retake but i dont know if i am doing the right thing I am in NY area, i hear Columbia Presbyterian has high reputation docs for this. Should i 1. do the biopsy 2. wait the three months and retake PSA 3. retake PSA in a month or two (doc didn't date the scrip) 3. get a second opinion immediately Also, do any docs put you to sleep for the biopsy? I've heard it is pretty painful. Very nervous, any guidance would be really appreciated.",

      "Content": "Depends on the doc. My first will be at 6 weeks post surgery, the second will be 6 weeks after that. I think after that I go to 3 months, not sure. Honestly, if I had a PSA rise at 6 weeks I wouldn't do anything anyway, too soon after surgery to have SRT, so I don't know what the sense is. I wonder if the DRs that do the first one at 6 weeks post op are doing it more for their own research. But I'll do whatever my surgeon says, he's a rock star, so I'm not about to debate the usefulness of that first PSA.",

      "Content": "Trinity, i sent you a PM in response to your PM. I'll add to it here but just want to note that everyone here has confirmed what i said in my PM, that you need to address this, and need treatment, pending a second opinion on the slides, which you should get on immediately. I assume you are in the NY area based on who you said you are seeing in your PM. Based on that, you have plenty of good people to consult with. I would recommend my surgeon, (as I'm sure most everybody would, LOL) Dr Ash Tewari, in Manhattan. He's done over 6000 Robotic Prostatectomies. I specifically asked him if he does the entire surgery. He told me, that his assistants (Drs) position the arms of the robot, but he is the only one that ever touches the controls. Also, Dr James Eastham has a very good rep at MSKCC, i believe he does mostly open. Others will mention Samadi, i met with him, and thought he was pompous, he denegrated my urologist, Dr Aaron Katz, who does have a good rep, so i would never go near him, Just my opinion. You should also explore radiation - seeds (brachy), SBRT (Cyberknife) and external Beam radiation. I met with Dr Gewanter, who is at MSKCC on Long Island (on the campus of Mercy Hospital, but no affilaition). He was terrific. He is Cheif of radiation Oncology at MSKCC, LONG ISLAND DIVISION. He does not do Brachy, if you went that way, he would refer you to the manhattan LOCATION. Dr Zelefsky, who does Brach at MSKCC in Manhattan, is one of the best in the country. Of course, Dr Jon Haas, does Cyberknife at Winthrop. Back to surgery, if you prefer to see someone on Long Island, i would meet with Dr Felix Badillo. I know two people who had him do surgery and both were very happy. I met with him, nice man. I just wanted Tewari. Badillo is Chief of Urology at Saint Francis. Most important - you need to learn all you can about all the different options available to you. Everyone has different values, i, like most people had my priorities of cure, contincence and erectile function in that order. As i told my surgeon. At age 65, i piss 7 times a day, i have sex 7 times a year (exaggerating to make a point) so just make sure i am continent. Tewaris results are 97% fully continent within one year - his definition of continent (important question to ask) is no pads. Like i said, learn as much as possible, be your own advocate. If you look hard enough you might find a doctor that tells you what you want to hear, that AS is ok. (although maybe not, with a G8 )BUT You need treatment if in fact it is an 8. Sorry to ramble, but i wanted to give you as much help as possible. Again, I'm not a medical professional, just a guy who had his prostate taken out and is very happy with the result, and more knowledgeable for the experience. Good luck and keep us posted, and keep in touch",

      "Content": "Thanks for all the responses. Much appreciated. @Featherboy - the doc i am working with is the urologist. My primary care doc, who is a cardiologist, said i should do the biopsy, but i'm ignoring him on this one, he's the type that if i show up at his office with a cold, he sends me for a brain scan. Update - i called the urologist back, and asked him some questions (below with his responses) . I got the questions from readin this forum, and he said they were great questions, all the right one's, so thank you. i asked 1. should we do free psa, psa3, before doing a biopsy. His response was he generally does those tests when the PSA is above 4. Since my PSA is 2.2, he thinks the results wouldn't be useful 2. What about CIPRO? - His response was that he uses CIPRO alot, but its more likely to be an infection, when there is a sudden spike, as opposed to my situation which has been trending up over a few years, slowly 3. Would doing a biopsy with what might be such an apparently very early stage situation increase the chances of false negative? He said it wouldn't 4. does he use ultrasound to guide the biopsy - he said yes 5. what does he do about pain management - he said it wasn't really necessary, he just uses a little lydocaine around the prostate. I followed up with a question about gel to numb the area before the lydocaine injection, he said he doesnt use it , there is not that much pain frmo the lydocaine injection. He said regarding teh cipro, even though my situation was not typical of an infection it was worth a try (why didnt he try it before i brought it up?) So he gave me a prescription and said to retake in a month. I said ok. Last thing i told him was that he shouldn't be surprised if i request the records because i would go for a second opinion before i do anything invasive (like a biopsy). He was totally cool with that (as he should be, it wouldn't matter to me if he wasnt) So that leads me to my next move. I contacted a Doc who was recommended to me at Columbia Presbyterian, Dr DeCastro, for a second opinion, i am going to see him next Friday. Maybe I am wrong, but it bothers me that the doc i am seeing is a one doc practice in a small local office. He was recommended to me by my Primary Care Doc,but you know how that goes, they are all buddies. So i have no way of knowing who is good, but i figure at Columbia, they are well known in Urology, i think on a par with Hopkins, and why not consult with the best. So we'll see. I will be pretty nervous until this is resolved one way or the other, even though i know that if it turns out to be a problem, it is in all likelyhood very early and curable. I can't even imagine having an \"i have cancer\" conversation with my 29 - 30 year old kids, no matter how good the prognosis. I think thats what scares me most. It will be a long week. Thanks for letting me vent 3.",

      "Content": "Went to Urologist today, PSA continues to rise - facts and numbers as follows: Age - just turned 62 Father had Prostate Cancer PSA Levels: 2009 - .7 2010 - 1.1 2011 - did not take April 2012 - 1.7 (or 1.6, not clear) Nov 2012 - 2.2 Got the 2.2 results today. Doc did digital rectal exam, prostate felt normal. Gave me choice - biopsy now, or wait 3 months. Told me, while you can never be sure, he feels 3 months wait would not present any real risks. I asked what he would do if it was him - he said he would do the biopsy, and he has, in a similar situation. Said the threshold at my age is 3.5, but rising level, with family history is cause for concern. I found an online calculator that showed the velocity is .37, not sure of the exact dates i put in but they weren't far off. I've read that there is controversy about how important velocity is. I told the doc i would come back in three months for retake but i dont know if i am doing the right thing I am in NY area, i hear Columbia Presbyterian has high reputation docs for this. Should i 1. do the biopsy 2. wait the three months and retake PSA 3. retake PSA in a month or two (doc didn't date the scrip) 3. get a second opinion immediately Also, do any docs put you to sleep for the biopsy? I've heard it is pretty painful. Very nervous, any guidance would be really appreciated.",

      "Content": "Thanks Highlander, i appreciate the insight. I should clarify - when the doc said the DRE was normal (he actually used the word 'fine\") i believe what he meant was (based on our conversation from the last visit) that there were no lumps and it was soft. I know that my prostate is somewhat enlarged (dont know how much) because i have been told that a couple of times over the last 10 years or so, but in the context of it being \"normally enlarged for my age\". Also, Highlander, no i have no urinary symptoms. I get up once at night, SOMETIMES, but i do dring a ton of water, even at night. I dont have dripping. My stream is not what i would consider weak, although i dont piss like a racehorse the way i did in my 30's. So I am pretty much asymptomatic. I am going to go ahead with the visit to Columbia - i might have mentioned in the previous post, i am seeing the Co-Director of the Dept of Urology - just to be complete. But i think i have decided that i after seeing him, unless he surprises me by telling me something different, i am going to have the biopsy. I am too nervous about it. I actually had to take a xanax tonight, so i don't want to live like this for three more months, or even six weeks. In addition to which i dowloaded the Dr. Patrick Walsh book and read the chapter on PSA and DRE screening, and he seems to indicate that i am clearly biopsy material. Curious - i mentioned also in a previous post, when i asked my current doc about pain management he seemed rather flip about it, he said its no big deal, he just gives \" a little lydocaine around the area of the prostate\" , and when asked said he doesnt numb the area prior to the lydocaine injection. No gel either. Is that standard? Should i be looking for something different? I don't have a great tolerance level for pain. Thanks again, in advance to everyone. I can't say you guys are calming me down, but you have been a big help.",

I think I mentioned in your previous thread, I\u2019ve seen one RO who recommended I start SRT now, or soon, and my PSA is at .06. And I\u2019m seeing another RO who after seeing my last two psa\u2019s, .046 and .06, had his secretary call me and say he wants to see me to discuss treatment. Meanwhile my surgeon, well known and world reknowned, tells me to wait till .2, then we\u2019ll do imaging. So it\u2019s a quandary, but my gut tells me that we both should put more weight in what the ro\u2019s Say. This sure does suck. But it is what it is.

      "Content": "Thanks all, for your responses, all very helpful, and Otago - thank you very useful, I appreciate the information. So i got home an hour ago, very uneventful. They found nothing. He told me that the stents were in place and working just the way we want them to, and they found nothing significant that needed to be stented. I asked, in that case, how should we approach the fact that i did have a positive echo stress test. He told me that the positive aspect of the stress test were not that significant, so just dont worry about it. I know that about 30% of stress tests are false positives. Also it was only the EKG that was abnormal, the images looked very good. So hopefully thats the end of it and i can move on. I'll talk with my cardiologist later today or tomorrow. Otago, you've given me some great questions to ask the cardiologist, expecially about whether to exercess through what appears to be stable angina (or my defective brain, not sure which. So now i get to lay around all day and ask my wife to make me lunch, do this, get me that. And actually get away with it, without hearing \"go f yourself, do it yourself? LOL Thanks again to all, for the support.",

With the low % fPSA, i wouldn't bother with the PCA3. Something is going on. Keep in mind even if its cancer, with your PSA under 10 you are still highly likely in a curable state.",

My surgeon to,d me at my 3 month post up visit that less than 5 % of his patients with those (my) stats need any further treatment. And yet I see so many guys like you, Gunny, who end up with BCR. At least the scans were negative. Keep us posted on the ROs comments.",

      "Content": "I am 38000 feet up, on my way home from a 10 day trip to Baton Rouge, Orlando, and Lake Worth, Florida, all for different reasons. While I was gone, I didn't spend as much time on this forum, the other PC forum I'm on, or the ovarian cancer forum I'm on. Not completely off the forums, but much less, mostly because I was very busy. I have to say, it was a great respite. I thought less about cancer. Which was nice, because lately it seems like cancer has occupied my thoughts more than any other topic. Which truly sucks. Anyone else feel this way? Anyway, my respite is about to end. I'll be back at work on Monday, and on Friday I have an appointment with my urologist. Which means -on Tuesday, Wednesday or Thursday, (haven't decided yet) I'll go for my blood draw for PSA. January was 2 years since surgery, and up till then I was <.02. But in January, then again in February I lost the <, and I was .02 both times. So this 3 month test is a big one for me, and I'm starting to sweat. On top of that, my wife is having a CT Scan on Friday, 1st one since finishing chemo for ovarian cncer, 5 weeks ago. She won't get the results for 10 days, when she sees the Dr. But I'll get my results the next day. So I don't know if I should have the blood draw 1, 2 or 3 days before the appointment. The only reason I'm c0nsidering Tuesday is because I have to be in Manhattan that day for business, and it would save me a Trip. But if I do it Tuesday, I will get the results Wednesday, and if it's higher (showing a trend) then I have to wait 2 days to see the Dr and have him talk me off the ledge. What to do, what to do. Just venting, thanks for listening. I really really don't want to recur.😰 (call me Captain Obvious)🙄",

My surgeon to,d me at my 3 month post up visit that less than 5 % of his patients with those (my) stats need any further treatment. And yet I see so many guys like you, Gunny, who end up with BCR. At least the scans were negative. Keep us posted on the ROs comments.",

But if it was confined to the Prostate when taken out, the odds are better than 90% that it won't return. If you do get some rise in PSA after surgery , yes, you will need radiation. That should zap it. If it comes back after that, it's far from goodbye.

I think I mentioned in your previous thread, I\u2019ve seen one RO who recommended I start SRT now, or soon, and my PSA is at .06. And I\u2019m seeing another RO who after seeing my last two psa\u2019s, .046 and .06, had his secretary call me and say he wants to see me to discuss treatment. Meanwhile my surgeon, well known and world reknowned, tells me to wait till .2, then we\u2019ll do imaging. So it\u2019s a quandary, but my gut tells me that we both should put more weight in what the ro\u2019s Say. This sure does suck. But it is what it is.

      "Content": "Samie, lots of good advice above. Especially from those who told you in one way or another that all is not lost. Has he had an MRI? A 3 Tesla Multiparametric MRI will show with 95% accuracy, whether the cancer has left the prostate capsule. I think that is what you should be looking to find out. If it hasnt its clearly curable with surgery. Even if it has, it might be. But if its contained, its a strong case for surgery. Also, consider sending the biopsy slides for a second opinion to either Dr Jonathan Epstein at Johns Hopkins or David Bostwick at Bostwick Laboratories. Both are experts in prostate pathology, as opposed to most local pathologists who look at all kinds of slides. It is not unusual to have a gleason score changed on second opinion, reading those slides is very subjective. If you were to be downgraded to a gleason 6 (3+3) it would change everything. Of course the PSA of 39 is troubling. But its not the end all. It could be partially attributed to infection or inflammation of the prostate.",

      "Content": "Stuntmole, one of the most frustrating parts of recovery is the urinary leakage, at least for me.but it gets better. Everything you describe, sounds normal, including the burning while peeling . The day I got the catheter out, I remember having yo walk up,and down the halls after drinking water, so they could see me pee on my own before letting me go home. I remember walking back and forth fro about 3 hours, then I sat down for a few minutes as my legs needed a rest. When I got up, I noticed the chair was soaking wet. After feeling my sweatpants, I realizedthey were soaked. I would keep doing the Kegels. I started 4 times a day, each time was one set of 10 reps, holding 10 seconds, followed by 10 seconds f rest. I'm finally seeing progress, no,leaking In tHE LAST 36 hours, and last night I slept almost 6 hours without waking up to pee. That was the first time I went more than 3 hours of straight sleep since the surgery. So my point is, I went through the same frustatrayions as you are, but if you are diligent about Kegels, you will likely do well.",

      "Content": "Samie, lots of good advice above. Especially from those who told you in one way or another that all is not lost. Has he had an MRI? A 3 Tesla Multiparametric MRI will show with 95% accuracy, whether the cancer has left the prostate capsule. I think that is what you should be looking to find out. If it hasnt its clearly curable with surgery. Even if it has, it might be. But if its contained, its a strong case for surgery. Also, consider sending the biopsy slides for a second opinion to either Dr Jonathan Epstein at Johns Hopkins or David Bostwick at Bostwick Laboratories. Both are experts in prostate pathology, as opposed to most local pathologists who look at all kinds of slides. It is not unusual to have a gleason score changed on second opinion, reading those slides is very subjective. If you were to be downgraded to a gleason 6 (3+3) it would change everything. Of course the PSA of 39 is troubling. But its not the end all. It could be partially attributed to infection or inflammation of the prostate.",

The T1c is great, that means no abnormalities felt on the DRE of the prostate. uC from what I hear is a great place for this, and you'll be in great hands. We all know your head is swimming now, because none of us will ever forget how we were, the day we got the news and the weeks that followed. But your gonna be fine, and a year from now, (less actually), you will likely look back at this as a bump in the road. One thing - get your slides sent to Epstein or Bostwick for a second opinion.

Uneventful, full recovery, no incontinence, and with Cialis no issues with turning little John into Big John. Hve you looked at SBRT (AKA Cyberknife)? It's got a very good 10 year track record now, I think IMRT for primary is old school, and what's more common these days is SBRT and HDR Brachytherapy, which leads me to my next question. You mentioned brachytherapy, but didn't differentiate between HDR and LDR. HDR is the newer and I think more state of the art form. Rectestosterone, I'm no expert, but I think there's a lot of scientific evidence that supplements don't promote PC growth. It's counterintuitive, I know, but that's what I read.

Uneventful, full recovery, no incontinence, and with Cialis no issues with turning little John into Big John. Hve you looked at SBRT (AKA Cyberknife)? It's got a very good 10 year track record now, I think IMRT for primary is old school, and what's more common these days is SBRT and HDR Brachytherapy, which leads me to my next question. You mentioned brachytherapy, but didn't differentiate between HDR and LDR. HDR is the newer and I think more state of the art form. Rectestosterone, I'm no expert, but I think there's a lot of scientific evidence that supplements don't promote PC growth. It's counterintuitive, I know, but that's what I read.

Also, don't expect improvement to be linear. It will happen, with two steps forward one step back. Yesterday for example, I had my first 24 hour (ending yesterday morning) leak free period. But today, I weighed my pad this morning and had a leakage over 24 hours of .3 ounces. So don't get discouraged, it will all get amazingly better over time.",

      "Content": "Samie, lots of good advice above. Especially from those who told you in one way or another that all is not lost. Has he had an MRI? A 3 Tesla Multiparametric MRI will show with 95% accuracy, whether the cancer has left the prostate capsule. I think that is what you should be looking to find out. If it hasnt its clearly curable with surgery. Even if it has, it might be. But if its contained, its a strong case for surgery. Also, consider sending the biopsy slides for a second opinion to either Dr Jonathan Epstein at Johns Hopkins or David Bostwick at Bostwick Laboratories. Both are experts in prostate pathology, as opposed to most local pathologists who look at all kinds of slides. It is not unusual to have a gleason score changed on second opinion, reading those slides is very subjective. If you were to be downgraded to a gleason 6 (3+3) it would change everything. Of course the PSA of 39 is troubling. But its not the end all. It could be partially attributed to infection or inflammation of the prostate.",

That should zap it. If it comes back after that, it's far from goodbye.

Honestly I'm not sure if it's real, or in my head, because I am so hyper aware of every little sensation since the stents were inserted in June. In fact, it's so slight, that I told the Dr if I wasn't looking for it, I wouldn't even notice it. But I had an echo stress test yesterday, and while the pictures were ok, the EKG showed abnormalities, same as before my stents were out in. So the doctor wants to be cautious and make sure everything is ok. I am seriously so done with this crap, it's really getting old. Thanks for letting me rant",

      "Content": "Thanks all, for your responses, all very helpful, and Otago - thank you very useful, I appreciate the information. So i got home an hour ago, very uneventful. They found nothing. He told me that the stents were in place and working just the way we want them to, and they found nothing significant that needed to be stented. I asked, in that case, how should we approach the fact that i did have a positive echo stress test. He told me that the positive aspect of the stress test were not that significant, so just dont worry about it. I know that about 30% of stress tests are false positives. Also it was only the EKG that was abnormal, the images looked very good. So hopefully thats the end of it and i can move on. I'll talk with my cardiologist later today or tomorrow. Otago, you've given me some great questions to ask the cardiologist, expecially about whether to exercess through what appears to be stable angina (or my defective brain, not sure which. So now i get to lay around all day and ask my wife to make me lunch, do this, get me that. And actually get away with it, without hearing \"go f yourself, do it yourself?

      "Content": "Welcome to the place that nobody wants to be, but some of us need to. First thing I'd recommend is get a second pinion on your pathology. Tell your urologists office that you want the slides sent to Dr JOnatjan Epstein at Johns Hopkins, or Davd Bostwick at Bostick Labs, for second opinion. They will do it, they get this request all the time from knowledgeable patients who are wanting to be their own best advocate. My GLeason was G8, then downgraded on second and third opinion to G6, and this changed everything Second, on what basis is your urologist recommending radiation therapy? Is that what he does? And on what basis is he saying you have a 40% chance that the Cancer is not organ confined? Not saying he is wrong, but I'd be curious, with a 5.9 PSA (not crazy high) Third, with radiation, you will have more ejaculate than with surgery (with surgery you will have none, and a 60-80% chance of return of sexual function (erection good enough for penetration) , with radiation I have been told (with BRachy/seeds) it would be 65% without drugs, and 80-85% with EDdrugs. But be aware that you will produce LESS ejaculate than before. Also, with Surgery, side effects tend to come early and improve over time, while with radiation they tend to be milder, and eventually disappear, but over a period of years, may return. You should visit with more than one surgeon, and more than one radiation oncologist. Educate yourself, then, make the decision that you. Feel most comfortable with. If a second opinion downgrades you to G6 you might even be able to consider active surveillance. Aside from that, both surgery and radiation work well, in most cases of locally confined disease.

The fact that it's on one side is a \"favorable finding\" to use the words Tha Dr Epstein at Johns Hopkins used in talking to me. So I think you just have to get the scans done, and see what the Dr. says. But again, with high volume cores consistently, and a PSA of 38, be prepared for the possibility that it has escaped. Not the result you wanted, but even if it's escaped or metastasize, the chances are high it can be controlled for many years, even decades, and youll die of something else.",

First off, i agree with Highlander, especially in view of the fact that your prostate is normal size, that with a PSA of 30, treating the cancer would be a \"best practice\" for lack of a better way of putting it. Incontinence, permanently, is a very small possibility, maybe 3%. Sexual side effects, more of a possibility. This is a very personal decision. At age 56, i know what i would do. If you were 66 and the doc said probably 10 years without symptoms, then maybe i would consider doing nothing with your state of mind. You are lucky to have a wife that stands by you, we all are, so thats a plus. Like i said, its really personal decision, that only you can make.

      "Content": "Ian, I had a biopsy two years ago that was negative for PC but AHOWED one core out of 14 with hi grade pin. Dr said it was of no concern and just continue to test every six months which I dis. My PSA kept rising, but slowly. After nine months when my PSA went from 2.7 to 3.1 in only 6 months, I asked about a biopsy he said no because he was not concerned because the rate of rise was not fast enough. In early November I had another biopsy and if was positive, 3 cores, all G6 thankfully If I had to do if all over again, I would have pushed a little harder for the 2nd biopsy six months ago, and if the dr still wouldn't do it, I would have come back for another biopsy in three months instead of waiting the six months. If I were in your shoes, with a PSA of 8.9 I would retest very three months and insist on a repeat biopsy in a year. Unless the doc shows you on the path report that you've got a very large Prostate and has VERY good reason to not assume the Psa being that high is not attributable to BPH or some other benign issue. Hope this provides you with some perspective. HGPIN is known to not always, but OFTEN, turn into Cancer",

Its only a week so its not surprising that i feel no effects yet, but i am bracing myself. The downside of Firmagon is monthly shots rather than every 3 or 6 months.

      "Content": "Ian, I had a biopsy two years ago that was negative for PC but AHOWED one core out of 14 with hi grade pin. Dr said it was of no concern and just continue to test every six months which I dis. My PSA kept rising, but slowly. After nine months when my PSA went from 2.7 to 3.1 in only 6 months, I asked about a biopsy he said no because he was not concerned because the rate of rise was not fast enough. In early November I had another biopsy and if was positive, 3 cores, all G6 thankfully If I had to do if all over again, I would have pushed a little harder for the 2nd biopsy six months ago, and if the dr still wouldn't do it, I would have come back for another biopsy in three months instead of waiting the six months. If I were in your shoes, with a PSA of 8.9 I would retest very three months and insist on a repeat biopsy in a year. Unless the doc shows you on the path report that you've got a very large Prostate and has VERY good reason to not assume the Psa being that high is not attributable to BPH or some other benign issue. Hope this provides you with some perspective. HGPIN is known to not always, but OFTEN, turn into Cancer",

The T1c is great, that means no abnormalities felt on the DRE of the prostate. uC from what I hear is a great place for this, and you'll be in great hands. We all know your head is swimming now, because none of us will ever forget how we were, the day we got the news and the weeks that followed. But your gonna be fine, and a year from now, (less actually), you will likely look back at this as a bump in the road. One thing - get your slides sent to Epstein or Bostwick for a second opinion.

      "Content": "JMorris All good advice above. I'm just 12 days past surgery, so it's still fresh in my mind. So I'll add what I can without being repetitive... First couple of days, maybe three, will be tough. Butvthen you will start to see big improvements each day for a week or two Assuming you are doin robotic, you will have gas pains in your chest shoulders back and neck, this is gas they pump in you to open up the area and give them more room to work. The only way to get rid of this a is to walk. So walk as much as you can every day. Try to walk within a few hours of getting out of recovery room. They will, push you to do that. Go with it. GasX and tums might help a bit too. The catheter is annoying, but not painful. But the day they take the catheter out, is a day that you will want to be declared as a national holiday, you will feel like q new man. To give you an idea of how quickly things will progress, I am 12 days past surgery and only 3 days past getting the catheter out. I walked three miles in an hour yesterday. I'm 64. Good luck, and please, when it's over come back and keep us posted. There is a lot of support for you here if you want it. See you on the other side.",

I dont remember if i mentioned this upcoming trip, but i spent 3 days in Vancouver, a beautiful, and hip city, 8 days cruising Alaska, which was amazing, and then a 2 night stay in Seattle, another great place. Got back last night. While i did have internet access, i made it a point not to log on, i just felt i needed a rest. Between my RALP in January, and the stents and Coronary Artery disease in June, i was just worn out. So i tuned out. I have to say, this was the most timely vacation I've ever taken. I found myself not thinking about cancer (or heart disease) for days at a time, which was a new experience for me. I also found some perspective on life, i believe. I know that i will still be a lunatic if something else goes wrong. But for now, i feel more relaxed about things than i have in a long time. My reason for posting this, is for the new guys. I've noticed in the two weeks i am back, that a lot of new guys have shown up here, and while i dont like to have to welcome them to our reluctant brotherhood, its good for the forum, because we help them and they hopefully get through treatment and help the next group. So my message to the new guys, is there is life after PC, and a really good life. Stay positive, none of us want to be here but we are and there is a lot of life ahead of us to enjoy. Time heals. Take your time to be upset when newly diagnosed, its totally normal. Then get treatment, kick some ass, and take a long vacation. Stay positive",

      "Content": "Thanks guys. @Ray --- Glacier Bay was truly an amazing sight. I got some great photo shots, but I don't think they do justice to the sight of it in person. But for me, the highlight of the trip was a helicopter to the top of Taku Glacier, one of the four major Glaciers in the Juneau Icefield. When I got out of the heli, and stepped onto the Glacier, it was a real adrenalin rush. I walked over to a nearby Glacier Lake, got on my knees and drank from it! (But not too much, for fear of having to pee before I got back LOL)",

Ingot the results online and have an appointment tomorrow at the surgeons office but not with the Dr., I am supposed to meet with his director of Wellness, who does the nutrition, and other holistic stuff. He said I didn't need to see him this visit . And I said, right, unless the PSA comes back detectable. He responded by telling me \"with your surgical pathology, it's not going to happen. So here I am looking 7 times to make sure I wasn't seeing things, at a 3.38. I called the office spoke to the PA, she said it's likely a mistake. Said to retest when I come in tomorrow, and they'd have the results Monday. But I didn't want to wait the weekend, in this mental state, so I asked if I could drive into the city (about an hour, and get the blood draw tonight, which I did. I'll have results tomorrow. My surgical pathology was (3+4), negative margins (1 positive intra operative margin so he cut more and got a negative final margin. No ECE, SV-, 9 lymph nodes all negative. So how can this happen. It's high probability it was an error by the lab. But doesn't make sense how do you make such an error? I called the lab and asked them to check and make sure I was given my results and not someone else's. They did so and confirmed it was mine. They said the blood tube is checked carefully so there cannot be a mixup in the blood, and when the girl drew my blood at the Quest Center, she put the label on the tube, and showed it to me with m name and had me initial . Even of it was a mistake, and someone entered 3.38, but should have been .338, that's a huge jump from <.02 3 months ago. I'm confused scared and in a panic",

      "Content": "I don't know of any research which has DEFINITIVELY, in peer reviewed studies, shown any foods to be good, or bad, for PC, either prevention wise, or after diagnosis. In fact, part of the diet conversation has always been, eliminate red meat, and here is your dad, a vegan, with an advanced case of PC. With that said, from my readings, and conversations with various Drs and Nutritionists, my understanding is that there is very strong evidence that dairy products are not good for Prostate Cancer, and also egg yolks. Something about choline in egg yolks, and calcium in dairy, so even fat free dairy is believed to be something that should be limited. Also, I've read that a heart healthy diet is synonymous with a prostate healthy diet. So no enriched wheat, only whole wheat, whole grains, high protein, low fat, etc. Also, cruciferous vegetables are thought to be good, i.e. broccoli, cauliflower, brussel sprouts. I follow the above, but loosely, I'm not going to stop living life based on theories. Again, these are things that have been thought to have strong links, both positive and negative, but none of this to my knowledge, has been proven in peer reviewed studies.",

So when I get my surgical path report next week, even if it's all good, I won't really know if I'm cured until I die of something else. That's something we all have yo live with.

      "Content": "Thanks Michael. I did call Quest and asked questions. They checked and confirmed that the numbers posted on my account were in fact my numbers. And when I asked if it's possible that tubes of blood were mixed up, she said highly unlikely, as the tubes are meticulously identified at every step of the process. Also when they took the blood, at the local center, she showed me the tube right after taking my blood and asked me for confirmation that my name, etc w was correct. I asked her if there was any change in the testing assay method and she didn't even know what that meant, she also told me that the normal range was below 4, so it's not a result that should be questioned. At that point I corrected her and pointed out that under 4 is for someone with a. Prostate, and that the test ordered for me was a post prostatectomy test. But I realized that the person. Spoke to was an idiot. If this turns out to be an error, and I'm undetectable, trust me, the CEO is getting a letter from me via FedEx, not that it will matter. I just hope I get that opportunity. Hey,mlogically. Know it's an error in all likelihood. But emotionally I can't help but be a wreck. Even if the number is .338, rather than 3.38, that would be a huge jump in three months. The Xanax is kicking in (I hate taking that) so I guess I'll get through the night, then going yo Dr first thing in the AM PS, Iremember posting about problems with Quest, but never saw or heard of anything like this",

Ingot the results online and have an appointment tomorrow at the surgeons office but not with the Dr., I am supposed to meet with his director of Wellness, who does the nutrition, and other holistic stuff. He said I didn't need to see him this visit . And I said, right, unless the PSA comes back detectable. He responded by telling me \"with your surgical pathology, it's not going to happen. So here I am looking 7 times to make sure I wasn't seeing things, at a 3.38. I called the office spoke to the PA, she said it's likely a mistake. Said to retest when I come in tomorrow, and they'd have the results Monday. But I didn't want to wait the weekend, in this mental state, so I asked if I could drive into the city (about an hour, and get the blood draw tonight, which I did. I'll have results tomorrow. My surgical pathology was (3+4), negative margins (1 positive intra operative margin so he cut more and got a negative final margin. No ECE, SV-, 9 lymph nodes all negative. So how can this happen. It's high probability it was an error by the lab. But doesn't make sense how do you make such an error? I called the lab and asked them to check and make sure I was given my results and not someone else's. They did so and confirmed it was mine. They said the blood tube is checked carefully so there cannot be a mixup in the blood, and when the girl drew my blood at the Quest Center, she put the label on the tube, and showed it to me with m name and had me initial . Even of it was a mistake, and someone entered 3.38, but should have been .338, that's a huge jump from <.02 3 months ago. I'm confused scared and in a panic",

First couple of days, maybe three, will be tough. Butvthen you will start to see big improvements each day for a week or two Assuming you are doin robotic, you will have gas pains in your chest shoulders back and neck, this is gas they pump in you to open up the area and give them more room to work. The only way to get rid of this a is to walk. So walk as much as you can every day. Try to walk within a few hours of getting out of recovery room. They will, push you to do that. Go with it. GasX and tums might help a bit too. The catheter is annoying, but not painful. But the day they take the catheter out, is a day that you will want to be declared as a national holiday, you will feel like q new man. To give you an idea of how quickly things will progress, I am 12 days past surgery and only 3 days past getting the catheter out. I walked three miles in an hour yesterday. I'm 64. Good luck, and please, when it's over come back and keep us posted. There is a lot of support for you here if you want it. See you on the other side.",

This was the first time I had a chance to speak/meet with him directly, since the surgery, so I got to ask all my questions It was a great meeting. My one concern was the upgrade from G6 to g7 (3+4). He told me with negative margins and everything, I should be celebrating. He said that of all his patients with the same pathology as me, less than 5% have needed further treatment, and he's never lost one. (whew, that's a relief) So all good. He also told me my follow ups would be every 3 months for the first year, then we go to every 6 months. That was good news, because I had thought it would be 3 month visits for 2 years. I told him I was so happy I chose surgery, and that I chose him as my surgeon, and I meant it. I walked out of there, feeling more confident about the future than I have since this whole shitstorm started.",

In fact, part of the diet conversation has always been, eliminate red meat, and here is your dad, a vegan, with an advanced case of PC. With that said, from my readings, and conversations with various Drs and Nutritionists, my understanding is that there is very strong evidence that dairy products are not good for Prostate Cancer, and also egg yolks. Something about choline in egg yolks, and calcium in dairy, so even fat free dairy is believed to be something that should be limited. Also, I've read that a heart healthy diet is synonymous with a prostate healthy diet. So no enriched wheat, only whole wheat, whole grains, high protein, low fat, etc. Also, cruciferous vegetables are thought to be good, i.e. broccoli, cauliflower, brussel sprouts. I follow the above, but loosely, I'm not going to stop living life based on theories. Again, these are things that have been thought to have strong links, both positive and negative, but none of this to my knowledge, has been proven in peer reviewed studies.",

Sitting in the docs office after removing the catheter, when they were waiting for me to void before letting me leave, i didnt even realize i was leaking, then after about an hour and a half, i reaized not only was my depends brief wet, my sweatpants were soaked. It will change, just do your kegels, do a lot of walking, and over time you will see. Last night at 5 months post op, i slept 8 straight hours without waking up to pee for the first time. When i woke up my bladder felt like it was about to burst, but i was dry. Immediately after surgery, i couldnt go more than 2 1/2 or 3 hours. Also, you will find later on especially, as you recover, that you will piss like a water canon. And even though your bladder feels really really full, it will take you not more than 15 seconds to empty it. Good luck with your recovery",

      "Content": "JLukas, you are a good son. I am, your dads age, 64, and I had surgery with Ash Tewari 2 weeks ago tomorrow. I would highly recommend him, and you may hear the same from another member soon NYCGman. I also used Jonathan Epstein at Johns Hopkins for 2nd opinion on the pathology slides, you should do it. As far as a radiation oncologist, one of the more well known in Nyc is dr Zelefsky, at MSKCC. HE specializes in Brachytherapy, which is radioactive seeds, but I'm sure he can talk to you about other types of radiation. I consulted with Dr Gewanter at MSKCC, AT THEIR Long Island Facility. Great professional, good man. Be aware, that before Dr ZELEFSKY will see you, he will require your slides, the pathology report, the discs from your dads bone scan and CT scan and you will have to have (your father I mean) a 3Tesla multiparametricMRI metric MRI done. (This is also done by Dr Tewari , required by him before surgery to help him plan. ) The MRI cannot be done for 6-7 weeks after biopsy, or it will be inaccurate. What I did was, I immediately scheduled the surgery with dr Tewari at my first visit. It can't be done for at least 6-7 weeks after biopsy. I used that time to explore the other options. And I did the MRI at Mount SiNai, with prescription from Dr Tewari, and had a copy sent to dr Gewanter, the RO at MSKCC. THIS WAY, I DIDNT LOSE ANY TIME. Have your dad explore ALL options. I am a surgery guy, others would rather do radiation. The both have their upside and downside. You need to learn a lot, and make an informed decision. radiation Oncologists will tell you do radiation and surgeons will be biased towards surgery. Dr. Tewari at my first visit, encouraged me to consult with a radiation oncologist as well before making up my mind. If you have other questions and want to PM me for my email address I will be happy to try to help. Know one thing though - this is not a death sentence. When we are first diagnosed most of us are in a fog. But as we educate ourselves, we learn that this disease is curable, and for the minority of unlucky ones who cannot be cured, there is a lot that can be done to hold this beast at bay for many years, even decades. And your dads PSA would seem to indicate good chance that he has early stage/curable disease Last thing - the suggestion to buy and read dr Patrick Walshs book is a good one. Almost a must. Get the third edition, it's the most recent, you can buy or download it on amazon. You are not alone we are here and anxious to help.",

Ingot the results online and have an appointment tomorrow at the surgeons office but not with the Dr., I am supposed to meet with his director of Wellness, who does the nutrition, and other holistic stuff. He said I didn't need to see him this visit . And I said, right, unless the PSA comes back detectable. He responded by telling me \"with your surgical pathology, it's not going to happen. So here I am looking 7 times to make sure I wasn't seeing things, at a 3.38. I called the office spoke to the PA, she said it's likely a mistake. Said to retest when I come in tomorrow, and they'd have the results Monday. But I didn't want to wait the weekend, in this mental state, so I asked if I could drive into the city (about an hour, and get the blood draw tonight, which I did. I'll have results tomorrow. My surgical pathology was (3+4), negative margins (1 positive intra operative margin so he cut more and got a negative final margin. No ECE, SV-, 9 lymph nodes all negative. So how can this happen. It's high probability it was an error by the lab. But doesn't make sense how do you make such an error? I called the lab and asked them to check and make sure I was given my results and not someone else's. They did so and confirmed it was mine. They said the blood tube is checked carefully so there cannot be a mixup in the blood, and when the girl drew my blood at the Quest Center, she put the label on the tube, and showed it to me with m name and had me initial . Even of it was a mistake, and someone entered 3.38, but should have been .338, that's a huge jump from <.02 3 months ago. I'm confused scared and in a panic",

      "Content": "Thanks Michael. I did call Quest and asked questions. They checked and confirmed that the numbers posted on my account were in fact my numbers. And when I asked if it's possible that tubes of blood were mixed up, she said highly unlikely, as the tubes are meticulously identified at every step of the process. Also when they took the blood, at the local center, she showed me the tube right after taking my blood and asked me for confirmation that my name, etc w was correct. I asked her if there was any change in the testing assay method and she didn't even know what that meant, she also told me that the normal range was below 4, so it's not a result that should be questioned. At that point I corrected her and pointed out that under 4 is for someone with a. Prostate, and that the test ordered for me was a post prostatectomy test. But I realized that the person. Spoke to was an idiot. If this turns out to be an error, and I'm undetectable, trust me, the CEO is getting a letter from me via FedEx, not that it will matter. I just hope I get that opportunity. Hey,mlogically. Know it's an error in all likelihood. But emotionally I can't help but be a wreck. Even if the number is .338, rather than 3.38, that would be a huge jump in three months. The Xanax is kicking in (I hate taking that) so I guess I'll get through the night, then going yo Dr first thing in the AM PS, Iremember posting about problems with Quest, but never saw or heard of anything like this",

      "Content": "John, welcome. I had surgery as my primary treatment. And most of us have a bias towards whatever treatment we chose. With that caveat, I'll say I'm not sorry. Uneventful, full recovery, no incontinence, and with Cialis no issues with turning little John into Big John. Hve you looked at SBRT (AKA Cyberknife)? It's got a very good 10 year track record now, I think IMRT for primary is old school, and what's more common these days is SBRT and HDR Brachytherapy, which leads me to my next question. You mentioned brachytherapy, but didn't differentiate between HDR and LDR. HDR is the newer and I think more state of the art form. Rectestosterone, I'm no expert, but I think there's a lot of scientific evidence that supplements don't promote PC growth. It's counterintuitive, I know, but that's what I read. Good luck and keep us posted",

I would highly recommend him, and you may hear the same from another member soon NYCGman. I also used Jonathan Epstein at Johns Hopkins for 2nd opinion on the pathology slides, you should do it. As far as a radiation oncologist, one of the more well known in Nyc is dr Zelefsky, at MSKCC. HE specializes in Brachytherapy, which is radioactive seeds, but I'm sure he can talk to you about other types of radiation. I consulted with Dr Gewanter at MSKCC, AT THEIR Long Island Facility. Great professional, good man. Be aware, that before Dr ZELEFSKY will see you, he will require your slides, the pathology report, the discs from your dads bone scan and CT scan and you will have to have (your father I mean) a 3Tesla multiparametricMRI metric MRI done. (This is also done by Dr Tewari , required by him before surgery to help him plan. ) The MRI cannot be done for 6-7 weeks after biopsy, or it will be inaccurate. What I did was, I immediately scheduled the surgery with dr Tewari at my first visit. It can't be done for at least 6-7 weeks after biopsy. I used that time to explore the other options. And I did the MRI at Mount SiNai, with prescription from Dr Tewari, and had a copy sent to dr Gewanter, the RO at MSKCC. THIS WAY, I DIDNT LOSE ANY TIME. Have your dad explore ALL options. I am a surgery guy, others would rather do radiation. The both have their upside and downside. You need to learn a lot, and make an informed decision. radiation Oncologists will tell you do radiation and surgeons will be biased towards surgery. Dr. Tewari at my first visit, encouraged me to consult with a radiation oncologist as well before making up my mind. If you have other questions and want to PM me for my email address I will be happy to try to help. Know one thing though - this is not a death sentence. When we are first diagnosed most of us are in a fog. But as we educate ourselves, we learn that this disease is curable, and for the minority of unlucky ones who cannot be cured, there is a lot that can be done to hold this beast at bay for many years, even decades. And your dads PSA would seem to indicate good chance that he has early stage/curable disease Last thing - the suggestion to buy and read dr Patrick Walshs book is a good one. Almost a must. Get the third edition, it's the most recent, you can buy or download it on amazon. You are not alone we are here and anxious to help.",

You make some good points With that said, I already know so much, that for my stage, I'm not sure what's left to learn (sure , there's always something more to learn, but you get my drift, I'm \"learned up\". I'm not even sure what I'm looking for sometimes when I start to do searches on the internet. I think what I'm describing, and thanks for helping me identify it, is \"obsession\" I think I'm too obsessed and that's what's unhealthy. Btw, you hit on another thing I obsess about....my plan is to spend Winters at my new home in Florida which I just purchased two months ago. And I obsess about the possibility that Health issues may I interfere with that plan. Then I say, well I can always get treatment in Florida. But I don't think the quality of care in Florida is up to the quality of care I get in NYC. So I obsess about that too.",

Gary, re your comment \"take a break from the forums for your own peace of mind\".....I've actually thought if that. I find it difficult.

I would schedule an appointment with Tewari, after you've had your bone andCT scans, although ithe scans are highly likely to be negative. Contact an RO as well. Take a breath, relax, it will all work out",

I would highly recommend him, and you may hear the same from another member soon NYCGman. I also used Jonathan Epstein at Johns Hopkins for 2nd opinion on the pathology slides, you should do it. As far as a radiation oncologist, one of the more well known in Nyc is dr Zelefsky, at MSKCC.

Great professional, good man. Be aware, that before Dr ZELEFSKY will see you, he will require your slides, the pathology report, the discs from your dads bone scan and CT scan and you will have to have (your father I mean) a 3Tesla multiparametricMRI metric MRI done. (This is also done by Dr Tewari , required by him before surgery to help him plan. ) The MRI cannot be done for 6-7 weeks after biopsy, or it will be inaccurate. What I did was, I immediately scheduled the surgery with dr Tewari at my first visit. It can't be done for at least 6-7 weeks after biopsy. I used that time to explore the other options. And I did the MRI at Mount SiNai, with prescription from Dr Tewari, and had a copy sent to dr Gewanter, the RO at MSKCC. THIS WAY, I DIDNT LOSE ANY TIME. Have your dad explore ALL options. I am a surgery guy, others would rather do radiation. The both have their upside and downside. You need to learn a lot, and make an informed decision. radiation Oncologists will tell you do radiation and surgeons will be biased towards surgery.

      "Content": "Logic, for me to tell you to relax is pointless, it won't happen unless you find a way to make it happen. Once I made the decision i was more relaxed till a day or two before the surgery. You chose a great dr try to just keep in mind that you chose him for a reason and have faith that he will cure you. Regarding your cincerns, I think every doc has a different opinion. Dr John Mulhall, at MSKCC is an acknowledged expert in ED, and works with PC patients in that area. I know of at least one guy who is being treated by him, and started seeing him BEFORE his surgery. I believe he said that Mullhall recommends taking Viagra or Cialis or whatever, before surgery. Others don't agree. But Mullhall is an expert. He wrote a book on sex after PC, which you can buy on Amazon http://http://www.amazon.com/Saving-Your-Sex-Life-Prostate/dp/0980064961/ref=sr_1_2?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1423745518&sr=1-2&keywords=Dr+john+Mulhall I didn't start taking Cialis until 2 weeks after surgery. And was getting erections almost immediately. And the other day I tried an experiment and stopped taking the Cialis for two days, and after 50 hours, of no Cialis, I was able to get a good solid erection. Everyone is different. But try to be optimistic. Regarding continence, as others have said, everyone is different. And also, docs have different opinions about Kegels before surgery. My Surgeon, Dr Tewari, recommended that I do them, which I did. And his nurse, after surgery, told me it would help me regain confidence faster. I did4 sets a day of 10 reps, and still am. Believe it or not, if you have a smart phone, there are apps that remind you at whatever time intervals you set and then guide you thru the reps. I am 5 weeks post surgery, and am leaking about .2-.3 ounces a day, not a big deal, just annoying. I expected (maybe like you?) that incontinence means pissing all over yourself like an old man in a nursing home. That's not what it is. The first day or two I was leaking heavily, like7 ounces in a 24 hour period. After that it improved fast. Btw, I have a friend who had surgery 4 years ago. He did NOT do Kegels before surgery, and when they took the catheter out, he was 100% continent within a day. So everyone is different Like someone said above, spend time with those important to you, think in terms of you are getting closer to being Cancer free and getting on with your life. And if possible, have as much sex as possible. I hope you can find some peace , I know it's not easy, but trust that this mental mess and all of the head trash in your mind is temporary. Now that you've sxheduled the surgery, there is light at the end of the tunnel.",

Again, these are things that have been thought to have strong links, both positive and negative, but none of this to my knowledge, has been proven in peer reviewed studies.",

Sitting in the docs office after removing the catheter, when they were waiting for me to void before letting me leave, i didnt even realize i was leaking, then after about an hour and a half, i reaized not only was my depends brief wet, my sweatpants were soaked. It will change, just do your kegels, do a lot of walking, and over time you will see. Last night at 5 months post op, i slept 8 straight hours without waking up to pee for the first time. When i woke up my bladder felt like it was about to burst, but i was dry. Immediately after surgery, i couldnt go more than 2 1/2 or 3 hours. Also, you will find later on especially, as you recover, that you will piss like a water canon. And even though your bladder feels really really full, it will take you not more than 15 seconds to empty it. Good luck with your recovery",

      "Content": "Logic, for me to tell you to relax is pointless, it won't happen unless you find a way to make it happen. Once I made the decision i was more relaxed till a day or two before the surgery. You chose a great dr try to just keep in mind that you chose him for a reason and have faith that he will cure you. Regarding your cincerns, I think every doc has a different opinion. Dr John Mulhall, at MSKCC is an acknowledged expert in ED, and works with PC patients in that area. I know of at least one guy who is being treated by him, and started seeing him BEFORE his surgery. I believe he said that Mullhall recommends taking Viagra or Cialis or whatever, before surgery. Others don't agree. But Mullhall is an expert. He wrote a book on sex after PC, which you can buy on Amazon http://http://www.amazon.com/Saving-Your-Sex-Life-Prostate/dp/0980064961/ref=sr_1_2?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1423745518&sr=1-2&keywords=Dr+john+Mulhall I didn't start taking Cialis until 2 weeks after surgery. And was getting erections almost immediately. And the other day I tried an experiment and stopped taking the Cialis for two days, and after 50 hours, of no Cialis, I was able to get a good solid erection. Everyone is different. But try to be optimistic. Regarding continence, as others have said, everyone is different. And also, docs have different opinions about Kegels before surgery. My Surgeon, Dr Tewari, recommended that I do them, which I did. And his nurse, after surgery, told me it would help me regain confidence faster. I did4 sets a day of 10 reps, and still am. Believe it or not, if you have a smart phone, there are apps that remind you at whatever time intervals you set and then guide you thru the reps. I am 5 weeks post surgery, and am leaking about .2-.3 ounces a day, not a big deal, just annoying. I expected (maybe like you?) that incontinence means pissing all over yourself like an old man in a nursing home. That's not what it is. The first day or two I was leaking heavily, like7 ounces in a 24 hour period. After that it improved fast. Btw, I have a friend who had surgery 4 years ago. He did NOT do Kegels before surgery, and when they took the catheter out, he was 100% continent within a day. So everyone is different Like someone said above, spend time with those important to you, think in terms of you are getting closer to being Cancer free and getting on with your life. And if possible, have as much sex as possible. I hope you can find some peace , I know it's not easy, but trust that this mental mess and all of the head trash in your mind is temporary. Now that you've sxheduled the surgery, there is light at the end of the tunnel.",

I'm fully continent, but as i said, i get the ghost squirts, even 9 months out, and i do get up some nights to pee. Also, on occasion, i would say maybe 3 times since my fully continent state began, about 6 wweeks after surgery, i have found myself waking up to find i peed myself. Not all over the place, on the bed, etc, but the underwear is wet in a decent size spot, once the whole front, but more often, maybe the size of a dollar bill, or a bit less. I think it happens mostly when i have drank a lot of water before going to bed and am very tired to begin with. Its not the end of the world, but psychologically, it upsets me.",

      "Content": "JLukas, you are a good son. I am, your dads age, 64, and I had surgery with Ash Tewari 2 weeks ago tomorrow. I would highly recommend him, and you may hear the same from another member soon NYCGman. I also used Jonathan Epstein at Johns Hopkins for 2nd opinion on the pathology slides, you should do it. As far as a radiation oncologist, one of the more well known in Nyc is dr Zelefsky, at MSKCC. HE specializes in Brachytherapy, which is radioactive seeds, but I'm sure he can talk to you about other types of radiation. I consulted with Dr Gewanter at MSKCC, AT THEIR Long Island Facility. Great professional, good man. Be aware, that before Dr ZELEFSKY will see you, he will require your slides, the pathology report, the discs from your dads bone scan and CT scan and you will have to have (your father I mean) a 3Tesla multiparametricMRI metric MRI done. (This is also done by Dr Tewari , required by him before surgery to help him plan. ) The MRI cannot be done for 6-7 weeks after biopsy, or it will be inaccurate. What I did was, I immediately scheduled the surgery with dr Tewari at my first visit. It can't be done for at least 6-7 weeks after biopsy. I used that time to explore the other options. And I did the MRI at Mount SiNai, with prescription from Dr Tewari, and had a copy sent to dr Gewanter, the RO at MSKCC. THIS WAY, I DIDNT LOSE ANY TIME. Have your dad explore ALL options. I am a surgery guy, others would rather do radiation. The both have their upside and downside. You need to learn a lot, and make an informed decision. radiation Oncologists will tell you do radiation and surgeons will be biased towards surgery. Dr. Tewari at my first visit, encouraged me to consult with a radiation oncologist as well before making up my mind. If you have other questions and want to PM me for my email address I will be happy to try to help. Know one thing though - this is not a death sentence. When we are first diagnosed most of us are in a fog. But as we educate ourselves, we learn that this disease is curable, and for the minority of unlucky ones who cannot be cured, there is a lot that can be done to hold this beast at bay for many years, even decades. And your dads PSA would seem to indicate good chance that he has early stage/curable disease Last thing - the suggestion to buy and read dr Patrick Walshs book is a good one. Almost a must. Get the third edition, it's the most recent, you can buy or download it on amazon. You are not alone we are here and anxious to help.",

      "Content": "Apologies to the guys and gals here who are on the \"other forum\"... I'm. Opting and pasting this for the folks who are not on that forum. I posted it there, and thought it was worth getting a discussion going here to for the benefit of the guys who frequent this forum only (and me ). So it's about what seems to have become my \"life's work.... I'm not referring to my work as a Financial Planner, I'm referring to what seems to have become my life's work, life as a senior citizen with health issues. And I'm not even sure if this is a rant, or a question. But I'm curious to know if I'm in the majority or minority, I.e. How others manage things. Between my prostate Cancer which has been in the rear view mirror, but might be pulling up alongside me now, and my coronary artery disease, which will always be in front of me, and family members health issues, I find myself totally preoccupied with all matters health. Diet, exercise, supplements, dr appointments, and the inevitable \"worry\". I manage to have a good time with my friends, and manage to focus on work when I'm in the office, or with a client. But health I always there. I constantly wonder if I'm doing the right things diet wise, supplement wise. And uncertainty about the future is always in the back, sometimes in the front, of my mind. When I am not at work, or out with friends,I'm reading a health book, or searching the internet for studies, or on a forum. I thought of taking a long vacation from ALL the health related forums I'm on, but I don't want to. Which is bad. I take Zoloft, it helps, I do biofeedback breathing exercises, I think it helps. I try mindfulness. But the bottom line is that health has become, in some sense, my life's work. I fear this is unhealthy, and will only make things worse in the long term. Not to mention all the time I spend on it that I could be doing other things (stupid mindless things like watching replays of Seinfeld, or useful things like learning to be a good photographer) Maybe I'm wrong, but I'm guessing I'm not the only one here in this mindset. Especially guys with more advanced cases than mine. Maybe this would be a useful discussion for others. I think if it was \"just\" prostate cancer (forgive me), it would be easier. But combined with heart disease, and other family issues I'm dealing with, it's hard to get away from it. Thoughts?",

      "Content": "Thanks for the response Rob. You make some good points With that said, I already know so much, that for my stage, I'm not sure what's left to learn (sure , there's always something more to learn, but you get my drift, I'm \"learned up\". I'm not even sure what I'm looking for sometimes when I start to do searches on the internet. I think what I'm describing, and thanks for helping me identify it, is \"obsession\" I think I'm too obsessed and that's what's unhealthy. Btw, you hit on another thing I obsess about....my plan is to spend Winters at my new home in Florida which I just purchased two months ago. And I obsess about the possibility that Health issues may I interfere with that plan. Then I say, well I can always get treatment in Florida. But I don't think the quality of care in Florida is up to the quality of care I get in NYC. So I obsess about that too.",

Still some leaking but improving, had an erection when I woke up this morning, but that's unusual, it can take a long time for many, everyone is different, some don't get it back. No real pain, just less stamina which will resolve with Time. I would schedule an appointment with Tewari, after you've had your bone andCT scans, although ithe scans are highly likely to be negative. Contact an RO as well.

Luckily for me, i experienced no side effects at all, with the exception of the possibilty that these palpatations i've been getting were from the Cialis. (but i dont think so). On another note, i have been off Cialis for 10 days, and was able to have sex last night with no problem. So thats encouraging, but i am still hoping when this cardiac thing is figured out and over, i can go back on it.",

      "Content": "Allen, My surgeon has dictated that he wants me to continue on Cialis for the time being because it will continue to promote blood flow to the area, separate from the erectile function issue. That's his protocol Now if my cardiac issue prevents that, then according to his NO they will recommend injections, trimix I guess. At that point I'll have to make a decision, which will probably be to say no. I really don't want to be sticking needles in my junk. And I think it puts me at higher risk for peyronies. But if I can take the cialis after the cardiac thing is resolved, why not",

      "Content": "JLukas, you are a good son. I am, your dads age, 64, and I had surgery with Ash Tewari 2 weeks ago tomorrow. I would highly recommend him, and you may hear the same from another member soon NYCGman. I also used Jonathan Epstein at Johns Hopkins for 2nd opinion on the pathology slides, you should do it. As far as a radiation oncologist, one of the more well known in Nyc is dr Zelefsky, at MSKCC. HE specializes in Brachytherapy, which is radioactive seeds, but I'm sure he can talk to you about other types of radiation. I consulted with Dr Gewanter at MSKCC, AT THEIR Long Island Facility. Great professional, good man. Be aware, that before Dr ZELEFSKY will see you, he will require your slides, the pathology report, the discs from your dads bone scan and CT scan and you will have to have (your father I mean) a 3Tesla multiparametricMRI metric MRI done. (This is also done by Dr Tewari , required by him before surgery to help him plan. ) The MRI cannot be done for 6-7 weeks after biopsy, or it will be inaccurate. What I did was, I immediately scheduled the surgery with dr Tewari at my first visit. It can't be done for at least 6-7 weeks after biopsy. I used that time to explore the other options. And I did the MRI at Mount SiNai, with prescription from Dr Tewari, and had a copy sent to dr Gewanter, the RO at MSKCC. THIS WAY, I DIDNT LOSE ANY TIME. Have your dad explore ALL options. I am a surgery guy, others would rather do radiation. The both have their upside and downside. You need to learn a lot, and make an informed decision. radiation Oncologists will tell you do radiation and surgeons will be biased towards surgery. Dr. Tewari at my first visit, encouraged me to consult with a radiation oncologist as well before making up my mind. If you have other questions and want to PM me for my email address I will be happy to try to help. Know one thing though - this is not a death sentence. When we are first diagnosed most of us are in a fog. But as we educate ourselves, we learn that this disease is curable, and for the minority of unlucky ones who cannot be cured, there is a lot that can be done to hold this beast at bay for many years, even decades. And your dads PSA would seem to indicate good chance that he has early stage/curable disease Last thing - the suggestion to buy and read dr Patrick Walshs book is a good one. Almost a must. Get the third edition, it's the most recent, you can buy or download it on amazon. You are not alone we are here and anxious to help.",

Still some leaking but improving, had an erection when I woke up this morning, but that's unusual, it can take a long time for many, everyone is different, some don't get it back. No real pain, just less stamina which will resolve with Time. I would schedule an appointment with Tewari, after you've had your bone andCT scans, although ithe scans are highly likely to be negative. Contact an RO as well. Take a breath, relax, it will all work out",

Just a comment, I know of many guys, here and on other forums whose initial diagnosis included multiple bone mets, and PSA in the hundreds, even thousands, who have been fighting the good fight for many years, and still are, and leading productive happy lives.

I posted it there, and thought it was worth getting a discussion going here to for the benefit of the guys who frequent this forum only (and me ). So it's about what seems to have become my \"life's work.... I'm not referring to my work as a Financial Planner, I'm referring to what seems to have become my life's work, life as a senior citizen with health issues. And I'm not even sure if this is a rant, or a question. But I'm curious to know if I'm in the majority or minority, I.e. How others manage things. Between my prostate Cancer which has been in the rear view mirror, but might be pulling up alongside me now, and my coronary artery disease, which will always be in front of me, and family members health issues, I find myself totally preoccupied with all matters health. Diet, exercise, supplements, dr appointments, and the inevitable \"worry\". I manage to have a good time with my friends, and manage to focus on work when I'm in the office, or with a client. But health I always there. I constantly wonder if I'm doing the right things diet wise, supplement wise. And uncertainty about the future is always in the back, sometimes in the front, of my mind. When I am not at work, or out with friends,I'm reading a health book, or searching the internet for studies, or on a forum. I thought of taking a long vacation from ALL the health related forums I'm on, but I don't want to. Which is bad. I take Zoloft, it helps, I do biofeedback breathing exercises, I think it helps. I try mindfulness. But the bottom line is that health has become, in some sense, my life's work. I fear this is unhealthy, and will only make things worse in the long term. Not to mention all the time I spend on it that I could be doing other things (stupid mindless things like watching replays of Seinfeld, or useful things like learning to be a good photographer) Maybe I'm wrong, but I'm guessing I'm not the only one here in this mindset. Especially guys with more advanced cases than mine. Maybe this would be a useful discussion for others. I think if it was \"just\" prostate cancer (forgive me), it would be easier. But combined with heart disease, and other family issues I'm dealing with, it's hard to get away from it. Thoughts?",

      "Content": "JimBow, welcome to the forum, and our \"reluctant brotherhood\". It tends to be a bit quiet here on the weekends, some replies will trickle in, but by early in the week, you'll have way more, and alot from folks more knowledgeable than i am. Just remember, the most important thing is to do your own research, we can relate our experiences and give our opinions, although none of us, as far as i know, are doctors, and even if we were, we may not know all the specifics of your case. First of all, slow down, take a deep breath, your world is not going to come to an end, it will just change. I can tell you from my personal experience, that its really not nearly as bad as we all expect, when we get the diagnosis and our minds start running wild. I was in your position, exactly a year ago, having been diagnosed in November of 2014, with my biopsy showing a Gleason 6. However after surgery my pathology was changed to a G7(3+4). So i guess the first question that would be worth knowing is, were you a 3+4 or a 4+3? One is low intermediate risk, the other is high intermediate risk. There is a clear difference. But the good news is, you are not an 8 9 or one of the rare G10s. Those are the very aggressive tumors. . As i said, i was exactly where you were a year ago, and had my surgery January 6th, 2015. In March i was back to work (desk job). In May i was playing golf (i could have played months earlier if the weather allowed). In July i wennt on a two week trip to Vancouver and Alaska. November i ran a 5K with my daughter (to benefit Prostate Cancer Awareness). And in December, i flew to Aruba for 9 days in the sun. SO ALL IS NOT LOST, YOUR LIFE WILL BE FULL OF HAPPINESS AGAIN, AFTER YOU GET THROUGH THIS. Yes, there are guys who have ongoing problems. But the majority move on and live their full lives as before. PC is a very slow growing cancer in the vast majority of cases. Good on ya that you bought Walshs book. Its a great primer for newly diagnosed guys. Make sure you have the 3rd edition. But even some of that is outdated, as it was published in 2012 and things are moving fast in PC treatement world (for the better). For my money, surgery is probably the right thing for you, just based on your age. But you should look at the various forms of radiation as well. SBRT (Cyberknife), IMRT, IGRT, LDR and HDR Brachy (seeds). They've all gotten great results with low and intermediate risk guys, if the cancer has not escaped the prostate capsule. And with your relatively low PSA, combined with the fact that you had cancer showing only on one side, and a negative DRE, the chances of no escape, are pretty high. In fact, if there was escape, radiation would probably be the better choice, because radiation cooks not only the prostate, but surrounding tissue. There is a reason i think its important to explore all options. You get only one shot at CHOOSING the best treatment. If you look at all the possibilites, and are educated about them, the side effects of each, the results of each, etc, you will choose the right one for YOU (everyone is different) with CONFIDENCE AND YOU WON'T LOOK BACK. And once you do that you will feel so much better. And you won't look back. Remember, most Urologists are surgeons, and many if not most surgeons will recommend surgery. Radiation Oncologists will recommend radiation. Not because they don't have you best interest at heart. But because they have a natural bias. They believe in what they do, or they wouldn't be doing it. So its up to you to decide on whats best for YOU. The phase you are in now, understanding, educating, and deciding, is probably the hardest part of this journey. Which brings me to 3TmultiParametric MRI. You should ask for one. It will tell you with about 90-95% certainty whether there has been any escape from the capsule. If there has, it might affect your treatment choice. The other thing you should do, that might affect your treatment choice, is get a second opinion on the pathology. Have the slides sent to either Jonathan Epstein at Johns Hopkins, or David Bostwick and Bostwick Labs. Your Doctor gets this request all the time from newly diagnosed guys that are educating themselves about the disease, and should know where to send them. If not, just google Johns Hopkins Second Opinion Service Prostate, and it will take you to the instructions. They charge $250, its usually not covered by insurance but its worth it. And Dr Epstein will get on the phone with you after the results are in, if you have questions. The reason this is important, is that these two guys ,Epstein and Bostwick, are the acknowldged experts in Prostate Cell Pathology. And reading prostate slides is a very subjective thing. Most local pathologists generally read all kinds of slides, so before reading yours, they might have read a breast or colon slide. Epstein (and Bostwick) read only Prostate Slides. When i asked my surgeon, if i could take Espteins second opinion to the bank, his response was \"Epstein IS the bank\". My Biopsy was originally diagnosed at Gleason 8 (3+5). UGH!!! Epstein downgraded it to a G6 (3+3). As i mentioned after surgery, when they looked at the entire prostate, they found G6, but also found some g7(3+4). The biopsy samples only about 1/1000th of the prostate, so it can often miss something. Thats why in about 30% of cases, post surgical pathology changes the Gleason score. Don't worry about hormone therapy right now, it may well not be necessary. Especially if your Gleason is a 7(3+4) Regarding surgery, you want a surgeon who is highly experienced, having done at least 300 surgeries, according to research, but for margin of safety i wanted at least 1000. Arbitrary number i know. The surgeon i chose, Dr Ash Tewari, in NYC, hadover 6000 under his belt. Everyone has a different experience. For me, the surgery wasnt so bad, and i was fully continent after 5 weeks, and experienced no Erectile Dysfunction. I took Cialis for about 10 mnths, but am off it now, no need. Enough for now. 1. calm down 2. read the book 3. speak to many Practitioners in the various treatment options until you find the one you are comfortable with. 4. Slay the beast 5. Remember you aren't alone, we are all with you, we've all gone through it, survived, and thrived in most cases. Good luck , stick around, keep us posted along the way, and ask alot of questions of both us and your doctors.",

We're lymph nodes taken and were they positive or negative 3. We're the seminal vesicles positive or negative 4. Did the Cancer escape from the capsule 5. What was the final GLeason score. (About 30% of cases are upgraded on surgical pathology) Those are the main and most important issues. I'd also want to know what % of the tumor was involved by tumor, was there PErineural invasion (in post surgical pathology, most specimens will show this, but it's less important according to most experts, than if there was PNI in the biopsy), was the disease bi lateral or found on one side only It would help us to give you better answers if you posted your info in a signature block, I.e.

You make some good points With that said, I already know so much, that for my stage, I'm not sure what's left to learn (sure , there's always something more to learn, but you get my drift, I'm \"learned up\". I'm not even sure what I'm looking for sometimes when I start to do searches on the internet. I think what I'm describing, and thanks for helping me identify it, is \"obsession\" I think I'm too obsessed and that's what's unhealthy. Btw, you hit on another thing I obsess about....my plan is to spend Winters at my new home in Florida which I just purchased two months ago. And I obsess about the possibility that Health issues may I interfere with that plan. Then I say, well I can always get treatment in Florida. But I don't think the quality of care in Florida is up to the quality of care I get in NYC. So I obsess about that too.",

      "Content": "As documented in another thread, i had a \"positive\" echo stress test and my PCP, who is a Board Certified Cardiologist as well, took me off Cialis. Up to that point i have had no ED problems since RALP. The other day, after having gone 5 days with no Cialis, i engaged in \"doing the deed\" and still had no problem at all. So does this mean i no longer need to be on Cialis (putting the heart issue aside), or is it still too soon to tell? My Uro's NP, whom i called when this development occurred last week, said that being off Cialis for a few weeks wont hurt, but that they do like to keep patients on it longer term for a while, to promote blood flow. And she further said, that if i cannot go back on it in a few weeks or a month, they would suggest injections/Trimix, which i REALLY REALLY REALLY want nothing to do with, if i can avoid it. So just curious if anyone has any thoughts on 1. being able to \"do it\" after 5 days with no ED Meds means I'm home free, and 2. is it really important to do the injections if i am getting full erections at will, with no meds, 5 months post RP",

I took a xanax before i left the house, another one in the car, and a third one when i got to the Drs office. I was very looped. And it was not bad. Second biopsy i only took one xanax an hour before. easy peasy. 3. Be ready after the biopsy to piss some blood, lasts a day or two, up to a week. And be expecting that your gism will be blood red at first, then slowly turn brownish then in a few weeks back to normal 4. the fact that your PSA jumped so much in a short time, combined with the fact that the DRE was painful, leads me to think Prostatitis. Maybe ask for a round of Cipro before proceeding to biopsy? If that brings the PSA down to a much lower range, then its likely an infection. Good luck. Breathe",

I posted it there, and thought it was worth getting a discussion going here to for the benefit of the guys who frequent this forum only (and me ). So it's about what seems to have become my \"life's work.... I'm not referring to my work as a Financial Planner, I'm referring to what seems to have become my life's work, life as a senior citizen with health issues. And I'm not even sure if this is a rant, or a question. But I'm curious to know if I'm in the majority or minority, I.e. How others manage things. Between my prostate Cancer which has been in the rear view mirror, but might be pulling up alongside me now, and my coronary artery disease, which will always be in front of me, and family members health issues, I find myself totally preoccupied with all matters health. Diet, exercise, supplements, dr appointments, and the inevitable \"worry\". I manage to have a good time with my friends, and manage to focus on work when I'm in the office, or with a client. But health I always there. I constantly wonder if I'm doing the right things diet wise, supplement wise. And uncertainty about the future is always in the back, sometimes in the front, of my mind. When I am not at work, or out with friends,I'm reading a health book, or searching the internet for studies, or on a forum. I thought of taking a long vacation from ALL the health related forums I'm on, but I don't want to. Which is bad. I take Zoloft, it helps, I do biofeedback breathing exercises, I think it helps. I try mindfulness. But the bottom line is that health has become, in some sense, my life's work. I fear this is unhealthy, and will only make things worse in the long term. Not to mention all the time I spend on it that I could be doing other things (stupid mindless things like watching replays of Seinfeld, or useful things like learning to be a good photographer) Maybe I'm wrong, but I'm guessing I'm not the only one here in this mindset. Especially guys with more advanced cases than mine. Maybe this would be a useful discussion for others. I think if it was \"just\" prostate cancer (forgive me), it would be easier. But combined with heart disease, and other family issues I'm dealing with, it's hard to get away from it. Thoughts?",

      "Content": "JimBow, welcome to the forum, and our \"reluctant brotherhood\". It tends to be a bit quiet here on the weekends, some replies will trickle in, but by early in the week, you'll have way more, and alot from folks more knowledgeable than i am. Just remember, the most important thing is to do your own research, we can relate our experiences and give our opinions, although none of us, as far as i know, are doctors, and even if we were, we may not know all the specifics of your case. First of all, slow down, take a deep breath, your world is not going to come to an end, it will just change. I can tell you from my personal experience, that its really not nearly as bad as we all expect, when we get the diagnosis and our minds start running wild. I was in your position, exactly a year ago, having been diagnosed in November of 2014, with my biopsy showing a Gleason 6. However after surgery my pathology was changed to a G7(3+4). So i guess the first question that would be worth knowing is, were you a 3+4 or a 4+3? One is low intermediate risk, the other is high intermediate risk. There is a clear difference. But the good news is, you are not an 8 9 or one of the rare G10s. Those are the very aggressive tumors. . As i said, i was exactly where you were a year ago, and had my surgery January 6th, 2015. In March i was back to work (desk job). In May i was playing golf (i could have played months earlier if the weather allowed). In July i wennt on a two week trip to Vancouver and Alaska. November i ran a 5K with my daughter (to benefit Prostate Cancer Awareness). And in December, i flew to Aruba for 9 days in the sun. SO ALL IS NOT LOST, YOUR LIFE WILL BE FULL OF HAPPINESS AGAIN, AFTER YOU GET THROUGH THIS. Yes, there are guys who have ongoing problems. But the majority move on and live their full lives as before. PC is a very slow growing cancer in the vast majority of cases. Good on ya that you bought Walshs book. Its a great primer for newly diagnosed guys. Make sure you have the 3rd edition. But even some of that is outdated, as it was published in 2012 and things are moving fast in PC treatement world (for the better). For my money, surgery is probably the right thing for you, just based on your age. But you should look at the various forms of radiation as well. SBRT (Cyberknife), IMRT, IGRT, LDR and HDR Brachy (seeds). They've all gotten great results with low and intermediate risk guys, if the cancer has not escaped the prostate capsule. And with your relatively low PSA, combined with the fact that you had cancer showing only on one side, and a negative DRE, the chances of no escape, are pretty high. In fact, if there was escape, radiation would probably be the better choice, because radiation cooks not only the prostate, but surrounding tissue. There is a reason i think its important to explore all options. You get only one shot at CHOOSING the best treatment. If you look at all the possibilites, and are educated about them, the side effects of each, the results of each, etc, you will choose the right one for YOU (everyone is different) with CONFIDENCE AND YOU WON'T LOOK BACK. And once you do that you will feel so much better. And you won't look back. Remember, most Urologists are surgeons, and many if not most surgeons will recommend surgery. Radiation Oncologists will recommend radiation. Not because they don't have you best interest at heart. But because they have a natural bias. They believe in what they do, or they wouldn't be doing it. So its up to you to decide on whats best for YOU. The phase you are in now, understanding, educating, and deciding, is probably the hardest part of this journey. Which brings me to 3TmultiParametric MRI. You should ask for one. It will tell you with about 90-95% certainty whether there has been any escape from the capsule. If there has, it might affect your treatment choice. The other thing you should do, that might affect your treatment choice, is get a second opinion on the pathology. Have the slides sent to either Jonathan Epstein at Johns Hopkins, or David Bostwick and Bostwick Labs. Your Doctor gets this request all the time from newly diagnosed guys that are educating themselves about the disease, and should know where to send them. If not, just google Johns Hopkins Second Opinion Service Prostate, and it will take you to the instructions. They charge $250, its usually not covered by insurance but its worth it. And Dr Epstein will get on the phone with you after the results are in, if you have questions. The reason this is important, is that these two guys ,Epstein and Bostwick, are the acknowldged experts in Prostate Cell Pathology. And reading prostate slides is a very subjective thing. Most local pathologists generally read all kinds of slides, so before reading yours, they might have read a breast or colon slide. Epstein (and Bostwick) read only Prostate Slides. When i asked my surgeon, if i could take Espteins second opinion to the bank, his response was \"Epstein IS the bank\". My Biopsy was originally diagnosed at Gleason 8 (3+5). UGH!!! Epstein downgraded it to a G6 (3+3). As i mentioned after surgery, when they looked at the entire prostate, they found G6, but also found some g7(3+4). The biopsy samples only about 1/1000th of the prostate, so it can often miss something. Thats why in about 30% of cases, post surgical pathology changes the Gleason score. Don't worry about hormone therapy right now, it may well not be necessary. Especially if your Gleason is a 7(3+4) Regarding surgery, you want a surgeon who is highly experienced, having done at least 300 surgeries, according to research, but for margin of safety i wanted at least 1000. Arbitrary number i know. The surgeon i chose, Dr Ash Tewari, in NYC, hadover 6000 under his belt. Everyone has a different experience. For me, the surgery wasnt so bad, and i was fully continent after 5 weeks, and experienced no Erectile Dysfunction. I took Cialis for about 10 mnths, but am off it now, no need. Enough for now. 1. calm down 2. read the book 3. speak to many Practitioners in the various treatment options until you find the one you are comfortable with. 4. Slay the beast 5. Remember you aren't alone, we are all with you, we've all gone through it, survived, and thrived in most cases. Good luck , stick around, keep us posted along the way, and ask alot of questions of both us and your doctors.",

Nobody cares about you as much as you and your family . It's particularly important with prostate cancer, where there are so many treatments to choose from in most cases and also in most cases they will all cure you, particularly if your Gleason six diagnosis holds. Educate yourself do a lot of reading learn about the disease asked the doctors for guidance, make your own educated decisions, and then have a doctors execute on your decisions .

      "Content": "You need to find different Doctors, IMHO. FIrst, G6 is usually indolent, meaning you could have no treatment, NS stay on active surveillance. But active surveillance does not mean a PSA every six months. You should be monitored on a regular basis in a structured program with PSA tested every three months, annual biopsies etc. Second, it's very curious to me that your PSA would be as high as it is with G6 and only 2 cores positive. You might have some prostatitis going on in there in addition to the cancerous cells . Third, be aware but in about 30% of cases, for those who choose to go the surgery route ( not recommending for or against surgery ) The Gleason score is upgraded, to a more serious grade . On the other hand if you had something higher than a G6 the MRI a(I assume it was a 3T multi parametric MRI) usually will pick it up. In short, I don't think it's time to panic, but I do think you need to find a top doctor Who specializes in prostate cancer knows what he's doing. The only thing that any of your doctor said that make sense to me, is that in large lymph nodes should be investigated . The fact that the only way you found out about that is by reading the report, speaks volumes to how little you're attending doctor cares. I'd be furious.",

The fact that his PSA is under 20, suggests that its unlikely that bone mets will be detected. ... 1. have the slides sent to Dr Jonathan Epstein at Johns Hopkins for a second opinion. Reading these slides is very subjective and you want someone eyeballing the slides that is an expert at Prostate cells specifically, not a local pathologist who looks at all kinds of slides. The reason to get the second opinion, is not to confirm that there is cancer, with that many cores positive, there most definitely is. But it could be that the G7s get downgraded to G6, or upgraded to G8, which might change treatment options. 2. get and read Dr Patrick Walshs book \"surviving Prostate Cancer\". Make sure its the third edition. It will give you an excellent understanding of the disease and things you need to think about and ask your doctors. And its an easy read. 3. Consider asking that an MRI be done on the prostate. 3 TESLA Multiparametric MRI to be specific. This test is 95% accurate at determining whether the cancer has left the prostate. 4. make sure you explore ALL options available to you. Not just surgery, not just radiation. Thats enough for now, others will surely chime in soon. A couple of suggestions",

And sometimes I piss like a water canon and other times it's not a weak stream but not especially strong either. And there are a few occasions where I feel like I haven't fully emptied. The only difference for me is at night I rarely wake more than once a night. And sometimes I sleep 7 hours without waking. I find that to be dependent on whether I drink a lot of water after 8PM or so. These issues are things I am going to discuss with my surgeon in Jamuary at my one year follow up",

I took a xanax before i left the house, another one in the car, and a third one when i got to the Drs office. I was very looped. And it was not bad. Second biopsy i only took one xanax an hour before. easy peasy. 3. Be ready after the biopsy to piss some blood, lasts a day or two, up to a week. And be expecting that your gism will be blood red at first, then slowly turn brownish then in a few weeks back to normal 4. the fact that your PSA jumped so much in a short time, combined with the fact that the DRE was painful, leads me to think Prostatitis. Maybe ask for a round of Cipro before proceeding to biopsy? If that brings the PSA down to a much lower range, then its likely an infection. Good luck. Breathe",

His answer was just.... \"it can certainly happen. Anything is possible with Prostate Cancer\" and i was a g7(3+4) but with low Decipher. Regarding the Decipher Grid Report - i pointed out to my RO that the Grid Report states a low chance that Salvage Radiation would work (i dont recall the exact words)> He responded that its just investigational (as Chuck pointed out) and its not considered actionable science at this point. Regarding the benign prostate tissue question, its very doubtful, with a psa of .25 that benign tissue is causing the increase. .025, maybe, not .25 This sucks, sorry you are going through it, i am as well, although my psa is still lower, at .068 (next PSA blood draw this week). So i feel your pain. We just have to deal with it, and hope that we can move on after treatment. I keep saying lots of guys here have gone through it and come out the other end to enjoy life.

Was it a sudden jump, of a slow steady rise over a period of years? If a sudden jump it could be an infection. PSA is not an indication of cancer, its an indication that something is inflaming the prostate, and that something could be a number of things. Also, did the urologist do a Free PSA before goign to biopsy? Hang in there, and stick around, hope you dont need the help after you get results, but if its the news you fear, we are here to help",

      "Content": "JimBow, welcome to the forum, and our \"reluctant brotherhood\". It tends to be a bit quiet here on the weekends, some replies will trickle in, but by early in the week, you'll have way more, and alot from folks more knowledgeable than i am. Just remember, the most important thing is to do your own research, we can relate our experiences and give our opinions, although none of us, as far as i know, are doctors, and even if we were, we may not know all the specifics of your case. First of all, slow down, take a deep breath, your world is not going to come to an end, it will just change. I can tell you from my personal experience, that its really not nearly as bad as we all expect, when we get the diagnosis and our minds start running wild. I was in your position, exactly a year ago, having been diagnosed in November of 2014, with my biopsy showing a Gleason 6. However after surgery my pathology was changed to a G7(3+4). So i guess the first question that would be worth knowing is, were you a 3+4 or a 4+3? One is low intermediate risk, the other is high intermediate risk. There is a clear difference. But the good news is, you are not an 8 9 or one of the rare G10s. Those are the very aggressive tumors. . As i said, i was exactly where you were a year ago, and had my surgery January 6th, 2015. In March i was back to work (desk job). In May i was playing golf (i could have played months earlier if the weather allowed). In July i wennt on a two week trip to Vancouver and Alaska. November i ran a 5K with my daughter (to benefit Prostate Cancer Awareness). And in December, i flew to Aruba for 9 days in the sun. SO ALL IS NOT LOST, YOUR LIFE WILL BE FULL OF HAPPINESS AGAIN, AFTER YOU GET THROUGH THIS. Yes, there are guys who have ongoing problems. But the majority move on and live their full lives as before. PC is a very slow growing cancer in the vast majority of cases. Good on ya that you bought Walshs book. Its a great primer for newly diagnosed guys. Make sure you have the 3rd edition. But even some of that is outdated, as it was published in 2012 and things are moving fast in PC treatement world (for the better). For my money, surgery is probably the right thing for you, just based on your age. But you should look at the various forms of radiation as well. SBRT (Cyberknife), IMRT, IGRT, LDR and HDR Brachy (seeds). They've all gotten great results with low and intermediate risk guys, if the cancer has not escaped the prostate capsule. And with your relatively low PSA, combined with the fact that you had cancer showing only on one side, and a negative DRE, the chances of no escape, are pretty high. In fact, if there was escape, radiation would probably be the better choice, because radiation cooks not only the prostate, but surrounding tissue. There is a reason i think its important to explore all options. You get only one shot at CHOOSING the best treatment. If you look at all the possibilites, and are educated about them, the side effects of each, the results of each, etc, you will choose the right one for YOU (everyone is different) with CONFIDENCE AND YOU WON'T LOOK BACK. And once you do that you will feel so much better. And you won't look back. Remember, most Urologists are surgeons, and many if not most surgeons will recommend surgery. Radiation Oncologists will recommend radiation. Not because they don't have you best interest at heart. But because they have a natural bias. They believe in what they do, or they wouldn't be doing it. So its up to you to decide on whats best for YOU. The phase you are in now, understanding, educating, and deciding, is probably the hardest part of this journey. Which brings me to 3TmultiParametric MRI. You should ask for one. It will tell you with about 90-95% certainty whether there has been any escape from the capsule. If there has, it might affect your treatment choice. The other thing you should do, that might affect your treatment choice, is get a second opinion on the pathology. Have the slides sent to either Jonathan Epstein at Johns Hopkins, or David Bostwick and Bostwick Labs. Your Doctor gets this request all the time from newly diagnosed guys that are educating themselves about the disease, and should know where to send them. If not, just google Johns Hopkins Second Opinion Service Prostate, and it will take you to the instructions. They charge $250, its usually not covered by insurance but its worth it. And Dr Epstein will get on the phone with you after the results are in, if you have questions. The reason this is important, is that these two guys ,Epstein and Bostwick, are the acknowldged experts in Prostate Cell Pathology. And reading prostate slides is a very subjective thing. Most local pathologists generally read all kinds of slides, so before reading yours, they might have read a breast or colon slide. Epstein (and Bostwick) read only Prostate Slides. When i asked my surgeon, if i could take Espteins second opinion to the bank, his response was \"Epstein IS the bank\". My Biopsy was originally diagnosed at Gleason 8 (3+5). UGH!!! Epstein downgraded it to a G6 (3+3). As i mentioned after surgery, when they looked at the entire prostate, they found G6, but also found some g7(3+4). The biopsy samples only about 1/1000th of the prostate, so it can often miss something. Thats why in about 30% of cases, post surgical pathology changes the Gleason score. Don't worry about hormone therapy right now, it may well not be necessary. Especially if your Gleason is a 7(3+4) Regarding surgery, you want a surgeon who is highly experienced, having done at least 300 surgeries, according to research, but for margin of safety i wanted at least 1000. Arbitrary number i know. The surgeon i chose, Dr Ash Tewari, in NYC, hadover 6000 under his belt. Everyone has a different experience. For me, the surgery wasnt so bad, and i was fully continent after 5 weeks, and experienced no Erectile Dysfunction. I took Cialis for about 10 mnths, but am off it now, no need. Enough for now. 1. calm down 2. read the book 3. speak to many Practitioners in the various treatment options until you find the one you are comfortable with. 4. Slay the beast 5. Remember you aren't alone, we are all with you, we've all gone through it, survived, and thrived in most cases. Good luck , stick around, keep us posted along the way, and ask alot of questions of both us and your doctors.",

It continued that way till about 2 1/2 months. At my 3 month visit to my surgeon, it was only a once in a while,squirt, every few days. He told me it would continue to improve for another few months. And now at 4 months, I've been squirt free for about two weeks now. So you are right on track to total normalcy. Thanks again for this thread, on behalf of all the new dudes.",

      "Content": "Sorry your dad is having all these issues. A DRE prior to blood draw, and especially two DRE's, can and will raise PSA, but it won't raise a normal PSA into \"the hundreds\". I'd assume a catheter can raise PSA Significantly, although I've never read about that.. but I doubt into the 100's. An enlarged prostate and /or prostatitis, can raise PSA, but not into the 100's. But I'm thinking, wondering, I suppose all these things taken together, could possibly raise PSA by a lot. Maybe into the 100'a, I don't know. The only definitive diagnosis for Prostate Cancer is a biopsy . But your dad should try to eliminate all other possibilities first. If his doc indeed did do a DRE PRIOR to PSA blood draw, I would be looking for another doc, any urologist knows that's not good practice.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by brownie43 You stated you would be furious with the Dr. Well, it is the VA, and I forgot to mention that I am 73yrs. old. The first VA Urologist that I saw at the VA was a bit \"put off\" because I had a PSA in my labs., and said he would never order a PSA for anyone 70 or older but seeing as how someone else was ordering 'unnecessary lab work\", he would do a DRE (enlarged but no bumps). Said if I came in dragging an oxygen bottle or such, he would not order more tests, etc. but I was a youthful 73, so lucky me. Anyway, he did order up another PSA and recommended a biopsy. Not sure how to get a second opinion at the VA, so will probably go to my Medicare PCP So once we turn 70, we don't need the same level,of care? Because we are gonna die soon anyway? Absurd. I'm 66. I've got health issues. I still plan to be around for a long time. And part of that plan is to monitor for issues that haven't shown up yet.",

Nobody cares about you as much as you and your family . It's particularly important with prostate cancer, where there are so many treatments to choose from in most cases and also in most cases they will all cure you, particularly if your Gleason six diagnosis holds. Educate yourself do a lot of reading learn about the disease asked the doctors for guidance, make your own educated decisions, and then have a doctors execute on your decisions .

      "Content": "JimBow, welcome to the forum, and our \"reluctant brotherhood\". It tends to be a bit quiet here on the weekends, some replies will trickle in, but by early in the week, you'll have way more, and alot from folks more knowledgeable than i am. Just remember, the most important thing is to do your own research, we can relate our experiences and give our opinions, although none of us, as far as i know, are doctors, and even if we were, we may not know all the specifics of your case. First of all, slow down, take a deep breath, your world is not going to come to an end, it will just change. I can tell you from my personal experience, that its really not nearly as bad as we all expect, when we get the diagnosis and our minds start running wild. I was in your position, exactly a year ago, having been diagnosed in November of 2014, with my biopsy showing a Gleason 6. However after surgery my pathology was changed to a G7(3+4). So i guess the first question that would be worth knowing is, were you a 3+4 or a 4+3? One is low intermediate risk, the other is high intermediate risk. There is a clear difference. But the good news is, you are not an 8 9 or one of the rare G10s. Those are the very aggressive tumors. . As i said, i was exactly where you were a year ago, and had my surgery January 6th, 2015. In March i was back to work (desk job). In May i was playing golf (i could have played months earlier if the weather allowed). In July i wennt on a two week trip to Vancouver and Alaska. November i ran a 5K with my daughter (to benefit Prostate Cancer Awareness). And in December, i flew to Aruba for 9 days in the sun. SO ALL IS NOT LOST, YOUR LIFE WILL BE FULL OF HAPPINESS AGAIN, AFTER YOU GET THROUGH THIS. Yes, there are guys who have ongoing problems. But the majority move on and live their full lives as before. PC is a very slow growing cancer in the vast majority of cases. Good on ya that you bought Walshs book. Its a great primer for newly diagnosed guys. Make sure you have the 3rd edition. But even some of that is outdated, as it was published in 2012 and things are moving fast in PC treatement world (for the better). For my money, surgery is probably the right thing for you, just based on your age. But you should look at the various forms of radiation as well. SBRT (Cyberknife), IMRT, IGRT, LDR and HDR Brachy (seeds). They've all gotten great results with low and intermediate risk guys, if the cancer has not escaped the prostate capsule. And with your relatively low PSA, combined with the fact that you had cancer showing only on one side, and a negative DRE, the chances of no escape, are pretty high. In fact, if there was escape, radiation would probably be the better choice, because radiation cooks not only the prostate, but surrounding tissue. There is a reason i think its important to explore all options. You get only one shot at CHOOSING the best treatment. If you look at all the possibilites, and are educated about them, the side effects of each, the results of each, etc, you will choose the right one for YOU (everyone is different) with CONFIDENCE AND YOU WON'T LOOK BACK. And once you do that you will feel so much better. And you won't look back. Remember, most Urologists are surgeons, and many if not most surgeons will recommend surgery. Radiation Oncologists will recommend radiation. Not because they don't have you best interest at heart. But because they have a natural bias. They believe in what they do, or they wouldn't be doing it. So its up to you to decide on whats best for YOU. The phase you are in now, understanding, educating, and deciding, is probably the hardest part of this journey. Which brings me to 3TmultiParametric MRI. You should ask for one. It will tell you with about 90-95% certainty whether there has been any escape from the capsule. If there has, it might affect your treatment choice. The other thing you should do, that might affect your treatment choice, is get a second opinion on the pathology. Have the slides sent to either Jonathan Epstein at Johns Hopkins, or David Bostwick and Bostwick Labs. Your Doctor gets this request all the time from newly diagnosed guys that are educating themselves about the disease, and should know where to send them. If not, just google Johns Hopkins Second Opinion Service Prostate, and it will take you to the instructions. They charge $250, its usually not covered by insurance but its worth it. And Dr Epstein will get on the phone with you after the results are in, if you have questions. The reason this is important, is that these two guys ,Epstein and Bostwick, are the acknowldged experts in Prostate Cell Pathology. And reading prostate slides is a very subjective thing. Most local pathologists generally read all kinds of slides, so before reading yours, they might have read a breast or colon slide. Epstein (and Bostwick) read only Prostate Slides. When i asked my surgeon, if i could take Espteins second opinion to the bank, his response was \"Epstein IS the bank\". My Biopsy was originally diagnosed at Gleason 8 (3+5). UGH!!! Epstein downgraded it to a G6 (3+3). As i mentioned after surgery, when they looked at the entire prostate, they found G6, but also found some g7(3+4). The biopsy samples only about 1/1000th of the prostate, so it can often miss something. Thats why in about 30% of cases, post surgical pathology changes the Gleason score. Don't worry about hormone therapy right now, it may well not be necessary. Especially if your Gleason is a 7(3+4) Regarding surgery, you want a surgeon who is highly experienced, having done at least 300 surgeries, according to research, but for margin of safety i wanted at least 1000. Arbitrary number i know. The surgeon i chose, Dr Ash Tewari, in NYC, hadover 6000 under his belt. Everyone has a different experience. For me, the surgery wasnt so bad, and i was fully continent after 5 weeks, and experienced no Erectile Dysfunction. I took Cialis for about 10 mnths, but am off it now, no need. Enough for now. 1. calm down 2. read the book 3. speak to many Practitioners in the various treatment options until you find the one you are comfortable with. 4. Slay the beast 5. Remember you aren't alone, we are all with you, we've all gone through it, survived, and thrived in most cases. Good luck , stick around, keep us posted along the way, and ask alot of questions of both us and your doctors.",

The reason this is important, is that these two guys ,Epstein and Bostwick, are the acknowldged experts in Prostate Cell Pathology. And reading prostate slides is a very subjective thing. Most local pathologists generally read all kinds of slides, so before reading yours, they might have read a breast or colon slide. Epstein (and Bostwick) read only Prostate Slides. When i asked my surgeon, if i could take Espteins second opinion to the bank, his response was \"Epstein IS the bank\". My Biopsy was originally diagnosed at Gleason 8 (3+5). UGH!!! Epstein downgraded it to a G6 (3+3). As i mentioned after surgery, when they looked at the entire prostate, they found G6, but also found some g7(3+4). The biopsy samples only about 1/1000th of the prostate, so it can often miss something. Thats why in about 30% of cases, post surgical pathology changes the Gleason score. Don't worry about hormone therapy right now, it may well not be necessary. Especially if your Gleason is a 7(3+4) Regarding surgery, you want a surgeon who is highly experienced, having done at least 300 surgeries, according to research, but for margin of safety i wanted at least 1000. Arbitrary number i know. The surgeon i chose, Dr Ash Tewari, in NYC, hadover 6000 under his belt. Everyone has a different experience. For me, the surgery wasnt so bad, and i was fully continent after 5 weeks, and experienced no Erectile Dysfunction. I took Cialis for about 10 mnths, but am off it now, no need. Enough for now. 1. calm down 2. read the book 3. speak to many Practitioners in the various treatment options until you find the one you are comfortable with. 4. Slay the beast 5. Remember you aren't alone, we are all with you, we've all gone through it, survived, and thrived in most cases. Good luck , stick around, keep us posted along the way, and ask alot of questions of both us and your doctors.",

      "Content": "JimBow, welcome to the forum, and our \"reluctant brotherhood\". It tends to be a bit quiet here on the weekends, some replies will trickle in, but by early in the week, you'll have way more, and alot from folks more knowledgeable than i am. Just remember, the most important thing is to do your own research, we can relate our experiences and give our opinions, although none of us, as far as i know, are doctors, and even if we were, we may not know all the specifics of your case. First of all, slow down, take a deep breath, your world is not going to come to an end, it will just change. I can tell you from my personal experience, that its really not nearly as bad as we all expect, when we get the diagnosis and our minds start running wild. I was in your position, exactly a year ago, having been diagnosed in November of 2014, with my biopsy showing a Gleason 6. However after surgery my pathology was changed to a G7(3+4). So i guess the first question that would be worth knowing is, were you a 3+4 or a 4+3? One is low intermediate risk, the other is high intermediate risk. There is a clear difference. But the good news is, you are not an 8 9 or one of the rare G10s. Those are the very aggressive tumors. . As i said, i was exactly where you were a year ago, and had my surgery January 6th, 2015. In March i was back to work (desk job). In May i was playing golf (i could have played months earlier if the weather allowed). In July i wennt on a two week trip to Vancouver and Alaska. November i ran a 5K with my daughter (to benefit Prostate Cancer Awareness). And in December, i flew to Aruba for 9 days in the sun. SO ALL IS NOT LOST, YOUR LIFE WILL BE FULL OF HAPPINESS AGAIN, AFTER YOU GET THROUGH THIS. Yes, there are guys who have ongoing problems. But the majority move on and live their full lives as before. PC is a very slow growing cancer in the vast majority of cases. Good on ya that you bought Walshs book. Its a great primer for newly diagnosed guys. Make sure you have the 3rd edition. But even some of that is outdated, as it was published in 2012 and things are moving fast in PC treatement world (for the better). For my money, surgery is probably the right thing for you, just based on your age. But you should look at the various forms of radiation as well. SBRT (Cyberknife), IMRT, IGRT, LDR and HDR Brachy (seeds). They've all gotten great results with low and intermediate risk guys, if the cancer has not escaped the prostate capsule. And with your relatively low PSA, combined with the fact that you had cancer showing only on one side, and a negative DRE, the chances of no escape, are pretty high. In fact, if there was escape, radiation would probably be the better choice, because radiation cooks not only the prostate, but surrounding tissue. There is a reason i think its important to explore all options. You get only one shot at CHOOSING the best treatment. If you look at all the possibilites, and are educated about them, the side effects of each, the results of each, etc, you will choose the right one for YOU (everyone is different) with CONFIDENCE AND YOU WON'T LOOK BACK. And once you do that you will feel so much better. And you won't look back. Remember, most Urologists are surgeons, and many if not most surgeons will recommend surgery. Radiation Oncologists will recommend radiation. Not because they don't have you best interest at heart. But because they have a natural bias. They believe in what they do, or they wouldn't be doing it. So its up to you to decide on whats best for YOU. The phase you are in now, understanding, educating, and deciding, is probably the hardest part of this journey. Which brings me to 3TmultiParametric MRI. You should ask for one. It will tell you with about 90-95% certainty whether there has been any escape from the capsule. If there has, it might affect your treatment choice. The other thing you should do, that might affect your treatment choice, is get a second opinion on the pathology. Have the slides sent to either Jonathan Epstein at Johns Hopkins, or David Bostwick and Bostwick Labs. Your Doctor gets this request all the time from newly diagnosed guys that are educating themselves about the disease, and should know where to send them. If not, just google Johns Hopkins Second Opinion Service Prostate, and it will take you to the instructions. They charge $250, its usually not covered by insurance but its worth it.

      "Content": "Jen, welcome to the forum, really sorry you guys need to be here, especially at such a young age. I can't answer the bladder question, not familiar. Regarding the Prostate Cancer, thats a lot of cancer. But all is not lost and its likely highly treatable and maybe even curable. The fact that his PSA is under 20, suggests that its unlikely that bone mets will be detected. ... 1. have the slides sent to Dr Jonathan Epstein at Johns Hopkins for a second opinion. Reading these slides is very subjective and you want someone eyeballing the slides that is an expert at Prostate cells specifically, not a local pathologist who looks at all kinds of slides. The reason to get the second opinion, is not to confirm that there is cancer, with that many cores positive, there most definitely is. But it could be that the G7s get downgraded to G6, or upgraded to G8, which might change treatment options. 2. get and read Dr Patrick Walshs book \"surviving Prostate Cancer\". Make sure its the third edition. It will give you an excellent understanding of the disease and things you need to think about and ask your doctors. And its an easy read. 3. Consider asking that an MRI be done on the prostate. 3 TESLA Multiparametric MRI to be specific. This test is 95% accurate at determining whether the cancer has left the prostate. 4. make sure you explore ALL options available to you. Not just surgery, not just radiation. Thats enough for now, others will surely chime in soon. A couple of suggestions",

It sounds like you are on a very typical NON LINEAR track to full continence. Setbacks are a normal part of the game, that you will likely eventually win with full continence. I also weighed my pads like Wilde, to measure my progress. I'm 9 months out of surgery now and what I would call full continence. I a, writing this, while wearing my very comfortable boxers, the thought of which brings me great joy! �� I remember at my 3 month Follow up, I was pretty much full continent but with an occasional leak. The surgeon told me I will continue to improve, for many months. And it was true, I did. I now pretty much only leak when I grab my wife's ass, or let my bladder get really full. Last night I slept 7 1/2 hours without getting up to pee. You'll get there, it just takes time.nice work so far. Btw I still do kegels 3-4 X a day",

What value is there in knowing the size of Your prostate thru ultrasound (which is an estimate anyway). A good urologist can tell in general terms if your prostate is enlarged. Also, when your Dr does the PSA, ASK HIM to order A FREE PSA as well, it can be performed on the same blood, and will give the Uro more info. And tell your Dr you are going to a Uro.

BCR after RP As mentioned, not all patients with BCR after RP will develop clinical failure; indeed, published reports suggest that an estimated 24\u201334% of men who develop BCR will experience clinically evident recurrence (i.e., metastatic disease) within 15 years of surgery [21, 23]. Furthermore, it has been estimated that 2\u20136% of men who experience BCR after RP may die from PCa [21, 23]. So only 24-34% of men with BCR will develop mets ? Am I interpreting tht correctly?",

      "Content": "You need to find different Doctors, IMHO. FIrst, G6 is usually indolent, meaning you could have no treatment, NS stay on active surveillance. But active surveillance does not mean a PSA every six months. You should be monitored on a regular basis in a structured program with PSA tested every three months, annual biopsies etc. Second, it's very curious to me that your PSA would be as high as it is with G6 and only 2 cores positive. You might have some prostatitis going on in there in addition to the cancerous cells . Third, be aware but in about 30% of cases, for those who choose to go the surgery route ( not recommending for or against surgery ) The Gleason score is upgraded, to a more serious grade . On the other hand if you had something higher than a G6 the MRI a(I assume it was a 3T multi parametric MRI) usually will pick it up. In short, I don't think it's time to panic, but I do think you need to find a top doctor Who specializes in prostate cancer knows what he's doing. The only thing that any of your doctor said that make sense to me, is that in large lymph nodes should be investigated . The fact that the only way you found out about that is by reading the report, speaks volumes to how little you're attending doctor cares. I'd be furious.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by brownie43 You stated you would be furious with the Dr. Well, it is the VA, and I forgot to mention that I am 73yrs. old. The first VA Urologist that I saw at the VA was a bit \"put off\" because I had a PSA in my labs., and said he would never order a PSA for anyone 70 or older but seeing as how someone else was ordering 'unnecessary lab work\", he would do a DRE (enlarged but no bumps). Said if I came in dragging an oxygen bottle or such, he would not order more tests, etc. but I was a youthful 73, so lucky me. Anyway, he did order up another PSA and recommended a biopsy. Not sure how to get a second opinion at the VA, so will probably go to my Medicare PCP So once we turn 70, we don't need the same level,of care? Because we are gonna die soon anyway? Absurd. I'm 66. I've got health issues. I still plan to be around for a long time. And part of that plan is to monitor for issues that haven't shown up yet.",

      "Content": "Jlynn, welcome, and sorry, you had to show up here. First of all, we've all been in your (husbands shoes). So we know, easy for us to tell you to calm down, not so easy to do. But there are reasons for you to do so, With your husbands PSA of 4.6, and a Gleason score of G7(3+4) , which is the less aggressive Goeason 7, it's highly likely that you have caught this early, that it's contained within the prostate capsule, and that you have a number of options all of which will have a high chance of CURING your husbands cancer. The thing with Prostate cancer is, in many cases, there is no one treatment that is better than the others. surgeons (urologists are usually surgeons ) will say surgery is your best option. radiation Oncologists will tell you that (the form of ) radiation that they practice is the best course. In some cases, you might be told to practice active surveillance, which is a structured program of regular testing, with preset parameters that might call for action, but no other treatment until and unless those parameters are met. All confusing I know, but the point is, you have to get educated about your options, and be your own advocate. So, 3 suggestions, no 4. 1. Take a deep breath, it's going to be ok. 2. Have your husbands slides sent to an expert in Prostate Pathology for a second opinion. The two acknowledged experts in the U.s. Are Jonathan Epstein at Johns Hopkins, and David Bostwick at Bostwick labs. This is not a big deal, you can go to their websites and get the paperwork, or you can just tell your urologists office that you want the slides sent to Epstein or Bostwick, as I did. They've likely done this before and will know what you are talking about. The reason you want to do this, is that local pathologists usually look at many types of slides, breast, colon, prostate, etc. and Prostate Gleason scoring is a very subjective process, so you want an expert opinion because it could ,are a difference in treatment 3. Go to Amazon and Buy his book, http://www.amazon.com/s/ref=nb_sb_no...+Patrick+Walsh make sure it's the third edition. It's the best education you'll get, and it's easy reading. Seriously, it's going to be ok. Oh one more thing. As far as your husbands concern about side effects, yes with surgery it happens. But it's highly likely in today's world, that he will be fully continent in short order. And over time, will regain his full erectile function. That may take longer but especially at his young age, it will probably happen Also (sorry, I'm rambling) if I wasn't clear... It's important that you explore ALL options. Surgery, radiation in all its forms (seeds(Brachytherapy), cyberknife (SBRT) Etc., Active Surviellance (you might be a candidate especially if the second opinion downgrades you to G6) even if you guys are set on surgery, if you do your own due diligence before making a final decision, you will be more likely to not look back with regret no matter how things turn out.",

I know G6 is spelled C-U-R-E. But what if there is something else there that was missed? 2 years ago i had a biopsy that was negative but showed hi grade pin in one core on LEFT side. This biopsy showed all the cancer on the RIGHT side. What if there is G8, OR G9 on the left that was missed? I have seen one rock star surgeon, and am seeing the other one (nyc, you know who they are, probaly) this week. Of course, they rec surgery. Seeing my Uro for the first time on Wednesday. He will rec Cyberknife because thats what his hospital does. Every one has an agenda I made an appt with surgeon at MSKCC, they told me no agenda, if surgery is not my best option, then he will tell me. But he can't see me until Mid Dec. EVERY DAY THAT GOES BY I AM AFRAID I AM AT MORE RISK OF ESCAPING THE CAPSULE. Trying to see a RO at MSKCC, wont even give me an appt until they get the reports (easy) scans (easy), slides (still at Hopkins) and a TE Parametric MRI which they say i ccant have until end December because it needs to be 7-8 weeks after biopsy. More time lost. And how is it that i get to see two rock star surgeons who have done over 5000 robotic surgeries each, within days, but i cant see anyone at MSKCC for over a month? How does that work? I'm so confused, scared and depressed. Logicallty i know, i have time. But still.",

Most men have to wait 6-24 months to get back to full continence. Sure , some men never get it back. But younger men have a better shot at it, that's why I think you will be one of the lucky ones. In the meantime, talk to your surgeon, there are many things that can be done to move the process along And. Try to think about all the things you have to be than,full for. Like zero PSA, a loving wife who sounds like she gets it, and cares for you unconditionally. Every day is a gift man. Take it, try to stay positive.",

If you do choose surgery, I can comment that for me at least, with a top surgeon, after the first couple of weeks I healed rapidly. There is a new normal, but its not too much different than the old normal, and certainly will not interfere with my QOL. But you do sound like a good candidate for AS. I would make a note to ask if there are other diagnostic tests, i.e. 3tesla Multiparametric MRI, or others, that might have a good chance of finding anything more sinister than G6 lurking, or hopefully, increase the chance that that's all there is, and hopefully reconfirm that you are a good candidate for AS",

      "Content": "First, slow down. Don\u2019t put the cart before the horse. It far from a forgone conclusion that you have prostate cancer. And even further from fact that you have AGGRESSIVE PC. In fact, the most aggressive forms of prostate cancer, Gleason 9 and 10, sometimes put out very little PSA. You\u2019re right, that\u2019s a big jump. But more often than not, a jump like that is indicative of Prostatitis, or infection/inflammation of the prostate that usually resolves on its own. Still it\u2019s a high PSA for your age, so yeah further testing probably makes sense. But I wouldn\u2019t rush to biopsy. I would ask for a PHI test (stands for Prostate Health Index). It\u2019s a combination of PSA, free PSA and a few other tests that taken together are a better indication than PSA alone that a biopsy is warranted. And ask for a referral to a urologist. This is beyond the scope of most GP\u2019s Like I said, slow down, one step At a time. Even the more aggressive prostate cancers don\u2019t grow very fast. Good luck and keep us posted.",

So its entirely possible, to have SRT to the prostate bed, and not solve the problem. A big risk to take, for sure. And the rock and the hard place comes in because you have to ask yourself, as you did, \"well, since i don't know for sure that i a attacking the cancer cells by nuking the prostate bed, and i decide to wait until its detectable on a Choline scan, i risk the possiblity of it being in the prostate bed now, and by the time its detectable elsewhere, its, well.... elsewhere, i've given it a chance to escape. So its a very personal choice. Chuck is right, most Drs will wait till they see .1, even .2. In fact, my surgeons PA told me right after the surgery, that if ever there was a rise they would not be concerned until it hit .1 at which time they would do imaging to try to find the source.

In the meantime, talk to your surgeon, there are many things that can be done to move the process along And. Try to think about all the things you have to be than,full for.

So its entirely possible, to have SRT to the prostate bed, and not solve the problem. A big risk to take, for sure. And the rock and the hard place comes in because you have to ask yourself, as you did, \"well, since i don't know for sure that i a attacking the cancer cells by nuking the prostate bed, and i decide to wait until its detectable on a Choline scan, i risk the possiblity of it being in the prostate bed now, and by the time its detectable elsewhere, its, well.... elsewhere, i've given it a chance to escape. So its a very personal choice. Chuck is right, most Drs will wait till they see .1, even .2. In fact, my surgeons PA told me right after the surgery, that if ever there was a rise they would not be concerned until it hit .1 at which time they would do imaging to try to find the source. But who knows what the right answer is. A connundrum, for sure.",

I had surgery, was sort of depressed afterwards, although the surgery seemed to have gone well with good pathology, no complications, and none of the dreaded side effects. After about 5-6bmonths, I started to feel good, and was more or less over the psychological effects of having to face my own mortality. I was 65, so older than you, but trust me, it doesn't make it easier. 7 months after surgery, I. Feeling great... then....BOOM!!!....routine physical, bad ekg, bad echostress, bad nuclear stress, bad Ct heart scan all in one day. The next day I was in the cardiac catch lab having 2 stents inserted.WTF? I was told I have coronary artery disease and a heavy plaque load. Very depressed, for a long while. And I became obsessed with my health , diet, etc. you would think that's good, but it's not I got over it and started enjoying life again. A year and a half later, my wife gets diagnosed with ovarian cancer. So I'm asking myself again, WTF? What a horrible 3 years. Why does God hate me? What did I do wrong? But I know it doesn't work that way. Shit happens. I didn't take care of myself all my life as you did, (aside from the alcohol, and congrats on kicking it btw)I started when I got my PCP diagnosis. So maybe unlike you, I did it to myself, who knows. Maybe it's just genetic. Can't control it, can't change it. I don't know what branch bundle block is, I hope it's something treatable. But whatever it is, I hope you learn to live in the moment, and enjoy each day without obsessing over it all the way I do. It's a matter of QOL. Keep taking good care of yourself, and squeeze all the juice out of every day. Because every day is a day you won't get back.",

If you do choose surgery, I can comment that for me at least, with a top surgeon, after the first couple of weeks I healed rapidly. There is a new normal, but its not too much different than the old normal, and certainly will not interfere with my QOL. But you do sound like a good candidate for AS. I would make a note to ask if there are other diagnostic tests, i.e. 3tesla Multiparametric MRI, or others, that might have a good chance of finding anything more sinister than G6 lurking, or hopefully, increase the chance that that's all there is, and hopefully reconfirm that you are a good candidate for AS",

Most men have to wait 6-24 months to get back to full continence. Sure , some men never get it back. But younger men have a better shot at it, that's why I think you will be one of the lucky ones. In the meantime, talk to your surgeon, there are many things that can be done to move the process along And. Try to think about all the things you have to be than,full for. Like zero PSA, a loving wife who sounds like she gets it, and cares for you unconditionally. Every day is a gift man. Take it, try to stay positive.",

      "Content": "Bad68rs, up until my PC diagnosis, I'd never been sick a day in my life. I had surgery, was sort of depressed afterwards, although the surgery seemed to have gone well with good pathology, no complications, and none of the dreaded side effects. After about 5-6bmonths, I started to feel good, and was more or less over the psychological effects of having to face my own mortality. I was 65, so older than you, but trust me, it doesn't make it easier. 7 months after surgery, I. Feeling great... then....BOOM!!!....routine physical, bad ekg, bad echostress, bad nuclear stress, bad Ct heart scan all in one day. The next day I was in the cardiac catch lab having 2 stents inserted.WTF? I was told I have coronary artery disease and a heavy plaque load. Very depressed, for a long while. And I became obsessed with my health , diet, etc. you would think that's good, but it's not I got over it and started enjoying life again. A year and a half later, my wife gets diagnosed with ovarian cancer. So I'm asking myself again, WTF? What a horrible 3 years. Why does God hate me? What did I do wrong? But I know it doesn't work that way. Shit happens. I didn't take care of myself all my life as you did, (aside from the alcohol, and congrats on kicking it btw)I started when I got my PCP diagnosis. So maybe unlike you, I did it to myself, who knows. Maybe it's just genetic. Can't control it, can't change it. I don't know what branch bundle block is, I hope it's something treatable. But whatever it is, I hope you learn to live in the moment, and enjoy each day without obsessing over it all the way I do. It's a matter of QOL. Keep taking good care of yourself, and squeeze all the juice out of every day. Because every day is a day you won't get back.",

If you do choose surgery, I can comment that for me at least, with a top surgeon, after the first couple of weeks I healed rapidly. There is a new normal, but its not too much different than the old normal, and certainly will not interfere with my QOL. But you do sound like a good candidate for AS. I would make a note to ask if there are other diagnostic tests, i.e. 3tesla Multiparametric MRI, or others, that might have a good chance of finding anything more sinister than G6 lurking, or hopefully, increase the chance that that's all there is, and hopefully reconfirm that you are a good candidate for AS",

      "Content": "Thanks for the link, Djin. From that link, this is particularly striking....... BCR after RP As mentioned, not all patients with BCR after RP will develop clinical failure; indeed, published reports suggest that an estimated 24\u201334% of men who develop BCR will experience clinically evident recurrence (i.e., metastatic disease) within 15 years of surgery [21, 23]. Furthermore, it has been estimated that 2\u20136% of men who experience BCR after RP may die from PCa [21, 23]. So only 24-34% of men with BCR will develop mets ? Am I interpreting tht correctly?",

      "Content": "I would get a second opinion on the biopsy. If the 3+4 is really a 4+4 or a 3+3, you want to know, it might affect treatment choice. Its easy to do. Tell your urologist that you want the slides sent to Dr Jonathan Epstein at Johns Hopkins. Do not take no for an answer. They have gotten this request before and should know exactly what to do. Just in case, here is a link... http://pathology.jhu.edu/department/...ondopinion.cfm. You could also use David Bostwick at Bostwick labs. My experience with Epstein was excellent. They were quick, responsive, and Dr Epstein himself got on the phone and spoke with me. ( AND I would never have even attempted to speak with him, if i had not been told by someone here that he speaks with patients). In the meantime, educate yourself on all options. With 70% of one core being cancerous and being stage 2A, you are probably not a great candidate for Active Surviellance, but look at surgery, and all the various types of radiation. What does your Urologist mean when he says Dr Kaul is a superstar? How many surgeries has he done? Does he do open or robotic? What is his record of positive margins? These are all questions you should ask. You have a right to know. Trust your doctors, but verify. Dont take anyones word for anything. Prostate Cancer is big business. The vast majority of Drs have their clients best interest at heart, but they all have their natural biases. Be your own advocate",

What do you mean when you say he has a \"possible\" malignancy? I assume if treatment has been recommended, he has had a biopsy that was positive for cancer? I think its reasonable to say that at age 78, surgery may not be the best option, depending partly on his general health. It would be helpful if you could post his stats from the biopsy report . At his age, if it is low grade, low volume cancer, he might be a candidate for Active Surveillance which means no treatment for now, just periodic blood tests and possible annual biopsies.",

      "Content": "I would get a second opinion on the biopsy. If the 3+4 is really a 4+4 or a 3+3, you want to know, it might affect treatment choice. Its easy to do. Tell your urologist that you want the slides sent to Dr Jonathan Epstein at Johns Hopkins. Do not take no for an answer. They have gotten this request before and should know exactly what to do. Just in case, here is a link... http://pathology.jhu.edu/department/...ondopinion.cfm. You could also use David Bostwick at Bostwick labs. My experience with Epstein was excellent. They were quick, responsive, and Dr Epstein himself got on the phone and spoke with me. ( AND I would never have even attempted to speak with him, if i had not been told by someone here that he speaks with patients). In the meantime, educate yourself on all options. With 70% of one core being cancerous and being stage 2A, you are probably not a great candidate for Active Surviellance, but look at surgery, and all the various types of radiation. What does your Urologist mean when he says Dr Kaul is a superstar? How many surgeries has he done? Does he do open or robotic? What is his record of positive margins? These are all questions you should ask. You have a right to know. Trust your doctors, but verify. Dont take anyones word for anything. Prostate Cancer is big business. The vast majority of Drs have their clients best interest at heart, but they all have their natural biases. Be your own advocate",

      "Content": "Tim, first thing i will tell you, have the slides sent for a second opinion by a pathologist specializing in Prostate Cancer. I sent mine to Dr Epstein at Johns Hopkins, there is also David Bostwick at Bostwick Labs. I'm sure there are others. My original path was G6 and G8, but epstein dowgraded in his opinion to G6/G6. The other docs (surgeons and urologist) that i spoke with said i an take Epsteins opinion as gospel (pending surgerial pathology) of ourse Advantages of surgery are you can always have radiation afterwards if there is still PSA, but its much harder to have surgery after radiation. Also, and this is important - 40% of PC gleason scores get upgraded after surgery (some get downgraded) and surgery is the only real way to know exactly what you are dealing with. Beause the pathologist looks at the entire prostate that was removed as opposed to 12 tiny tissue sample. From what i have been reading in my research, Radiation brings similar results, but with fwer side effects. although i have read that you can have more side effects later in future years. But i have not yet met with an RO. Meeting with one next week. In my mind i am doing surgery. Unless the RO says something that blows me away. Lots to think about. But think about this. Even a worst case scenario, you get primary treatment and in 2 years, say, your PSA starts to rise. AVERAGE life expectancy from PSA rise is over 13 years. There is a guy on another forum that was diagnosed with a psa of 3200 no typo. Bone mets all over his body. That was in 2006. He is still doing well, with the beast under control. Try not to panic. I did, and still do sometimes. But slowly as you educate yourself, you will realize that you will be around for a long time. This is not late stage breast cancer. PC is not lethal as many other cancers are, at least in the short and intermediate years.",

      "Content": "One week to the day i was diagnosed, with G6 x 2 and one G8, 3 DAYS FROM Receiving second opinion from Johns Hopkins saying 3 G6 (the G8 was an unusual 3+5, he called it a 3+3 saying the premise the pathologist used to call it a 5 is wrong and invalid) I am so confused and depressed. I know G6 is spelled C-U-R-E. But what if there is something else there that was missed? 2 years ago i had a biopsy that was negative but showed hi grade pin in one core on LEFT side. This biopsy showed all the cancer on the RIGHT side. What if there is G8, OR G9 on the left that was missed? I have seen one rock star surgeon, and am seeing the other one (nyc, you know who they are, probaly) this week. Of course, they rec surgery. Seeing my Uro for the first time on Wednesday. He will rec Cyberknife because thats what his hospital does. Every one has an agenda I made an appt with surgeon at MSKCC, they told me no agenda, if surgery is not my best option, then he will tell me. But he can't see me until Mid Dec. EVERY DAY THAT GOES BY I AM AFRAID I AM AT MORE RISK OF ESCAPING THE CAPSULE. Trying to see a RO at MSKCC, wont even give me an appt until they get the reports (easy) scans (easy), slides (still at Hopkins) and a TE Parametric MRI which they say i ccant have until end December because it needs to be 7-8 weeks after biopsy. More time lost. And how is it that i get to see two rock star surgeons who have done over 5000 robotic surgeries each, within days, but i cant see anyone at MSKCC for over a month? How does that work? I'm so confused, scared and depressed. Logicallty i know, i have time. But still.",

      "Content": "Jlynn, welcome, and sorry, you had to show up here. First of all, we've all been in your (husbands shoes). So we know, easy for us to tell you to calm down, not so easy to do. But there are reasons for you to do so, With your husbands PSA of 4.6, and a Gleason score of G7(3+4) , which is the less aggressive Goeason 7, it's highly likely that you have caught this early, that it's contained within the prostate capsule, and that you have a number of options all of which will have a high chance of CURING your husbands cancer. The thing with Prostate cancer is, in many cases, there is no one treatment that is better than the others. surgeons (urologists are usually surgeons ) will say surgery is your best option. radiation Oncologists will tell you that (the form of ) radiation that they practice is the best course. In some cases, you might be told to practice active surveillance, which is a structured program of regular testing, with preset parameters that might call for action, but no other treatment until and unless those parameters are met. All confusing I know, but the point is, you have to get educated about your options, and be your own advocate. So, 3 suggestions, no 4. 1. Take a deep breath, it's going to be ok. 2. Have your husbands slides sent to an expert in Prostate Pathology for a second opinion. The two acknowledged experts in the U.s. Are Jonathan Epstein at Johns Hopkins, and David Bostwick at Bostwick labs. This is not a big deal, you can go to their websites and get the paperwork, or you can just tell your urologists office that you want the slides sent to Epstein or Bostwick, as I did. They've likely done this before and will know what you are talking about. The reason you want to do this, is that local pathologists usually look at many types of slides, breast, colon, prostate, etc. and Prostate Gleason scoring is a very subjective process, so you want an expert opinion because it could ,are a difference in treatment 3. Go to Amazon and Buy his book, http://www.amazon.com/s/ref=nb_sb_no...+Patrick+Walsh make sure it's the third edition. It's the best education you'll get, and it's easy reading. Seriously, it's going to be ok. Oh one more thing. As far as your husbands concern about side effects, yes with surgery it happens. But it's highly likely in today's world, that he will be fully continent in short order. And over time, will regain his full erectile function. That may take longer but especially at his young age, it will probably happen Also (sorry, I'm rambling) if I wasn't clear... It's important that you explore ALL options. Surgery, radiation in all its forms (seeds(Brachytherapy), cyberknife (SBRT) Etc., Active Surviellance (you might be a candidate especially if the second opinion downgrades you to G6) even if you guys are set on surgery, if you do your own due diligence before making a final decision, you will be more likely to not look back with regret no matter how things turn out.",

I can say, i have never been much on resistance training, but try to at least do cardio somewhat regularly. I find since my diagnosis last November, 2014, i have been way more active. I started by walking 4 miles almost every day, and doing planks and crunches about 5 days a week, for the 5 weeks before my surgery, and i believe it helped in my recovery. Once i was past surgery, i got on the treadmill as quickly as possible, doing about 1.5 miles a day even with the catheter still in. I've worked up to 3-4 miles a day and still do it regularly. I've been cleared for a while to do some lifting, and while i havent ever been much of on weights, i intend to start, as i have noticed muscle loss, at least in my arms, which i dont like, although i guess it comes with age.",

      "Content": "So yesterday, after meeting again with my Urologist, and separately, with. medical Oncologist, in his office, I made a decision to move forward with SRT + ADT. The Medical Oncologist agreed that from a medical perspective I was not jumping the gun, and that I would eventually need treatment, and that it\u2019s better to do it now, while everything looked non-aggressive. My urologist also said I should treat. But when I pressed him, he said his treatment recommendation was based on me as a person, and if he was meeting me for the first time, and justvlooking at my chart, without knowing me, he would recommend that I wait until .2 (my last PSA had been .082). We had a long discussion, and I asked him if he would do one more PSA, even though my last one, .082, was only 18 days ago. I got the results this morning, it was .078. While the blood draw was in my Drs office, and previous blood draws were at a local labcorp office, the lab AND assay was the same, labcorp in Raritan NJ and Roche ECLIA. I\u2019m thinking this is JUST TEST TO TEST VARIATION, and doesn\u2019t mean much. I know there was a thread about it somewhere, and a study I think in Djin subforum but I couldn\u2019t find it. But if I round these two tests off, they are both .08. The good news is that when I got the .082, it was only 6bweeks after a .068 result, and it broke a very constant trend of a .01 rise every three months, very linear. That made me nervous. This new result gets me right back into the linear trend, and I am not worried that things are getting more aggressive. So nothing changes, I\u2019m going to upload these results to the MSK patient portal and just comment, to the RO, that if this changes anything in your recommendation, let me know, but if not, I plan to be there Wednesday for my first Firmagon shot. As far as I\u2019m concerned, I\u2019m done researching, satisfied that I\u2019ve done what I can, and making the exact right decision at the exact right time.",

      "Content": "@Djin - yes, I meant .2, and I just corrected it. Surgeon and I didn\u0092t talk specifically whethetrvit could plateau at .2, he talked about if and when it gets to .2, which he said would be a year or year and a half from now, we would do scans. He did say (in response to my query) that he thinks there\u0092s a moderate chance (I asked low, moderate or high) that his will never become something that bothers me, if I don\u0092t treat. To me that means there\u0092s also a moderate chance that it will, and I just don\u0092t want to take that risk. To answer your question, nah, I don\u0092t want to wait a month. I want to get this crap done so I can get my ass down to my home in Florida for the winter. Btw, I asked for the PSA because on Wednesday, MSKCC will do their own PSA, before the shot. They insist on all their own blood work. I want to be able to have a baseline comparison between MSKCC and Labcorp, whim I\u0092ve been using all along. (MSKCC goes down to .05, labcorp to .006). As an aside, including the MSKCC Test that will be 3 PSA\u0092s In 4vweeks. I\u0092m guessing Medicare will say nope, yourvon the hook for two of them.",

Tell your urologist that you want the slides sent to Dr Jonathan Epstein at Johns Hopkins. Do not take no for an answer. They have gotten this request before and should know exactly what to do. Just in case, here is a link... http://pathology.jhu.edu/department/...ondopinion.cfm. You could also use David Bostwick at Bostwick labs. My experience with Epstein was excellent. They were quick, responsive, and Dr Epstein himself got on the phone and spoke with me. ( AND I would never have even attempted to speak with him, if i had not been told by someone here that he speaks with patients). In the meantime, educate yourself on all options. With 70% of one core being cancerous and being stage 2A, you are probably not a great candidate for Active Surviellance, but look at surgery, and all the various types of radiation. What does your Urologist mean when he says Dr Kaul is a superstar? How many surgeries has he done? Does he do open or robotic? What is his record of positive margins? These are all questions you should ask. You have a right to know. Trust your doctors, but verify. Dont take anyones word for anything. Prostate Cancer is big business. The vast majority of Drs have their clients best interest at heart, but they all have their natural biases. Be your own advocate",

And I'm glad to hear that you're jumping in full throttle (if I may mix metaphors). I too caught the .02 typo mentioned by Djin, but knew what you meant. So now is the time to STOP SWEATING the details, just keep your head up and move forward. Here's hoping to see a smooth descent to zero... and stay there! Thanks Rob. Aboutvthat panel meeting... so I getvthere, and they put me in a room, just me and a young Medical Oncologist, whom I never heard of before. I asked what happened to my meeting with Drs Stock, Oh, and Cheetam? He said something about it being August and hard to get them all together. I was out of my mind pissed off I wanted to put my fist in his mouth (not that it was his fault). But amazingly, I bit my tongue and just said, ok. I mentoned it to Tewari when I met with him afterwards, his response was \u0093hmmm....that\u0092s never happened before\u0094 Anyway, the med onc , who did seem to know his stuff, and who said he works closely with dr stock, the rad onc, recommended to treat. Tewari repeated his recommendation to treat. I pushed him this time though and asked him \u0093if you didn\u0092t know me personally, if you were meeting me for the first time, and just looking at my chart, would your rec be the same\u0094, he said \u0093no, I\u0092d tell you to wait. But part of my job is to care for the whole patient, not the disease, and I think if you waited you\u0092d be constantly preoccupied with worry.\u0094 To me, that\u0092s a good doctor.",

      "Content": "To the original poster - i dont think the comments about colonic mucosa or squamous mucosa are cause for concern, especially considering they have the word \"benign\" in front of them. Also, he may not have actually missed the prostate on that side, he may have caught some colon cells on the way in to the prostate. I used google to find info and came across an article in the Harvard Medical School Harvard Medical Publication. I don't think the forum rules permit posting links, please correct me if i am wrong. But you can google \"Harvard\" and \"Understanding Your Pathology Report\" and it will probably take you to the article. In any case, i am cutting and pasting this section below, which is relevant to your question..... \"Don\u2019t be alarmed if you see mention of rectal or colonic tissue. Small fragments of bowel lining (colonic mucosa) are common in needle core biopsy specimens since the needle has to poke through this tissue to get to the prostate.\" Also, regarding Squamous Mucosa, I couldn't find anything as it relates to colon or prostate cells but i did find something related to other types of cells, like Esophagus. Apparently squamous is just a type of cell in the lining of an organ. See below, which i found in another article: \"2. What does \"squamous mucosa\" mean? The lining of the esophagus is known as the \"mucosa.\" Most of the esophagus is lined by squamous cells, similar to those seen on the surface of the skin. I hope this puts your mind at ease, as it relates to these two issues, i know what its like to be at a loss for understanding something like this. Which is probably why the envelope was sealed.",

While I had no problem receiving approval from Medicare to start SR at 0.11 PSA, my guess would be that there IS some number already identified that might preclude starting SR as early as Chester did. On the other hand, Medicare has rarely posed any authorization problems over the last ten years for me and my wife. I find it hard to believe that a program run by the Federal Government works so smoothly, for the most part. Jim Jim I've been on Medicare for a year and a half and I too am amazed how well it's worked so far. Just hoping it's there when I really need it. If I ever do. For SRT",

So discount what he said. Prostatectomy after radiation can be a mess. It can be done but it's very difficult and must be done by someone who specializes in salvage surgery. And the side effects are worse than after Prostatectomy for primary treatment. I may have missed it, but am I to understand that your radiation was primary treatment? If so, I think it's too soon to assume failure. I'm not an expert in this area, I'm sure others more knowledgeable, will chime in soon, so stay tuned. And good luck.",

      "Content": "With apologies to those who\u0092ve already seen this on another forum, there are some really knowledgeable folks here that are not there, so I\u0092m copying and pasting with a few minor edits. So, in the face of a rising PSA, i am going to make a final decision about going ahead with SRT with or without Hormone Therapy after one more PSA which i will do the end of this month. My current PSA is .068 as of a month ago. For background, i had negative margins, however, my surgeon does a intra operative frozen section which is looked at by pathology, which showed a positive margin, leading to the surgeon to do further resection, to obtain final negative margins. I saw two prominent Radiation Oncologists who both advised that i should be treated now, saying that they felt 80% sure that the negative final margin actually did contain some cancer cells that were missed and wasnt really negative My surgeon thinks i should wait and do scans if i reach .2, which he says may never happen. So I recently asked that the slides be relooked at, and that i be informed what % of pattern 4 cells there was in the g7(3+4) which was the \"dominant tumor\" (1.1 cm) AND also what the gleason was at the positive margin in the frozen section, before the surgeon obtained negative final margins. Today i got the results as follows: The tumor shows approximately 5% of a Gleason pattern 4, with the remaining 95% pattern 3 And this: While the final margins are negative, the involved apical margin (part A (which was the frozen section)) showed Gleason pattern 3 at the margin So now, this new information gives me pause, and i am not so sure whether i should do SRT at such a low PSA. I do know that if I do SRT, I am now heavily leaning toward NOT adding Hormone Therapy to the mix. Any thoughts would be welcome. I feel like I\u0092m in never never land, I know there is no clear answer.",

      "Content": "With apologies to those who\u0092ve already seen this on another forum, there are some really knowledgeable folks here that are not there, so I\u0092m copying and pasting with a few minor edits. So, in the face of a rising PSA, i am going to make a final decision about going ahead with SRT with or without Hormone Therapy after one more PSA which i will do the end of this month. My current PSA is .068 as of a month ago. For background, i had negative margins, however, my surgeon does a intra operative frozen section which is looked at by pathology, which showed a positive margin, leading to the surgeon to do further resection, to obtain final negative margins. I saw two prominent Radiation Oncologists who both advised that i should be treated now, saying that they felt 80% sure that the negative final margin actually did contain some cancer cells that were missed and wasnt really negative My surgeon thinks i should wait and do scans if i reach .2, which he says may never happen. So I recently asked that the slides be relooked at, and that i be informed what % of pattern 4 cells there was in the g7(3+4) which was the \"dominant tumor\" (1.1 cm) AND also what the gleason was at the positive margin in the frozen section, before the surgeon obtained negative final margins. Today i got the results as follows: The tumor shows approximately 5% of a Gleason pattern 4, with the remaining 95% pattern 3 And this: While the final margins are negative, the involved apical margin (part A (which was the frozen section)) showed Gleason pattern 3 at the margin So now, this new information gives me pause, and i am not so sure whether i should do SRT at such a low PSA. I do know that if I do SRT, I am now heavily leaning toward NOT adding Hormone Therapy to the mix. Any thoughts would be welcome. I feel like I\u0092m in never never land, I know there is no clear answer.",

      "Content": "Hope everyone here Is doing well. I thought I\u0092d update as I haven\u0092t been here for a while... Just finished week 5 of SRT, and am in the middle of month 3 of a 6 month course of ADT. Regarding the radiation, with 3 weeks to go, no side effects to date other than being very tired but I think that\u0092s as much a function of getting up at 4-4:15 every morning to go into Manhattan for treatment, then working an almost full day. Other than that, no issues. One problem I\u0092ve had, only the last two days, is that even though I empty my bowels each morning at 5:30-6am, I start to feel a little gassy just before I get called in for treatment, and indeed, the last two days, right after treatment, when I go to empty my bladder, I have another (not insignificant) bowel movement, I can\u0092t let that continue, lest I end up with damage, so I\u0092ll start today, increasing the Metamucil and colace, frM 2 to 3 x a day. Also I\u0092ll eliminate salads for lunch, and eat less at night. I hope that works Other than that, no bleeding, no diarrhea, no urinary frequency, so thus far, I\u0092m blessed, I know it\u0092s the last few weeks though, that this stuff starts. As far as ADT, I started on Firmagon, had 2none month shots, both give me a pretty bad reaction at the injection sight. So my RO switched me to Lupron, and it was so much easier. In the two + months that my T has been at castrate levels (5 - 6), the only SE I\u0092ve had is the hot flashes, and they are annoying but not unbearable. Other than that, nothing. No insomnia, fatigue, depression, more emotion, or any if the other side effects. When I started treatment my PSA was .08. The two monthly tests since I started have both been undetectable. But MSKCC tests only down to <.05, so I guess it could be anywhere from 0.000 to 0.049. But I know it\u0092s probably closer to 0.00 and it\u0092s because of the Lupron. 3 more weeks of treatment and one more Lupron shot, which will be a 3 month shot. Then I just wait, until T starts to rise, and hopefully PSA stays down. Hope this helps someone who may be about to start salvage treatment, and is concerned about side effects. It\u0092s really not bad as it sounds, for most men.",

      "Content": "I posted this on another forum, apologies to some of you who may have seen it, but i am looking for answers so just pasting it here too.... So now i have a new problem. Has anyone ever experienced heart issues that turned out to be related to Cialis? I went to my longtime PCP today for a checkup, first since the surgery. My bloodwork was all perfect, (i did the bloods in advance of the appointment). Cholesterol was 136. Triglycerides 148, down from 300 in December, he did about 30 other tests, all normal, so i was feeling good going in. But i mentioned to him that i was having what felt like palpatations on occasion. He did an EKG, which showed an \"extra heart beat\". which i guess, is an arrythmia. So he did an echo cardiogram, which was normal. Then an echo stress test, which was \"positive\" whatever the f that means. He told me to stop the Cialis immediately, and he put me on a beta blocker, wants me back a week from Monday (i'm going away on vacation next week). He said, depending on what happens between now and then, he will possibly send me for a CT Angiogram to look for blockages. These palpatations started soon after my surgery, which is why i thought it might be related to the Cialis. But i called my surgeon and spoke with his NP, she said she had never seen a heart problem caused by Cialis. Said if i have to stay off it, they would probably recommend injections, whcih i really dont want. So now, i have PSA Anxiety (next test, one month), a probable limp dick, AND heart issues. I'm ready to shoot myself in the mouth. Seriously depressing. Just when i was starting to feel safe. I think my life expectancy has gone down dramatically",

      "Content": "@Djin - yes, I meant .2, and I just corrected it. Surgeon and I didn\u0092t talk specifically whethetrvit could plateau at .2, he talked about if and when it gets to .2, which he said would be a year or year and a half from now, we would do scans. He did say (in response to my query) that he thinks there\u0092s a moderate chance (I asked low, moderate or high) that his will never become something that bothers me, if I don\u0092t treat. To me that means there\u0092s also a moderate chance that it will, and I just don\u0092t want to take that risk. To answer your question, nah, I don\u0092t want to wait a month. I want to get this crap done so I can get my ass down to my home in Florida for the winter. Btw, I asked for the PSA because on Wednesday, MSKCC will do their own PSA, before the shot. They insist on all their own blood work. I want to be able to have a baseline comparison between MSKCC and Labcorp, whim I\u0092ve been using all along. (MSKCC goes down to .05, labcorp to .006). As an aside, including the MSKCC Test that will be 3 PSA\u0092s In 4vweeks. I\u0092m guessing Medicare will say nope, yourvon the hook for two of them.",

And I'm glad to hear that you're jumping in full throttle (if I may mix metaphors). I too caught the .02 typo mentioned by Djin, but knew what you meant. So now is the time to STOP SWEATING the details, just keep your head up and move forward. Here's hoping to see a smooth descent to zero... and stay there! Thanks Rob. Aboutvthat panel meeting... so I getvthere, and they put me in a room, just me and a young Medical Oncologist, whom I never heard of before. I asked what happened to my meeting with Drs Stock, Oh, and Cheetam? He said something about it being August and hard to get them all together. I was out of my mind pissed off I wanted to put my fist in his mouth (not that it was his fault). But amazingly, I bit my tongue and just said, ok. I mentoned it to Tewari when I met with him afterwards, his response was \u0093hmmm....that\u0092s never happened before\u0094 Anyway, the med onc , who did seem to know his stuff, and who said he works closely with dr stock, the rad onc, recommended to treat. Tewari repeated his recommendation to treat. I pushed him this time though and asked him \u0093if you didn\u0092t know me personally, if you were meeting me for the first time, and just looking at my chart, would your rec be the same\u0094, he said \u0093no, I\u0092d tell you to wait. But part of my job is to care for the whole patient, not the disease, and I think if you waited you\u0092d be constantly preoccupied with worry.\u0094 To me, that\u0092s a good doctor.",

      "Content": "So yesterday, after meeting again with my Urologist, and separately, with. medical Oncologist, in his office, I made a decision to move forward with SRT + ADT. The Medical Oncologist agreed that from a medical perspective I was not jumping the gun, and that I would eventually need treatment, and that it\u2019s better to do it now, while everything looked non-aggressive. My urologist also said I should treat. But when I pressed him, he said his treatment recommendation was based on me as a person, and if he was meeting me for the first time, and justvlooking at my chart, without knowing me, he would recommend that I wait until .2 (my last PSA had been .082). We had a long discussion, and I asked him if he would do one more PSA, even though my last one, .082, was only 18 days ago. I got the results this morning, it was .078. While the blood draw was in my Drs office, and previous blood draws were at a local labcorp office, the lab AND assay was the same, labcorp in Raritan NJ and Roche ECLIA. I\u2019m thinking this is JUST TEST TO TEST VARIATION, and doesn\u2019t mean much. I know there was a thread about it somewhere, and a study I think in Djin subforum but I couldn\u2019t find it. But if I round these two tests off, they are both .08. The good news is that when I got the .082, it was only 6bweeks after a .068 result, and it broke a very constant trend of a .01 rise every three months, very linear. That made me nervous. This new result gets me right back into the linear trend, and I am not worried that things are getting more aggressive. So nothing changes, I\u2019m going to upload these results to the MSK patient portal and just comment, to the RO, that if this changes anything in your recommendation, let me know, but if not, I plan to be there Wednesday for my first Firmagon shot. As far as I\u2019m concerned, I\u2019m done researching, satisfied that I\u2019ve done what I can, and making the exact right decision at the exact right time.",

      "Content": "To the original poster - i dont think the comments about colonic mucosa or squamous mucosa are cause for concern, especially considering they have the word \"benign\" in front of them. Also, he may not have actually missed the prostate on that side, he may have caught some colon cells on the way in to the prostate. I used google to find info and came across an article in the Harvard Medical School Harvard Medical Publication. I don't think the forum rules permit posting links, please correct me if i am wrong. But you can google \"Harvard\" and \"Understanding Your Pathology Report\" and it will probably take you to the article. In any case, i am cutting and pasting this section below, which is relevant to your question..... \"Don\u2019t be alarmed if you see mention of rectal or colonic tissue. Small fragments of bowel lining (colonic mucosa) are common in needle core biopsy specimens since the needle has to poke through this tissue to get to the prostate.\" Also, regarding Squamous Mucosa, I couldn't find anything as it relates to colon or prostate cells but i did find something related to other types of cells, like Esophagus. Apparently squamous is just a type of cell in the lining of an organ. See below, which i found in another article: \"2. What does \"squamous mucosa\" mean? The lining of the esophagus is known as the \"mucosa.\" Most of the esophagus is lined by squamous cells, similar to those seen on the surface of the skin. I hope this puts your mind at ease, as it relates to these two issues, i know what its like to be at a loss for understanding something like this. Which is probably why the envelope was sealed.",

      "Content": "I have a question that may seem ridiculous, but it's an issue that's bothering me, despite assurances from one member here who is very knowledgeable (to whom I apologize in advance). The question is probably Bourne out of plain old fashioned nervousness, but here's the story.... As you can see from my stats, my biopsy was 3 weeks ago and results were 3 of 12 cores positive, [email protected]%, [email protected]% and [email protected]%. The G8 is in the right apex and all three positive cores are on one the right side (mid, base, and apex). PSA at time of biopsy was 4.3, up from 3.1 6 months earlier. I immediately requested the slides be sent to Johns Hopkins for. A second opinion. I got results from them, which I discussed with Dr Jon Epstein by phone, which reduced the G6 to a G8 @80%, so now 3/12 cores positive all G6. The 80% is driving me crazy.Dr Epstein said it didn't mean anything. My Urologist who did the biopsy, also fairly high profile, said it was \"concerning\" that one of the positive cores was 80%. And I read an interview in the Harvard Medical Newsletter (or whatever it's called), that said it is often just a matter of where the needle hit the tumor (Bulls eye vs glancing the side) which is what I was told by a knowledgeable member here. So I am getting different opinions. So first question, any thoughts on this ? Second related question. - I looked at the path report, and added up the total length of all the cores, then looked at the positive cores, their sizes and % of core cancerous. Then I did the calculation of what % of all tissue taken was cancerous (all tissue being both positive and negative cores) and I came up with a result that of all the tissue taken, 6.6% of the total tissue was cancerous. So my question is, aside from the fact that I am being OCD and crazy, is this calculation meaningful? I have been so vigilant, with regular testing over the last 5 years, a biopsy two years ago that was negative except for one core of high grade PIN, and PSA tests every six months for the last two years, and I am fearful that despite the care I took, I got it late, not early enough for full cure.",

I'm trying to get a call from my RO at MSKCC main facility, to talk to Dr then get my records transferred to the suburban location where i want to treat. Problem is that the earliest they can schedule me is end August, to see the RO out there. So its gonna be a while. But nothing i can do about it. Its a bummer. But i'm not gonna die any time soon.

      "Content": "Does Gleason score and detailed pathology matter once the cancer is in the bones? Yes, and no, yes, it could determine how quickly it will might spread, but no, because there is nothing you can do to change it, and I don't THINK it would affect or rather, inform, treatment. Will we only know how responsive the cancer is to the hormone therapy by doing blood tests every so many months? you may also be able to tell, or maybe, get a feeling, based on whether his symptoms improve. But the Drs will go by the PSA Will the level at which his psa drops to have some bearing to his overall survival? i don't think so, but maybe someone else will chime in. I think what's more important is how long he remains respinsive to hormone therapy, and other treatments that follow once he becomes resistant (which could be years) The oncologist mentioned zytiga w Lupron (stampede) or chemo in the next couple of months. Is it better to do the chemo early? It really depends on his individual case. I think standard of care is HT alone at first, then chemo when HT stops working. But I also think recent studies have shown that chemo with HT helps the HT be more effective. He is seeig a top oncologist at the Cleveland clinic whom we haven't seen since being first diagnosed. I'd ask these questions of him if I could. Thx so much your dad is in good hands at CC, you should have confidence in his doc. A suggestion.... why not ask your dad to sign off in you being able to speak to his doc, get information, etc. if he and your mom are not informed, it's hard for them to be their own advocate, which is really important. You being on the forum, helps you help them. You should ask for copies of all his reports, biosy, imaging, PSA history, etc. keep them ina binder. Just a suggestion. Others may come up with different answers to your question, I'm not an expert in advanced cases (and NONE OF US ARE MEDICAL PROFESSIONALS). But I'm sure you are anxious for some responses to your post, so I wanted to respond as best as I could What I can tell you, is that even with G9, there are many treatments available. When one stops working, there are many others. Most often, advanced PC today is treated as a chronic disease. It's not a Death sentence. Your dad has a fight ahead of him. But it's highly likely that he'll be around for many years. Hang in there, Good luck and keep us posted",

Seems like every day since diagnosis has been a new mental adventure. But I've been a worrier all my life so certainly this isn't going to change that. Maybe it will, after the surgery, but not yet.

      "Content": "I posted this on another forum, apologies to some of you who may have seen it, but i am looking for answers so just pasting it here too.... So now i have a new problem. Has anyone ever experienced heart issues that turned out to be related to Cialis? I went to my longtime PCP today for a checkup, first since the surgery. My bloodwork was all perfect, (i did the bloods in advance of the appointment). Cholesterol was 136. Triglycerides 148, down from 300 in December, he did about 30 other tests, all normal, so i was feeling good going in. But i mentioned to him that i was having what felt like palpatations on occasion. He did an EKG, which showed an \"extra heart beat\". which i guess, is an arrythmia. So he did an echo cardiogram, which was normal. Then an echo stress test, which was \"positive\" whatever the f that means. He told me to stop the Cialis immediately, and he put me on a beta blocker, wants me back a week from Monday (i'm going away on vacation next week). He said, depending on what happens between now and then, he will possibly send me for a CT Angiogram to look for blockages. These palpatations started soon after my surgery, which is why i thought it might be related to the Cialis. But i called my surgeon and spoke with his NP, she said she had never seen a heart problem caused by Cialis. Said if i have to stay off it, they would probably recommend injections, whcih i really dont want. So now, i have PSA Anxiety (next test, one month), a probable limp dick, AND heart issues. I'm ready to shoot myself in the mouth. Seriously depressing. Just when i was starting to feel safe. I think my life expectancy has gone down dramatically",

So, in the face of a rising PSA, i am going to make a final decision about going ahead with SRT with or without Hormone Therapy after one more PSA which i will do the end of this month. My current PSA is .068 as of a month ago. For background, i had negative margins, however, my surgeon does a intra operative frozen section which is looked at by pathology, which showed a positive margin, leading to the surgeon to do further resection, to obtain final negative margins. I saw two prominent Radiation Oncologists who both advised that i should be treated now, saying that they felt 80% sure that the negative final margin actually did contain some cancer cells that were missed and wasnt really negative My surgeon thinks i should wait and do scans if i reach .2, which he says may never happen. So I recently asked that the slides be relooked at, and that i be informed what % of pattern 4 cells there was in the g7(3+4) which was the \"dominant tumor\" (1.1 cm) AND also what the gleason was at the positive margin in the frozen section, before the surgeon obtained negative final margins. Today i got the results as follows: The tumor shows approximately 5% of a Gleason pattern 4, with the remaining 95% pattern 3 And this: While the final margins are negative, the involved apical margin (part A (which was the frozen section)) showed Gleason pattern 3 at the margin So now, this new information gives me pause, and i am not so sure whether i should do SRT at such a low PSA. I do know that if I do SRT, I am now heavily leaning toward NOT adding Hormone Therapy to the mix. Any thoughts would be welcome.

      "Content": "Hope everyone here Is doing well. I thought I\u0092d update as I haven\u0092t been here for a while... Just finished week 5 of SRT, and am in the middle of month 3 of a 6 month course of ADT. Regarding the radiation, with 3 weeks to go, no side effects to date other than being very tired but I think that\u0092s as much a function of getting up at 4-4:15 every morning to go into Manhattan for treatment, then working an almost full day. Other than that, no issues. One problem I\u0092ve had, only the last two days, is that even though I empty my bowels each morning at 5:30-6am, I start to feel a little gassy just before I get called in for treatment, and indeed, the last two days, right after treatment, when I go to empty my bladder, I have another (not insignificant) bowel movement, I can\u0092t let that continue, lest I end up with damage, so I\u0092ll start today, increasing the Metamucil and colace, frM 2 to 3 x a day. Also I\u0092ll eliminate salads for lunch, and eat less at night. I hope that works Other than that, no bleeding, no diarrhea, no urinary frequency, so thus far, I\u0092m blessed, I know it\u0092s the last few weeks though, that this stuff starts. As far as ADT, I started on Firmagon, had 2none month shots, both give me a pretty bad reaction at the injection sight. So my RO switched me to Lupron, and it was so much easier. In the two + months that my T has been at castrate levels (5 - 6), the only SE I\u0092ve had is the hot flashes, and they are annoying but not unbearable. Other than that, nothing. No insomnia, fatigue, depression, more emotion, or any if the other side effects. When I started treatment my PSA was .08. The two monthly tests since I started have both been undetectable. But MSKCC tests only down to <.05, so I guess it could be anywhere from 0.000 to 0.049. But I know it\u0092s probably closer to 0.00 and it\u0092s because of the Lupron. 3 more weeks of treatment and one more Lupron shot, which will be a 3 month shot. Then I just wait, until T starts to rise, and hopefully PSA stays down. Hope this helps someone who may be about to start salvage treatment, and is concerned about side effects.

But I have to say, while I\u2019d rather not need it, it\u2019s really been a piece of cake so far. If course I\u2019m not done, but I think whatever comes from here on will be manageable.

My bloodwork was all perfect, (i did the bloods in advance of the appointment). Cholesterol was 136. Triglycerides 148, down from 300 in December, he did about 30 other tests, all normal, so i was feeling good going in. But i mentioned to him that i was having what felt like palpatations on occasion. He did an EKG, which showed an \"extra heart beat\". which i guess, is an arrythmia. So he did an echo cardiogram, which was normal. Then an echo stress test, which was \"positive\" whatever the f that means. He told me to stop the Cialis immediately, and he put me on a beta blocker, wants me back a week from Monday (i'm going away on vacation next week). He said, depending on what happens between now and then, he will possibly send me for a CT Angiogram to look for blockages. These palpatations started soon after my surgery, which is why i thought it might be related to the Cialis. But i called my surgeon and spoke with his NP, she said she had never seen a heart problem caused by Cialis. Said if i have to stay off it, they would probably recommend injections, whcih i really dont want. So now, i have PSA Anxiety (next test, one month), a probable limp dick, AND heart issues.

      "Content": "Hope everyone here Is doing well. I thought I\u0092d update as I haven\u0092t been here for a while... Just finished week 5 of SRT, and am in the middle of month 3 of a 6 month course of ADT. Regarding the radiation, with 3 weeks to go, no side effects to date other than being very tired but I think that\u0092s as much a function of getting up at 4-4:15 every morning to go into Manhattan for treatment, then working an almost full day. Other than that, no issues. One problem I\u0092ve had, only the last two days, is that even though I empty my bowels each morning at 5:30-6am, I start to feel a little gassy just before I get called in for treatment, and indeed, the last two days, right after treatment, when I go to empty my bladder, I have another (not insignificant) bowel movement, I can\u0092t let that continue, lest I end up with damage, so I\u0092ll start today, increasing the Metamucil and colace, frM 2 to 3 x a day. Also I\u0092ll eliminate salads for lunch, and eat less at night. I hope that works Other than that, no bleeding, no diarrhea, no urinary frequency, so thus far, I\u0092m blessed, I know it\u0092s the last few weeks though, that this stuff starts. As far as ADT, I started on Firmagon, had 2none month shots, both give me a pretty bad reaction at the injection sight. So my RO switched me to Lupron, and it was so much easier. In the two + months that my T has been at castrate levels (5 - 6), the only SE I\u0092ve had is the hot flashes, and they are annoying but not unbearable. Other than that, nothing. No insomnia, fatigue, depression, more emotion, or any if the other side effects. When I started treatment my PSA was .08. The two monthly tests since I started have both been undetectable. But MSKCC tests only down to <.05, so I guess it could be anywhere from 0.000 to 0.049. But I know it\u0092s probably closer to 0.00 and it\u0092s because of the Lupron. 3 more weeks of treatment and one more Lupron shot, which will be a 3 month shot. Then I just wait, until T starts to rise, and hopefully PSA stays down. Hope this helps someone who may be about to start salvage treatment, and is concerned about side effects. It\u0092s really not bad as it sounds, for most men.",

Six weeks ago, at my last blood draw it was .068, and 2 1/2 months before that it was .060. But whatever, seems to me that it\u0092s time to treat. RO told me at .068 that he would be comfortable treating me without ADT if I prefer, but if it gets to .1, he would be much less comfortable. So I don\u0092t want to wait. Seeing the surgeon tomorrow, probably my last visit with him. IM WONDERING if the increased rate of rise means anything at this point.",

So, in the face of a rising PSA, i am going to make a final decision about going ahead with SRT with or without Hormone Therapy after one more PSA which i will do the end of this month. My current PSA is .068 as of a month ago. For background, i had negative margins, however, my surgeon does a intra operative frozen section which is looked at by pathology, which showed a positive margin, leading to the surgeon to do further resection, to obtain final negative margins. I saw two prominent Radiation Oncologists who both advised that i should be treated now, saying that they felt 80% sure that the negative final margin actually did contain some cancer cells that were missed and wasnt really negative My surgeon thinks i should wait and do scans if i reach .2, which he says may never happen. So I recently asked that the slides be relooked at, and that i be informed what % of pattern 4 cells there was in the g7(3+4) which was the \"dominant tumor\" (1.1 cm) AND also what the gleason was at the positive margin in the frozen section, before the surgeon obtained negative final margins. Today i got the results as follows: The tumor shows approximately 5% of a Gleason pattern 4, with the remaining 95% pattern 3 And this: While the final margins are negative, the involved apical margin (part A (which was the frozen section)) showed Gleason pattern 3 at the margin So now, this new information gives me pause, and i am not so sure whether i should do SRT at such a low PSA. I do know that if I do SRT, I am now heavily leaning toward NOT adding Hormone Therapy to the mix. Any thoughts would be welcome.

It seems that for early stage, low GLeason , cure rates are similar, with less trauma to the body. Side effects are different but seem to be more tolerable than SE's of RP. On the other hand, with RP, you get certainty on final pathology, and quick drop in PSA. My opinion after today's consult and my own reading, is that early stage, low GLeason PC , you do equally well with either decision, and it comes down to individual priorities. I still have not decided. DOING A 3T MRI next week then, with results I will consult one more time with surgeon and RO, then make a decision without ever looking back, and no regrets. As far as AS, that's a whole different ball of wax.",

      "Content": "I posted this on another forum, apologies to some of you who may have seen it, but i am looking for answers so just pasting it here too.... So now i have a new problem. Has anyone ever experienced heart issues that turned out to be related to Cialis? I went to my longtime PCP today for a checkup, first since the surgery. My bloodwork was all perfect, (i did the bloods in advance of the appointment). Cholesterol was 136. Triglycerides 148, down from 300 in December, he did about 30 other tests, all normal, so i was feeling good going in. But i mentioned to him that i was having what felt like palpatations on occasion. He did an EKG, which showed an \"extra heart beat\". which i guess, is an arrythmia. So he did an echo cardiogram, which was normal. Then an echo stress test, which was \"positive\" whatever the f that means. He told me to stop the Cialis immediately, and he put me on a beta blocker, wants me back a week from Monday (i'm going away on vacation next week). He said, depending on what happens between now and then, he will possibly send me for a CT Angiogram to look for blockages. These palpatations started soon after my surgery, which is why i thought it might be related to the Cialis. But i called my surgeon and spoke with his NP, she said she had never seen a heart problem caused by Cialis. Said if i have to stay off it, they would probably recommend injections, whcih i really dont want. So now, i have PSA Anxiety (next test, one month), a probable limp dick, AND heart issues. I'm ready to shoot myself in the mouth. Seriously depressing. Just when i was starting to feel safe. I think my life expectancy has gone down dramatically",

      "Content": "With apologies to those who\u0092ve already seen this on another forum, there are some really knowledgeable folks here that are not there, so I\u0092m copying and pasting with a few minor edits. So, in the face of a rising PSA, i am going to make a final decision about going ahead with SRT with or without Hormone Therapy after one more PSA which i will do the end of this month. My current PSA is .068 as of a month ago. For background, i had negative margins, however, my surgeon does a intra operative frozen section which is looked at by pathology, which showed a positive margin, leading to the surgeon to do further resection, to obtain final negative margins. I saw two prominent Radiation Oncologists who both advised that i should be treated now, saying that they felt 80% sure that the negative final margin actually did contain some cancer cells that were missed and wasnt really negative My surgeon thinks i should wait and do scans if i reach .2, which he says may never happen. So I recently asked that the slides be relooked at, and that i be informed what % of pattern 4 cells there was in the g7(3+4) which was the \"dominant tumor\" (1.1 cm) AND also what the gleason was at the positive margin in the frozen section, before the surgeon obtained negative final margins. Today i got the results as follows: The tumor shows approximately 5% of a Gleason pattern 4, with the remaining 95% pattern 3 And this: While the final margins are negative, the involved apical margin (part A (which was the frozen section)) showed Gleason pattern 3 at the margin So now, this new information gives me pause, and i am not so sure whether i should do SRT at such a low PSA. I do know that if I do SRT, I am now heavily leaning toward NOT adding Hormone Therapy to the mix. Any thoughts would be welcome. I feel like I\u0092m in never never land, I know there is no clear answer.",

      "Content": "Regarding Newporters comment on outcomes being the same, this is what I was told today in a consult with RO at MSKCC. It seems that for early stage, low GLeason , cure rates are similar, with less trauma to the body. Side effects are different but seem to be more tolerable than SE's of RP. On the other hand, with RP, you get certainty on final pathology, and quick drop in PSA. My opinion after today's consult and my own reading, is that early stage, low GLeason PC , you do equally well with either decision, and it comes down to individual priorities. I still have not decided. DOING A 3T MRI next week then, with results I will consult one more time with surgeon and RO, then make a decision without ever looking back, and no regrets. As far as AS, that's a whole different ball of wax.",
