      "Content": "My H is one month into SRT and is having pretty bad bowel issues as a side effect. He says he feels generally bad and run down, like he has a mild stomach virus. Many evenings he just lays in bed. He's 51 and otherwise healthy. His oncologist says it's normal. Should he be concerned? He said he has had a strange feeling in his bowels since his biopsy in April 2014.",

      "Content": "My H was diagnosed last year with PC at age 50. He went from PSA 3.6 in November to 5.3 six months later. He had DaVinci surgery about a month later. At that point, I thought things were in the clear. Gleason score increased from 6 to 7 post surgery (3+4), but the surgeon didn't recommend radiation post surgery, PSA was not detectable, and while he had some side effects with leakage, etc., we went back to our lives. But last month's PSA test showed a small rise. It from 0 to .06 in six months. Second PSA two weeks later was .07. Still, his urologist said we would just do another PSA test in six months. So I read up on prostate cancer, not just surgery, and find out a lot about doubling time, time to recurrence, etc. I read through my H's pathology report. Turns out his tumor volume was 25% and he had 3 positive margins. To me, those aren't good numbers. If his PSA is rising like it is, waiting six months for another PSA test could let it rise above .1, but I've read that salvage radiation is most effective if it's done before the PSA rises over .1. Needless to say, I'm not impressed with the urologist and his relaxed attitude. To me, it seems like my H has aggressive prostate cancer. But maybe I'm wrong?!? I will also say that I've read that diet can play a role in both the occurrence and aggressiveness of prostate cancer. Well, my H has a pretty bad diet. He probably went for the first 45 years of his life without voluntarily eating a vegetable. He hates them. Loves deli meat, eats lots of nuts, never has eaten a salad in his life. I used to encourage him to eat better, but he says that salad makes him wretch. He finally is listening to me about his diet, but his version is to drink V-8 and maybe get in a bowl of vegetable soup once or twice a week. He also has a persistent cough. I'm just here looking for perspectives. The recurrence has caught me off guard, and I want to be better informed.",

      "Content": "As I've said before here, my H doesn't want to talk about his cancer, at least not the important things. I asked him if he is having his PSA checked during radiation and he said he's not. He then went on to tell me that you don't start hormone therapy during radiation, only before. I hadn't mentioned hormones, so I know he was being defensive and wanting to shut me down. Here's my concern - I don't think his doctors are being honest with him. His cancer has recurred in less than 1 year and his psadt is less than 3 months. Based on this chart from Johns Hopkins, he can't be cured. His chances of surviving 15 years are about 1%. How can they suggest to him that radiation could cure him in this case? http://urology.jhu.edu/newsletter/pr..._cancer829.php",

      "Content": "Thanks, guys. I have to handle this delicately, as my H doesn't want me to disagree with his doctors or express concern. He would rather just get radiation once a day and forget about it the rest of the time. My thought is that I might just request responses here and just show him this thread and let him decide for himself. Just have to be careful to not make him angry.",

      "Content": "As I've said before here, my H doesn't want to talk about his cancer, at least not the important things. I asked him if he is having his PSA checked during radiation and he said he's not. He then went on to tell me that you don't start hormone therapy during radiation, only before. I hadn't mentioned hormones, so I know he was being defensive and wanting to shut me down. Here's my concern - I don't think his doctors are being honest with him. His cancer has recurred in less than 1 year and his psadt is less than 3 months. Based on this chart from Johns Hopkins, he can't be cured. His chances of surviving 15 years are about 1%. How can they suggest to him that radiation could cure him in this case? http://urology.jhu.edu/newsletter/pr..._cancer829.php",

      "Content": "My H was diagnosed last year with PC at age 50. He went from PSA 3.6 in November to 5.3 six months later. He had DaVinci surgery about a month later. At that point, I thought things were in the clear. Gleason score increased from 6 to 7 post surgery (3+4), but the surgeon didn't recommend radiation post surgery, PSA was not detectable, and while he had some side effects with leakage, etc., we went back to our lives. But last month's PSA test showed a small rise. It from 0 to .06 in six months. Second PSA two weeks later was .07. Still, his urologist said we would just do another PSA test in six months. So I read up on prostate cancer, not just surgery, and find out a lot about doubling time, time to recurrence, etc. I read through my H's pathology report. Turns out his tumor volume was 25% and he had 3 positive margins. To me, those aren't good numbers. If his PSA is rising like it is, waiting six months for another PSA test could let it rise above .1, but I've read that salvage radiation is most effective if it's done before the PSA rises over .1. Needless to say, I'm not impressed with the urologist and his relaxed attitude. To me, it seems like my H has aggressive prostate cancer. But maybe I'm wrong?!? I will also say that I've read that diet can play a role in both the occurrence and aggressiveness of prostate cancer. Well, my H has a pretty bad diet. He probably went for the first 45 years of his life without voluntarily eating a vegetable. He hates them. Loves deli meat, eats lots of nuts, never has eaten a salad in his life. I used to encourage him to eat better, but he says that salad makes him wretch. He finally is listening to me about his diet, but his version is to drink V-8 and maybe get in a bowl of vegetable soup once or twice a week. He also has a persistent cough. I'm just here looking for perspectives. The recurrence has caught me off guard, and I want to be better informed.",
