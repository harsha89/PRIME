    "Content": "New guy here, but turning to those with experience as this is turning out more complicated than I expected. Diagnosed Gleason 3+3 in January, and at my age RRP seemed the sure thing. Surgery went pretty smoothly other than some adverse reaction to yet another antibiotic I can't take, but core tumor was worse, Gleason 3+4 and with two 2mm positive margins at the base and apex rating Gleason 3+3 each. Surgeon said cutting any deeper on bladder/urethra would have had serious functional impairment. Second guessing that won't do much now. Good news is that PSA was down to what Walsh suggests is a \"negligible\" .1 after only a month. Confusion comes in the fact that surgeon is recommending a rush to adjuvant radiation therapy without establishing whether the PSA trend is down/stable/rising. Taking further action only 6 weeks out seems awfully fast. I get that the core Gleason and margins are reason for pause, but anyone else go through this? How long before you went to RT to address the margins, and what were results?",
