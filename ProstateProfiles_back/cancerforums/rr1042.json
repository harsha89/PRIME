    "Content": "Just wanted to add my support to other guys going through their treatment process and let them know that things do improve! I was fortunate to have a great doc, Dr Ron Ennis and his wonderful team (thanks Larry) at Roosevelt in NY, they helped to manage my treatment and my expectations. My girlfriend and family have been amazingly supportive. Both my radiotherapy and implantation procedures went well, and 4 months after bracytherapy my PSA is 1.25, so I'm pretty happy. As far as quality of life issues go, my nighttime urination is down to once per night, and seems to be a steady stream most of the time, although I'm still taking Flomax. Now I'm getting some decent sleep, my erections are as hard as ever, and without giving too much unwanted detail, my orgasms are more intense. I have used Cialis a couple of times, but I think really it's been for mental rather than physical support! So hang in there fellas, we may have cancer, but it doesn't have to define who we are. I think it has taught me to treat each day as a gift, treasure those around us and care more about those things that really matter.",
