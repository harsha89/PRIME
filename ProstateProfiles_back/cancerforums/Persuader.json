      "Content": "Hi all. First time poster and I'm looking for info from folks who've had perineal biopsy's. I'm currently doing active surveillance and was diagnosed in 2008 when my PSA left the 1-2 range and made the huge leap to 3.5. This was enough for the doc to advise a 12 core biopsy. Have since had 3 - 12 core and 1 MRI of the prostate along with multiple PSA's and 3xPCA3's. Results: 1st biopsy 3% in one core only, 2nd biopsy 10% of one 12mm core, 3rd biopsy negative followed by the MRI which was negative. Last 3 PSA's were 3, 4.24, 3.59. PCA3's 34, 55, 99, in that order. My issue now is do I go for a 48 core perineal biopsy to try and better locate the cancer and if so, what side effects have others experienced. Since I have an enlarged prostate and already medicate to ease urination, I expect I'll need a catheter if there's any post swelling. There you have it. Any info on your experience will be gratefully received. Thanks, Jim",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by johnT I would get a Color Doppler Ulltrasound before a saturation biopsy. 1. It is much less expensive. 2. It can see into the anterior much better than an MRI 3. It will provide a baseline for continued Active Survelience Even travelling to a well known CDU radiologist like Dr Duke Bahn or Dattoli would be less expensive and less traumatic than a saturation biopsy. A saturation biopsy would be the way to go if your were considering a focal treatment, but for monitoring AS, a CDU would be better. Now that's two of you for TRUS. My doc mentioned that and stated he wasn't that much of a fan of the procedure so I never followed up to look into it. Not that he doesn't have my best interests at heart, I do have to keep reminding myself that he's a surgeon and the saturation is done at his place by one of his partners. So I'll do my due diligence. My thanks to you and LL Fauntleroy.",
