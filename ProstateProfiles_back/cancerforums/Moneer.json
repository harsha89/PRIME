    "Content": "Hi everyone, The new sticky regarding what people should know & ask about prior to undergoing surgery for prostate cancer will hopefully help new patients leaning in that direction -- or those who have already chosen it. For everyone who has undergone brachy treatments, perhaps you can list things to be aware of, questions to ask, etc., for those just starting down your road. If this thread proves to be helpful & informative, I'll make it a sticky also. Thanks, Moneer",
