      "Content": "Hi Chuck and Pratoman Thank you for your comments and suggestions. I do have BPH due to enlarged prostate. In fact, in 2006 I did undergo a Green light laser PVP treatment to open up the urethral tract of my prostate. After the surgery my my urinay flow restrictions were eliminated. My last urologist told me after the negative biopsy in 2012 that I might be having some issues with prostate inflammation and infections from time to time. But he did not prescribe any antibiotics. When I see a new urologist on Feb 9, before doing another biopsy , I will ask him to give me Cipro for two weeks and then check my PSA. Next I will get a MR Imaging of biopsy at Virginia Commonwealth University, Richmond. It is a very advanced technique which is non invasive and lasts for 45 minutes and can detect cancerous lesions or tumors with almost 85 pct accuracy as they claim. If the MRI images show suspicious areas then I will have to go back to them for a MRI/Ultrasound fusion biopsy of the prostate. So this is my plan. I will welcome all comments and suggestions from the members of the forum. Thank you. Ron",
