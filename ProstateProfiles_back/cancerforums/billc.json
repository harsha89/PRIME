Alex Sorry to hear that you've joined our club, but in saying that, welcome to our club! You will find a wealth of info on here from men just like yourself who have gone before you in treatment. There are many options for you but first and foremost I would suggest you go and buy Dr. Patrick Walsh's third edition book on \" Surviving Prostate Cancer\". I listened to fellow members here and bought it and read it cover to cover. It will help to ease the anxiety you are feeling and give you an in depth review of all your options. Make sure whatever choice you make and Dr. you choose, that the Dr. has done at least 300-400 procedures to avoid any learning curve. Good luck to you and keep watching for more very informative posts from fellow members.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by billc Just wanted to say hi to all on here and a special shout out to Chuck. Over a year ago I came to find this site and I was scared and confused and didn't know where to turn for answers. I was diagnosed with a low prostate cancer Gleason score of 3-3 with only 2 of 12 cores having cancer cells. Of the 2 cores with cancer cells they were only 10-15%. I was told AS was my probable best choice of treatment and I had plenty of time to wait and read as much as I could on my disease. This site and Chuck and others gave me great advice and calmed me down when I needed it most. Probably the best suggestion was the buying of the book by Dr. Walsh. I bought it and read it from cover to cover. I decided for myself that I was not satisfied with AS and decided to pursue the option of the DaVinci Robotic surgery to remove my prostate. My personal theory was this, even a small amount of cancer in my body was something I eventually would have to deal with. I decided considering my age that my best choice for recovery and a cure was to have my prostate removed as soon as possible. I got preapproved for surgery through my insurance and decided to fly to L.A. to have my prostrate removed by the top surgeon at Kaiser who had done thousands of procedures. It has been a year now since my surgery and I thank God that I have had 4 PSA tests revealing an undetectable reading every time. My incontinence is gone and I have semi erections enough so that my wife and I can enjoy our sexual relationship as well as our normal day to day relationship. So far I am one of the lucky ones and for that I thank God, this forum and Chuck and the rest of the gang who faithfully follow and offer advice and an ear to anyone who comes here to this site. I pray and wish the best to all who visit this forum and a special shout out to the administrators of this site! Thanks Chuck and all the gang, Don't want to upset anyone or start anything here because I love this forum but I do want to speak out about my post surgery outcome and state why I am so fortunate I followed my instincts in regards to my decision to go ahead and have my surgery when I did. I know Chuck remembers my story but for the new members I want to relay this. I was suggested AS as an alternative to either surgery or radiation due to my low Gleason following my biopsy. After surgery when we went for my follow up with my surgeon I was informed that the 1 core that per my Urologist had only 10-15% cancer cells was actually only biopsied on a corner of the tumor. I was upgraded to a 4-3 Gleason score and additional tissue was taken and sent to the lab to be frozen and tested resulting in additional tissue removal. The cancerous tumor was only 1 millimeter away from exiting the Prostate! Had I waited it surely would have exited the Prostate and I would now be facing a whole different scenario. Therefore in my non medical professional opinion I would NOT choose AS as a possible choice of treatment. If it is found that through a biopsy cancer is indeed in your prostate, it will have to be dealt with at some point in your life, why not deal with it when it is small and more readily treatable. At a younger age you have much more time to recover from the side effects associated with the surgery or radiation. For myself I was 60 when I was diagnosed which did make recovery a little longer then someone younger, however the most important decision one needs to make is the choice of surgeon or Dr. who will be doing your radiation treatment if that is the way you choose to treat. Choose someone who has done thousands if you can find one, and look at their outcome history. Read Dr. Walsh's book first and foremost so you are educated, then make your decision as to whether you choose surgery or radiation but please reconsider AS because when you get that PSA result and your number has jumped significantly it might be too late. Just my opinion and my fellow members will have their own, but this is MY story and I'm glad I made my decision when I did!",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by HighlanderCFH Hi, Fairwind just gave you some very valid advice. About 28% of the time, after a prostatectomy, the Gleason score is found to be HIGHER than predicted by the clinical biopsy report. Sometimes the tumor(s) is also found to be more involved than originally thought. That is the risk one takes with active surveillance. Hopefully your husband will turn out to truly be a G6 -- but with multiple positive cores and several at 80%, it is probably much too dangerous to just trust that it will be okay. Active surveillance is usually only recommended if there are only 1 or 2 positive cores and if both are under 50% -- and even then, it's still a roll of the dice that it truly is a G6 and not a higher grade. In my own case, I had 3 cores positive with G6. As you can see by my signature down below, two were 20% and one was only 5%. My urologist said that with 3 positive cores, he believed in an aggressive approach whereas only 2 positive cores would have generated his recommendation of active surveillance. So I firmly believe that your husband IS doing the right thing. He is also young enough to make a great recovery in all phases. Good luck!! Chuck Good advice Chuck, My personal experience I have shared with those considering the surveillance method of treatment is this. I was diagnosed after a biopsy to be a Gleason 6 with 2 of 12 cores having between 5-20% cancer. Probably the lowest numbers on the table and I was told I was a perfect candidate for surveillance. I opted after reading Dr. Walsh's excellent book and reading this forum to go ahead and have the DaVinci robotic surgery and be done with it. After pathology my Gleason score was changed to a 7, 4-3, which is a more aggressive cancer and the tumor was 1 millimeter from exiting the prostate. Had I listened to the Dr. and waited I would be probably facing a dimmer future with follow up treatments instead of hopefully heading towards a full recovery. My surgeon told me that the Gleason score usually will be higher in most cases after pathology because the biopsy is only sampling a small portion of the entire prostate. Also they may biopsy a corner of a tumor that is actually larger than what is diagnosed. Based on my own situation I would never recommend surveillance as a method of treatment. Besides you have to address the cancer at some point so you might as well address it when you are younger and better suited for recovery. Good luck!",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by HighlanderCFH Hi, Fairwind just gave you some very valid advice. About 28% of the time, after a prostatectomy, the Gleason score is found to be HIGHER than predicted by the clinical biopsy report. Sometimes the tumor(s) is also found to be more involved than originally thought. That is the risk one takes with active surveillance. Hopefully your husband will turn out to truly be a G6 -- but with multiple positive cores and several at 80%, it is probably much too dangerous to just trust that it will be okay. Active surveillance is usually only recommended if there are only 1 or 2 positive cores and if both are under 50% -- and even then, it's still a roll of the dice that it truly is a G6 and not a higher grade. In my own case, I had 3 cores positive with G6. As you can see by my signature down below, two were 20% and one was only 5%. My urologist said that with 3 positive cores, he believed in an aggressive approach whereas only 2 positive cores would have generated his recommendation of active surveillance. So I firmly believe that your husband IS doing the right thing. He is also young enough to make a great recovery in all phases. Good luck!! Chuck Good advice Chuck, My personal experience I have shared with those considering the surveillance method of treatment is this. I was diagnosed after a biopsy to be a Gleason 6 with 2 of 12 cores having between 5-20% cancer. Probably the lowest numbers on the table and I was told I was a perfect candidate for surveillance. I opted after reading Dr. Walsh's excellent book and reading this forum to go ahead and have the DaVinci robotic surgery and be done with it. After pathology my Gleason score was changed to a 7, 4-3, which is a more aggressive cancer and the tumor was 1 millimeter from exiting the prostate. Had I listened to the Dr. and waited I would be probably facing a dimmer future with follow up treatments instead of hopefully heading towards a full recovery.

Sorry it's been so long since my last visit but I've been busy with finishing up at work, getting ready for retirement and building a new house in Florida for my retirement. Anyways, on to the good news. I just had my second PSA test done this afternoon and my Dr. emailed me the results already tonight. My test result was 0.02 down from the last one two months ago of 0.05. I'm so relieved I think I'm going to have trouble falling asleep tonight. I was prepared for a couple days of anxiousness waiting but modern medicine is incredible nowadays. I hope everyone is doing well and all those that had surgery or radiation around the same time as I did are doing great. I am at 1 pad per day, for minor leaks but not much luck in the erection department as yet. As I told my surgeon, you get all the cancer and allow me to become continent again and I couldn't ask for much more, 2 out of 3 ain't bad!! Take care all, I'll keep in touch! bill.",

Rudy Congratulations on great results so far. My surgery was also 1 week today. I see my Dr. Thursday to rid of this dang catheter and get staples out. My path report wasn't as good as yours though. My Gleason was changed from 3-3 to 4-3. Cancer was still contained to prostate as Dr. during surgery noted irregular tissue and took a bit more tissue had it frozen and sent to the lab to verify if any cancer cells were found. Thank God there wasn't any cancer cells in the extra tissue so he believes he got it all.wont know for sure till the 90 day first PSA.

      "Content": "Originally Posted by recentlydiagnosed56 Hi all, my husband surgery is this friday. I got on this prostate cancer forum for ladies only and started freaking out. The women were telling me my husband should not have surgery at a gleason 6 and telling me all of the horrible things that could happen and he should check into other treatments. Wow! I didn't expect that. Kind of got me thinking is my husband doing the right thing? Cheryl Hi Cheryl, You have come to a great forum, there are a lot of men on here who have gone through what your husband is going through and have an enormous amount of experiences to share. My personal experience is as follows, I was diagnosed with a Gleason 6, PSA of 5.12 and had a biopsy. They found 2 of the 12 cores sampled had 5-20% cancer. I was diagnosed with a \"low grade\" cancer and was told I had plenty of time to do research and suggested even that I could opt for the active surveillance treatment. I opted instead to have the DaVinci robotic surgery done in LA by a surgeon who has done close to a thousand procedures. During surgery my surgeon discovered the tumor to be larger than first diagnosed and removed extra tissue, had the extra margin of tissue frozen and examined at the hospital lab and confirmed it to be cancer free. My Gleason score was changed after the pathology biopsy of my prostate to 4-3, which meant a more aggressive cancer was actually in my prostate. Had I waited I would probably be in a worse state, expecting to have radiation treatment in the future. I will have my first PSA test in several weeks followed by 2 more spaced out a month apart. My surgeon expects good results as the cancer was contained within the prostate. My point being, your husband is diagnosed now with a Gleason score of 3-3, but that can and does change quite often after the prostate is removed and examined. When they do a biopsy the Dr. is sampling usually 12 small samples from the entire prostate,,meaning they can easily miss an entire tumor or hit just a fraction of a tumor. There is no way of knowing the extent of the tumor or rumors until a final exam of the prostate after it is removed. Good luck to your husband. I am sure with a well trained competent surgeon who has done at least 300-400 surgeries, your husband will be fine. Others on here will give you great advice and share similar stories of their recoveries. billc.",

      "Content": "Hi, new to this site. Just received my biopsy results yesterday and I am a new member to the \"club\". It was a bit of a shock as I am healthy, not overweight, exercise 3-5 times a week at my local exercise club and have had few health issues in my 60 years. As my PSA has slowly climbed over the years my Dr. suggested this last checkup that I go and have an ultrasound and biopsy done to make sure nothing was going on. I went and the Urologist first did a digital exam and said my prostate was normal, smooth with no discernible growths. After the tests were completed I waited a week for the results and found out I did indeed have prostate cancer. My PSA is 5.18, my Gleason score is 6 and 2 of the 12 biopsy samples have a 20% growth. My prostate was found to be slightly enlarged also. I have been reading constantly treatment options as my Dr. advised me to do so. As a Urologist that also performs the radical surgery to remove the prostate, he is in favor of this treatment option. I am considering hearing my option to have a radiation treatment based on my low grade cancer, however reading that surgery would not be an option after having radiation I have second thoughts. Some say not to do anything rash as I have time on my side because of the low grade numbers. I don't think I want to wait and then end up regretting that decision later on down the road if and when my cancer gets worse. I would appreciate any advice from people here who have had similar numbers as mine and what they chose and how there outcome was. Thanks in advance..",

I myself have to research to decide which form of treatment I am going to choose. I have been leaning towards the robotic Da-Vinci from the beginning but I want to explore all my options. I just today bought Dr. Walsh's third edition book on surviving PC and I hope to have it read by this week. I guess I am fortunate in that my discovery was early and my numbers are low enough to give me the time to do my research. Good luck to you and please keep me posted as to your continued recovery. billc.",
