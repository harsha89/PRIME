      "Content": "I've been experiencing most of the classic symptoms of BPH, prostatitis, and/or prostate cancer (frequent urination, low flow, dribbling, urgency, occasional dull, aching prostate). In addition to the classic symptoms, I've also been experiencing chronic flu-like symptoms (fatigue, lower abdominal pain, feverish) for several months. I'm concerned that my symptoms may be an indication of the worst case scenario (cancer). I have an appointment for a full prostate screening in 1 month (1/6/12), shortly after my insurance kicks in (1/1/12). For those that have had prostate cancer, should I be concerned?? Are my symptoms consistent with what you may have experienced, having had PC? Should I be seeking immediate care, instead of waiting 1 month?",

      "Content": "My appointment is tomorrow morning, moved up from 1/6/12 because of my concern over what is happening to me. Just returned from the holidays, and they were anything but joyous. My condition has taken a turn for the worse, as I began to experience a \"pins and needles\" sensation in my lower abdomen and back Christmas Day, and the sensations have worsened to sharp twitches of stabbing pain over the ensuing days, together with an abnormal bloating of the midsection. Don't know if this is all prostate related, but to feel so progressively ill with accelerating bad symptoms over the past month is not a good sign. I am hoping for the best, but am prepared for the worst. This is a surreal situation, suspecting that something very bad is wrong with me, and just awaiting for the ultimate verdict.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by newporter DMD, You said: \"In addition to the classic symptoms, I've also been experiencing chronic flu-like symptoms (fatigue, lower abdominal pain, feverish) for several months.\" I am not a doctor, but let me emphasize again, if you have persistent fever that won't go away, it could mean serious infections, so you should see a doctor quickly for that. PSA, DRE etc. can wait. Good luck. Thanks for your concern. Coincidentally, I began taking my temp today to see if there was actual fever in conjunction with these episodes, and the readings are actually OK (97.3F). I'm not sure if that's good news (no infection), or bad news (possible cancer instead of prostatitis), as I feel so lousy.",
