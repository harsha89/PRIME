      "Content": "I had some bouts with ED since surgery in 2014. Now erections are basically normal. I felt BP medication was causing some ED last year so I made a medication change and that has helped for sure. I tried Cialis twice last year (before medication change) but it just did not work for me. Highlander is correct about taking up to two years sometimes. I can agree with that based on my experience. Do not be surprised if you feel a change almost over night. Good luck! Steve",

When you reference 7 kegels a day are you meaning 7 sets (one set being flex (hold 10 seconds), rest (hold 10 seconds), flex (hold 10), rest (hold 10), flex (hold 10)? I received an exercise guide from my urologist to start with 10 sets per day for 1st week, increase to 15 sets per day for 2nd week, increase to 20 sets per day for 3rd week, increase to 25 or 30 sets per day for 4th week (I am at work and trying to recall the schedule). I currently get sore at 15 sets per day.",

I am continuing to do kegel exercises but have to slack off sometimes because of soreness. I have read comments that incontinence can take a year to improve.
