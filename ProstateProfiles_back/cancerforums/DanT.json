      "Content": "Hello all, I was told a week ago that I have PC, had the \"consult\" with my urologist last night and still have many questions and concerns like I'm sure all of you had. My history...I'm 52, was told 3 years ago my PSA numbers were on the rise (upper 3's) need to talk to doc, was told by my GP that it was most likely due to me having an enlarged prostate but we would keep an eye on it. PSA numbers continued to rise to where they are now(5.0). I decided to go straight to urologist he did DRE found prostate to be enlarged but nothing else, did PSA Free test came back 14.4%, told me he wanted to do a biopsy. Biopsy came back last week showing 3 cores positive left side only. Sixe 71ccm. ,gleason 7 (3x4). In the consult last night doc went through all possible treatment options and we narrowed it down to the 2 he thought most likely to be best, surgery and radiology. Now the confusing part for me, he explained the different options for both procedures and said I would need to decide which one I wanted to go with. By this time my head was mush and there was no way for me to grasp everything he was saying but I could kind of tell he was leaning toward the open surgery (RD?). Thought I would come to you guys, maybe get your thoughts and opinions on these two methods. Thanks in advance...Dan",

      "Content": "Way too early to tell but I think I've done alright with my doc/surgeon. I didn't really choose him...he just happened to be closest to my home. Turns out he has done over 1500 of these surgeries, comes highly recommended from several friends and probably most importantly, I like him. Hopefully my character judging skills are still up to snuff... is there a way check on the competence or ranking of your Doc, kind of like a \"customer review\" or maybe even has he had any lawsuits against him?

      "Content": "Thanks to all those that replied, I can't you how great it is to hear from guys that have \"been there done that\". I couldn't get my doc to just flat out say \" this is the best course of action for you\" ,but I could tell that he was leaning more towards the open surgery telling me in the case of a bigger prostate he liked to \"feel\" where he was going to be cutting, said he can't do that with the robotic method. Doc has also set me up with the folks that do the radiation for a consult to hear their take on my PC. I'll keep an open mind but,I have to admit I have developed the mentality of get that SOB out of there, so at this point it's just a matter of which type of surgery do I get. I was afraid my doc just didn't like to do da vinci but I talked to a friend this afternoon that had the robotic procedure done and he told me he too could tell his doc was leaning towards that type of surgery, I asked him who his doc was and lo and behold he was the same as mine. Thanks again for the input Dan",
