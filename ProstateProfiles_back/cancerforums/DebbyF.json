      "Content": "My husband was diagnosed with a very rare and aggressive prostate cancer in June 2014. By October he was told it had spread to his spine and hip. He's been having elegard injections every 6 months. In May 2017 it had spread significantly so he had radiation. In December it had spread to the base of his skull, up and down entire spine, ribs, femurs but not to any organs yet. He started chemo Jan. 3rd this year and has one every three weeks. He just completed his 2nd one last week and has been very sick. My question is this. Why did they wait so long before doing chemo? Is that normal? He sure seemed fine before starting chemo so I just question is this a last ditch effort on their part? My husband won't ask them these questions and forbids me to ask also. He's 69 years old so I guess it's the era he was raised in. He doesn't want to know how long he has to live but I feel I need an idea so I can start preparing myself. Can you offer any insight?",

      "Content": "Well I'm back. My husband had radiation for 9 weeks last year. In Jan of this year he started chemo. He took 8 rounds of chemo and the dr told him he could make the decision on whether or not he wanted to continue chemo. He opted not to. He had another bone scan recently which showed the lesions on his bones have gotten much worse. For about a week he could hardly walk. He had to pick his leg up and place it under him in order to stand from a sitting position. He quit taking the steroid and got better. But now he seems to be going down hill flying. He says he feels so extremely fatigued that he can't hardly function. He's having trouble keeping food down. He's so very weak and he just feels so cold to the touch. I tried to talk to the dr without my husband hearing and I asked him approximately how long he thinks he has. He said he couldn't tell me. My question is if he can't then who can? I'm desperately trying to come to terms with this but I need some kind of warning. Saturday he seemed fine and even wanted to cut the grass but Saturday night he started down hill. My question is did he just overdo it on Saturday? Because today is Tuesday and each day he is getting worse. He's not sleeping well at all. Absolutely NO appetite. Could this be the end?",
