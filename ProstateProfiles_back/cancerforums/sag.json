      "Content": "I developed a bend at the base after RP. According to a Urologist that I saw specifically for this condition he said it occurs in about 25% of men after the surgery. He recommended taking COQ10 as some have seen it improve on that. It's been about 6 mos of COQ10 for me and I've seen minimal improvement. Good luck.",

      "Content": "I feel your pain man. Nothing more frustrating than not being able to perform after RP surgery. My surgeon spared nerves 100% on one side and 50% on the other and because of that gave me a 50% chance of getting a useable erection with pills. I was on 5mg Cialis every other day starting 2 weeks after surgery then started once a week Trimix injections at 5 mos and 20mg Sildenafil 3-4 times per week. I've had only a few weak nighttime erections and nothing in the morning but 9 mos after surgery I was able to get a 6/10 useable erection with 100mg Sildenafil (empty stomach, waited 1 1/2 hrs). So no nocturnal erections is not necessarily a predictor of failure with pills. Good luck.",
