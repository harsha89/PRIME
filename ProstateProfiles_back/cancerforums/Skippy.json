It might be that there is simply not a sufficient level of knowledge in the comparatively small Bruneian health system to diagnose and deal with rarer form of prostate cancer. If I were you, I'd contact St.Vincent by email without delay and ask their view on what should be done - they are quite approachable. Their web pages are at prostate.com.au",

      "Content": "I'd truly hate to be a bearer of bad news, but in my most humble opinion as someone who had his CaP detected early, I really think more determined diagnostic effort, and an eminent expert opinion, are definitely called for. Andrology Australia posts on their prostate pages the PSA levels for different age groups of Western men. The three numbers in every line are: Age (years) | Average PSA | Upper limit of normal PSA 40-49 | 0.65 | 2.0 50-59 | 0.85 | 3.0 60-69 | 1.39 | 4.0 70-79 | 1.64 | 5 .5 As you can see, your baseline (3.0) at age 22 was nearly five-fold of an average, and 150% of an alert level for a 40yo. man. Currently your PSA of 9.8 is at nearly five times the alert level of PSA for a man in his forties. It is likely is a significant problem somewhere, and it must be found. You have a very high baseline PSA to begin with, and a rapid PSA increase which does not respond to antibiotics. If I were you, I'd be looking for an opinion from an eminent prostate cancer specialist at a centre of excellence in urological cancers (John Hopkins, Sloan-Kettering and a few others). You might perhaps benefit from a TRUS examination with the color Doppler option, which can pick up deep seated transitional zone tumours which are very difficult to find in biopsies. There exist rare variants of prostate cancer which strike early in life. It is in your interest to get to the bottom of the question of your rising PSA as soon as practicable.",
