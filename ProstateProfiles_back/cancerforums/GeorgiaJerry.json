Some research says there is little or no difference in overall survival (OS) with 79.2 Gy and 70.2 Gy dosage. I'll bring this up with my RO again.

      "Content": "My first post: I start EBRT on Monday August 27. This is the primary treatment path, no seeds, no markers and no hormone treatment (primarily due to bleeding issues). I am told that the dose will be 79.2 Gy for 45 sessions. I also have a condition known as Myelodysplastic Syndromes (MDS), which further leads to bleeding issues. I try and do research in this area and come up with articles on doses of 79.2 Gy in 44 fractions VS 70.2 GY in 39 fractions. And you wonder, with bleeding and rectal issues as one of the primary side effects of radiation treatment, is one dose better in the long run, than the other? Does anyone out there have any experience in this area with similar health issues that went through or is going through EBRT? And I\u0092m not questioning my doctor\u0092s decision on this but it seems that PC has a ton of treatment plans and no shortage of opinions as to which is best for patients. Any ideas, suggestions or first hand experiences would be appreciated. Thanks.",

Yes, surgery ruled out due to bleeding issues, on Xaralto, Afib and the MDS issue ruled out surgery. I'm scheduled for RT tomorrow at 79.2 Gy. RO is aware of bleeding issue. I just hope that the higher dosage of 79.2 VS 70.2 will not be a significant issue later on.",

      "Content": "Fairwind, Thanks for the info. I don't actually take everything I see on the Internet as being totally honest or correct. But it can be a valuable tool if you vet the site and use the info from nationally know cancer organizations. Today was my 2nd session and the machine is a Truebeam with IGRT, IMRT and Rapid Arc. I guess all the bells and whistles are turned on for each session. I also keep seeing the fraction number as decreasing and this is why I get a bit antsy about 79.2 across 45 fractions. But I guess \"Ours is not to reason why; Ours is but to do or die,\" But 2 sessions done and only 43 more to go.",
