I was discharged at Hill AFB then worked as a civilian then went to Kadena for Class II F-16 maintenance. I sure enjoyed working fighters, greatest sound in the world.",

      "Content": "Hello All, I had started lurking to this forum back in October when I was diagnosed with Prostrate Cancer. My gleason scoring from a 15 core sampling was a 7 and the cancer was rated at T2. I just had the DaVinci surgery completed on Feb. 28th. I then had my catheter removed on March 9th my birthday. That was a good present. Just prior to that I had received my pathology from the doctor via phone. She said that upon pathology completed my grade actually turned out to be a T4. I know am not verbalizing this as some of members have listed in their postings/profile. I am not quite up on the more technical aspect of it yet. I still waiting for my paper copies of labs. But bottom line, I am feeling very well. Just bummed out with the dribbling, incontinence aspects at moment. Which of course I was informed and aware of. I am very adamant about doing kegels to help get out that sooner. Just wanted to say that I found this forum very helpful with information, others experiences etc. So thanks for all that. I would like to add that as many members here are blessed also, but my wife is so awesome in understanding and caring. Bless her.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by garyi Welcome....and happy birthday! Get on the phone with your hospital's records and/or pathology department and insist they scan you your pathology report. Then call your surgeon and instruct her or her staff to send your slides to Dr. Epstein at Johns Hopkins for a second pathology opinion. A T4, if you heard her correctly, is not to be taken lightly. Good luck! I am sure that is what I heard. But my doctor has assured that I am 100% cancer free based on the surgery and her examination of the area during surgery. But yes I did just call them and request all that info to make sure I heard it correctly. By the way your profile picture. I started my USAF career working as a Radar Tech on F-4 C/D aircraft.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by Michael F Hi USA2PHILS! Welcome to \"The Good Side\" of radical prostatectomy! Glad that it is behind you and you are now in recovery mode. Re Incontinence: For most, it takes about 3 months to get back to about 90% \"normal.\" Maintain the Kegel regimen recommended by your URO Surgeon. The progress will be gradual but it does get better! Be sure to do lots of daily walking as able. Increase the frequency, pace and duration as your recovery progresses. When is your next follow up appointment with your URO Surgeon? Start a list of questions to ask when she reviews your Pathology Report. Basically ask: - \"What do these findings mean? - \"What, if any, are the implications for additional treatment?\" - \"How frequently should I monitor my PSA moving forward?\" For now simply stay focussed on your recovery. Work at it but do NOT overdo it! Keep asking questions and keep us updated! MF My follow up is March 28th. But I have requested copies of my pathology via mail or email. So hope to have that information soon.",
