      "Content": "Thanks All for the encouragement and suggestions. I am hopeful that it is something as simple as an infection on top of BPH, but I am also prepared for something more serious. I hope to get the results of my MRI scan next week and we will take it from there. If there is something suspicious then I may look at the options for paying for a targeted biopsy as the TRUS biopsy is clearly not going to do it. I will let you know what happens next. Thanks Alan",

      "Content": "Hi, I have been reading everything I can on PSA velocity which says doubling in a year is bad, etc., but I can't find anything that discusses anything like my results so I wondered if anyone on here has had similar results. Following 9 years of urination problems and numerous visits to the doctors, in April my GP suggested a PSA blood test. He had carried out a DRE which he said was normal, but given the length of time my problems had been going on for thought it would be a good idea. My results came back as 8.9 so he referred me to a urologist who also conducted a DRE and suggested a biopsy which I had in June. I had a TRUS guided 12 core biopsy and the results were negative but there was high grade PIN in one core so the urologist arranged a follow up PSA test and telephone consult for October. My prostate was enlarged at 54cm so I was diagnosed as BPH and put on Tamsulosin for the urination issues. I had my second PSA test in September and was given the results early October in a telephone consult with the urologist. He informed me that my PSA had increased to 14.7 and he arranged an MRI scan to see what the problem was. He didn't seem very concerned by the spike and said there was nothing to worry about as my biopsy was negative, but he never suggested any reasons for the rapid increase. I was having another blood test a couple of weeks later for another matter and requested my PSA be re-tested in case the last test was a mistake and this one came back at 15.0, so gone up again. I had my MRI last week and I am now just awaiting the results, but it all seems to be taking a long time with sense of urgency. I am obviously quite worried, but no one else appears to be. Has anyone else seen a jump of 70% in their PSA in 6 months and is it likely to be indicative or an aggressive cancer or more likely to be prostatitis or some other issue?

      "Content": "Well after a two month wait I finally got my results of the MRI scan today, but only after I called the consultants secretary for the 5th time. Turns out a letter was sent out last Monday, but to the wrong address (sent it to my GP not me), anyway he read it out to me. All it says is that there was nothing of concern on the scan but that he still wants to keep an eye on me so he is arranging a follow up telephone consult for 6 moths time. No explanation/speculation as to the possible cause of my seriously elevated PSA, no further investigation planned, not even a repeat PSA test. I have said that I am not happy with that and I am not prepared to wait 6 months with a PSA of 15.0, so he is asking the consultant to give me a call this week or next. I will ask for a Free/Total %age PSA test as a minimum. It could be the issue is prostatitis but I think an increase of 6.1 in 6 months should at least get some further investigation",
