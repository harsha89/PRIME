      "Content": "It looks like i'm joining your club ... First, want to thank Replicant, ThatBiopsy..., Fairwind and all of the other posters who've educated me over the last few white knuckle days. I'm reading Walsh, setting up appointments and getting to the bottom of the situtation. Feel like i already know many of you. Right now trying to arrange medical insurance so that i can go out of state to U Mich cancer center instead of my regular small town hospital. Making appointments for next week ... I'm sure i'll have lots of questions as they come up ... first is insurance details, then getting ready for first appointments with specialist, biopsy, etc. ----------------- 2006 PSA 'normal' 6/9/2012 PSA 36.3 6/22/2012 PSA 31.2 age 49 Dx",

      "Content": "Update: Met with local Urologist today and had DRE and biopsy. (Note: good thing I called ahead and bugged the staff to prep for biopsy, get Cipro prescription, etc. Otherwise, it would have been put off again.) DRE found large nodule on right side; ... For biopsy, he took 12 samples, plus 2 samples on the right side seminal vesicle. biopsy results in three days. Insides feel like he plucked guitar strings with pliers, even with novacaine. Thanks for giving me hope ... 2006 PSA 1.1 6/9/2012 PSA 36.3 6/22/2012 PSA 31.2 (retest) 7/2/2012 DRE one nodule, right side biopsy ... waiting for results Age Dx 49",

      "Content": "yes, I'm scheduled for consult with my 'local' hometown Urologist on Monday (took three weeks to get the appointment and then they tried to reschedule/postpone already) -- problem is that my local urologist and insurance is a $500 plane ride away. Got to call them and make sure they understand that they'll be doing biopsy Monday too, not another three weeks. The U Mich specialists are down the street from my work -- much easier to deal with them during the week. One way or the other, got to get the biopsy next week. Yes, provisional membership for now ... we can only pray and hope. Thanks for the hope you all give me.",
