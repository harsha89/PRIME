      "Content": "I don't think the GP conduct a DRE ill ask later to confirm. I know that it could be an infection or something other than PC, however it is worrying that the PSA is at 43...which seems very very risky. I read that PSA over 20 means that it is unlikely it will be BPH and my dads PSA is twice that amount. I havn't read any cases yet where the PSA is over 40 and is minor. Regarding his urination problems, he had blood in his urine i think a while after his biopsy...went to the specialist and he said it was normal that could happen and not to worry. Yep the urologist performed it. I'm trying to be optimistic but also preparing for the worst case scenario at the same time. I'll keep you guys posted. Cheers!",

      "Content": "Hi thanks for your reply. It's been about 3 months i think from his last test. The result is definately 43, i looked at the sheet. I'm not sure if she did a DRE... she felt around his testical region though and he said it hurt, ill ask him tomorrow. Also not sure if he has an enlarged prostate but hoping that something like that caused elevation in PSA and not cancer. I wish your dad well too. Cheers!",

      "Content": "Hi Guys I'm very worried that my dad might have prostate cancer. His latest blood tests revealed a PSA of 43, his 3 previous tests revealed a PSA of 3,3.2 and 3.6. The specialist told him to have a biopsy when the PSA was 3.6 which he did...they took 10 samples but couldn't find anything. During this past few weeks he has been sick (fever/flu) and in the last few days he has had some irritation in the testical region...couldn't feel any lumps though. He took a blood test last week and got the results today of PSA of 43. He is booked in next week to have and ultra sound, then from there the GP said she will look at the results and give him a referral back to the specialist. The specialist had previously said that he had a 20% chance of having prostate cancer at 3.6...now it is at 43 is more than 11 times that number. My dad is in his low 50s, he doesn't smoke or drink alchohol and goes for little runs on the treadmill a few times a week. Can anyone shed some light on the situation? I know nothing is for certain but what do you think the likelyhood is and if some what treatment option would be the best way? Also how fast can the cancer spread to different parts of the body? He does go for regular blood check ups so if he does have it i hope it is at an early stage and curable. I've been reading some links that a PSA of over 40 could mean that the cancer may have spread to other parts of the body Any help would be greatly appreciated. Cheers! (I live in Australia by the way) David",
