      "Content": "Hi Harding, I believe you're making this issue a lot more complex than it probably is. (That's the good news.) You have a G6 which is in your favor. G6 rarely metastasizes and is generally VERY slow growing. You also don't seem to have a history of high PSA. You indicate that your treatment choice is IMRT. Be aware that radiation keeps doing it's thing for some time after the end of your sessions. Occasionally, this can be as much as 2 or 3 YEARS. The only confusing part is that using the combination of radiation and ADT, while augmenting the effects of the radiation really doesn't give a direct answer as to how effective the radiation is. In other words, the ADT will almost always lower your PSA to zero by itself even in the presence of metastatic disease. Radiation will not. Bottom line: If disease is confined to the prostate then radiation alone should eventually drop the PSA to <0.1. With the addition of ADT during the early phase, you MAY be seeing the results of the ADT and not the radiation. You would be well advised to talk this over with your Rad. Onc. Best of luck! --- Dave",

      "Content": "Putt, This information was provided to me by my own radiation oncologist regarding my own case. He wanted to be as sure as possible that the radiation was truly 'killing' the tumor cells. I is common knowledge that ADT does not kill but merely controls cell proliferation for an indefinite period of time. In my case, my PSA is consistently dropping and that can be directly attributed to the radiation. If it should rise in the future, We still have the option of ADT. I personally believe that a lot of guys begin ADT too early and therefore lose a valuable weapon when the disease becomes refractory.",

My doc simply said that he wanted to avoid ADT so that if the PSA went down, we would know it was due to the radiation and not at least partially due to ADT suppression. Bear in mind, I'm sharing this information as it was given to me. As a total layman it is of course possible that I misunderstood. I hope not! Cheers! --- Dave",

In general, there is no empirical evidence that any supplement will have a curative effect on existing PCa. This particular product also may negatively interact with a number of common drugs, sometimes with potentially serious side effects. I highly recommend that you discuss this with your doctor before experimenting with it. Best of luck!",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by Robnj Hi Guys, PSA has gone from 11.42 Jan. 2017 to what it is now 132.02 June 2017. Was on Xtandi for a few years, went to Zytiga which did absolutely nothing. Have been on double Degarelix shots to get Testosterone down. Which it did get it down into 20's but seems too little too late on that. Started Xofigo in March. Have done 4 shots of that...no real problems. Anyway, my oncologist would like me to stop the Xofigo, and start Taxotere immediately. I'm inclined to do the 2 more shots of Xofigo, and see where we are at that point. I didn't expect the Xofigo to drop my PSA (of course I was hoping), but I did expect it to control it somewhat. I just don't like the idea of stopping in mid stream. I have been able to keep my prostate cancer known to only my close friends & family. My physical appearance has not changed in 5 1/2 years of some form of ADT. I never wanted to be defined by my illness. Of course, once I start Taxotere and my hair falls away.....the cat is out of the bag. I know it's in my future, but would like to stay away from it as long as possible. My Onc has no other options according to her. Any input would be welcome..... Thanks guys Hi Robnj, Are you dealing an RO or an MO? I would suggest an MO at this point for sure. Have you had a bone scan yet? I can't advise you on the meds but it sounds like you're not being offered the full range of options. Keep us posted. --- Dave",

      "Content": "Hi Harding, I believe you're making this issue a lot more complex than it probably is. (That's the good news.) You have a G6 which is in your favor. G6 rarely metastasizes and is generally VERY slow growing. You also don't seem to have a history of high PSA. You indicate that your treatment choice is IMRT. Be aware that radiation keeps doing it's thing for some time after the end of your sessions. Occasionally, this can be as much as 2 or 3 YEARS. The only confusing part is that using the combination of radiation and ADT, while augmenting the effects of the radiation really doesn't give a direct answer as to how effective the radiation is. In other words, the ADT will almost always lower your PSA to zero by itself even in the presence of metastatic disease. Radiation will not. Bottom line: If disease is confined to the prostate then radiation alone should eventually drop the PSA to <0.1. With the addition of ADT during the early phase, you MAY be seeing the results of the ADT and not the radiation. You would be well advised to talk this over with your Rad. Onc. Best of luck! --- Dave",

His statement was: \"We're fairly sure you're PSA is due to the positive margins. If we treat with just IMRT and your PSA goes down, then we KNOW we've got it. If it doesn't, we have an issue elsewhere, i.e. microscopic spread. If we use ADT at this time, we won't know for sure if the margins were the cause or not because the ADT will bring down the PSA in any case.\"",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by Robnj Hi Guys, PSA has gone from 11.42 Jan. 2017 to what it is now 132.02 June 2017. Was on Xtandi for a few years, went to Zytiga which did absolutely nothing. Have been on double Degarelix shots to get Testosterone down. Which it did get it down into 20's but seems too little too late on that. Started Xofigo in March. Have done 4 shots of that...no real problems. Anyway, my oncologist would like me to stop the Xofigo, and start Taxotere immediately. I'm inclined to do the 2 more shots of Xofigo, and see where we are at that point. I didn't expect the Xofigo to drop my PSA (of course I was hoping), but I did expect it to control it somewhat. I just don't like the idea of stopping in mid stream. I have been able to keep my prostate cancer known to only my close friends & family. My physical appearance has not changed in 5 1/2 years of some form of ADT. I never wanted to be defined by my illness. Of course, once I start Taxotere and my hair falls away.....the cat is out of the bag. I know it's in my future, but would like to stay away from it as long as possible. My Onc has no other options according to her. Any input would be welcome..... Thanks guys Hi Robnj, Are you dealing an RO or an MO? I would suggest an MO at this point for sure. Have you had a bone scan yet? I can't advise you on the meds but it sounds like you're not being offered the full range of options. Keep us posted. --- Dave",

In general, there is no empirical evidence that any supplement will have a curative effect on existing PCa. This particular product also may negatively interact with a number of common drugs, sometimes with potentially serious side effects. I highly recommend that you discuss this with your doctor before experimenting with it. Best of luck!",

      "Content": "Putt, This information was provided to me by my own radiation oncologist regarding my own case. He wanted to be as sure as possible that the radiation was truly 'killing' the tumor cells. I is common knowledge that ADT does not kill but merely controls cell proliferation for an indefinite period of time. In my case, my PSA is consistently dropping and that can be directly attributed to the radiation. If it should rise in the future, We still have the option of ADT. I personally believe that a lot of guys begin ADT too early and therefore lose a valuable weapon when the disease becomes refractory.",

      "Content": "Hi newporter, You are correct! To me, it seems sort of like a medical paradox. It is well established that ADT does make cancer cells more susceptible to the effects of radiation. My doc simply said that he wanted to avoid ADT so that if the PSA went down, we would know it was due to the radiation and not at least partially due to ADT suppression. Bear in mind, I'm sharing this information as it was given to me. As a total layman it is of course possible that I misunderstood. I hope not! Cheers! --- Dave",

      "Content": "Hello Tiger, So sorry you need to be here. We all understand your concerns. Could you provide us with his post-op PSA? A G 3+4= 7 is mildly aggressive as as opposed to an 8,9 or 10. The fact that your doctor is comfortable waiting 4 months before radiation suggests that he is still shooting for a cure. This is a case where you really need to ask direct questions of him. Keep in mind that, although metastatic/systemic disease is generally thought to be incurable, this is not always the case. If the only spread is ACTUALLY contained in the pelvic area, it is possible that whole pelvic radiation will result in a cure. Also, keep in mind that there is a difference between the terms \"chronic\" and \"terminal\". They are not the same. If he does need ADT, the disease will become chronic, with the real possibility of one or more remissions. Your husband is VERY young but with careful management, he could have MANY good years ahead These are all points that you need to cover with your doctor. I wish you the best of luck! --- Dave",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by LL Fauntleroy Just back from the consult with the urology oncologist. This facility offers RRP and EBRT & seeds. He basically said surgery is my best option, however, I had 8 cores positive both sides, plus the largest involvement in the apex and base, not good for being completely contained, T1C staging(for now) which is why I am told by others, that radiation would be the best approach...So, the RO and the surgeon are completely at both ends of the spectrum.. Is there an unbiased physician or service that one can go to for help in deciding which treatment is best, based on personal stats? The detail about the surgery was sobering, especially with the apex involvement, urinary sphincter, cutting the urethra, possible nerve and lymph node removal.... Fauntleroy I don't understand how you can be staged as T1c with positive cores on BOTH sides. That would be a T2c or greater. (See link: http://prostatecancer101.org/staging.html) The main issue here is that every case is different. The outcome is based more on (1) how advanced the disease is at diagnoses and (2) the experience and skill of the treatment provider. These facts are well established in the medical community. Unfortunately, doctors cannot make the decision for you, mainly due to liability issues. All things being equal, recent studies clearly show there is little difference between the top three standard treatments (Surgery, Brachytherapy & Ext.Radiation) in the same situation. I'm sure the others will have more input on this. Best of luck! --- Dave",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by ASAdvocate I would suggest that you request a PHI blood test. It includes psa, free psa, a marker for prostate cancer activity, and a formula to provide a score of the liklihood of a biopsy finding prostate cancer. It is less sensitive to benign prostatitis spikes than just psa. There are some infection risks with biopsies, and a PHI test can help determine if one is really necessary. The blood must be drawn before any rectal exam, and the urologist should know that. Hi dth32, The advice ASA just gave you was excellent! Before his post, I had not heard of the PHI test. After a little research, it made a whole lot of sense to me. If I were in your shoes, that would be my first move, ASAP! Cheers and best of luck! --- Dave",

I had laproscopic hernia surgery 8 years ago which was more pain than I expected but I recovered quickly (running again after 2 weeks). My only concern is the catheter part which gives me willies.....Wish me luck next month and thanks for sharing your experiences. Bob Hi Bob and welcome to the forum, This is a common concern for many men. Please rest assured it is more of a nuisance than anything else. You will not be awake when they place the catheter and you may not even be aware of its presence until you start moving around. After that, it is simply more of an inconvenience than anything else. When it is time to remove it, the removal may be done either by your provider or yourself. The little water balloon in your bladder is deflated and the catheter will slide right out. No pain. The most important thing to remember to keep the genital area and especially the area where the tubing enters the penis extremely clean. You will be instructed on proper catheter care before you are discharged. I hope this helps to allay some of your fears. Cheers! --- Dave",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by Big_Bob Gentleman: I'm new here and was diagnosed in April 2017. After considering my options, I've elected to go with the DaVinci Surgery next month. I had laproscopic hernia surgery 8 years ago which was more pain than I expected but I recovered quickly (running again after 2 weeks). My only concern is the catheter part which gives me willies.....Wish me luck next month and thanks for sharing your experiences. Bob Hi Bob and welcome to the forum, This is a common concern for many men. Please rest assured it is more of a nuisance than anything else. You will not be awake when they place the catheter and you may not even be aware of its presence until you start moving around. After that, it is simply more of an inconvenience than anything else. When it is time to remove it, the removal may be done either by your provider or yourself. The little water balloon in your bladder is deflated and the catheter will slide right out. No pain. The most important thing to remember to keep the genital area and especially the area where the tubing enters the penis extremely clean. You will be instructed on proper catheter care before you are discharged. I hope this helps to allay some of your fears. Cheers! --- Dave",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by LL Fauntleroy Just back from the consult with the urology oncologist. This facility offers RRP and EBRT & seeds. He basically said surgery is my best option, however, I had 8 cores positive both sides, plus the largest involvement in the apex and base, not good for being completely contained, T1C staging(for now) which is why I am told by others, that radiation would be the best approach...So, the RO and the surgeon are completely at both ends of the spectrum.. Is there an unbiased physician or service that one can go to for help in deciding which treatment is best, based on personal stats? The detail about the surgery was sobering, especially with the apex involvement, urinary sphincter, cutting the urethra, possible nerve and lymph node removal.... Fauntleroy I don't understand how you can be staged as T1c with positive cores on BOTH sides. That would be a T2c or greater. (See link: http://prostatecancer101.org/staging.html) The main issue here is that every case is different. The outcome is based more on (1) how advanced the disease is at diagnoses and (2) the experience and skill of the treatment provider. These facts are well established in the medical community. Unfortunately, doctors cannot make the decision for you, mainly due to liability issues. All things being equal, recent studies clearly show there is little difference between the top three standard treatments (Surgery, Brachytherapy & Ext.Radiation) in the same situation. I'm sure the others will have more input on this. Best of luck! --- Dave",

      "Content": "Hi Chief, Your situation sounds very similar to mine. The damn bladder/urethral spasms kept on for the duration of the time on the catheter! Royal pain but nothing to worry about. Definitely try to avoid things that irritate the urinary tract such as coffee, tea , alcohol etc. As to the drain, I assume you have a Jackson-Pratt as I did. They are necessary to prevent fluid buildup such as blood, pus or other fluids. They are very commonly used and need only to be kept clean. I was in the hospital for 3 days and the drain was removed before I was discharged. The little puncture where the drain is will heal rapidly after removal. And yes, a good wife IS a Godsend. I know mine is. Keep her as they are few and far between nowadays! Best of luck! --- Dave",

The rapid rise in PSA plus the low free PSA coupled with your age and the rapid increase in size of your prostate unfortunately smacks pf early PCa. Now the good news: If you have to have cancer, PCa is the one to have. You have acted early and, assuming you are in reasonably decent health otherwise, you can probably expect to see at least 80 years, possibly more with the current treatments. There is also the possibility of a full cure and your biopsy results will help us make more informed comments. Keep us in the loop regarding your treatment choices (assuming you DO become a member).

I think the doctor was surprised too. He is to go back in 6 weeks for another check. Does this happen? -- Where the pathology is really bad, but the PSA is 0.00? We appreciate any feedback. Thank you. Hi Fred, Sure it happens. That's the way it's SUPPOSED to go. Your path report really isn't that bad. From a layman's perspective, unless you were pre-treated with some form of HT, you're probably good to go. Best of luck! --- Dave",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by Walt_Green not to pic nits here, but the OP did Watchful Wait, not Active Surveillance. there is a very big difference! Unless I read it incorrectly, he went 2 years (perhaps 3?) in between biopsies, and only had PSA's every 6 months. IIRC, AS requires yearly biopsies as well as PSA tests every three months. As for the OP, I would recommend a he get second opinion on the G8 scoring. His PSA is *extremely* low for his age. Even if scaled back to a G7a or 7b, he should still treat, of course. But, there's a world of difference between G7a/b or G8. For those quick to criticize WW/AS, the OP has had three years of normal life. His scans are negative. Even if he has to treat now, he's LOST NOTHING. on the other hand, he has gained THREE YEARS OF NORMAL LIFE. Given his age, his WW was a smart play. He's lost nothing, only gained. Walt, As you can see here, there is currently no clear definition of either one. It just depends on what the physician chooses to call it. Either way, they both carry inherent risks. http://www.cancer.org/cancer/prostat...tchful-waiting",

I was diagnosed with 3+3 in August 2012, tracking PSA religiously, every three to four months at two different places to avoid false readings. One Prolaris Test, low risk of 2%. Two Oncotype DX tests, low risk. Two subsequent biopsied from first Bx showed G6s. PSA gradually rose from 3.2 to 5.3, brought that up with my uro but my uro just said PSA was not the best indication. Last Bx on 05/05/2017, one G9, one G8, one G7, two G6s. I think the first three biopsied missed the G9, genomic tests gave me false sense of security, they are only as good as the samples tested. All biopsies were T3MRI fused, two at USC and two at UCLA. MRI never picked up this G9 or G8 spots. I thought that the 3TMRI would pick up aggressive type of PCa but apparently not. The G9 spot was from the systematic 12 samples not from the targeted spots pointed by the MRI. It is not a good idea to be PSA tested at different labs because the assays they use are often different. You need to be sure the assays are exactly the same.",

      "Content": "Hi Warren, Truth be told, it is likely that we will have to approve your membership. The rapid rise in PSA plus the low free PSA coupled with your age and the rapid increase in size of your prostate unfortunately smacks pf early PCa. Now the good news: If you have to have cancer, PCa is the one to have. You have acted early and, assuming you are in reasonably decent health otherwise, you can probably expect to see at least 80 years, possibly more with the current treatments. There is also the possibility of a full cure and your biopsy results will help us make more informed comments. Keep us in the loop regarding your treatment choices (assuming you DO become a member).

      "Content": "Originally Posted by Walt_Green not to pic nits here, but the OP did Watchful Wait, not Active Surveillance. there is a very big difference! Unless I read it incorrectly, he went 2 years (perhaps 3?) in between biopsies, and only had PSA's every 6 months. IIRC, AS requires yearly biopsies as well as PSA tests every three months. As for the OP, I would recommend a he get second opinion on the G8 scoring. His PSA is *extremely* low for his age. Even if scaled back to a G7a or 7b, he should still treat, of course. But, there's a world of difference between G7a/b or G8. For those quick to criticize WW/AS, the OP has had three years of normal life. His scans are negative. Even if he has to treat now, he's LOST NOTHING. on the other hand, he has gained THREE YEARS OF NORMAL LIFE. Given his age, his WW was a smart play. He's lost nothing, only gained. Walt, As you can see here, there is currently no clear definition of either one. It just depends on what the physician chooses to call it. Either way, they both carry inherent risks. http://www.cancer.org/cancer/prostat...tchful-waiting",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by gurley43 I started my prostate cancer awareness completely by chance with a urinary track exam in 2010 and decided to have biopsies. Can't remember any thoughts or concerns about cancer at that time and the biopsy was recommended as precautionary due to my age. Had the 12 part test and 2 cells of the 12 came back with slow growth non aggressive results. First urologist said remove the prostate now. 2nd said with my results and low PSA recommended the watchful wait. In the 2010 time frame my pas was 1.6. PSA test have been conducted every 6 months. All around 2 with little change. 2 months ago I had the second biopsy and 2 cells came back active one with a gleason score of 8 and my PSA rose to 2.6, still fairly low. But with the gleason score I know something should be done. I just cant seem to come to a conclusion on what would be best. I will be 70 in Oct and am healthy and enjoy a good life with my children who live close by and my wife of 33 years. Of course, I want to live as long as possible but I worry about the side effects of the various treatments. Any thoughts on my situation would be appreciated. I wanted to mention too that I had a bone scan and complete MRI and both came back favorable with no cancer detection beyond the prostrate. Hi gurley 43, So sorry you need to be here! This is a classic example of the drawbacks of AS. Sometimes you can get away with it and sometimes you can't. In any case, waiting for a prolonged period of time with ANY active cancer is playing 'Russian Roulette' with your future. With G8 disease, I suggest that you consider either surgery or radiation with curative intent if your medical team feels that the disease is still confined. G8 can be quite aggressive so this is not the time to wait around pondering options. You already did that. Assuming the disease really is totally confined to the gland, you may still have a good chance of a cure. You are young enough to make this course of action reasonable. You need to meet with your medical team and treat this aggressively. Best of luck!",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by Rich S So was having a bit of a problem with urination, burning, weak flow, up every hour or so at night. At 56 I figured it was just part of getting older and was looking at a swollen prostate and perhaps a urinary tract infection. Doc says no problem, you have kidney stones. drink lots of water and things will be cool. Two weeks later and no improvement so back to the same practice, different doctor who rushes me off for lab work.....

I retire in four weeks, sometimes life really sucks Hi Rich! Welcome to the board and so sorry you may join us. Based on my own experience, you MAY have a little pinkish tinge now and then even after two or three weeks. Everyone is different. My own urologist/surgeon warner me about that. Try not to let that add to your existing worries. As to the #2, I am making the assumption that you either are or were on a short course of antibiotics. This is standard procedure. If you took the meds as instructed, there is little or no risk in having regular bowel movements. Thousands upon thousands of prostatic biopsies are done every year and morbidity is EXTREMELY low! Here's hoping you don't need to join us! Best of luck! --- Dave",

Try to accept the fact that your condition is what it is. We are all the same here in that regard. You are probably never going to die from prostate cancer but you may very well kill yourself due to stress alone! I know what it's like to obsess. I am a lifelong OCD sufferer. Give yourself a break. Try to forget the cancer until they tell you to worry, which may never happen. All the best! --- Dave",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by Rich S So was having a bit of a problem with urination, burning, weak flow, up every hour or so at night. At 56 I figured it was just part of getting older and was looking at a swollen prostate and perhaps a urinary tract infection. Doc says no problem, you have kidney stones. drink lots of water and things will be cool. Two weeks later and no improvement so back to the same practice, different doctor who rushes me off for lab work..... PSA = 180.8 The dreaded finger showed a hard lumpy prostate that really had no feeling when poked and prodded which seemed to really concern the urologist so it was immediately off for a needle biopsy. Not a pleasant process to have 16 holes punched in that part of the world but much to my surprise I did make it through. The Doc was somewhat vague in his answers (or more likely I was too rattled to listen) so I bring these questions to this forum for a answer from those that know firsthand. (1) My biopsy was yesterday morning, how long should I expect the blood in the urine to continue? It is not a huge amount but it is quite disturbing to see.... (2)I am somewhat concerned about \"doing # 2\" in light of all the punctures that were made during the biopsy, do I need to be? Thanks in advance... Oh and real irony...... I retire in four weeks, sometimes life really sucks Hi Rich! Welcome to the board and so sorry you may join us. Based on my own experience, you MAY have a little pinkish tinge now and then even after two or three weeks. Everyone is different. My own urologist/surgeon warner me about that. Try not to let that add to your existing worries. As to the #2, I am making the assumption that you either are or were on a short course of antibiotics. This is standard procedure. If you took the meds as instructed, there is little or no risk in having regular bowel movements. Thousands upon thousands of prostatic biopsies are done every year and morbidity is EXTREMELY low! Here's hoping you don't need to join us! Best of luck! --- Dave",

This was after (months later) I had prostate surgery..Uro did a scope job (Cystoscope) and found a small bladder stone obstructing and irritating my urethra..He was able to remove the stone with an attachment on the 'scope and that was that..Catheter was removed the next day and no more problems... I would think a careful Cystoscope examination by an expert urologist would be able to find the source of your Dad's problem..... Hi Fairwind! Did your Uro actually run the 'scope through the cath or did he remove and then re-insert? Probably a REALLY dumb question!",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by Derkie54 As you can see from my stats Gleason 4+3=7 & high PSA's. Next week having MRI and bone scans so I have not got any treatment plan yet. Reading the posts some of you have treatment over long periods such as \" external beam radiation, 5 weeks, 15 minutes a day, five days a week \" Is it normal to try and carry on working through all this or is it too much. What can I expect ? Hi Derkie, All cases are different however I can give you my own experience, so far. I am being treated for post-surgical positive margins. The technology is IMRT and the dose is 80gy over 7 weeks delivered to the prostatic fossa. I am on session #26 (I think) out of 35. So far, I am experiencing both urinary AND bowel urgency and frequency however both are fairly mild and more of an annoyance than a real problem. My best advise to you if you go this route is to take off work if possible. You may find yourself needing to be close to a restroom most of the time for a while so whether that is a practical option would depend on the kind of work that you do. Hope this was helpful. --- Dave",

My RO hasn't seen the latest report yet. He DID however see the previous test and said basically the same thing the uro said. I guess my MAIN concern is the doubling time. According to the Sloan Kettering nomogram, it appears to be around three months! If correct, that aint good, fellas!",

      "Content": "Hi all! My name is Dave. I'm a 59 year old, semi-retired maintenance mechanic and professional grandpa. I'm also a brand new prostate cancer patient. I was diagnosed with stage pT2c carcinoma on my Mother's birthday, June 19th, 2012, two days after Father's Day. (Nice Father's Day present!) Lol! I have a wonderful wife of 22 years and a 30 year old son from a previous marriage. He is a staff sergeant and an F-16 mechanic in the USAF. He and his wife recently brought my brand new granddaughter into the world. It's been nearly 3 months and reality of the diagnosis is still sinking in. I'm still sort of numb! Am I going to live to see my granddaughter grow up? Will I see her get married. Am I asking too much? I still have a constant tension in my stomach. I tend to obsess over things that may or may not ever happen. I'm sure you guys have NEVER heard THAT before. Oddly, the diagnoses didn't come as a surprise as the disease killed my father at 63 and his brother in his early 70s. I was just hoping to get lucky and somehow avoid it. No luck! I underwent surgery (Open RRP) on July 16th and things seem to be going well so far. I get my first post-op DRE and PSA in about two weeks. My urologist says the only thing that worries him is the positive margins. I worry that it just couldn't be that easy. These forums seem to be very well run and informative. Sorry about the rambling intro! I am not normally the type to make a nuisance of myself and I would be very pleased to be accepted into \"The Club\".",

      "Content": "Hi all, Just got results of first post-op PSA. Came back at 0.4. I now have an appointment this Wednesday for a consult with a radiation oncologist. Does anyone have experience with the Calypso System? Looks like that may be what will be used. Any comments on \"clean-up radiation\" for positive margins? Is it effective in your experience? I won't have much more information till Wednesday. --- Cheers!",

      "Content": "Hi all! My name is Dave. I'm a 59 year old, semi-retired maintenance mechanic and professional grandpa. I'm also a brand new prostate cancer patient. I was diagnosed with stage pT2c carcinoma on my Mother's birthday, June 19th, 2012, two days after Father's Day. (Nice Father's Day present!) Lol! I have a wonderful wife of 22 years and a 30 year old son from a previous marriage. He is a staff sergeant and an F-16 mechanic in the USAF. He and his wife recently brought my brand new granddaughter into the world. It's been nearly 3 months and reality of the diagnosis is still sinking in. I'm still sort of numb! Am I going to live to see my granddaughter grow up? Will I see her get married. Am I asking too much? I still have a constant tension in my stomach. I tend to obsess over things that may or may not ever happen. I'm sure you guys have NEVER heard THAT before. Oddly, the diagnoses didn't come as a surprise as the disease killed my father at 63 and his brother in his early 70s. I was just hoping to get lucky and somehow avoid it. No luck! I underwent surgery (Open RRP) on July 16th and things seem to be going well so far. I get my first post-op DRE and PSA in about two weeks. My urologist says the only thing that worries him is the positive margins. I worry that it just couldn't be that easy. These forums seem to be very well run and informative. Sorry about the rambling intro! I am not normally the type to make a nuisance of myself and I would be very pleased to be accepted into \"The Club\".",

First of all, your prostate weight of 20 grams is perfectly normal. Second, at least according to your biopsy report, you likely have a g6 which is a minimal threat to your life despite the 5 out of 6 positive cores on the right. Even with extracapsular extension, g6 has a well-documented reputation for NOT metastasizing. Actually, I would trade my stats for yours any day! My personal advice would be to sit back, take a deep breath, have a nice drink, follow your provider's advice and stop relying on Dr. Google. Best of luck!",

      "Content": "Hi Ron, I have absolutely NO business giving out advice as I am not only a newbie to this forum but also a newbie to PCa, as well! That being said, I defer to the guys here with FAR more experience than I. I am responding to your post because your case seems extremely similar to mine. I also lost my father to PCa at age 63 and I fully understand what you are going through right now. I also had \"a firmness\" on the right side that even my PCP couldn't feel. I was TOTALLY asymptomatic at biopsy. If your urologist has recommended biopsy, please DO IT! It is sometimes uncomfortable but not painful. (If I can get through it, ANYBODY can!) You will here scare stories on Dr. Google. Most are GREATLY exaggerated! More like a \"minor pain in the ass\". Your doubling time of 15 months is favorable, as opposed to 3-6-9 months. The longer, the better according to my research. As far as the DRE raising your PSA, yes, it is possible, but here I defer to those with more experience. Above all, DO NOT PANIC! I realize that statement alone will do nothing to allay your immediate fears but understand that, based on the information you currently have, if you DO have PCa, you are most likely getting it at an early stage with an excellent chance of cure.

      "Content": "Originally Posted by newporter Kazzie61, In addition to what HighlandCFH said, another important point is to ask him about going forward plans. With aggressive cases, one should prepare for the worst but hope for the best. Hopefully everything will work out for him but ask his urologist about his views on adjuvant vs salvage radiation and if he recommend going ahead with adjuvant, would he also recommend adding hormone therapy prior/during/after adjuvant radiation. There were studies that indicated for very high risk cases, adjuvant radiation plus hormone offers better odds of getting rid of the cancer. Also ask him for a referral to a radiation oncologist and/or an oncologist for a second opinion consult. Best of luck to you and your husband. They may want to be proactive with the Rad Onc. as to the the availability/wait time for a LINAC if he DOES need radiation. They seem to be in short supply in the UK and he will want to act quickly.",

That being said, I defer to the guys here with FAR more experience than I. I am responding to your post because your case seems extremely similar to mine. I also lost my father to PCa at age 63 and I fully understand what you are going through right now. I also had \"a firmness\" on the right side that even my PCP couldn't feel. I was TOTALLY asymptomatic at biopsy. If your urologist has recommended biopsy, please DO IT! It is sometimes uncomfortable but not painful. (If I can get through it, ANYBODY can!) You will here scare stories on Dr. Google. Most are GREATLY exaggerated! More like a \"minor pain in the ass\". Your doubling time of 15 months is favorable, as opposed to 3-6-9 months. The longer, the better according to my research. As far as the DRE raising your PSA, yes, it is possible, but here I defer to those with more experience. Above all, DO NOT PANIC! I realize that statement alone will do nothing to allay your immediate fears but understand that, based on the information you currently have, if you DO have PCa, you are most likely getting it at an early stage with an excellent chance of cure.

      "Content": "Hi Ron, I have absolutely NO business giving out advice as I am not only a newbie to this forum but also a newbie to PCa, as well! That being said, I defer to the guys here with FAR more experience than I. I am responding to your post because your case seems extremely similar to mine. I also lost my father to PCa at age 63 and I fully understand what you are going through right now. I also had \"a firmness\" on the right side that even my PCP couldn't feel. I was TOTALLY asymptomatic at biopsy. If your urologist has recommended biopsy, please DO IT! It is sometimes uncomfortable but not painful. (If I can get through it, ANYBODY can!) You will here scare stories on Dr. Google. Most are GREATLY exaggerated! More like a \"minor pain in the ass\". Your doubling time of 15 months is favorable, as opposed to 3-6-9 months. The longer, the better according to my research. As far as the DRE raising your PSA, yes, it is possible, but here I defer to those with more experience. Above all, DO NOT PANIC! I realize that statement alone will do nothing to allay your immediate fears but understand that, based on the information you currently have, if you DO have PCa, you are most likely getting it at an early stage with an excellent chance of cure. Please keep in touch! --- Dave",

      "Content": "Hi!, I can certainly understand your situation! I'm basically in the same boat, but probably quite a bit worse. In 2012, I had a radical prostatectomy followed by radiation for positive margins. 3 years later, I find myself with radiation induced cystitis and uncontrollable incontinence. Because of this, I'm seriously considering looking into the same thing you are. I wish I could offer you some sound, concrete advice both on the procedure in the device itself but because I'm looking into it for the first time myself, that will be difficult. I'm planning on following this thread and will post when I get any kind of new information. You indicate that you have mild incontinence which is gradually getting worse. In my situation, I am literally confined to diapers and if I walk around the urine just comes out as it's produced, I have no sphincter control. Do keep in mind that this is open, abdominal surgery although it's considered quite safe. However, from what I read, it is generally considered as a last resort. My advice is to do your homework as best you can, discuss this with your medical team and go with what you feel is going to fit your lifestyle in the long run. I have been away from this board for quite a long time and I'm just getting back on board. I wish you the very best of luck with this and I'm looking forward to see progress updates. Cheers!",

My question is he has developed what we believe to be a Hernia where the laparoscopic hole is where the take out the prostate. We see our surgeon in two we but have been told to see a general surgeon. Can these hernias be repaired laparoscopically or do they do an open surgery. Does anyone know the medical term for this particular hernia. Thank. If it IS a hernia, it's an incisional hernia. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incisional_hernia",

      "Content": "Hi Guarnera, This is precisely what makes this disease so frustrating. The fact is, at the end of the day, how long you live, with or without active disease is directly proportional to how well and for how long you respond favorably to various treatment options. This is why your oncologist was \"kind of slippery\" in her response. Stats are confusing, even to them! There are also lots of unanswered questions such as how can a G6 succumb in a year or two when a G10 might live 20+ years! These are extreme cases, of course but they can still happen. The end result of all this is worry and frustration on the part of the patient who has little or no control over the situation. All this being said, the good news, (and there is some) is that if you MUST have cancer, PCa is the one to have and now is the time to have it. --- Dave",

You don't say what you've been taking but there are a number out there that are well known to do that. The most common one is probably saw palmetto which is commonly used to reduce the symptoms pf BPH. Based on the time frame and your G scores, I highly doubt that you've waited too long however, bear in mind your cancer IS NOT being cured by a holistic approach. I think you've made a wise choice as far as treatment. Just stay healthy with a balanced diet and plenty of exercise and I'm sure you'll be around a LONG time. Best of luck! --- Dave",

You don't say what you've been taking but there are a number out there that are well known to do that. The most common one is probably saw palmetto which is commonly used to reduce the symptoms pf BPH. Based on the time frame and your G scores, I highly doubt that you've waited too long however, bear in mind your cancer IS NOT being cured by a holistic approach. I think you've made a wise choice as far as treatment. Just stay healthy with a balanced diet and plenty of exercise and I'm sure you'll be around a LONG time. Best of luck! --- Dave",

Around noon we were told the surgeon would be delayed about an hour, so I sent my wife home. I remember they finally wheeled me into the OR at 2PM. Next thing I remember was being wheeled into a room where my wife was waiting at 6PM. The day finally ended after 8PM with the Dr inserting a Foley cath. What happened in the meantime? I suspect that I was \"out\" much longer than expected. I do remember someone telling me \"you don't remember because of the drugs we gave you\". Well if such drugs exist then I want some NOW because my head keeps going back to that day. Today I had my first followup. The Foley was out briefly, then went back in for another week. I'm still pretty beat up but am gradually returning to normal. I have to keep reminding myself that I am doing this not to be pad free but so I can start radiation before the cancer spreads any further. Looking forward to rejoining the group here... Hi Rob! Sorry to hear about the experience with Mr. Foley! Mine was installed while I was still out...fortunately! Was this done here or in the UK?

You still continue to have them just as before for the rest of your life. They do that as an extra margin of safety.",

I just had my blood drawn yesterday and now I am sitting here on pins and needles waiting for the dreaded phone call, or lack thereof. Actually, I really don't want to hear about it because in this particular case no news is good news! If they haven't called me by Wednesday evening, it's probably safe to say that I'm good for another 3 months. Keep your fingers crossed for me. I really don't want to leave the 'Zero Club' so soon! The next post will be with the result. Cheers!",

      "Content": "Hi Gary, Yeah, I realize that and stated so in the message. The primary info on the radiation/bleeding thing was from my own RO during my initial consultation with him. According to him, radiation damage is not tissue specific. It can and does damage all healthy tissue as well as malignant tissue. It just does more damage to cancer cells because of their increased rate of mitosis. Normal tissue can usually repair itself. In the course of the healing process, both normal and abnormal tissues sometimes become more fragile and subject to things like spontaneous bleeding, etc. In this case, he was referring to the bladder and urethra and especially the suture line between the two which might not be fully healed at the time of irradiation. As I previously mentioned, my brother in law STILL has occasional light bleeding during urination nearly 10 years out! In any case, if properly treated, I have no doubt that you'll do fine!

      "Content": "Hi gfr1n51, If your current PSA is <0.1 it is unlikely that you have any prostate tissue or tumor recurrence. Regarding the bleeding, sometimes a little blood can seem like a great deal, depending on the situation. Bleeding after radiation therapy is quite common and can occur MANY years after the fact. 49 treatments is tough on delicate tissues. If you haven't already done so, you may want to run this issue by your radiation oncologist for his or her input. Good luck & good health! --- Dave",

Hi BigT, You don't mention whether your radiation was adjuvant or your primary therapy. I strongly suspect that you had an episode of AFIB (atrial fibrillation) which is extremely common after abdominal or thoracic surgery. If radiation was your primary treatment, then your AFIB was most likely due to something else. The symptoms you describe (other than lack of energy) are typical of AFIB. I am curious to know if you doctor prescribed any medications for it and if so, what they were. Lastly, can you please tell us exactly what type of radiotherapy you had? Best of luck!",

But I don't like the waistband that is usually made too tight on that style, so I stretch out the waistband overnight around the mouth of a bucket or trash can before wearing. Rob, Are you talking so-called 'whitie-tighties or a real thong?

If you Know you have cancer, it would be a HUGE mistake to wait, even with a low PSA. You need to evaluate this based more on your doubling time and PSA velocity. If you have a doubling time under a year, you need to act on this, ASAP. Best of luck! --- Dave",

Are you having any bleeding? Did your Doc mention how much and what part of your colon was involved? This is, unfortunately, quite common especially in men who fail to retain a full bladder during treatments. Six months isn't very far out and you should probably consider a relatively bland diet, at least for another six months. Good luck with this! --- Dave",

I ask because a G6 is usually somewhat indolent and it would be quite a surprise if it had spread, especially given your low PSA. Did you actually have an actual prostate biopsy? It seems unusual to have a LN biopsy without a full prostate workup. Stay with us and we'll see what others have to say. Cheers!",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by blank newporter I know that Walsh give the number 300 in the most recent edition of his book but the studies I have seen were talking \"1000\" as the number. I wonder what Walsh would say about these studies given the import on patients? blank, I think you're going to find that, like most other stats, these can be confusing. They are only meant as guidelines and are relative to the baseline skills that the surgeon already has. I personally feel that we get too obsessed with specific numbers, the same way we tend to become obsessed with a \"famous\" doctor, simply because we have seen his stats. It all boils down to the fact that one surgeon may be gifted and extremely prolific at 300 operations while another may take thousands to get it right. Some may never become skilled. This NOT the same as the training minimums that institutions choose to impose on their surgical staff. Those minimums can vary widely for many different reasons and, as far as I know, there is still no formal standardization for training. I feel, as some others here do, that you're far better off if you can get access to your prospective surgeon's actual track record plus input from medical staff that have had at least a few years working with him/her. Just my two cents. --- Dave",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by Steve2017 My urologist phoned me today with the biopsy results from last week. He said it showed 4 positive areas for PC, up from 1 area found in 2014. My last PSA was 3.4. My primary care physician said the DRE I had in 2014 was what found PC initially even though my PSA was in the high normal range. The current biopsy indicated the same Gleason 6 3+3. My uro said he is not immediately concerned and I could remain on active surveillance or opt to have it removed or radiated. He said they could probably spare nerves on one side and possibly more. I have an appointment next month with him. I told him I am not interested in radiation. My prostate size increased in size from 40 to 50s gram. I'm actually fine with this but will probably be joining the prostate removal club and then, hopefully the zero club. I want to avoid the probability of having to catheterize every time I have to urinate as I grow older. My urologist is at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, Boston. I met him once for an evaluation and then the second time when he did the biopsy. So, I don\u2019t have a history with this doctor but when asked, he said he has done 500 robotic surgeries. I haven\u2019t had an opportunity yet to ask how many he has done last week. My main concern is being incontinent. I value any suggestions and any knowledge about robotic surgery at Beth Israel. Age 67 Father, 2 brothers had PC Hi Steve, Please don't take this the wrong way as it is, after all, your life. What I can't seem to get my head around is the fact that you waited three years before taking any action. I DO understand your concerns but what makes you think you would have to catheterize every day? At worst, you might have to wear pads but I have never heard of daily catheterization due to or as a consequence of prostate cancer treatment. I know, everyone seems to subscribe to the idea that G6 cells do not mutate or spread yet I remain skeptical in that regard. Either way, I wish you the very best of luck regardless of the mode of treatment (if any) you ultimately choose. Cheers! --- Dave",

      "Content": "Hey brownie, Sorry you need to be here but welcome! Would you mind sharing where you have had all your treatments? Have you had any other treatments besides the proposed ADT. I ask because a G6 is usually somewhat indolent and it would be quite a surprise if it had spread, especially given your low PSA. Did you actually have an actual prostate biopsy? It seems unusual to have a LN biopsy without a full prostate workup. Stay with us and we'll see what others have to say. Cheers!",

Unfortunately, I found them again when I learned I had cancer. The problem docs seem to have with Atkins and prostate cancer is the extremely high fat content. I was at 65%! If I read his post correctly, this gentleman was consuming five dozen eggs a day plus meat and cheese!

      "Content": "Originally Posted by Kazike About 2 years ago I was treated with radiation for prostate cancer. My PSA has been stable since, but I have been having pain in the pelvic area. It feels like having a ball or obstacle between the legs. I am not able to seat for work for a couple of hours. Most of the time I work standing in front of my PC. For the first 1.5 years the pain was not constant and moderate. Lately the pain is permanent, feeling a burning sensation after weak up in the morning, seating is impossible. Anybody having similar experience? Any recommendations? Thank all for your advice. Hi, I can't say for sure what your issue is but I CAN tell you that I developed radiation induced cystitis 3 years after 35 sessions of IMRT. The radiation wound up burning my bladder resulting in hypervascularization and bleeding. This usually means a trip to the ER for catheterization and continuous bladder irrigation. This is usually not pleasant. Are you passing any blood in your urine? This might be a question to pose to your urologist just to get his input. For the record, I also developed radiation induced proctitis as a result of this. The IMRT was adjuvant therapy for positive margins and the bitch of the thing is my PSA is STILL slowly rising. The reason I commented on this is because of the similarity of the symptoms. I wish you the best of luck with this but I will not kid you. You may be stuck with this for a long time, if not for life. Radiation is the gift that keeps on giving. --- Dave",

      "Content": "Hi all, Well, in a couple of weeks I get my second Lupron injection! I've been on bicalutamide and leuprolide for almost six months now. No noticeable side effects other than a little fatigue and mental fogginess. Hard to differentiate from my normal self. LOL! I'll get a PSA and a baseline testosterone in a week or so to see if any progress has been made since last June when the PSA was 9.3. I'm still totally asymptomatic, thank goodness! I guess that's a good sign. Interestingly, my bladder bleeding stopped a week after I started bicalutamide and has never recurred. Weird! Glad to say I'm able to get out and about more now, despite the diuretics and diapers. (I am a man of constant peeing) Here's to all my forum brothers and sisters. Stay strong and keep the faith!",

Even before I started the radiation, I was experiencing frequent pain in the testicles. Wondering if any of you have experienced this. Forgive me for being direct but the sensation is very similar to being a teenage guy with a case of the \"Blue Balls\"! I am not sexually active...yet, as nothing works. Any ideas? --- Dave",

      "Content": "Hi all, Well, in a couple of weeks I get my second Lupron injection! I've been on bicalutamide and leuprolide for almost six months now. No noticeable side effects other than a little fatigue and mental fogginess. Hard to differentiate from my normal self. LOL! I'll get a PSA and a baseline testosterone in a week or so to see if any progress has been made since last June when the PSA was 9.3. I'm still totally asymptomatic, thank goodness! I guess that's a good sign. Interestingly, my bladder bleeding stopped a week after I started bicalutamide and has never recurred. Weird! Glad to say I'm able to get out and about more now, despite the diuretics and diapers. (I am a man of constant peeing) Here's to all my forum brothers and sisters. Stay strong and keep the faith!",

I am almost certainly going to need both Casodex and Lupron within the next few months as my PSA is soaring and my current health insurance ends January 1st with no renewal option. I'm hearing that Lupron runs at least $2,000/dose and that's what my wife and I get for social security every month. I now have other medical issues that basically make me 100% disabled so I can no longer work. I can make very small monthly payments but that's about it. I'm looking for a bit of education from people who have actually been in this position. I just don't feel ready to lay down and die! --- Dave",

I just found out about the generic equivalents for Lupron and Casodex. That was a big relief! As far as hospital and provider charges go, I'm glad to say that so far, we are holding our own thanks to debt forgiveness on their part. The big issue right now is finding new insurance that I can afford. Here in Arizona, I have only one choice through the AHA and that company only offers four plans. I'll report back when I get some of my ducks in a row. -- Dave",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by rooster22 From my experience.........lube the tip of the catheter at the end of your Johnson. You can even pull out the catheter tube about a quarter inch or so. When pulled out, lube the tube, then push it back inside your Johnson to better lube yourself. That is far better then just lubbing the very tip of your Johnson. Any time you feel a need, lube the catheter as much and as often as you like. If you change catheter bags, I found it far better to use the small travel bag during all waking hours. I wore shorts, so the catheter empty control valve would just barely stick out the bottom of the shorts. This made it very easy to empty urine, and a lot easier then carrying a bucket around the neighborhood. I did both approaches, and found the small bag much easier to manage. When transferring from small bag to large bag, I found it easier to do so in the bath tub. Any urine spills were much easier to clean up in the bath tub, as opposed to bathroom hard wood floor or carpet. If you are sleeping in a bed alone as I do, I found it better to lay the catheter collection bag on the bed beside me. I used a rubberized mattress cover, so any urine spill would not soak into the mattress. I never had a spill, and found the extra length of the drain tube gave me much more freedom to lay different ways in bed, particularly being able to sleep on my side. I used extra pillows placed on both sides of my body to keep from rolling over or around too much in the bed. Overall this is a much better experience, then hooking the collection bag to the side of the bed rail, or laying it on the floor. It does not allow much body movement in bed. I had to wear a Foley catheter for a total of 21 days over two episodes, so during that time, I had plenty of time to experiment to see what wearing improvements I could find to make Foley catheter life just a little better and easier. Hope some of these ideas help you and others. Get well soon...........Rooster Great advice from all, as usual. Just a caution on sleeping with the night bag on the bed with you. If you don't have the bag lower than your bladder, it is possible to either roll over on the bag or have the contents siphon back into your bladder by gravity. Either way, it can set you up with a UTI. Been there, done it! Best of luck!",

For me, I am scheduled to have an injection from a nurse at Mayo Clinic in October (better be a female nurse!!). I don't know what erectile agent will be used, but I'm guessing it will probably be Trimix. Haven't had any luck with Cialis and none so far with Viagra. So hopefully an injection will work for me. Thanks, Chuck Hopefully, not only will your nurse be female, but gorgeous as well! Behave yourself! I got my first lupron shot a couple of days ago and the PA was a \"walking, talking aphrodisiac\"!

Seems to not be that complicated. http://www.healthcentral.com/drdean/408/81106.html My favorite line... \"How you reach the prostate, of course, is up to you\" ( Is there more than one route?) First of all: that article was posted a decade ago! Second: Dean Edell is an ophthalmologist so where he gets his expertise on rectal exams is beyond me. Third, As I stated before, there is NO WAY that an individual can perform his own DRE correctly, primarily due to obvious anatomical restrictions. Fourth: Even if it WAS physically possible to do an adaquate exam on yourself, the average Joe is unlikely to have the training and experience to interpret the findings with any accuracy. Even some otherwise competent physicians don't do them as well as they should! For what it's worth, around the time that was published, there was also a popular rumor that women could do their own PAP smears. That one also bit the dust for many of the same reasons!",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by bigalcalbisque Please look at my Biopsy results on my profile. I am currently in a state of semi-confusion in regards to what direction to take (Prostate Removal Or Radiation) Have had a consultation with both Urologist and Radiologist. Neither one was trying to sell me on their remedies. So I don't feel any pressure in that regard. My #1 major concern would be what will help me live the longest. I have been married for 36 years and basically don't have a sexual relationship. We are more like Partners/ Great Friends. If I need to release the pressure valve I take the situation in hand. So all sarcasm aside. It's not a priority even though it would be nice to have the \"ability\" in case things change. its a 2 on my scale. Having an occasional leakage problem would also be a #2 on my scale. I like to fish, so casting and getting a little leakage wouldn't be an issue, even though my heartless buddies would capitalize on it if they saw a wet spot on my Levi's (Sarcasm). Rectal incontinence would be a 9 or 10 on my scale for obvious reasons. I do have Moderate Diverticulosis and have it totally under control with my diet, no flare-ups in a year and a half. Not sure the implications of that on my final decision. Both my Urologist and my Radiologist are letting me take a fishing trip with my buddies Sept 11-16-2017 before any procedures, so I am assuming that is an indication of the seriousness or lack of seriousness of my situation. However I want to decide on my direction before that and set up the appropriate appointments. Also, would you recommend any scans on my bones or other areas before I proceed? Comments would be greatly appreciated. Thank you everyone for your support! Al Hi bigalcalbisque, Love your description of yourself, you sound just like me! Based on your posted stats, you could probably go either way with with your choice of treatment with equally good results. That being said, as you are a 4+3 vs a 3+4, you might want to consider surgery as opposed to radiation because with surgery, you will have the added benefit of knowing precisely what your tumor status was which you will not have with radiation. A 4+3 can be significantly more aggressive than a 3+4 and the pathologist will upgrade or downgrade based on the cut samples. This is much more accurate than a biopsy alone. Best of luck! --- Dave",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by robpar Hello all, It has been some time since I last participated in the forum here. I was laid off five to six months ago, and since then I have been trying to focus my efforts in securing a new position since then. During this time I could not follow up with my PCP or my urologist. Fortunately, I finally secured a new position and received health benefits for my family and I. I had an physical exam with my PCP, and he mentioned to me my PSA is 4.9, and last year it was 4.7 before the fusion biopsy I had. I had a scheduled appointment with my urologist and I let him know my PSA just taken. I have not heard back from him, but I guess he will let me know what to do next. I do hope everyone I corresponded with is doing well, and do hope I can hear back from you guys. Looking forward to hearing from everyone. See you soon! RobP Hi Rob and welcome back! Life gets in the way sometimes. Keep us posted.",

However, if untreated, it is possible that they might contribute to it years down the road. His G7 (4+3) is moderately aggressive and adjuvant radiation to the prostatic fossa (bed) is commonly used in cases like this with excellent results and generally few side affects. In fact, I'm currently going through it myself. I AM curious about why they decided to include hormone therapy along with the radiation with such a low PSA. To me, it seems like overkill because hormone therapy in one of your \"big guns\" that you generally reserve for later, if and when you need it. In any case, I'm sure your father will have many more years to enjoy symptom free. Good luck! --- Dave",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by 35coupe Yea thanks lord, PSA 3.1 Doc said most likely high psa is due to prostate enlarged. Will do another one in 6 months. I did start talking a mens supplement for prostate health. I do not guess that would effect the psa level. 35coupe, What supplement are you taking? Some of them can and will reduce PSA values. Is your doctor a urologist? You should share with him/her ALL the OTC products you're taking!",

The values in the ultrasensitive assays fluctuate all the time and usually mean nothing. What we look for is an upward trend over time. If you look at your values, you will find that they ALL round off to 0.1 which is considered undetectable. In some labs, even 0.2 falls within that range. There is a HUGE amount of conflicting information out there which is extremely difficult for the average layman to sort through. I encourage you to speak with your medical team regarding this.

      "Content": "Originally Posted by HighlanderCFH It is a somber thought when realizing that the internal sphincter (in the bladder) is removed along with the urethra -- and the opening created by this process must be \"rebuilt\" down to the diameter of the reattached urethra. This is probably where some patients have continence problems and perhaps this is where some surgeons \"get away\" with doing a poor reconstruction job and thereby cause urination problems. Hi Chuck, It is my understanding that we actually have TWO urethral sphincters, an upper and a lower. The lower one is always removed however the upper, which is part of the bladder is only removed if there is evidence of disease in that area. The cut end of the urethra is simply sutured onto the upper sphincter. The urinary issues usually come into play due to scarring, shortening of the urethra itself and problems with the suture line at the bladder neck, e.g. scarring, leakage etc.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by HighlanderCFH It is a somber thought when realizing that the internal sphincter (in the bladder) is removed along with the urethra -- and the opening created by this process must be \"rebuilt\" down to the diameter of the reattached urethra. This is probably where some patients have continence problems and perhaps this is where some surgeons \"get away\" with doing a poor reconstruction job and thereby cause urination problems. Hi Chuck, It is my understanding that we actually have TWO urethral sphincters, an upper and a lower. The lower one is always removed however the upper, which is part of the bladder is only removed if there is evidence of disease in that area. The cut end of the urethra is simply sutured onto the upper sphincter. The urinary issues usually come into play due to scarring, shortening of the urethra itself and problems with the suture line at the bladder neck, e.g. scarring, leakage etc.",

      "Content": "Hi folks, This is the latest update since August, 2015. I really wish I could say all is well but that is not the case. Since the end of the IMRT treatments in 2012, everything has been ok in the sense that there have been no catastrophic issues to deal with. In July,2015, I began to notice blood spotting in my urine. Went to my primary Doc who thought it might just be a UTI. Things went well for a couple of weeks till one morning, I went to void my bladder and it was pure blood! In an effort to avoid writing a large book about what happened during the next year, I am going to just give the facts with short commentary. Turns out, I have radiation induced hemorrhagic cystitis. It appears that during treatment, the beam took a little more than intended and the bladder lining was essentially \"burned\". This resulted in the formation of new blood vessels in the bladder lining which are extremely delicate and tend to bleed if disturbed at all. This issue wound up requiring two separate surgeries, a week apart to control. Quite honestly, it was pure hell for awhile. I still have occasional spotting if the perineal area receives any significant pressure e.g. bike riding. To make matters worse, the cancer is back. PSA was fairly stable for nearly three years. My last test, around a month ago revealed that it doubled in three months. 0.8 to 1.8. Not good. If, in fact this is a true trend, we will probably start ADT in the form of Casodex first for a month or so and then begin Lupron. I am not looking forward to that! At this point, we do not know where the cancer is located and it is way too early for scans. Am I scared? I guess, a little bit but I have at least two other potentially life threatining conditions running concurrently and the cancer is the least formidable of them. Now, the answer to the big question. If I had to go through all of this again, would I change anything? Actually, very little. Please bear in mind that my case is somewhat atypical and most prostate cancer patients will never go through this nonsense. What I might do differently would be to use radiotherapy in the form of Brachytherapy (seeds). Surgery, in my case, was not curative and I was left 100% impotent as well as 100% urinary incontinent. With brachy, you don't have issues like positive margins which seems to be what got me. Most importantly, make sure you know and understand all your options when you are diagnosed. I moved far to quickly out of fear. Even if it is a highly aggressive tumor, it is not going to kill you today, or next week or even next month. Taking one's time, within reason, can avoid a lot of unwanted side effects. I honestly have no clue what my future holds. I just play it a day at a time. Cheers to all the members of our unique club! -- Dave Robbins",

The good news is that your PSA values are literally meaningless when taken in context. You are totally in the 'zero club' and there is no sign of a trend in either direction so trust your doctor on that. As far as the MO, they are usually not involved until the disease is systemic which yours is almost definitely not. So relax and enjoy life because you've got a lot of it yet to live.

      "Content": "Originally Posted by Gimmy Hi guys , doctor wants me on zytiga 250mg starting Monday .should I do it ? My son is going nuts over this up to now he's made all the right calls .but this zytiga seems to only be used for extending life for 2-5 months or there abouts. so he thinks if he says no he'll be killing me early and if he says yes then he's afraid I'll suffer more. There's too much going on for me to think straight........anyone else using it....Thanks Eugene Hi Eugene, Even though there is a lot going on in your life right now, you still have your own mind and your own wishes regarding your future. You need to pay attention to them. No one here can make the decision as to whether you SHOULD take a course of action regarding your illness. Neither can your family. Rich S is absolutely correct in that 2-5 months is not cut in stone. Whether you take this path is a matter of personal preference and you would probably do well to \"absolve\" your son of his perceived responsibility to you. Doing so might well make the remaining time you have together more rewarding for both of you. Something to consider. I can only imagine how difficult this is for you and I wish you the best outcome possible! Take care. --- Dave",

      "Content": "judway, Prostate 5LX is is just another saw palmetto product designed to be used for relief of benign conditions of the prostate. There is a sadly misunderstood notion out there that any treatment that reduces PSA is also treating the cancer. This is not the case. There is no empirical evidence out there that I am aware of that proves that such products do any more than relieve symptoms, mostly by relieving inflammation. PSA values are virtually useless when using such products. PS: That being said, I see you are using the ultra sensitive assay. Your last test translates to 0.9 from 0.2 back in 2006. This is an EXTREMELY slow rise. Always make sure you're using the same lab and the same assay for all testing. Also make sure there is no stimulation of the prostate e.g. DRE, sex of any kind, bike riding etc. within 48 hours of your exam. I feel confident in telling you that at this stage of your life, PCa is NOT an issue you need to dwell on. If you still have concerns, please talk to your Urologist. All the best!",

His expertise may very well be worth the price but I doubt that the majority of patients who could use that type of custom tailored attention could afford it. My understanding from what I read on his website is that follow-up appointments are around $800/hour, out of pocket. That puts him WELL out of the range of folks like me. Does he offer any kind of payment plan? Finally, I see by your signature that your PSA has been rising since January, 2012 and you are now at 110+. As a patient of Dr. Myers, what kind of action is he recommending in your case? Any info. you'd like to share would be helpful to all. Keep the faith Brother. We've all got your back!",

      "Content": "35coupe, I'm quite sure most of the others here will agree that the short answer is that PSA values are far and away more valuable AFTER the fact. The controversy is more about when or even whether to rely on it for initial diagnosis. Levels are hard to interpret and are a guide at best. If you have no prostate, or it has been killed by radiation, then you should have no PSA, period! I hope I haven't confused you. The long answer is a lot more complex! Cheers!",

      "Content": "Hi, The PSA tests are extremely accurate as long as you use the same assay/lab for each test. This is going to be important in your case because your numbers are so low. Generally, 'undetectable' is currently considered to be <0.1 using the standard test. Are you on other treatment protocols that might affect PSA such as hormone therapy? We can be of more help if you can provide your pre and post surgical stats. Salvage radiotherapy makes the assumption that at least a few malignant cells were missed at the time of surgery and are resident either in the prostatic fossa (bed) or the local lymph nodes or both. Based on your PSA, I would HIGHLY doubt that you have systemic disease however I am not qualified to speculate. If you DO have a recurrence, external beam radiotherapy has a very good track record. RT is NOT like it was a few decades ago. I AM qualified to say that as I just finished 35 IMRT treatments myself. It was a breeze! Keep in touch and good luck! --- Dave",

      "Content": "Hi Mark! I totally concur with Highlander's assessment. It's VERY important to remember that with any form of radiotherapy, the prostate takes a huge hit and is forever changed. The vascular system within it is also damaged which can result in vascular friability which can be extremely unpredictable. I speak from experience as I have a similar issue with my bladder known as Radiation Induced Hemorrhagic Cystitis. It occurred around three years after I was treated. Radiation is a wonderful tool against cancer but it is 'the gift that keeps on giving'. You will undoubtedly be fine but you may have to put up with this nuisance for the rest of your life. A small price for a cancer cure! Best of luck!",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by Pratoman So i finally go to speak with the Uro - first conversation since the biopsy (from my other thread you may know i got the good news that results were negative for cancer via email from the nurse). He told me that 1 sample (i think he took 14, at least thats how many of those little sample containers they wheeled in for the biopsy along with the tools) showed Hi Grade PIN. He explained that it used to be accepted that this was a precursor or hi predictor of future PC diagnosis, but that it is generally not so much universally accepted any more and they (he) believe that it is not necessarily a precursor. But he also said that there are doctors who will disagree. He suggested i not wait a year, retake PSA in 6 months. Well, that was definitive! Any thoughts? Hi Pratoman, From my own research, I believe he is giving you good advice. PIN, high grade or otherwise does not guarantee the subsequent development of cancer, however it is still generally thought to be a fairly reliable predictor. If I were you, I would trust his advice but I'd run the PSAs every three months instead of six. The test is simple and cheap so why not? Good luck! --- Dave",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by maxsmom Hi everyone, I'm new to these forums and I'm hoping someone can give me some piece of mind. My husband was diagnosed with prostate and bone cancer 2 years ago, and his initial PSA was somewhere in the high 20's, but he has been on Lupron as the treatment (he could not complete the chemo, but he did have radiation) and his PSA has always been .01. Now he is due for his next shot in 2 1/2 weeks, and his oncologist called and said his PSA is now .2. Is it starting to climb because the Lupron is almost due? Thank you for any help! Hi maxsmom, When your husband was diagnosed 2 years ago, was it prostate cancer w/bone involvement or did he present with both prostate and actual bone cancer (two different animals)? Can you provide any more information regarding his treatment?",

I too, have internal, bleeding hemorrhoids. As far as the burning, you don't want to go there! It does diminish fairly rapidly after treatment ceases though! Also, keep in mind that the size of the area being irradiated will affect the degree and intensity of side effects. My target area was just the prostatic fossa (bed) and that is quite small. If you had the whole pelvis irradiated, you could reasonably expect more issues. --- Dave",

      "Content": "Hi kinghorne, Welcome and sorry you need to be here! Because of the presence of G4 cells in your biopsy, you are probably not a good candidate for \"watchful waiting\" and/or \"active surveillance\". You will get numerous opinions as there is a great deal of collective experience here. Personally, I favor early surgery (the earlier the better) assuming you are in fairly good health in general. IMRT can also be a good option, especially nowadays but both can have significant side effects. Brachytherapy (seeds) are another option. It depends a lot on what your expectations regarding continence, sexual health etc. are. You need to have a long, face to face discussion with your urologist/surgeon regarding your options. From your stats, you appear to be getting on this quite early and most likely have an excellent chance at a long, healthy life. Good luck! --- Dave",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by wolfgang While the above is true, the Saw Palmetto does not reduce the PSA levels. I was taking high dose Saw Palmetto 1000 mg capsules for about 3 years and while my BPH symptoms were mild, my PSA level tripled in that period of time. It certainly shrunk the gland which was verified by the urologist who performed the first TRUS (unfortunately false negative) biopsies. I then realized it was about time to get saturation biopsy to detect the suspecting cancer in my prostate. Wolfgang, With a G9 cancer, I'm sure your PSA values would have been MUCH higher without the Saw Palmetto. It is common knowledge that it reduces inflammation and thereby PSA. That doesn't justify it's use in cases of suspected but yet unproven cases of Pca.",

He probably should bring this up to his medical team as there are many medications that can effectively remedy these symptoms. As to the fatigue, the radiation is probably the culprit here. I was VERY tired for no apparent reason around my 4th or 5th week. Rest assured it will pass when he finishes therapy. I'm sure folks with more experience with HT will offer their comments soon.

      "Content": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proton_therapy The types of treatments for which protons are used can be separated into two broad categories. The first are those for disease sites that favor the delivery of higher doses of radiation, i.e. dose escalation. In some instances dose escalation has been shown to achieve a higher probability of \"cure\" (i.e. local control) than conventional radiotherapy.[11] These include (but are not limited to) uveal melanoma (ocular tumors), skull base and paraspinal tumors (chondrosarcoma and chordoma), and unresectable sarcomas. In all these cases proton therapy achieves significant improvements in the probability of local control over conventional radiotherapy.[12][13][14] The second broad class are those treatments where the increased precision of proton therapy is used to reduce unwanted side effects, by limiting the dose to normal tissue. In these cases the tumor dose is the same as that used in conventional therapy, and thus there is no expectation of an increased probability of curing the disease. Instead, the emphasis is on the reduction of the integral dose to normal tissue, and thus a reduction of unwanted effects.[11] Two prominent examples are pediatric neoplasms (such as medulloblastoma) and prostate cancer. In the case of pediatric treatments there is convincing clinical data showing the advantage of sparing developing organs by using protons, and the resulting reduction of long term damage to the surviving child.[15][16] In the case of prostate cancer the issue is not so clear. Some published studies found a reduction in long term rectal and genitio-urinary damage when treating with protons rather than photons (also known as X-ray or gamma ray therapy). Others showed the difference is small, and limited to cases where the prostate is particularly close to certain anatomical structures.[17][18] The relatively small improvement found may be the result of inconsistent patient set-up and internal organ movement during treatment, which offsets most of the advantage due to increased precision.[18][19][19][20] One source suggests that dose errors around 20% can result from motion errors of just 2.5 mm,[citation needed] and another that prostate motion is between 5\u009610 mm.[21] However, the number of cases of prostate cancer diagnosed each year far exceeds those of the other diseases referred to above, and this has led some, but not all, facilities to devote a majority of their treatments slots to prostate treatments. For example two hospital facilities devote roughly 65%[22] and 50%[23] of their proton treatment capacity to prostate cancer, while a third devotes only 7.1%[24] Current overall world wide numbers are hard to compile, but one example in the literature shows that in 2003 roughly 26% of proton therapy treatments world wide were for prostate cancer.[25] Proton therapy for ocular (eye) tumors is a special case since this treatment requires only a comparatively low energy (about 70 MeV). Owing to this low energy requirement, some particle therapy centers only treat ocular tumors.[8] Proton, or more generally, hadron therapy of tissue close to the eye affords sophisticated methods to assess the alignment of the eye that can vary significantly from other patient position verification approaches in image guided particle therapy.[26] Position verification and correction have to ensure that sensitive tissue like the optic nerve is spared from the radiation in order to preserve the patient\u0092s vision. Comparison with other treatment options[edit source | editbeta] The issue of when, whether, and how best to apply this technology is controversial.[27][28][29] As of 2012 there have been no controlled trials to demonstrate that proton therapy yields improved survival, or other clinical outcomes (including impotence in prostate cancer) compared to other types of radiation therapy, although a 5-year study of prostate cancer is underway at Massachusetts General Hospital.[30][31][32][33][33] Proton therapy is far more expensive than conventional therapy.[28][34] Using current technology, proton therapy requires a very large capital investment (from $100M to more than $180M).[27][29][35] Preliminary results from a three-year 2009 study, including high dose treatments, show very few side effects.[36]",

This diet is the ONLY diet I've ever been on where I didn't feel miserable. You're right, properly done you don't feel hungry. I was curious...do you eat any fruit and roughly how many carbs do you usually eat in a day? Do you induce dietary ketosis?

      "Content": "35coupe, I'm quite sure most of the others here will agree that the short answer is that PSA values are far and away more valuable AFTER the fact. The controversy is more about when or even whether to rely on it for initial diagnosis. Levels are hard to interpret and are a guide at best. If you have no prostate, or it has been killed by radiation, then you should have no PSA, period! I hope I haven't confused you. The long answer is a lot more complex! Cheers!",

      "Content": "Hi mickcee, I'm not commenting on the nosebleeds without knowing what medicines you take, what climate you live in and your general health as a whole. As far as adjuvant/salvage radiation goes, I can speak from experience. I your case, you would doubtless be receiving a course of IMRT (Intensity Modulated Radiation Therapy). Nowadays, radiation is MUCH more accurate than even a decade ago. The number of weeks and the total dose will depend on your specific needs. I had 35 treatments over 7 weeks for a total dose of 80 Gy. Side effects were almost non-existent until around the 5th week when I started experiencing significant fatigue. Toward the end of treatment, I was having what I would call, \"minor\" urinary and fecal incontinence more from urgency than anything else. Now, several months after the last treatment, I STILL have bouts of diarrhea and fecal urgency. They are much improved over what they were but there is a chance I will have to live with at least a certain degree of this. A lot of it depends on the experience and skill of your RO in developing your personal treatment plan. Your treatment team should be meeting with you at least weekly to evaluate your progress and side effects. Best of luck! --- Dave",

      "Content": "Guys, This is a great thread because it speaks of a way of coping that many cancer patients may deny. Being almost totally preoccupied with your state of health is not only normal but necessary. We can and must be our own advocates. We should not be concerned with a preoccupation with 'me'. Our health becomes our full-time job and the more we have wrong with us, the more difficult it becomes. My comment here is in total support of the previous posts in this thread because it accurately reflects my own case. It was very comforting to see that others go through exactly the same thing.

He wants to start with a full body bone scan which I will have on the 8th. Based on those results, we will then look into more sophisticated imaging. He is a little frustrated because, as always, he has to go \"toe to toe\" with the insurance to get this stuff authorized. If the bone scan is positive, we will initiate ADT. Casodex followed by Lupron. If it is negative, we will have to make the decision of whether to start ADT anyway or to watch the PSA a little longer. I imagine this is where the MO comes in. I flat out forgot to ask him if he felt it was time to bring one in! The options that Michael F mentioned regarding more types of scans are all on the table as far as he is concerned. it is just a matter of getting them paid for. So until I know more, I'll just join Brother Prato in some bourbon and a Xanax. Cheers!",

Hi Fairwind & MM Fortunately, My RO provided me with the names of two of what he claims are two of the best MOs in Phoenix. I hope he's right! They are even on my insurance! I believe he said they were major players in the 'SWOG' studies. I now believe I did make a mistake out of ignorance by not agreeing to ADT before radiation. I will be able to act on your advice within two weeks. Thank you both and keep the faith, Brothers!",

      "Content": "Hi all and thanks for the great input! Just got done with the uro appt. He spent a lot of time with us and was encouraging but he agreed it is time to act. He wants to start with a full body bone scan which I will have on the 8th. Based on those results, we will then look into more sophisticated imaging. He is a little frustrated because, as always, he has to go \"toe to toe\" with the insurance to get this stuff authorized. If the bone scan is positive, we will initiate ADT. Casodex followed by Lupron. If it is negative, we will have to make the decision of whether to start ADT anyway or to watch the PSA a little longer. I imagine this is where the MO comes in. I flat out forgot to ask him if he felt it was time to bring one in! The options that Michael F mentioned regarding more types of scans are all on the table as far as he is concerned. it is just a matter of getting them paid for. So until I know more, I'll just join Brother Prato in some bourbon and a Xanax. Cheers!",

      "Content": "Wow! You and I seem to have a lot in common. I feel like I'm reading my own story. Back to you. Obviously, I can't diagnose you but I will say that it really sounds like your bladder is not emptying completely. Did your doc mention whether it was empty when he scoped it? I have similar issue but MUCH less severe and that's what my doc and I chalked it up to...so far. Try to establish an association between the onset of these symptoms three months ago and any change in meds, health, environment or anything else you may consider significant. I realize that my response is a little ambiguous but there are a LOT of things that can cause this. At this point, I would be looking into the medications you're taking and possibly discussing it with a competent pharmacist. Explain that physical/mechanical causes seem to have been ruled out. I really hope you get this resolved soon. Good luck! --- Dave PS: Of course, you could always up the dose of Makers Mark. I'll have one with ya!",

Also, do you remember your original stats, Gleason grade, stage, etc.? The others here can be much more insightful if you can provide that information. Keep us poster.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by FeatherBoy Welcome. Sorry you need to be here! Are you quite sure about the PSA values? Those scores ( 147/103) are VERY high. Are you sure there isn't a decimal missing? Were the G7s 3+4 or 4+3? It the PSA values ARE correct, your husband most likely has at least some metastatic spread. If that is the case, surgery would most likely be ruled out as an option. The stage somewhat surprises me also. I would STRONGLY recommend that you make an appointment with a competent medical oncologist as soon as possible to discuss the possibility of starting hormone therapy (ADT). Please check your stats and give us an update. Best of luck! Hello, I unintentionally gave you totally unsolicited advice last night and I apologize. I was not paying attention and thought your post was the original in this thread. Apparently it is not possible to delete one's own posts on this forum so that's why it's still there. I may be an idiot but at least I have good intentions!",

Unfortunately, it matters. We need to know as much information about your case as possible to give an educated answer. Others will chip in so don't panic. A quick estimate of your PSA velocity suggests you are not in immediate danger. Good luck!",

It is really designed to replace condoms, but maybe has some value for guys with minimal incontinence like me. I slightly squirt, or loose a few drops of urine upon sneezing or coughing, especially when I am tired. I sent an email to jiftip, and they said it would work for minor incontinence like mine. I agree, it probably would work, but guys pee far more then have orgasms, so maybe not so practical. Still, it may have some practical incontinence use. Regardless, it is a novel approach for birth control, and std control. Who would ever have thought of creating a product like this?? http://www.jiftip.com/ http://www.jiftip.com/blog/the-promise Probably someone with a duct tape fetish.",

There also seems to be an overwhelming majority that agrees exercise should be an integral part of everyone's regiment to fight our common enemy PC. We all know testosterone feeds PC. To my question....can starting a moderate exercise program induce enough additional testosterone production to effect any residual cancer after treatment to the point it would cause a PSA \"bounce\" ? I think that's a great question...for your medical team.",

He had radiation and casodex and has now been on Lupron shots every 4 months. Been doing really good until recently. Got a shot in May. His PSA and testosterone levels barely readable. But in the last couple of weeks he has become extremely tired and says he very achy. He is working but it is a desk job. He comes home and is falling asleep by 7:30ish. I am worried. Should he get his levels rechecked Hi Carol, So sorry that you guys need to be here but you came to the right place. Do you think you could provide as many of his stats as possible? The folks on the forum will be able to give much better insight with them. More kind folks will be chiming in shortly. Cheers!",

Nowadays, whether the degree is an MD, (doctor of medicine) or a DO (doctor of osteopathy) is really not that important as long as they trained at a reputable school. The training of a DO is almost identical to an MD except that the DO usually involves additional training over and above the standard curriculum. What IS important is that, either way, the person you see is an experienced, board certified urologist/surgeon. They have the training in that field that others do not. That's all they do. Hope that helps! PS: For what it's worth, my own PCP for many years now is a DO.",

Go for the cure, not the sex life. G9 is a BAD cancer. No HDT at this point as it will mask the results of the radiation. This should be discussed with your surgeon.

      "Content": "Originally Posted by Derkie54 Lancepease - Yes I am from the UK Anyone who has been through this. Is the radiation treatment normally successful and if it does not eliminate all of the PC is it just a case of doing it again ? Hi Derkie, I have just finished 35 IMRT treatments for positive margins. According to my RO, success is usually 60%-75%. If it fails to eradicate the tumor it cannot be done again in the same area. My concern in your case is the concurrent HT. According to my RO, if you do hormones along with radiotherapy, you will never know for sure that the radiation is working because the HT will very likely lower your PSA dramatically, effectively masking the effects of the radiation. Remember, radiation can potentially cure. HT cannot. I have no idea if that is generally the case or not but I think it's well worth asking your medical team about before you begin HT! Good luck! --- Dave",
