No more Lupron ? Our oncologist is recommending Lupron injections every 3 months (for life) with 6 courses of chemo (Taxotere) now.

      "Content": "Originally Posted by Jovena Appreciate if you can advise: 1) Will he be taking 6 courses of Taxotere (3 weekly interval) ? 2) Is his Lupron injections supposed to be every 3 months ? 2nd injection is suppose to be on 6/10/16. No more Lupron ? Our oncologist is recommending Lupron injections every 3 months (for life) with 6 courses of chemo (Taxotere) now. The chemo must start before the second Lupron injection on 8/16/16 to get full benefits (Chaarted Trial). My dad is already \"struggling\" with his \"Total Androgen Blockage\" (Casodex & Lupron) plus back pain (also taking Gabapentin). Not keen at all to take on more toxic loads. Very nice of you to feedback. Kindly keep us further updated. Wishing your dad all the best. Hi all - I am new to the forum and am also interested in advice/reply to Jovena's above query owing to a similar condition for a loved one. Hope you could assist to advise, maryanddan, if you're able to - many thanks in advance. My sincere best wishes go out to your dad Jovena and your hubby maryanddan.",
