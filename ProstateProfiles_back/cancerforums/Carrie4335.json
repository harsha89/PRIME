      "Content": "Hi NavyChief. It sounds like the surgery went well. I pray the pain stays at bay and that you have a speedy recovery. My husband's biggest complaint was the catheter too. Lucky for him it was taken out yesterday. Let us know how you're doing in the days ahead. Best regards, Carrie",

      "Content": "Hi Everyone. This is kind of a silly question and I am very prone to worry -- just call me Ms. Worry Wart. Anyhow, my husband had robotic prostatectomy surgery last Wednesday (the 12th) and is at home recovering. We got the final pathology report yesterday after meeting with the doctor and he confirmed that the cancer was confined to his prostate and that the margins and lymph nodes were negative. We also recevied a call from the Pathologist stating the same thing. The thing that is worrying me is that after the GREAT news I was reading over the pathology report and noticed where it said margins and lymph nodes that it stated \"not identified\" instead of \"negative.\" I called the office back and the nurse pretty much told me that \"not identified\" means pretty much the same thing as being negative -- that there was no cancer identified in the lymph nodes or margins. She said she could have them do an addendum on the paper work if I'd like and I told her yes. I don't know why but this is driving me crazy. I wanted the final pathology report to state that the cancer was negative in his margins and lymph nodes and not \"not identified.\" I guess what I am looking for is confirmation that \"not identified\" is the same thing as \"negative.\" I know I must sound crazy but I've been very anal about my husband's health and care, especially since the day we found out he had PCa. Many thanks in advance... - Carrie",
