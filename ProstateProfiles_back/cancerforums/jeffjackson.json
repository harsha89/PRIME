      "Content": "Eight months out and I'm happy to report my PSA is still undetectable. Incontinence is largely under control with only minor stress leakage. I still do fell like I have to go often, but that is also slowly beginning to get better. I have opted to wait on any potential radiation treatments. I don't want to try to fix what I cannot confirm is broken. Still 100% ED with only very minor signs of life. Still, minor signs are a plus for me. My surgery was nerve sparing on one side but had to go wide on the other side. No meds have been effective so far, so I'm about to commit to trying injections.

      "Content": "I'm now 2 months past my RALP (12/29/17) and I'm happy to report my first post-surgery PSA level is undetectable. I'm scheduled for another follow-up and PSA test in 3 months. I guess that will be the norm for a while. Recovery is going about like I expected. Kudos to my doctor for laying it out as it would be. The days of \"sitting of a pine cone\" pain are mostly behind me now. Incontinence is only a minor issue. I use 2 small pads each day, and they are mostly always dry. I have good stream control and only have some minor problems finishing. Sometimes it is like normal (i.e. pre-surgery) and occasionally I may find myself going for 4-5 minutes (stream, stop, drip, drip, drip, squirt, stream, ... repeat). Sound familiar? I've also been going very frequently although cutting out caffeine and a Mybetriq prescription has begun to help. There is only a little movement on the ED front. Regular pill and pump therapy seem to be getting a little life back into the old fella. That's OK. I'm patient and my wife is extremely supportive and understanding. My doctor said to expect a dry orgasm. I'm looking forward to that because it is urine right now. I've read that will diminish or go away as healing continues. I had an consultation with a radiation oncologist about possible follow-up radiation therapy. Right now I'm in a holding pattern as the healing continues, but my inclination is to not do radiation. The RO said I basically had a year to decide without any adverse side effects. In fact, when asked, he said he would not undergo follow-on radiation himself unless the PAS became detectable. He also noted his radiation protocol would not be any different regardless of the PSA status. So, my thought is why go through that unless needed. I understand the short-term side effects may not be bad, but I don't really want any long term side effects. If it's not broke then don't fix it is my current philosophy. Otherwise life is good....I expect for many years!!!",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by Southsider Good luck on your surgery- but one question. Are you having it during the holiday week because of insurance reasons? I didn't think they would want to ordinarily schedule an operation like this that could wait a week or two during the last week of December. I would have thought that most of the staff was off, and those remaining would be dealing with emergency situations. Thanks. I actually put off the surgery for about 6 weeks and set it after Christmas so my kids normally away at school could be there. My surgeon said he only took off Christmas Day and would be doing surgery and seeing patients all this week so I took advantage of the timing.",

      "Content": "I'm now day 11 post RALP and I had my follow-up visit with my urologist yesterday. Unfortunately the pathology report was not as good as I had hoped for. The prostate weighed 49 grams which was a good bit bigger than expected. My Gleason increased from a 3+3 to a 3+4 with 27% of the prostate involved (22% right lobe and 32% left lobe). Unfortunately the cancer had also escaped the prostate with perineural and right seminal vesicle invasion. All not news I wanted to hear. The best news is negative margins on all biopsied tissues so maybe everything was gotten. That is what I'm hoping and praying for. I'll have a follow-up PSA test in a month and again in 3 months to determine the surgical results. My urologist mentioned he would likely want to do radiation regardless of the PSA level. I'm not jumping on that bandwagon until I see the numbers and can do some more radiation research. My father ultimately developed and died from bladder cancer and I believe that prostate cancer radiation he received years earlier was a part of the source of that problem. I'll proceed with caution as far as radiation is concerned. Post surgical recovery is going well. With the catheter out I feel much better. Congrats to those that had minimal to no incontinence issues. I can't say the same for me so far. I went through a half dozen pads in my first afternoon/evening of freedom. Honestly, it feels like the little fella is staging a revolution after having been strapped to my right leg for the past 10 days. I hope that does not offend anyone, but I find humor is a great release, as long as it is not enough to make me laugh. Then the release is not so good. Everyone take care and I'll keep monitoring the forum, providing opinions where I can, and update you again in the coming months.",

      "Content": "Merry Christmas everyone. Things are a little quiet around here right now so it is a good time to relax and unwind. My RALP is now only 4 days away. My wife said she is looking forward to it. My response was \"What?\". Seriously, I understand what she meant in wanting it to be behind us. But, I cannot say it is something I'm looking forward to undergoing. Honestly if I felt bad or was nervous about the cancer then I might \"look forward\" to the surgery as well. But, since I feel fine and my particular cancer is confined to the prostate and is only diagnosed as 3+3 I've not been worried at all. Surgery and the potential after effects are just necessary evils. I had discovered that I feel rather odd about saying I even have cancer. Cancer has had more than it's fair share of my family and close friends and I've seen the pain and death it can cause. My best friend died in college from Hodgkin's lymphoma, my brother in-law died at a rather young age from cancer, my father died after a combination of prostate and bladder cancer and my sister still has breast cancer. Still, my diagnosis was early, the cure rate is nearly 100% and I feel in perfect health. I know everyone is on their own journey and the diagnoses are all unique, but has anyone else in a similar situation as mine felt it is almost wrong to say you have cancer? I see my family and friends with far worse diagnoses than me and it is hard for me to even use the same \"C\" word in describing my own health. I've also been very much sensitized to even hearing the \"C\" word. It seems like every other commercial on television is an advertisement for some cancer center in some location. The ones showing young kids with cancer are particularly difficult to watch. Well, at least those commercials are better than the personal injury lawyers and political attack ads. OK, enough ranting for now. Everyone have a blessed Christmas and a most Happy New Year. I know that is my own plan!!!",

But, I cannot say it is something I'm looking forward to undergoing. Honestly if I felt bad or was nervous about the cancer then I might \"look forward\" to the surgery as well. But, since I feel fine and my particular cancer is confined to the prostate and is only diagnosed as 3+3 I've not been worried at all. Surgery and the potential after effects are just necessary evils. I had discovered that I feel rather odd about saying I even have cancer. Cancer has had more than it's fair share of my family and close friends and I've seen the pain and death it can cause. My best friend died in college from Hodgkin's lymphoma, my brother in-law died at a rather young age from cancer, my father died after a combination of prostate and bladder cancer and my sister still has breast cancer. Still, my diagnosis was early, the cure rate is nearly 100% and I feel in perfect health. I know everyone is on their own journey and the diagnoses are all unique, but has anyone else in a similar situation as mine felt it is almost wrong to say you have cancer? I see my family and friends with far worse diagnoses than me and it is hard for me to even use the same \"C\" word in describing my own health. I've also been very much sensitized to even hearing the \"C\" word. It seems like every other commercial on television is an advertisement for some cancer center in some location. The ones showing young kids with cancer are particularly difficult to watch. Well, at least those commercials are better than the personal injury lawyers and political attack ads. OK, enough ranting for now. Everyone have a blessed Christmas and a most Happy New Year. I know that is my own plan!!!",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by Southsider Good luck on your surgery- but one question. Are you having it during the holiday week because of insurance reasons? I didn't think they would want to ordinarily schedule an operation like this that could wait a week or two during the last week of December. I would have thought that most of the staff was off, and those remaining would be dealing with emergency situations. Thanks. I actually put off the surgery for about 6 weeks and set it after Christmas so my kids normally away at school could be there. My surgeon said he only took off Christmas Day and would be doing surgery and seeing patients all this week so I took advantage of the timing.",

      "Content": "I'm now day 11 post RALP and I had my follow-up visit with my urologist yesterday. Unfortunately the pathology report was not as good as I had hoped for. The prostate weighed 49 grams which was a good bit bigger than expected. My Gleason increased from a 3+3 to a 3+4 with 27% of the prostate involved (22% right lobe and 32% left lobe). Unfortunately the cancer had also escaped the prostate with perineural and right seminal vesicle invasion. All not news I wanted to hear. The best news is negative margins on all biopsied tissues so maybe everything was gotten. That is what I'm hoping and praying for. I'll have a follow-up PSA test in a month and again in 3 months to determine the surgical results. My urologist mentioned he would likely want to do radiation regardless of the PSA level. I'm not jumping on that bandwagon until I see the numbers and can do some more radiation research. My father ultimately developed and died from bladder cancer and I believe that prostate cancer radiation he received years earlier was a part of the source of that problem. I'll proceed with caution as far as radiation is concerned. Post surgical recovery is going well. With the catheter out I feel much better. Congrats to those that had minimal to no incontinence issues. I can't say the same for me so far. I went through a half dozen pads in my first afternoon/evening of freedom. Honestly, it feels like the little fella is staging a revolution after having been strapped to my right leg for the past 10 days. I hope that does not offend anyone, but I find humor is a great release, as long as it is not enough to make me laugh. Then the release is not so good. Everyone take care and I'll keep monitoring the forum, providing opinions where I can, and update you again in the coming months.",

      "Content": "My RALP was 5 days ago. My surgeon said it was a textbook operation (just over 2 hours) and that everything looked good and he feels he did a good job of sparing the nerves. I\"m still awaiting the final pathology report but I expect that to be good as well. Pain levels have been very manageable. I usually tolerate pain fairly well, but I have taken my meds (percocet) regularly to \"stay ahead of the pain\". Unexpected spasms (i.e. bladder, intestine, etc.) cause the greatest pain and it is quite intense. Fortunately these are only a few seconds in duration and are becoming less frequent. Bowel movements are happening again and I'm quite happy with that. That pressure was/is probably the second greatest source of pain behind the spasms. I strongly suggest a regimen of stool softeners and/or gentle laxatives to help that process. I would not have wanted to have to deal with constipation at the same time. My first follow-up is next Monday, which means 5 more days with my catheter friend. My doctor didn't want to remove the catheter this Friday in case there were complications over the weekend. Looking back, I would have probably been better off to schedule the surgery on a Wednesday or Thursday. I could have had the catheter out after only 7 days. Oh well, live and learn. The only catheter incident I have was when my daughter accidentally caught on the tube and gave it a good yank. Wow, that was some serious pain then. But, no damage was done. Thank God for the Foley stabilization device attached to my leg that kept the catheter in place. I really don't want to dwell on the other possibility. Thanks for all the useful information and support everyone has given. I'll give another update after my first follow-up. Happy New Year!!!!!",
