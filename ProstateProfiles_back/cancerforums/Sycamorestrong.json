    "Content": "My husband was diagnosed in July 2011 with Prostate cancer. He was 56. At that time I joined this forum, but I cannot seem to find the old thread.anyway, he had the DaVinci robotic prostatectomy in early September and was doing well until the winter of 2013/2014 when his numbers started rising again. He had salvage radiation during January, February and March 2014. His numbers fell again, but are steadily rising again. This past Monday, at his 6 month check up with his radiologist his numbers went from .10 to point .16. She wants him to retest in 2 months. I happen to be away thus week (ugh) so I don't have his initial info, but I do know that it was a Gleaaon 4-3 (not the best, I know) and I believe A stage 3. I guess the next step is HT? A digital exam revealed nothing, He feels well, and still swims a mile 4x a week, and works way too many hours, but he is stubborn and won't let anything slow him down. I do all the research on his disease, and support him any way I can. What are we dealing with here? It's not even 5 years since his Initial diagnosis. I cant seem to find any info on a 2d reoccurance Any info or support would be appreciated.",
