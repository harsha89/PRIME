Can you all give us some idea as how you felt in the days... weeks after surgery? Is it hard to walk? Pain? Sleeping? Is it helpful to have someone with you 24/7? Any tips/ideas on how to make things more comfortable for him afterwards? I started a new thread from my \"55 yr old hubby just diagnosed\". Not sure how stuff works on this forum but thought maybe that was a better idea. There might even be a thread answering these questions, but I'm not good at searching yet.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by Michael F Hi Jlynn! Sorry to learn about your husband's post op discomforts. As always, whenever there is any issue or concern, call his MDs office and speak to the MD or RN. Several others have reported having post op bloating and ankle swelling . One big concern is avoiding DVT and walking is one of the best preventive measures. DVT typically does not occur in both legs and it often presents with pain or burning sensation in the calf. Thus, if DVT is not present, then definitely keep his feet comfortably elevated. Also, he may want to wear support hose and see if that helps. Not sure why he is light sensitive but if he still is, you should report that as well. (With mouth closed and teeth together, can he comfortably touch his chin to his chest and hold it there for 10 seconds?) Re Nausea: Not sure if the pain meds can cause this or if it is a residual effect of anesthesia, but nausea typically leads to decreased food and fluid intake. Hopefully all of these issues have abated and he is starting to feel better. 3 other issues to monitor: - Bowel movements: Has he had one yet? Anesthesia knocks out one's normal bowel activity/motility. Guessing that without a BM, there could be gas building up that may be causing some bloating. (I did not have a BM until 4 days post op.) - Fluid and Hydration: Monitor his daily urine output: volume and coloration. My guess is that many post RP men who are in discomfort & nauseated are not going to take in nearly enough fluid. Also fluid will help facilitate the ease of a BM. He should be taking in at least 3 liters of fluid daily and likely more. (My average daily urine output was 5 liters) Simply write down the volume of urine each time before draining the bag. To keep him hydrated use: water, Gatorade, Ginger ale, Smoothies, light soups, - even a single beer (with MD's permission) will get fluid on board. Bottom line is you want to prevent him from getting into a dehydrated state. - Frequent Walking: Extremely important! It will help with his circulation and should lessen his ankle swelling, decrease risk of DVT, and may even help jump start his gut motility and get things moving! Gradually increase the frequency, distance, duration and pace of the walks. Stay close to his side to prevent a fall. Hope all of the discomforts quickly disappear. Keep us updated. Best wishes for a rapid return to Normal! MF Great information MF! His ankle swelling is a little better today. I'm sure it's like everyone said - probably from the car ride. He hasn't had a BM. He says, where is all that food going that I'm eating! lol I'm sure the stomach bloating with subside somewhat when he does have a BM.",

I think our next step is going to be to talk to a Radiologist Oncologist and get a second opinion from a urologist at the MD Anderson Cancer Center in Houston. My husband just started a new job about 3 months ago and travels 4-5 days a week so that might put a damper on what treatment we chose. Since he isn't in the position to take alot of time off work.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by HighlanderCFH Maybe it will help you to hear some of our surgery day/night before stories. If your, and your husband's, experience is anything like mine, things will go MUCH BETTER than you might be expecting. In the weeks & days leading to my surgery I could not help but wonder what kind of bundle of nerves I'd be the night before surgery. I wondered about tossing & turning, etc. Turned out to be just the opposite. I slept like a baby all night, got up early and prepared for my day as if I was just going out for a stroll. I did take a stroll -- on foot from the nearby motel right to the hospital at Mayo. I joked to my Mother that it felt like I was walking to my own execution. LOL But there was no nervousness, etc. Something comes over you that gives a calm feeling -- you know that this is something that HAS to be done and that you have a very good pre-op prognosis. Basically you're just gonna take a nap and wake up cancer free. I was even calm as they shaved me in the pre-surgical area, as they rolled me on the gurney down the hallway, as the doors opened and I saw the robot standing in the corner. All I really remember after that was when they lifted me from the gurney onto the surgical bed. When my lights came back on, I was being wheeled into my hospital room. In my case, the surgery took 4 hours and then another 4 hours in recovery before going into the room. The hardest thing was on my Mother, who had to sit there (at the age of 84) for over 8 hours. I slept like a baby through the whole thing. When I woke up, I had absolutely NO pain whatsoever from the surgery, catheter or drainage tube. No pain at all. I never did have any pain after the surgery. No discomfort when the drain tube was removed the following morning, no pain from the catheter and no pain when the catheter was removed. I hope that this experience shows how it can -- and very well might -- be for you & your husband. Nothing to fear. Just an \"unusual\" kind of day, but a day that will come and go..... .....and eventually seem as though it never really happened. Good luck! Chuck Thanks Chuck - your words are very reassuring! I had no idea he might be in recovery for 4 hours! Dr. Davis told him 2 1/2 hour surgery but didn't mention recovery. Is it typical to be in the recovery room 4 hours? I can't see him during that time? Thank you all for your uplifting thoughts!",

In my case, the surgery took 4 hours and then another 4 hours in recovery before going into the room. The hardest thing was on my Mother, who had to sit there (at the age of 84) for over 8 hours. I slept like a baby through the whole thing. When I woke up, I had absolutely NO pain whatsoever from the surgery, catheter or drainage tube. No pain at all. I never did have any pain after the surgery. No discomfort when the drain tube was removed the following morning, no pain from the catheter and no pain when the catheter was removed. I hope that this experience shows how it can -- and very well might -- be for you & your husband. Nothing to fear. Just an \"unusual\" kind of day, but a day that will come and go..... .....and eventually seem as though it never really happened. Good luck! Chuck Thanks Chuck - your words are very reassuring! I had no idea he might be in recovery for 4 hours! Dr. Davis told him 2 1/2 hour surgery but didn't mention recovery. Is it typical to be in the recovery room 4 hours? I can't see him during that time? Thank you all for your uplifting thoughts!",

      "Content": "Hi all - I haven't posted lately but just wanted you to know my husband is having his surgery at MD Anderson in Houston on Monday, Sept. 28. He is down there today going through all the pre-surgery tests/information. We are both getting really nervous and not looking forward to this at all! I do want to thank you all though for this forum and thanks to the couple of you that spoke with my husband on the phone. It has helped with many questions my husband and I have had. I will try to post within a couple days after his surgery to let you know how it went. I'm sure we will have questions about his recovery while he is going through it. Thank you for your prayers and wish us luck!",
