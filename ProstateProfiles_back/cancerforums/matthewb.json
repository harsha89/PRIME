      "Content": "Hello again, I've narrowed it down to either surgery or seeds. I saw a seed guy, and he handed me a set of view graphs based on a study by Peter Grimm: http://www.slideshare.net/Prostate-S...sults-1-1513-3 I find these slides make a compelling case for seed implantation. For my \"low risk\" situation, shown on slides 17 and 20, it appears to me the chances of low PSA after 10 years is in the low 90's for seeds, vs. mid-80's for surgery. So my chances of having cancer recurrence after 10 years is twice as high with surgery. This is NOT what the surgeons I've talked to suggested, nor is it what is suggested by Walsh's book. (I'm seeing a surgeon this Thursday -- I'll see what he has to say about the Grimm study.) Seeds also supposedly have lower rates of incontinence and ED. The seed guy I talked to suggested incontinence problems in his patients were very low (1%), and while 30-40 % of his patients develop ED problems, 80% of those were treatable with drugs (so 20% of 40% = 8% end up with ED for which drugs are no help). Before I talked to this guy, I had pretty much decided on surgery, but now am uncertain. The higher cure rates seen in study after study, the lower rates of side-effects, and the comparative simplicity of seeds vs surgery is difficult for me to just ignore. The concerns I am left with seed implantation are: 1) I'm only 50. If cancer does return (either because the treatment misses some cancer cells, or because I simply develop prostate cancer again) then what are my options? Can I be cooked a second time? How much radiation therapy can one tolerate? I've heard surgery after radiation therapy is problematic. Is it impossible, or just difficult? 2) I've heard the part of the rectum that sits close to the prostate can get pretty badly burned from radiation and cause problems (bleeding, etc). There's this new product that's starting to get used to alleviate this problem: http://www.spaceoar.com/what-is-spaceoar/ Anybody know anything about that? Didn't I read somewhere that the erection nerves that surgeons try to spare around the prostate are entwined with the colon? Will injecting this gel stretch and damage those nerves? 3) What other downsides are there for brachytherapy. 4) My wife's grandfather did the seed thing, and developed significant incontinence problems the last 5 years of his life. (Started wetting the bed.) If I go with seeds, am I doomed to eventually start having problems with incontinence? 5) There were only a few studies listed that went past 10 years, and none past 15 years. Is there any data for how seed and surgery patients do 20 or 25 years out? I would like to hear from younger men who were aware of this study and decided on surgery anyway -- I'd like to hear why they decided on surgery despite the apparent superior 10-year cure rates of seed implantation. Likewise, I'd like to hear from any younger men who saw this study and decided to go with seeds because of it. Are there any such people? It seems like most younger men opt for surgery. Thanks for any input you can provide. I REALLY hate coming up with my own treatment plan. Matt",

      "Content": "This is an annoyingly long post. I have many questions. I hope someone can help me find the answers to some of them. So for my 50th birthday I had my first PSA test which has led me to discover I have prostate cancer. Not sure how long it's been going on. I'm hopeful that I'm not already dead. During my last visit with my urologist, he said he'd be ok with radical prostatectomy, radiation, or active surveillance. And he wants to know what I want to do! Good grief. As an engineer, I'd like to make this decision based on the best statistics available, but I am having a hard time finding good information. My doctors have thrown out a few numbers here-and-there, but the exact basis of these numbers is not always clear, and frankly I'm not sure I believe them all. For example, one oncologist told me that he sees a 10-15% recurrence rate within 10 years of treatment. Is that across all of his patients (independent of age, initial gleason scores, and PSA levels)? (Obviously a question I should have asked during our meeting, but I don't think quick on my feet.) Once I figure out what I'm going to do, I need to find the right doc to do it. But that is an independent problem. I have 3 questions, although question 3 has many parts. Any help you can offer (e.g., references to applicable studies, etc) would be greatly appreciated. 1) Should I be getting an MRI or something to check for spread? My urologist said that if I had one, and a spot showed up, it would most likely be a false positive. 2) My urologist told me he would be comfortable with active surveillance if that's what I wanted to do. (It wasn't a recommendation -- just an option he was leaving me.) This seems like a bad choice to me. Here's my thinking. a) There's a possibility that the biopsy missed more aggressive cancer tissue. b) I am less concerned about side-effects than my kids (9, 13, and 15) growing up without a father. c) I don't have multiple PSA tests to see how fast the cancer is growing, but the fact that it is already palpable (big enough to feel), suggests to me that the time it took to get to this stage starting from a single cell, and doubling, say 30 times, to get to its current hundreds of millions of cells (I'm gussing) is far less than the remaining time that it's going to take to kill me. And at 50, and otherwise relatively healthy, it seems highly likely that this thing will end me before anything else is going to if I do nothing. d) So eventual treatment seems highly likely. So what's the idea? You wait for it to get worse? The data I've seen suggests that as PSA levels rise, and/or clinical staging levels increase, the cure rates fall off rather quickly. Do I really want to wait for my PSA to hit 10? Or my staging to go to T2B or T2C? My thinking is treat it now, while I have the best chance of beating this, and have the best chances of good recovery from the treatment. 3) Ruling out active surveillance, the choices I am considering are: P) Radical Prostatectomy S) Seed implantation (brachytherapy) B) External Beam radiation I have several questions about expectations for each treatment option. Assume I'll be able to get the best service available in each of these three cases. Looking at sample groups that most closely approximate me would be most useful: o 50 years old o PSA 6.1 o Gleason 3+3 o T2A o Negative perineural invasion detected from biopsy o Negative extra-prostatic extension detected from biopsy o Genomic Prostate Score (GPS) = 37 (not completely sure what that means actually) But ANY less-specific information would be useful if you have it. Specifically, here's what I'd like to know: A) For each of the three treatment types, what is the recurrence rate at 5, 10, 15, 20, 25 years? B) For each of the three treatment types, what is the rate of incontinence, say 5 years after treatment? (For prostatectomy, incontinence can improve as time goes on, but I've heard incontinence can get worse as time goes on after radiation, so I'm not even sure how to compare these two). C) For each of the three treatment types, what is the rate of erectile dysfunction without use of drugs? (For prostatectomy, ED conditions can improve as time goes on, but I've heard ED can get worse as time goes on after radiation, so I'm not sure how to compare these two). D) For each of the three treatment types, what is the rate of erectile dysfunction with use of drugs? E) Assuming I go with a radiation option, what are my options in the event of a recurrence? I assume there's at least a chance the prostate cancer is confined to the prostate again? Can they cook you a second time? Can they do the prostatectomy then? What is my outlook in this scenario? ----------------------------------------------- Here's what I've learned so far (which isn't much): 3.P.A Recurrence rates after radical prostatectomy From Pat Walsh's book, page 198, Table 6.3. Percentage of men with undetectable PSA levels at 10 years following radical retropubic prostatectomy for stage T2A disease and PSA scores 4.1-10: 93%. (I.e., 7% recurrence or about 1 in 14.) It would be nice to know what this number looks like 20 years or even more down the road since living past 60 would be nice too. Call me greedy. If you make it to 10 years, is it more likely you'll make it to 20? 3.P.B Incontenence rates after radical prostatectomy From Pat Walsh's book, page 313, Table 8.1 Urinary continance and sexual function after radical prostatectomy at John Hopkins. Continence (no pads) 3 months: 79% 6 months: 88% 12 months: 98% 3.P.C or 3.P.D (not sure which applies) Sexual function after radical prostatectomy From Pat Walsh's book, page 313, Table 8.1 Urinary continance and sexual function after radical prostatectomy at John Hopkins. Potent 3 months: 38% 6 months: 54% 12 months: 73% 18 months: 86% What does potent mean anyway? You've had at least one erection? Are these numbers drug aided? I saw one other surgeon on line with 7000+ surgeries that has similarly positive claims of 83% regaining sexual function. 3.B.A Recurrence rates after external beam radiation One oncologist I met with said 10-15% after within 10 years. I assume this was averaged over all his patients, so not very specific to me. I have no other data. 3.B.B Incontinence rates after external beam radiation One oncologist I met with said 5% five years after treatment. I have no other data. 3.B.C or 3.B.D Sexual function after external beam radiation The same oncologist said that of the men that got treated around 50 years of age, about 30% developed ED within 5 years of treatment. (Not sure if he meant with or without drugs.) He said that of the men that got treated around 70 years of age, about 50% developed ED within 5 years of treatment. ------------------------- Any additional resources you can point me to to help me make a side-by-side comparison of these treatment options would be greatly appreciated. If I am to believe Walsh and my oncologist, incontinence and ED rates are WORSE with radiation, than with prostatectomy. Could that be right? My oncologist said many are skeptical of Walsh's numbers -- they are not reproducible. Much thanks for reading this long post! And even more thanks if you can point me to good references that answer any of my questions. Matt",

      "Content": "I've been freaking out the past few days. My urologist has been telling me I'm low risk, but over the weekend I was reading about prostate cancer on wikipedia and it has this text about advanced prostate cancer: The most common symptom is bone pain, often in the vertebrae (bones of the spine), pelvis, or ribs. Spread of cancer into other bones such as the femur is usually to the proximal or nearby part of the bone. Prostate cancer in the spine can also compress the spinal cord, causing tingling, leg weakness and urinary and fecal incontinence. So about the same time I got my high PSA score, I simultaneously came down with peripheral neurpathy (PN) in my toes and balls of my feet -- a tingling sensation -- occasionally painful. Could this be being caused by cancer in the lower spine pushing on the spine and inhibiting sensory input from my feet? My primary care doc wasn't concerned about the PN and said I should be focused on this high PSA score. I'm pretty darn sure I included PN in my medical history when I had my first meeting with my urologist, but the PN never came up in our discussions. Also, this past Saturday I got a very slight sensation in one of my vertebrae in the middle of my back (bottom of rib cage). Each day since then the sensations have gotten more pronounced -- about 3 or 4 of my vertebrae now feel like I've been carrying a kid on my shoulders for too long -- compressed, a bit achy, a twinge now and then as I move about. I called my urologist's office today, but he doesn't work mondays. I talked to a nurse instead. She was annoyed with me, said I was low risk, and I should stop reading the internet. Anyway, I can't sleep. I can't eat. I'm convinced I'm a dead man walking. I'm terrified my kids are going to grow up without their father. Perhaps it's nothing, but I'm totally stressed out. Matt",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by Jim215 At the same time, after re-reading your other extensive thread, I see no record of an abdominal scan or a full-body bone scan prior to your biopsy or afterwards. I think my doctors are very proud of how well they keep medical costs down -- why do a scan for a gleason 6? When I complained about pain in my gut years ago, they told me it was likely just a hitch in my intestine, so I went with undiagnosed chron's disease for several years. Until I hit 50 and had a colonoscopy. You'd think they could have sprung for a blood in stool test at least. That probably would have revealed the problem. When I complained about frequent heart burn, and painful swallowing and asked if it was acid reflux, he said nah -- i don't think you have acid reflux. But I mentioned my problems to my gastro-interologist whom I was seeing about my chron's and he scheduled an upper scope test -- and sure enough -- acid reflux with scarring -- he stretched the scar tissue on my esophagus to help with swallowing. When I asked a doctor if my HDL score of 18 (should be 40) was a problem. He just said -- I've seen worse. 15 years later I finally went on statins, but I already have significant plaque on my arteries. I tried to have a deviated septum fixed when I was 25, but he didn't cut out the crooked part -- I'm still deviated. I tried to have a hernia fixed a few years back, and my hernia is now much worse. I could go on -- I have other bad luck/bad doc stories. So I guess I just don't trust doctors. Matt",

Wife say no dishes I do! So I hobble down steps, but slip down a few. On landing I lay, for part of a day, At least you did stay. Mr. Foley, you I hate! Pull you out would be great, But doc say, 9 days I must wait! So stand I disdainful, Cause you make sitting painful, As I wait 9 day date. Oh glee! 9th day it be! But doc say, much blood in my pee! Need picture to see if a leak inside me! So stood I in radiology, till I feel like a tree. Long I stood. Don't you see? Then receptionist say, \"No tech here for thee.\" Pardon me? Offer her mounds of money. Can't you find someone honey? \"Come back Monday, if you please.\" Oh geeze! Finally catheter I am rid of thee, But still angry at me, Is my sore little wee-wee. So swollen it be, It not let out my pee. Doc say, if not get out pee, you go back in me. Oh foul Mr. Foley! I'll not let thee, make again a woman of me! So I sit and I sit, Wee-wee pain it emit, But it only drip, drip. So I move to the tub And give it a rub. Then it give painful dribble, with which I'll not quibble. Painful dribble fine with me, Cause I stay rid of thee, Oh wretched Mr. Foley!",

      "Content": "So I've pretty much decided on surgery (though I'm still not confident seeds aren't a better way to go). I just put a call in to schedule prostatectomy. Of course my first hope is that I'm cured after surgery, and the second most important thing is I recover normal urinary function. But in this post I'm trying to find out more about what to expect with sexual function. I've read that although I'll never ejaculate again, it's still possible to have some kind of an orgasm after surgery. One doctor I asked about this said, \"Orgasms are in the brain.\" But that seems an oversimplification. Here are my questions: 1) Assuming you can get your erections back at all, are post operative orgasms even typically achievable? 2) At the risk of being overly graphic, the last time I orgasmed I tried to keep my wits about me and pay attention to what I was feeling. One sensation is a fluttering of the pelvic (floor?) muscles. Is that still part of a post-operative orgasm? If not, then what's left? Thanks for any info you can provide. Matt",
