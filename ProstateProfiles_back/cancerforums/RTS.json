      "Content": "Hi again, I had a thread earlier in the week but I wanted to start a new one for input. I have an appointment with a surgeon on Tuesday 11/16 to discuss what i think will most likely be my soon to have DaVinci Prostatectomy. I would like for suggestions of a list of questions that you guys... and gals, think that I should ask a potential surgeon. I feel comfortable with the references I have gotten on him but I want to know if he really feels in his heart that this is the best option for me and not just a paycheck. 1. How long have you been doing this? 2. How many have you done? 3. Do you accept input from other doctors such as Oncologist about my case? 4. What is the success rate of your patients? These are basic and general questions but I don't know what else to ask. This is why I need help. Thanks.",

      "Content": "I had my robotic prostatectomy on Dec. 18. My catheter and staples were removed on Friday Dec. 27. The catheter is by far the worst part of the whole surgery.Two days after removing the catheter I had zero leakage and I continue to have no leakage at all. The only thing that is annoying is the sensation at the tip of my penis that I am leaking. It's not a \"I need to go to the bathroom\" feeling but a \"I'm dripping\" feeling. Strange. Anyway I could not be happier with my results so far. I have had minor erections during the night but not anything like I'm used to. My doctor told me to not focus on the erections but to focus on the Kegal exercises and my bladder. He wants me to heal before I start forcing erections and he said definitely don't try sex yet. I'll go back in 4 weeks for my first PSA and he said we would concentrate on erections at that time. I feel like I wont have a problem with that. His goal before surgery was to 1. cure the cancer 2. maintain continence 3. maintain erections. In that order. I think he accomplished all 3. I'm content with it. I made a decision and pulled the trigger and so far it has worked out. Ironically, on a side note, my mother-in-law is at hospital with her brother in TX now, who is 63, and has recurring prostate cancer because he waited too late to check his prostate. It got out of his prostate and he underwent chemo for several years and now it is back and he is in trouble. Serious trouble. I feel different after going through this surgery but I also feel blessed that I have had such good results. Thanks to all the people on this site that answered questions and helped me with information that I helped me make a decision.",

      "Content": "I appreciate the input. The Radiation Oncologist that did the MRI is Dr. Walser at UTMB in Galveston, TX. He uses laser heat to treat the tumor and has had success killing the tumor with little or no side effects to the prostate. My hopes were that he would MRI a minor Gleason 6 cancer and be able to zap it out. However, his opinion is at my age, and due to the way the tumors are situated in my prostate, he would prefer to see the prostate removed and not risk the the treatment missing any of the cancer to appear again later on. He also felt that he saw more cancer on the MRI than the original biopsy seemed to be finding. He also felt comfortable waiting 6 months for another MRI. My Urologist feels that I should not risk it, that at some point I will need treatment, and that I should not miss the \"cure window\". I have read and researched this for over a year and I still can't reach a comfortable decision. My gut tells me that I should get this out of my body and move on with my life, but I would hate to remove my prostate because I had a high psa due to infection or prostatitis. I don't wont another biopsy because I now feel the MRI can more accurately show progression. Too bad it cant give a pathology but they are working on that. They are able to see \"higher and more active\" blood flow to the tumor which can be an indication of aggression. I was sort of shaken by the fact that the MRI showed cancer in both sides as opposed to the biopsy showing just one side. That in itself alarmed me. Dr. Patrick Daily in Jackson, MS is the surgeon I would use. He is skilled, experienced, as well as teaches the procedure around the country. I have heard nothing but good things and results from him. I have a consultation with him 11/16. I'll make my decision then. Thanks again",

My question is would a Smoothie from Smoothie King be off the table? If so, are there any suggestions for getting some calories in clear liquid so that I dont feel like crap from not eating for two days. Three counting Wednesday. Thanks",

      "Content": "I appreciate the input. The Radiation Oncologist that did the MRI is Dr. Walser at UTMB in Galveston, TX. He uses laser heat to treat the tumor and has had success killing the tumor with little or no side effects to the prostate. My hopes were that he would MRI a minor Gleason 6 cancer and be able to zap it out. However, his opinion is at my age, and due to the way the tumors are situated in my prostate, he would prefer to see the prostate removed and not risk the the treatment missing any of the cancer to appear again later on. He also felt that he saw more cancer on the MRI than the original biopsy seemed to be finding. He also felt comfortable waiting 6 months for another MRI. My Urologist feels that I should not risk it, that at some point I will need treatment, and that I should not miss the \"cure window\". I have read and researched this for over a year and I still can't reach a comfortable decision. My gut tells me that I should get this out of my body and move on with my life, but I would hate to remove my prostate because I had a high psa due to infection or prostatitis. I don't wont another biopsy because I now feel the MRI can more accurately show progression. Too bad it cant give a pathology but they are working on that. They are able to see \"higher and more active\" blood flow to the tumor which can be an indication of aggression. I was sort of shaken by the fact that the MRI showed cancer in both sides as opposed to the biopsy showing just one side. That in itself alarmed me. Dr. Patrick Daily in Jackson, MS is the surgeon I would use. He is skilled, experienced, as well as teaches the procedure around the country. I have heard nothing but good things and results from him. I have a consultation with him 11/16. I'll make my decision then. Thanks again",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by DjinTonic Hi Roy. Have a look at this study I added yesterday to the Subforum: Detection of prostate cancer lesions using Gallium-68 PSMA-11 PET in men with biochemical recurrence following radical prostatectomy [2018] [Emphasis mine] See in particular Table 1 there. It has the percentages for a Positive Scan, and 3 Most Distant Locations: Prostate Bed, Pelvic Lymph Nodes, and Extra-pelvic lesions grouped by the PSA at the time of the scan. For PSA 0.2 - 0.49: (32 men): 56% 9% 28% 19% Some questions to consider for your team: Is a 68Ga PSMA-PET scan available? Will the proposed RT include the pelvic LNs in the field of radiation? What benefits of adding HT have your team seen for men with your profile? How do we address possible distant metastases besides HT? (In the Subforum at the top of the main page Topic (L) is HT with studies.) My first thoughts, assuming above study proves to be generally accurate, are (1) in cases of BCR we need to focus on the chance of extra-pelvic lesions, since the men for whom salvage RT will not be successful are likely in this group and (2) it pays to ask about (or seek out) a 68Ga PSMA/PET scan if BCR is at hand. My Uro thinks scans can\u0092t start detecting until psa reaches 1.0. Also can the RO order this scan if he sees fit?",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by DjinTonic Hi Roy. Have a look at this study I added yesterday to the Subforum: Detection of prostate cancer lesions using Gallium-68 PSMA-11 PET in men with biochemical recurrence following radical prostatectomy [2018] [Emphasis mine] See in particular Table 1 there. It has the percentages for a Positive Scan, and 3 Most Distant Locations: Prostate Bed, Pelvic Lymph Nodes, and Extra-pelvic lesions grouped by the PSA at the time of the scan. For PSA 0.2 - 0.49: (32 men): 56% 9% 28% 19% Some questions to consider for your team: Is a 68Ga PSMA-PET scan available? Will the proposed RT include the pelvic LNs in the field of radiation? What benefits of adding HT have your team seen for men with your profile? How do we address possible distant metastases besides HT? (In the Subforum at the top of the main page Topic (L) is HT with studies.) My first thoughts, assuming above study proves to be generally accurate, are (1) in cases of BCR we need to focus on the chance of extra-pelvic lesions, since the men for whom salvage RT will not be successful are likely in this group and (2) it pays to ask about (or seek out) a 68Ga PSMA/PET scan if BCR is at hand. My Uro thinks scans can\u0092t start detecting until psa reaches 1.0. Also can the RO order this scan if he sees fit?",
