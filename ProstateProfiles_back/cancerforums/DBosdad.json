      "Content": "Newbie here, This is my first post as I recently had a blood test come back with an elevated PSA I'm 49 yrs old Have some mild symptoms: Weak stream on occasion Frequent urges to pee on occasion, but I can sleep through the night 7-8hrs without issue, Some nights I may get up once to go, but not every night Mild ED Went to Dr for normal check-up and had an elevated PSA of 6.1, Dr sent me to Urologist that I just saw today. Asked all the normal questions and performed a DRE, he said everything looked good. Right after that exam they took blood for another PSA test, I've read where a DRE can elevate the PSA results, is this correct? I go back to the Urologist for a follow up in a week, if my PSA is still elevated should I mention that too him and ask for another test before moving forward with anything else? With my first PSA test being elevated and it being the first PSA test I've ever had it has me concerned and the Urologist said it's quite elevated for someone my age",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by ASAdvocate Welcome, DBosdad, Yes, your psa is elevated, but most such readings are more likely to be from benign causes than prostate cancer. PSA is an indicator of prostate activity, and is not diagnostic for cancer. You could have an inflammation, and those are difficult to treat as most do not respond to antibiotics. They just come and go with time. Instead of just another PSA test, I would suggest a PHI instead. That includes PSA, free PSA, and a prostate cancer biomarker. It is more accurate and less affected by inflammation than PSA alone. Thanks for your reply, I have a follow up in 1 week and will ask many questions. For now I await the PSA results from the blood work today. Looking online I think I'm worrying and stressing myself more than I probably need too.",

I'm 49 yrs old, no family history in good general health, have some mild symptoms Once in a while I have a frequent need to go in evening from 6pm-10pm, always sleep through the night without the need to get up Some weak stream from time to time Back on April 6th during a general health exam I got a 6.11 ng/mL PSA I was referred to a a a Urologists who did a DRE which came back normal other than a slight enlargement, I don't have size results.

      "Content": "Went in for my TRUS biopsy on Wednesday at NOON due to elevated PSA. Biopsy went very smooth no pain at all, just a weird feeling when it snapped. Dr said my prostate felt soft it measured 38grams I believe he said and also that the ultrasound showed nothing abnormal other than some stones and calcification. Results in a week, Dr seemed encouraged, at least that's how I read him. A few questions regarding after the biopsy. The first day I had almost no blood in urine, but yesterday and through the night there's been more blood and sometimes it seems my flow is weak, I pass small dark solid things, are these clots and is this normal? Most of the time when I go flow is fine and only blood at the start and end of going I've been drinking a ton of water hoping to speed up the process. Bowel movements have had no issues When is it OK to ejaculate how many days after? I feel very hesitant to \"take care of things\" I'd also like to get all the blood out so my wife doesn't have to deal with that. All in all I'm just glad the biopsy is over with, the anxiety was much worse leading up to it than the actual procedure.",
