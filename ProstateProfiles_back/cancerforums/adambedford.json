    "Content": "Hello, Can someone help me, i have not been to the hospital yet for my scans. However i have high PSA levels from my blood tests and i have had a DRE my father had prostate cancer, and my grandfather did also. I am 62 years of age, and the chances are i have it. I have seen some of the threads on here with all different types of results showing but i don't understand what they mean its like another language to me. Can someone help explain to me what they mean, i cant have an appointment at the hospital for 4 weeks, and this is driving me crazy, how do the present you with the results, what does all this Gleason etc mean? Thank you",
