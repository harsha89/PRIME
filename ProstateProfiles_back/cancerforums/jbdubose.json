      "Content": "I was diagnosed with prostate cancer and had prostatectomy in Dec. 09'. I had a high cancer score (8+). The follow-up PSA test a few weeks after showed my level at 2.9. The doctor was astounded saying the margins were clear from my surgery. So he did another PSA a week later and it was 3.2. Evidently he did not get it all and it was climbing up fast. So, in Mar. 10' I got sent to radiation for 40+ treatments and as an added \"bonus\" I got started on Lupron. Yes, I have now read all the bad stuff on the drug and completely agree with many assessments. It did a number on me as well. I was on the drug for 1.5 years getting zeros all the while and talked my doc into getting off of it (Nov. 11'). He said it would take the same amount of time for the drug to wear off before my PSA tests would be truly accurate and for my hormone levels to bounce back. But he did mention that I was not a candidate for HRT since I was stage 3 at one point (Radiation, etc). Since Nov. 11' I have continued to get zeros on my PSA but my pituitary gland never kicked back and my hormone levels ranged 68 until recently. Now they are dropping (50) again. Now, the doc has ordered some pituitary blood tests to see if a tumor is present. He has also relented and has put me on HRT (via gel). Options? Is there any medicine, natural or otherwise, out there that can \"jumpstart\" my pituitary? Although there may be a risk in doing HRT again, I have done extensive research and have found that prognosis unstable. So I am 50/50 on HRT. Has anyone in this forum experienced this or have heard of this happening? Any advice? Please help...I am pretty frustrated! Thanks in advance, Jim",

      "Content": "I want to express my sincere thanks those those who replied to my post. I appreciate your suggestions and/or concerns on my behalf. I haven't sought out another urologist but have contemplated it. This is mostly happening through my urologist, who also did my surgery (Da Vinci). He is highly sought in Arkansas (Little Rock) and hard to get into to. The only time I was sent to an oncologist was when I went to radiation. The hard part in all of this was because he was hard to get into I had to wait 4 months for surgery. Because of my type of cancer it may have caused the present circumstances. My original PSA score was 8.7. I had done only one PSA previously at the age of 45 living in another state and the results were all clear. Because I was 50 at the time (I'm 54 now) the doc immediately sent me for a biopsy. The result was a tumor the size of a walnut (I don't remember the exact numbers at present) against the prostate wall with a gleason score of 8+, all this out of 12 samples taken. This gleason score is highly unusual because most prostate cancers are not near so aggressive. Following surgery the doc said the margins were clear, etc. However, as I mentioned before this cancer had obviously escaped the original area and was growing at an alarming rate. I will let everyone know how the Hormone Replacement Therapy is going. The urologist has me coming back for testing in 6 weeks for PSA and testosterone levels. Thanks again guys! Jim",
