      "Content": "Hi everyone! I am writing on behalf of my dad who was diagnosed 2 days before Christmas. Back in August last year he had a pain that was very sharp and stabbing in the bottom of his rib area behead it so he had an ultrasound done and they said nothing to worry about it was likely an infection. The doctors had already been monitoring his PSA for a year and by December it reached 10.5 so they did a prostate biopsy. The results came back a 3&4 - 7 with mostly 3's. They took 18 samples and 7 of them had cancer. They also did a MRI in December as an appointment came up and they said it was clear except for his prostate area and a swollen area like a cyst type thing around his lower back - right behind where his pain had been in August. They said at the time again nothing to worry about. The bone scan took place 2 weeks ago and the consultant called last Friday to say the bone scan was clear but Dad needed to get a biopsy of the cyst in his back before they decided on his treatment plan. We are now waiting on the results of that. I suppose I am just confused as to how the cancer could jump from the prostate to lower rib area without going through the bone - but if the consultant was worried enough to do a biopsy should we be really worried? We really thought we were all clear and could get surgery for him Hoping for a response. Thanks in advance Sandra",
