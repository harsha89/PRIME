    "Content": "Diagnosed 12/2/16, PSA 148....I know, really high. Found at physical with simple blood test. Biopsy proved positive. Began 6 month shots and put on oral chemo Zytiga. After cat scans, mri and bone scan showed it was confined to the prostate, on July 3rd 2017 I had robotic radical prostectimy, followed by 39 radiation treatments. I have one more 6 month shot to go. By January 2019 all meds will stop and we will cross our fingers.",
