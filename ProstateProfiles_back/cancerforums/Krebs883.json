      "Content": "Hello all, I too am a first time user of this forum, and am just two and a half weeks out of surgery. I am in the same position right now with my incontinence and am getting frustrated. It is good to hear from others with the same problem and know that it will get better. I am very active and have a hard time sitting around, so I go through 5 to 6 pads a day right now. Am I better off trying to take it easy right now, or should I stay active to become more continent? Thanks to everyone on here, reading all of this really helps, as I am sure everybody that has gone through this cancer knows.",
