      "Content": "One of the benefits I received from this group was seeing I had a bias against getting a biopsy. I spent a lot of time reading current and old threads, and in time worked through my issues around not wanting what some described as an excruciating experience. Still, that process included firing one urologist who I didn't trust, and finding a team at UCSF in San Francisco who I have a great deal of trust in, in part, because of their methodical and detailed approach. You can read my signature to see the many tests they performed before recommending a biopsy. We did the deed on Oct 18th. My doctor said he has performed about 20,000 prostate biopsies through his career. He often does up to 10 per day. I now see why some people don't want a prostate biopsy unless they are sedated. Yes, getting the instrumentation into position was a bit uncomfortable, but nothing extreme. What was extreme for me was injecting novocaine to numb the prostate. That was excruciating to the point the nurse came over and rested her hand on my foot out of pure compassion as I tried to withstand the pain. It was amazing how much that simple human compassion helped. Three of those shots and all were bad. I understand it's different for everyone. The 18 cores taken weren't nearly as bad. A few were very painful, but most were just uncomfortable. 15-20 minutes and we were done. There was fairly bad pain and feeling uncomfortable for the rest of the day. I hurt in places I didn't know existed. The drive home wasn't great, especially hitting bumps and rough roads. I was much better the next day and went to work as normal, though I had to take it easy. I did experience one complication the next day: Shooting pain in my left testicle. When I called into my urologists office they had me go to a lab for a urine sample to make sure I wasn't developing an infection. Results of that in two days. And results from the biopsy in two weeks. Despite the pain of the novocaine injection, I'm glad I got the biopsy. Better to know the results than not. After all, we are trying to determine if I have aggressive prostate cancer. I feel lucky that we have the technology to make that determination and am willing to do what it takes on my part. I'm hoping that the fact I got a T3 mpMRI prior to the biopsy, and that image was fused into a 3D image with the live biopsy image, will result in more accurate cores being taken and less of a chance of false negative results. Time will tell.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by Another Supplements with anti inflammatory qualities are beneficial for just about everything, but will not cure cancer or stop it from presenting. They are also present in a healthy diet in appropriate amounts. If not, its not a healthy diet. In other words, the nature of a \"supplement\" is to compensate for an unhealthy diet and lifestyle. If it helps you achieve a healthy weight it may work, but if your BMI is not between 19 to 24 the odds are you are overweight and your diet and lifestyle is counter to your health regardless of the supplements you take. Abdominal fat is a higher risk factor for PC than supplements will benefit you, imo. The biggest risk to your health is thinking you are not overweight when you are. Taking supplements may tempt you to think you are doing something. If you continue to be overweight, supplements are only a finger in the dike. If they are an attempt to compensate for a poor diet and lifestyle while you make adjustments, good for you. You have found what is missing in your diet and you can go to work on it. Indulging in supplements may be a warning flag you are missing identifing major components, good and bad, in your diet. Mega dosing on these benefitials may not only be deluding your acceptance of what a healthy lifestyle is but may be counter productive to it if its all you plan to do. No amount of pomegranite juice may be able to compensate for 10 pounds (yes, that little) overweight and a sedentary lifestyle. Consider your cancer is already set in your DNA regardless of your current diet and lifestyle. Interestingly, the switch that is designed to turn off a prostate cell may have been turned off much earliar in your life by an unhealthy diet, lifestyle choice, or stress experienced by you as an infant or embryo or your mother while pregnant with you. That so many are experiencing it implies it may be a culturally prevalent imbalance or stress. Taking something today to undo what was set in the bone a generation before may be folly. Focusing on your current diet and lifestyle as it may impact you as an example and the provider of the same for your children and grandchildren may be a healthier strategy.

      "Content": "When I had my biopsy a few months ago I received three shots of Novocaine through the rectum wall and into the prostate so it would be anesthetized for the procedure. I know some people here don't find this procedure overly painful, but as I've read on different threads, others find this an extremely painful experience to go through. It turns out, I'm one of the latter. In fact, those three shots of Novocaine were bordering on the most painful thing I've ever experienced. The 18-core biopsy itself was uncomfortable, but only somewhat painful once or twice with the novocaine, now that it was in and working, doing it's job quite well. I am now on AS. But on February 1, 2019 I go in for the Rezum procedure to deal with side effects of BPH. My URO is once again going to anesthetize the prostate, but this time to lessen any chance of infection he is putting the needle through the perineum. I'm wondering if this will add a new layer of pain onto what is already not a pleasant experience. Anyone have a needle through the perineum instead of the rectum wall? Much difference? BTW, at the recommendation of my URO I did the first procedure with no meds. This time my URO is letting me take a combo of Ativan and Narco. They won't be to the strength I want, but better than nothing. Any other suggestions?",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by HighlanderCFH Not sure if this happened with you or not, James, but I made sure that my uro applied a freezing agent to the RECTUM before he actually went in and froze the prostate. Those preparing for future biopsies should ask about this before hand. Yes, my URO did apply a freezing agent. The pain wasn't from the needle entering the skin, it was from the actual injection. I could feel the injection in the prostate itself and it was surprising how bad it was, all three times. I've wondered if the URO pushed the novocaine in too quickly, and if that caused the pain, or if I'm simply susceptible to pain in that area while most others are not. Curious.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by HighlanderCFH Not sure if this happened with you or not, James, but I made sure that my uro applied a freezing agent to the RECTUM before he actually went in and froze the prostate. Those preparing for future biopsies should ask about this before hand. Yes, my URO did apply a freezing agent. The pain wasn't from the needle entering the skin, it was from the actual injection. I could feel the injection in the prostate itself and it was surprising how bad it was, all three times. I've wondered if the URO pushed the novocaine in too quickly, and if that caused the pain, or if I'm simply susceptible to pain in that area while most others are not. Curious.",

And doubling dose of Tamsulosin didn\u2019t relieve BPH symptoms so switched yesterday to Rapaflo ($275 out of pocket, yikes) to see if it will help me get more than 2 hours of sleep at a time.

      "Content": "I'm curious why my PSA just dropped. Could it have something to do with the fact that I had an 18-core biopsy Oct 18, 2018? Or does it simply fluctuate? You'll see in my signature that I just got a low risk result on a genomic test and have gone on AS. I'm glad to get a lower PSA w/higher free percent, but does it actually means something at this point? PSA History: - Nov/2017 - 2.97, Free 0.688 ng/ml, 23% - Feb/2018 - 2.97, Free 0.621, 20.9% - May/2018 - 3.15, Free 0.604, 19.2% - Dec/2018 - 2.7, Free 0.62, 23% On a side note, I had to drop the year as a reference in my signature because the \"8\" in \"2018\" kept coming up as a happy face, which blocked the save feature. Any idea how to remove this?",

I have two hotspots of Gleason 7 (3+4) (5% and 10%) and one Gleason 6 (3+3) and am waiting for genomic test results to see if I'm a candidate for active surveillance. I like the sounds of this kind of treatment and the smaller chance of traumatic side effects of surgery or radiation. I haven't heard of these kinds of treatments as options.

      "Content": "Originally Posted by Michael F Warm Welcome Rad1964! Very sorry that you have joined \"The PCa Club\" but very glad that you have found The Forum! Fortunately most PCas tend to progress very slowly. This may have started 10 years ago. His Primary Care MD is to be commended for investigating the elevated PSA! Thus, now is the time to relax a bit, digest the diagnosis and begin your research into PCa and the treatment options that may be available to your husband. You are already taking these steps forward masterfully! Kudos to you! Your new Forum Brother (FB) Southsider has provided solid suggestions. You will receive lots of support and friendship every step of this Journey to Cure!

      "Content": "Originally Posted by Michael F Warm Welcome Rad1964! Very sorry that you have joined \"The PCa Club\" but very glad that you have found The Forum! Fortunately most PCas tend to progress very slowly. This may have started 10 years ago. His Primary Care MD is to be commended for investigating the elevated PSA! Thus, now is the time to relax a bit, digest the diagnosis and begin your research into PCa and the treatment options that may be available to your husband. You are already taking these steps forward masterfully! Kudos to you! Your new Forum Brother (FB) Southsider has provided solid suggestions. You will receive lots of support and friendship every step of this Journey to Cure! IMO, sending the Bx slides to Dr Epstein may not be of great benefit since Active Surveillance (AS) is off the table. Especially, if surgery turns out to be the best treatment option, his surgical Pathology Report will supersede the Bx Pathology. There is a wealth of information contained at the top of The Forum page including suggested reading publications. Be sure to attend all of his MD consultation appointments. A 2nd set of ears is always best as men tend to have selective hearing. Keep a list questions and write down the answers. You will get through this! Simply take it one step at a time. Best wishes. MF Is active surveillance off the table? It sounds like AS is still an option.",

I don't like the side effects of stuffiness, headache, insomnia, altered orgasm, and dizziness, but I'll take these over the alternative of not being able to pee at night. I was put on Tamsulosin initially because my blood pressure is generally on the low side and was told by my GP it would have less of an effect on blood pressure than the alternatives. I see there are two alternatives to Tamsulosin (Flomax): -- Rapaflo (Silodosin) -- Alfuzosin (Curoxatral) I think Alfuzosin reduces blood pressure more than Tamsulosin, which will not be a good thing for me. Also, Rapaflo warns against use if you have glaucoma, which I do. However, I'm wondering if anyone has experience with more than one of these drugs, and their effect on side effects, be it good or bad, pros or cons.",
