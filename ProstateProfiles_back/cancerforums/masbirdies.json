      "Content": "Originally Posted by FrankP Hi Everyone, It has been almost 11 months since my Radical Robotic Prostatectomy performed by Dr. David Samadi @ Lennox Hill Hospital in NYC. My incontinence is gone completely. I have one major issue and that is I get a terrible, severe pain in my large hip muscles in my but and surrounding area when I get \"Aroused\" and I start to get an erection. It feels like a wave of pain that is like a \"Brain Freeze\" but in my hips, all across my backside. I don't this pain any other times except when I am getting a stimulated erection. I have type II diabetes and maybe it is neuropathy pain? This pain is so severe that I stops me from having a natural erection. Has anyone experienced this pain condition??? What are your experiences and what have you done to treat this??? FrankP I wish I had answers for you! I am somewhat in the same boat in that I am having sharp pains in my right hip that come and go. They aren't arousal related. I've heard this is common and may last for quite some time. In your case, all most a year seems extreme, but not unbelievable. Have you mentioned this to your doc?",

      "Content": "Looking for an assist regarding bladder spasm? I still have the catheter in (out tomorrow). Releasing liquids well, most always yellow unless I sit too long or have a BM. I had a little trouble about 4 days ago with blood squirting around the catheter during BM. That has ceased and now it's just a spot of urine that creeps by and not 100% of the time. One thing that has started over the last 24 hours is a feeling of pressure behind the penis when I have a BM. It feels like a burning with pressure, however, I'm reluctant to use the word \"burning\" as that doesn't quite fit the bill. If this is not a bladder spasm, then I haven't had one. Anyone else feel a sensation similar to this and if not a bladder spasm, what is it? PS...I have no other associated bladder pain when resting, walking or sitting. This is only durning a BM....or just before as the BM builds.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by Wilde Well, you can expect days like this for some time. Too much Kegels can do it and so can too few. In my case it was mostly too much Kegels, too few was basically when I forgot about them totally for a couple of days. Also in the beginning the more you move around the more it leaks which is tricky since you need to move around also. But you are only two weeks out, I needed 6 weeks to be back to one small squirt/day. And also the recovery is not linear and bad days will come but more and more seldom. Try to just forget the bad days, they mean nothing for your recovery. I still keep a pad and a pair of briefs in my briefcase...... That's great feeback and great to know. I was expecting linear progress. Like everything else my brain is retooling for, it will for this too! lol. I am noticing that I am holding more in the bladder so that may have something to do with the increased leakage. Got to get the pelvic floor muscles stronger to handle more ozs. in the bladder??????!!!!!!",

      "Content": "Today is 16 days since cath removed. I was making great progress with incontinence. Went from 8 pads a day down to 2 real quick. I switched to shields 2 days ago. Yesterday, a real set back. dribble, dribble, dribble. It was still a 2 pad day, however, it felt like I was dribbling constantly...which was way different than when I switched to the pads. Today is much the same. Anyone experience this and suggestions. Too much kegels, not enough kegels! FRUSTRATED!",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by Wilde Well, you can expect days like this for some time. Too much Kegels can do it and so can too few. In my case it was mostly too much Kegels, too few was basically when I forgot about them totally for a couple of days. Also in the beginning the more you move around the more it leaks which is tricky since you need to move around also. But you are only two weeks out, I needed 6 weeks to be back to one small squirt/day. And also the recovery is not linear and bad days will come but more and more seldom. Try to just forget the bad days, they mean nothing for your recovery. I still keep a pad and a pair of briefs in my briefcase...... That's great feeback and great to know. I was expecting linear progress. Like everything else my brain is retooling for, it will for this too! lol. I am noticing that I am holding more in the bladder so that may have something to do with the increased leakage. Got to get the pelvic floor muscles stronger to handle more ozs. in the bladder??????!!!!!!",

They are now kicking in when I stand up from sitting (not every time) along with the BMs. Oh well, if nothing else, I'll be at the docs at 10am.",

      "Content": "One thing I don't like about the VED, my incontinence is getting to almost nothing. The VED makes me dribble a bit after using. Must be pulling some on that uretha bladder connection!?. It is seemingly working to help restore normal hanging size and functionality. My lil buddy was much shorter after surgery. Part of this is due to having a very puffy area in the pelvic area just above the penis and below the waste line (anyone else experience this?) not sure if this area is still a bit bloated from the surgery (had hernia repair down there too). I do know my stomach is still a bit bloated 7 weeks after. So, I would assume that area is. When I press it down a bit the lil buddy is longer but, still shorter than normal. After using the VED a few days, the normal hanging look is getting better and the other day, I looked down and saw a half woody hanging there. A great sign the nerves might be thawing out.",

With x being a number less than 100%. Did someone on here know they had 50% cut out and still get back to a good erection? How about x % ( more than 50 but less than 100) cut away and the plumbing still eventually worked? Thanks Ps....level before surgery was very good",

Don't make any twisting motions or lift heavy yet. I am 4.5 weeks from surgery. I had a hernia repair at the same time as RALP and that added to my discomfort. I know what you mean about the small wins go sleeping on your back. I am just getting to where I can sleep on my sides comfortably. I have no tightness on my left side but still feel some on the right side where the hernia was repaired. My sutures are looking good. The glue and scabs all fell off within the last couple of days.

If I don't drink beer or wine at night I am fine. If I do, even 1 can or beer or 1 glass of vino, I leak and get up several times during the night. This happened last night. I had one glass of wine and I got up every 2 hours last night. So, today, I've decided to quit drinking any alcohol for a few nights. Alcohol is a diuretic and a bladder stimulate causing more frequent urination and more leaks for me. I am almost continent so giving up a few nights might be the trick to getting over the hump and resting a bit better. I have one cup of coffee in the AM. It doesn't seem to bother me! One thing I am doing is trying to hold my bladder until I feel like I'm going to bust. Even at the expense of a little leakage. The reason is I'm trying to stretch it out and rewire my brain as to when it needs to empty. I am noticing that I am holding a lot more this week. Close to my normal before the surgery.

      "Content": "HI! I'm Bill, One thing I'd recommend is not to use Vaseline. It is petro based. The hospital gave me little packs of a KY Jelly knockoff. I used that for the lubrication around the cath. I would push the head of little buddy as far down the cath line as I could and then lubricate the cath line. That worked great. No issues really with pain except once when I forgot to do it. After awhile, it hurt a little but stopped when it got the gel. For after the cath comes out, I would use good pads vs cheap ones. Tena, Depends, etc...are good. I would not get Walmart or off brands. I would buy very few diapers. Just a small pack. You can keep pads in the diapers and just change those. Also, I got some adult \"baby-rash\" ointment called Balmex and some large adult wipes called Assurance. Every time I changed a pad I would wipe good with the wipes and then liberally apply Balmex. That stuff was a real comfort as the twins would get irritable and itchy from the pads. Also, I changed a pad whether it needed it or not after a few hours. I kept one on for 12 hours once and even though it was very dry, I felt it was over due for a new one. They are inexpensive! Ask the hospital for a leg bag as well as the normal cath bag. The leg bag works for walks outside the house, quick trips to the store, etc... My doc did not recommend Neosporin. The KY knock-off they provided did everything necessary down there. He also did not recommend the lidocaine ointment for numbing where the cath comes out. I cleaned my cath bag with white vinegar and water. Do not get in the shower with the bag unplugged. Have either the normal bag or leg bag plugged in at all times. You are trying to keep a sterile environment. Leaving the cath line unplugged in a hot shower is just asking for trouble. Make sure to have plenty of alcohol swab packs or cotton balls and a bottle. Clean the cath line every time it comes out. Be prepared for bladder spasms. I had to have my cath in 2 weeks longer than normal because my bladder was leaking at the suture joint. Whenever I had a bowel movement or emptied the cath bag too fast, I would have a bladder spasm. They are not pleasant. Hopefully, your cath comes out QUICK! I was very comfortable in my normal gym shorts. I am big Adidas fan! All of my shorts are that brand. They worked very well. Walk, Walk, Walk, Walk! as much as possible after the surgery. Around the house, outside....just walk! I would forget the meal they give you in the hospital until you pass that first fart or bowel movement. OMG....the worst pain I had was for about 5 hours the evening my bowels started waking up.....the second day after surgery. The first day out of surgery, I had little hunger. The second day, I was really hungry and ate a little more than I should have. Man, was it rough passing the gas that was in the system. I thought I was going to blow my sutures out. A couple of times I thought I was going to pass out. I just kept walking and walking and finally....what my son calls the best fart he's ever heard. He said it sounded like a machine made it! lol. It was pretty funny....and total relief when it came out. There wasn't a lot of stuff that I had to stock up on. My hospital sent me home with pretty much every thing I needed. I did get a doughnut and the thing busted. I got it from Walgreens and the damn thing was like $20. I need to return it. It really didn't help all that much when I used it. Make sure to take the stool softeners. I had a hernia repair at the same time as my RALP. I had a different level of pain than most on this site. I did take the pain pills I was prescribed. I did not have constipation issues because of the stool softeners and because I drank a ton of water and kept my diet really bland for a few days. My favorite was a home made chicken noodle soup. Also, I drank some prune juice around day 2 but be careful.....that stuff can really make you loose....too loose. I didn't stay with it as once I got flowing....the prune juice was too much! Give yourself time to heal! I enjoyed turning off the phone and staying off the internet for a few days. I really enjoyed series bingeing and movies for a couple of days straight. Everyone in the world wants to talk to you. Handle that the way you want. I had my daughter keep everyone posted via facebook and phone calls for a couple of days then started to call or take calls a few at a time. Again, my pain level was different in that I had two procedures, in the same area, at the same time. You may feel totally like talking, texting, etc... I didn't! Hope there is something in here that can give you some help! Bill",

      "Content": "HI! I'm Bill, One thing I'd recommend is not to use Vaseline. It is petro based. The hospital gave me little packs of a KY Jelly knockoff. I used that for the lubrication around the cath. I would push the head of little buddy as far down the cath line as I could and then lubricate the cath line. That worked great. No issues really with pain except once when I forgot to do it. After awhile, it hurt a little but stopped when it got the gel. For after the cath comes out, I would use good pads vs cheap ones. Tena, Depends, etc...are good. I would not get Walmart or off brands. I would buy very few diapers. Just a small pack. You can keep pads in the diapers and just change those. Also, I got some adult \"baby-rash\" ointment called Balmex and some large adult wipes called Assurance. Every time I changed a pad I would wipe good with the wipes and then liberally apply Balmex. That stuff was a real comfort as the twins would get irritable and itchy from the pads. Also, I changed a pad whether it needed it or not after a few hours. I kept one on for 12 hours once and even though it was very dry, I felt it was over due for a new one. They are inexpensive! Ask the hospital for a leg bag as well as the normal cath bag. The leg bag works for walks outside the house, quick trips to the store, etc... My doc did not recommend Neosporin. The KY knock-off they provided did everything necessary down there. He also did not recommend the lidocaine ointment for numbing where the cath comes out. I cleaned my cath bag with white vinegar and water. Do not get in the shower with the bag unplugged. Have either the normal bag or leg bag plugged in at all times. You are trying to keep a sterile environment. Leaving the cath line unplugged in a hot shower is just asking for trouble. Make sure to have plenty of alcohol swab packs or cotton balls and a bottle. Clean the cath line every time it comes out. Be prepared for bladder spasms. I had to have my cath in 2 weeks longer than normal because my bladder was leaking at the suture joint. Whenever I had a bowel movement or emptied the cath bag too fast, I would have a bladder spasm. They are not pleasant. Hopefully, your cath comes out QUICK! I was very comfortable in my normal gym shorts. I am big Adidas fan! All of my shorts are that brand. They worked very well. Walk, Walk, Walk, Walk! as much as possible after the surgery. Around the house, outside....just walk!

I just read your post and looked at my stomach and noticed that a black and blue belt has appeared, especially on the left side. My left hip hurt for awhile yesterday but then the pain went away. The bruising must be from the surgery. I was told pre=op my face might be bloated because for part of it I'd be upside down. No bloat there but some in my stomach still. I have managed the mild pain without meds so far although I have taken some prescribed adavan so I can sleep with the catheter. Catheter comes out in two days--yeeha! I had massive bruising on both sides but the left was really bad. Had me worried but 4 weeks later, it's gone. Still some stomach bloating but nothing like the first 2 weeks",

I was diagnosed June 26th 2015 and my life has been turned upside down in a few weeks. I was due for open surgery yesterday 18th August 2015 but this was cancelled last Friday due to my Diabetes sugars being too high. (I was diagnosed with Type 2 Diabetes at the same time as my cancer). I am hoping to have the op mid September now. As you can tell I am not the luckiest person (Ha Ha) I am just after a bit of advise as to how long is the recovery period after Radical surgery? This is my first operation ever and I am nervous as you can probably tell. Any help would be gladly received. Thank you Mark Hi Mark, Sorry you are here, but... You will be glad you found this forum. I had a large inguinal hernia that was repaired at the same time as my RALP. Today is my 6 week anniversary from surgery and I am feeling great. I have light incontenience and feel ill have that licked soon. There are signs that my little buddy wants to wake up but still a long way to go there. Looking back, I had a much tougher time than most as I had 2 procedures at once. So the first 2-3 weeks were a bit tougher but are now just a blur. 6 weeks is not all that long unless u are looking at it in front of you. The main thing I would focus on now is diet and whatever u can do to keep the Type 2 in check. With the Gleason score you have you want that stuff out of u ASAP. I knew I had some G 4 (4+3) and I was bummed that it took almost 3 months from the time I schedule my surgery. Keep reading, but, don't overthink it. Get up that great day and know u will be free of a creature inside of you. Treat it like you are getting down to business and it will go fast. Once they give you the happy shot, you won't know jack until it's all over. If you a really anxious during pre-op (which usually is about an hour before surgery), tell them you are and they will probably give you something to ease your mind. I didn't do that cause I had a lot of questions of all the people that were coming in a pReparing for the surgery. I wanted to be clear of what I was asking and the answers given. Again, I had 2 procedures going on so there were 2 sets of surgical teams stopping by, the medicine man, nurses, etc.... Best wishes and keep us up to date",

Then all the sudden, he got feeling really weird and went to the ER. They couldn't figure out what was wrong with him and he kept getting worse. They finally figured out the stent had failed and he was in a major dilemma. I'm sure yours is nothing like that and not trying to stress you out. You are doing the right thing in taking nothing for granted and having it checked out. Best Wishes and tons of positive vibes coming your way!",

I waited about 3 days after it was out and began having my normal 1-2 glasses with my meals. My Drs assistant said none for 4 weeks and i asked if that was to ward off those that might tie one on reguarlary vs. they causual drinker. He said try 1 or 2 and if there are issues stop. Alcohol is a bladder stimulate and it could cause problems. I have a little more leakage after a couple glasses of wine, however, 1 week from cath removal and i am making good progress....staying dry at night and sitting and reducing my squirts daily. Down to 2 pads a day. So, thats my accounting of my experience. As always, your mileage may vary",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by PDV Hello all, I've mentioned this in other threads but I have not got a lot of feedback. A couple weeks ago, three weeks post surgery, I was laid low by excruciating pain in my abdomen. I spent five days in the hospital diagnosed with an infected lymphocele. I have a drain in my stomach now and it will probably be there for at least a couple more weeks. Unless I misheard them, my surgery team indicated this is fairly common but the more I read online the less common I think it is. Has anyone else on this forum ever had one? My Doc orders an 8week pelvic ultrasound. It discovered a small lymphocele . They said nothing to worry about as it was small and risk of infection was extremely low. They told me they are very common when lymph nodes are removed.",

      "Content": "I copied and pasted this from a response in one of my other threads in the hopes it would be more visible to those gobbling up prostate surgery experiences Well, today is 30 days post op and 11 days post cath. Exactly 1 week from start of kegels. The first few days, I was going through 8-9 pads a day . Started the kegels and now I am down to 2-3. I washed the car by hand yesterday (bought a new car as a present for my new start) and it felt as though I was back to day 1 with the cath out. Dribble dribble dribble. However, I weighed the pad and it wasn't much at all. When I sit or lie down I am not leaking at all. I can usually hold until I get to the bathroom without a leak....the most just. A dribble. The urine output is anywhere from a lot to a little. If I have been on my feet for awhile, it's a short pee. Sitting or lying down, then going, I get a normal amount. The stream is about the same as pre-op. Maybe a little stronger. I still have a bit of discomfort at times with a slight burning sensation while the stream is flowing or shortly after. Not as much as the day or two after the cath was pulled but it's still there from time to time. Most of my sutures have healed and the scabs have fallen off. You can barely see the stomach scars. The one on top of the navel is more noticable but looks good....pretty pleased if that's all there is. I still have 2 glue scabs left and they both look ready to drop anytime. I feel like I'm getting there. Little buddy felt like he was trying to wake up a bit in the days I take the Viagra. (My insurance paid for it btw). However, no firmness. Just the sensation that it's trying to do something...especially in the head of the penis. I'm hoping next week is another big improvement in the leak department. I may buy some shields and see how they work out..",
