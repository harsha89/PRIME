    "Content": "Hello- My name is Edward From Florida and I'd sincerely appreciate any advice / guidance some here may provide: I'm a healthy 59 year old male with an increasing PSA reading over the last 5 years. Back in 2013 my PSA reading was at 4.6 and it steadily increased over the years to a current reading of 17.5 which was verified as my blood work taken twice over 5 weeks. I have had three negative biopsies and 18 months ago I had an MRI which indicated a two small mass with a PIRADS score of 4. I believe my urologist, that is also a part-time assistant Professor of Urology at a major medical school in Florida will suggest yet another biopsy. Any suggestions ??? Anything different you would do if you were in my predicament ? Thanks, Edward God Bless",
