      "Content": "Hi everyone, I'm new to the forum. My husband (70yo) was diagnosed with stage T2b, gleason score 7 prostate cancer in July 2017. He has been seeing an oncologist at Sloan Kettering Cancer Center and they are recommending SHARP (Stereotactic Hypofractionated Accelerated Radiation Therapy). It sounds good with only 5 radiation treatments instead of the 40-45 with other treatments. His appointment to have the markers inserted is in November and I was looking for anyone who has gone through this before. I can't find much info on it searching the internet. I would like to hear experiences from other people.",
