      "Content": "Sorry to see that you have to be here looking for advice, but as mentioned by other posters only you and your husband can decide what's the best treatment option. Many here often refer to how you are \"wired\" in making treatment choices, for some for some prolonging life at any cost is worth it for others quality of life is most important. The fact that you are here asking, indicates to me at least, that as a couple you are probably \"wired\" to forego dubious life prolonging treatment and instead concentrate on maximizing the quality of the remaining time you have together. You might seek another opinion but the numbers you have presented pretty much speak for themselves. In my case, I am going to succumb to something other than PCa in the next few years and I have chosen to maximize the quality of life both for myself and my family. I must say that once I made that decision, and with the support of my family I find this is the best time of my life and I wake up each morning savoring the time we have together and go to sleep each night satisfied I had lived one more of our days together to its fullest. But I and my family are \"wired\" that way. I would suggest both of you to do some soul searching to come up what is the best course for you. There is no right or wrong answer only the best one for you.",

      "Content": "I have been on 5mg/day of finasteride for about a year and a half. It dropped my PSA from 11.18 to 4.00 over the course of about a year. There is some debate about how much to multiply the finasteride PSA value to approximate pre drug levels, some say 2x others say 2.3x after a few years on the drug. The fact is that no one knows for sure but most research shows the drop should be large (40-70%) in the absence of clinically significant cancer. It sounds to me what your urologist is proposing is what is called the \"Finasteride Challenge\". That is your PSA should drop by at least 50% within 3-6 months after taking the drug, if the PSA does not drop by at least half during that time or if it stays the same or even increases then there is a likelihood that clinically significant cancer may be present. I tend to look at it as a way to filter the noise out of the PSA values. Additionally, there are some studies out there that indicate finasteride increases the chance of a positive biopsy, probably due to the fact that it will decrease the size of the prostate thus increasing the chance they will hit something. I have not had any side effects to speak of from taking the drug but some men experience very troubling side effects including growing man boobs, loss of libeto, ED etc., that at least in a few men may continue even after the use of the drug is stopped. If it is prescribed I'd want a MD with a lot of experience in its use and who has a through understanding of the potential side effects and most importantly has communicated that information to you so you know what to look out for....",

      "Content": "Can certainly understand your frustration but if you could fill in a few other details it might make his hesitancy more easy to understand. What is his PSA, the doubling time, what is his age, how is his health, what is his family history besides his brother, does he have other co-morbities? A biopsy is the sensible first step for the vast majority of men suspected of having PCa but not for all, for a small number the answer to those questions is critical because for a small minority of men a biopsy is not trivial and serious even life threatening complications may insue and other tests including a 3T Mri may be more appropriate given the answer to those questions...remember treatment for suspected or confirmed PCA is almost never an emergency... IMO what you really need to do is to have a heart to heart with him and understand his concerns so that both of you go forward together. Good luck",

      "Content": "I have been on 5mg/day of finasteride for about a year and a half. It dropped my PSA from 11.18 to 4.00 over the course of about a year. There is some debate about how much to multiply the finasteride PSA value to approximate pre drug levels, some say 2x others say 2.3x after a few years on the drug. The fact is that no one knows for sure but most research shows the drop should be large (40-70%) in the absence of clinically significant cancer. It sounds to me what your urologist is proposing is what is called the \"Finasteride Challenge\". That is your PSA should drop by at least 50% within 3-6 months after taking the drug, if the PSA does not drop by at least half during that time or if it stays the same or even increases then there is a likelihood that clinically significant cancer may be present. I tend to look at it as a way to filter the noise out of the PSA values. Additionally, there are some studies out there that indicate finasteride increases the chance of a positive biopsy, probably due to the fact that it will decrease the size of the prostate thus increasing the chance they will hit something. I have not had any side effects to speak of from taking the drug but some men experience very troubling side effects including growing man boobs, loss of libeto, ED etc., that at least in a few men may continue even after the use of the drug is stopped. If it is prescribed I'd want a MD with a lot of experience in its use and who has a through understanding of the potential side effects and most importantly has communicated that information to you so you know what to look out for....",

      "Content": "Sorry to see that you have to be here looking for advice, but as mentioned by other posters only you and your husband can decide what's the best treatment option. Many here often refer to how you are \"wired\" in making treatment choices, for some for some prolonging life at any cost is worth it for others quality of life is most important. The fact that you are here asking, indicates to me at least, that as a couple you are probably \"wired\" to forego dubious life prolonging treatment and instead concentrate on maximizing the quality of the remaining time you have together. You might seek another opinion but the numbers you have presented pretty much speak for themselves. In my case, I am going to succumb to something other than PCa in the next few years and I have chosen to maximize the quality of life both for myself and my family. I must say that once I made that decision, and with the support of my family I find this is the best time of my life and I wake up each morning savoring the time we have together and go to sleep each night satisfied I had lived one more of our days together to its fullest. But I and my family are \"wired\" that way. I would suggest both of you to do some soul searching to come up what is the best course for you. There is no right or wrong answer only the best one for you.",

The lesion can be caused by many things other than cancer, the biopsy will sample the lesion to find out what is there.

      "Content": "Brownie Can certainly understand your wanting to get started as soon as possible. A drop in the PSA due to treatment won't affect your rating. You will be responsible for the Medicare Advantage copay's at the University, their financial department can give you an estimate of how much it will be depending on the type of Advantage plan you have. It could be expensive depending on your particular plan and how much you you have used Medicare so far this year. It should not be a problem having your PCP write a script for the ADT. If the ADT is on the VA formulary you can continue with that. Generally the VA formulary is more extensive than what is offered by the advantage plans so its possible you won't have to change. As Dog mentioned getting a referral to Oncology by your PCP should not be a problem. If your VA doesn't have a oncology department that's when Veterans Choice comes in. In the unlikely event your pcp won't refer you then get the Veterans Advocate at your facility involved. As for the ED issues your pcp or oncologist can prescribe something to deal with that. Dog can probably give you more info on the additional rating. One other thing you might want to consider. Since you are already enrolled you can switch between Medicare Advantage plans between October 15th and December 7th for coverage beginning January 1st. Depending on what area of the country you are in you might be able to find a more cost effective plan to fit your needs going forward. I've been in the VHC system for almost longer than I can remember and have received excellent care but some guys don't want to deal with it for anything more than their prescriptions and having the best Advantage plan possible may work for them.

Also although it can take forever to get an appointment if something is urgent they have gotten me an appointment in a day or two. I just noticed you are on medicare. You need to be aware that medicare and VHC are totally separate and do not work together. If you want the VA to cover it you need to have them make the diagnosis and set up a treatment plan. Its ok for them to go off what your medicare providers found but you need to be careful how your treatment would be billed by your medicare providers. If its not done right you could end up with a bill from either medicare or the VA. Its complicated, PM if you have more specific questions.",

      "Content": "If the expense is a concern I'd definitely go with the VA. My PCP like most in the VA system is very good at accommodating my treatment choices. Also although it can take forever to get an appointment if something is urgent they have gotten me an appointment in a day or two. I just noticed you are on medicare. You need to be aware that medicare and VHC are totally separate and do not work together. If you want the VA to cover it you need to have them make the diagnosis and set up a treatment plan. Its ok for them to go off what your medicare providers found but you need to be careful how your treatment would be billed by your medicare providers. If its not done right you could end up with a bill from either medicare or the VA. Its complicated, PM if you have more specific questions.",

The caution I have is that should you receive PCa care that is billed to Medicare, you are responsible for the 20% copay unless you have a supplemental or advantage plan. The VA will not pick up that 20%.....",

At the same time there are plenty of statistics that show those of Northern European ancestry for example are more likely to be diagnosed with a genitic disorder such as hemochromatosis, than Africans, that untreated, will kill them far quicker than PCa or for that matter and many other cancers. Although there are many correlations between ethnicity and susceptibility to a particular cancer what is unknown is whether a particular race predisposes one to PCa or any other cancer. Cancer has been around for millions of years, its a safe bet that PCa as with all cancers is not politically correct.....but one having a particular racial background would be wise to heed the statistics and act in their best interests...",

It looks like Finasteride dropped your PSA by about two thirds similar to my experience with the drug. I'm certainly no expert and everyone is different but my intuition would be that it very well could take at least as long to go up as it did to down.... so taking a year or two after long term use to come to a true value might be a reasonable guess. I have neurological issues, recent testing shows my bladder has stopped working and I have to self catheterize 4-6 times a day. I would think your URO would want to do a cystocopy and urodynamic testing to zero in on the cause of your urinary symptoms.

      "Content": "Although only a biopsy can diagnose prostate cancer the 3T MRI is becoming an good tool to determine who may need a biopsy and locating areas of suspicion for a later targeted biopsy.. The MRI is scored with the PIRADS system that goes from 1-5 as follows: \u2022PI-RADS 1: very low (clinically significant cancer is highly unlikely to be present) \u2022PI-RADS 2: low (clinically significant cancer is unlikely to be present) \u2022PI-RADS 3: intermediate (the presence of clinically significant cancer is equivocal) \u2022PI-RADS 4: high (clinically significant cancer is likely to be present) \u2022PI-RADS 5: very high (clinically significant cancer is highly likely to be present) It sounds like you are a PIRADS 2. Most urologists would defer doing a biopsy at this time based on your score. Also a fluctuating PSA may indicate BPH or prostitis rather than PCa, which usually shows a steady increase. You want to ask the urologist his reasoning for the biopsy with the low PIRADS score....it could be that he needs to pay his kids fall tuition...",

      "Content": "Steve I self catheterize but I'm not an expert.... 1. A duet catheter is a Foley catheter with 2 balloons it is marketed by Poiesis under the brand name Duette its still a Foley catheter, I suspect your urologist thinks all Foley catheters whether with one or two balloons are the same. 2. DO NOT try to remove it on your own. You will seriously damage your bladder and cause more problems than you all ready have. If you are determined to remove it go to your nearest ER immediately and have them do it Good luck Joe",

      "Content": "Hi TB I don't know about the costs of the particular institution, but remember that it would be 20% or 40% of the Medicare allowable costs. For example, say the hospital charges $100,000 but medicare only allows $30,000. The maximum your father would be responsible for at 20% would be $6000 not $20,000 or and at 40% $12,000 not $40,000. You should be able to get an estimate from the institution before beginning treatment. But remember you need estimates from the hospital, surgeons, radiologists, anesthesiologists everybody and you also need to make sure they accept Medicare. From your description it sounds like your Dad has Medicare Part C... a Medicare Advantage Plan. The open enrollment period is coming up around October 15th for changes starting January 1, 2018. It might be wise to shop around for a plan that will meet his needs better that his present plan during that period. The monthly premium will likely be higher than what he is paying now but with the costs he is facing it may be worth it. He is not eligible for a supplemental (the F,N,A etc plans), he needed to sign up within 6 months of when he first became eligible for medicare which for most people is age 65 unless he was covered by private insurance after age 65.",

As hard as it is to accept no one gets out of this life alive and at a certain point as hard as it is to do, you and/or your husband may want to start asking the questions nobody wants to ask. There is no right or wrong way to go about it, just the way that works for both of you. As a first step you might ask your doctor if palliative care would be appropriate at this point. There are many resources out there available to help but unfortunately for most docs and patients the questions come to late to take full advantage of what might be most helpful for both of you.

      "Content": "Can't comment on post RALP retention but I have been self catheterizing for close to two years and I can say that it definitely gets easier with time should he find it necessary to continue for awhile. The biggest challenge for most is getting over the mental barrier. If it has not cleared up in a month or two he should have a cytoscopy and a procedure called urodynamic testing. The testing will tell what the problem is and the cystocopy gives a close up look at the urethra and bladder. The three most common causes of urinary retention are urethral obstruction, malfunction of the detussor muscle in the bladder and nerve damage. Urethral obstruction can be fixed, problems with the detussor can usually be rehabilitated with time, nerve damage, which I have, is permanent. If it dosen't get better in a few months I'd caution him not to have any procedure until the cytoscopy and urodynamic testing are done. Most uro's have little experience with chronic urinary retention and their tendency is to keep trying things until they stumble on something that works....an academic medical center is the place to go if it persists.",

      "Content": "Hi Tinkerbell I've been following your story and posted a few times along the way. I know you are trying to do what is best for your dad because you love him so. If I could make a gentle observation that you should feel free to disregard. From your first posts it seemed your 69 year old father had a number of medical issues in addition to the PCa diagnosis, from your description of the consults it may be that you (and him?) have decided on the treatment you want him to have. The physician who has seen your dad and knows his medical history the best and is not focused on \"cure\" is the one you like the least.....Aggressive treatment in a 69 year old with the co-morbidities you described in your earlier posts does not always end well. Every one has to make their own treatment choices, again trying not to be critical, I'd suggest you sit down and have a heart to heart with your dad to find out what HE wants and not what he thinks you want for him. I have a young wife and daughter and know how difficult it can be to do whats best ultimately for them when dealing with what they want for me now. There are many options available and reading into your care and concern I think you need to go the extra mile for both of you in assuring he makes the right choice for him no matter how hard that may be for you.... Good luck and God Bless",

I would be curious if anyone else has been a similar situation and how they handled it.",

      "Content": "\"However, this must be pointed out that what MD Anderson state is the NORM,\" You are correct, the top treatment centers across the board seem to have a similar policy. The interesting thing to me is that this information has not filtered into the forums dealing with prostate cancer. I've been sampling the various forums out there and it seems all have either a subtle or a very pronounced bias toward a particular treatment selection. I guess what I'm saying is that it's unfortunate that it is seemingly impossible for anyone with low risk disease (or even to get a accurate definition of low risk disease) or with co-morbidities to get an unbiased and straight forward assessment of their options regardless of age. The MD's most of us see are peddling their trade, the forums one might visit are frequented by those with positive/negative outcomes and they are naturally arguing for/against a particular treatment.",

All surgery has inherent risks and most studies show it takes at least 10 years for the risks of prostrate surgery to out weigh the benefit. AS means just that, your are actively engaged in your treatment and should something change you can address it. At my age and with the other problems I have I pretty much won't add to them by adding any more risk, for me QOL now is my priority. Because your MD's are recommending AS I'd consider sitting down and having a frank discussion with them. If they are recommending AS solely based on your age I'd be skeptical but if their recommendation is based on your age and other aspects of your health history (co-morbidities) I'd want to know. Of course what to do is a decision only you can make..",

Of course the 5 reductase inhibitors reduce the PSA values which can make tracking PCa more difficult..everything is a trade off..

      "Content": "I find it a bit mystifying that any Doc would subject an 81 year old to an invasive biopsy without first doing non invasive imaging preferably a 3T MRI. It would seem with a PSA of 85 and a Gleason of 8 imaging alone would have been enough.... even more mystifying, to me at least, is why the Doc didn't clearly lay out the risks to someone your age and the treatment options including the option for no treatment if PCa was detected.... Unfortunately, in some cases, patients needs come behind the Doc's need for a new boat or their kids next semester college tuition....",

      "Content": "Hi Bill The MD's treating your MS should be interacting with the MD's treating your PCa to determine the best course forward. As you are probably aware MS is an autoimmune disease and radiation can have a profound effect on the immune system. I suspect the concern is not SE's but the possibility that radiation could irreparably damage your immune system with potentially dire consequences. If I recall correctly there are at least 5 types of MS and only the physicians treating your MS would be knowledgeable enough of your particular case to guide the Doc's treating your PCa going forward. I also have neurological concerns and have found that it is impossible to isolate and treat one aliment without that treatment having an effect on the rest of my body. You are one of those patients with a \"complex\" medical history and to be treated effectively all of the MD's treating you need to be on board with a treatment plan that takes all of your conditions into account. I've found that having one MD that is aware of your entire medical situation who can advise you and who can direct your care by coordinating with all the specialists involved works best. You can't do it on your own. Good luck...",

He is concerned traveling with a catheter in (but it has been 3 weeks with it and he is adjusting for now). Worried about germs and bacteria. Worried about being tired. Worried, worried, worried. But I know time is fleeting and he will forever be grateful to have these memories and moreso to GIVE these memories to us and his grandkids. I can certainly understand your Dad's concerns and worries. You might ask his MD's if fitting him with a suprapubic catheter is possible this close to your planned trip. Many men with long term urinary retention find them more convenient and less prone to infection than the Foley. Good luck and hoping you have a great trip.",

      "Content": "Hi I've been taking 5mg/day of Finasteride since last October. After about 3 months it dropped the PSA from 11 to 5 and prostate had shrunk to about 35 cm. My docs told me the response did not rule out PCa but it made it less likely that it is aggressive. They become concerned when the PSA drops less than 50% or even rises while taking it, they referred to it as the \"Finasteride challenge\". I'm doing a 3T MRI next week Some guys have sexual side effects such as ED from the drug but for me its has been side effect free. As always everyone is different ..good luck to you and your hubby..",

      "Content": "I think how one is wired is actually the most important factor in one's choice of treatment. For the majority here watchful waiting or active surveillance are not even considered as treatment for PCa. I have posted in previous threads my PSA values over the last 10 years but in short it's increased from around 3 to about 9 or 10 today, my primary care provider has had me repeatedly sign off on the fact that I most assuredly have PCa, that they have advised me of that fact, and I have refused treatment. Due to the other risk factors in my particular case, this course makes the most sense to me, and therefore I have chosen to simply live with it, because that's the way I'm wired. I know others in my same situation would pursue more aggressive treatment. As I look back over the last 10 years, in my particular case, I'm sure choosing aggressive treatment would have always made me wonder what would have happened if I had done nothing. I think what it comes down to is to trust your gut. There is no right or wrong course of treatment only the best one for you...",

The biopsy on Thursday will help get that issue sorted out. As far as an interim solution to resolve the pee issue, its possible the Flomax would begin working well enough by the end of July for your father to void naturally, if not he could use a catheter. With a catheter there are three options. A Foley catheter with the which is what he got at the ER, having the bag attached makes it less than ideal for travel but its possible. The second is a suprapubic catheter which involves inserting a catheter directly into the bladder through an incision in the lower abdomen above the pubic bone. They have a valve and a detachable bag which would make travel easier. The third option is self catherization or CIC (Clean Intermitant Catherization) the system I use and what people with spinal chord injuries use. This involves inserting a catheter into the urethra and emptying the bladder when needed. This works really well for people who can do it. I PM'd you a link to more information on CIC. Good luck.",
