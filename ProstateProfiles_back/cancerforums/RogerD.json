      "Content": "Originally Posted by Michael F Welcome Roger! Sorry that you have received the PCa Diagnosis but very glad that you have found The Forum and are asking questions in your quest to find the optimal treatment pathway that best addresses your pathology and psyche. A couple of questions: - What was your PSA history prior to age 55? - Where are you currently being treated? - Why is your MD talking about a clinical trial? - What clinical trial? 2nd opinions are strongly recommended. IMO, 2nd opinions should be mandated by the health Insurers! Bottom line is you want to be sure that you are treated by highly experienced expert MDs who specialize in treating PCa. Thus: - If Radiation: Be sure you are being treated by a URO Radiation Oncologist who is treating multiple PCa patients daily. Be sure that the center is using \"state-of-the-art\" equipment. Ask the Uro RO if he/she has a financial interest in the radiation center. - if Surgery: Be sure the URO Surgeon has done at least 300 (if robotic). Overall the surgeon should be averaging 3-5 radical prostatectomies (RPs) per week - Ask the MDs of you should consider getting a 2nd opinion on your Biopsy slides. Dr Epstein / Johns Hopkins routinely does this. The cost is quite reasonable. You are Gleason (4+4) which places you in a high risk category. The universal order of PCa treatment priorities is: - Cure - Continence - Erectile Function Ask each Specialist to give you their expected level of achievement of each category. Keep asking questions and seeking correct answers. Ultimately, you must rely on the expert judgement of your MDs to arrive at the best decision. Good luck getting to the final decision and treatment underway and finally behind you. Keep asking questions and keep optimistic. MF Unfortunately I did not have a PSA before June 2017, so no track record. Treatment is going to be at the Arizona Center for Cancer Care. I don't have the name of the trial but I am sure I could get if it would benefit anyone. The doctors assistant had said my numbers would make me eligible to participate, but when the Doctor talked to me he said it would not be a good idea because of the high probability of extracapsular extension. He was basing this recommendation after plugging my numbers into the Sloan Kettering Nomogram (https://www.mskcc.org/nomograms/prostate) and showing high probability of extension and low probability of organ confined.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by Another You're having the one shot anxiety. Surgery is possible after radiation, but not ideal, only a limited number of surgeons take it on due to the condition of radiated tissue, but it's not the point. The choice, radiation or surgery, each has it's pros and cons. Some choose it thinking one is better than the other which is only partially true. It's choice specific depending on the patient profile. Everyone has doubts. Once you choose don't look back. Definitely having the one shot anxiety. I don't want to be playing the what if game a year from now, but you are right - make the choice and don't look back. thanks",

      "Content": "I was in to setup for my EBT/hormone schedule and the doctor said I am eligible to participate in a study and I wanted to get some feedback from the community. The study is Protocol Number: RTOG-0924. (Comes up on top with a Google search). https://www.rtog.org/ClinicalTrials/...spx?study=0924 The study has a really long title but it is basically looking at shorter hormone therapy time and only hitting the prostate and seminal vesicles with radiation instead of the whole pelvis (lymph nodes). I am eligible apparently because I only had one core that was Gleason 8 (the other 3 that were positive were 7,7,6). It is a random study so I won't know ahead of time but I will either be in the group getting the standard treatment for my situation which would be: 44 treatments of radiation to the whole pelvis and 24 months of hormone treatment or the study treatment group: 44 treatments of radiation to the prostate and seminal vesicles and 6 months of hormone treatments I could leave the study at any time. If it doesn't work my other options for treatment would be the same as if I had done the standard treatment. The upside is that I would be participating in a study the might help people in the future with a shorter treatment for the same results. The downside is that if it doesn't work I have to go another 18 months on hormones and dealing with lymph nodes if cancer ended up there.",
