      "Content": "Ever heard stories about folks who checked their PSA's for a long period of time then failed to do so for a time, only to find there had been a recurrence? Well here I am. I was diagnosed in 2000 at 42, PSA 10, Gleason 7. Clean lab report. For 10 years until 2010 the PSA was 0.2 or lower, which my surgeon at the University of Michigan instructed me to use to define recurrence. I failed to check it since. Perhaps it became buried in the recesses of my mind or it was easier to assume it was okay. This year I had a physical, the doctor included a PSA, and to my shock it checked at 2.88. In retrospect, I shouldn't have been shocked. I'm sure you are amazed, exaspertated, incredulous at me. But I can assure you, no matter what negative emotion this raises in you, I have directed same at myself 100 times over. I am in therapy both for dealing with the disease and particularly for compromising my treatment. My primary referred me to a local uro whose plan was accepting the disease as systemic and moving to intermittent hormone therapy. I balked at giving up and moved back to the cancer center where a radiation oncologist said there was some possibilty, despite the PSA admittedly being VERY high for salvage. Based on my relatively young age of 57, he devised an agressive plan, radiation with two years of hormone therapy alongside. Obviously we won't know how successful we were for sometime until the hormone block is off. Apparently the research is showing ADT with radiation as effective and a long period afterward can help reduce the chance of a recurrence in the out years after it's over. The radiation oncologist also expects some form of ADT alongside salvage to become the standard. Given my age and how well tolerated radiation is now, I've undertaken the second option. I'm sure two years of hormone therapy will be tough but that was in my future either way. Fire away at me guys.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by white08gt My urologist wanted to keep me on the HT for 3 years, I opted out 3 months after SRT. Changed Urologists who gave me some options where the other did not. Kept a close eye on my PSA every 6 weeks while my testosterone was still very low, as it was creeping up changed to every 3 months. Now that my T is in the 400 range back to every 2 months. So far my PSA has been <0.05 which is as low as the lab reads for 1 year. Doc told me the affects of HT can be 6 months to a year, my T took about 4 months to start an upward trend from zero. I did not tolerate HT very well at all. Being active and keeping a workout log for the last 3 years at the fitness center, I could see my health and strength do a nose dive. Don't know when the time comes with a reoccurrence that I will go back on HT. With a G8 and staged at 3tb mu urologist said there is a 70% that it will pop back up. As with Inquiring Mind, I asked my doctor how can we tell if the SRT worked or is it HT keeping my psa undectable, inquiring mind want to know. Asked the same and answer was you don't. Have to wait until HT is over and find out.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by newporter I hope your treatment will be successful so you do not have to face this dilemma. Since it is hypothetical, let me give you a hypothetical answer based on logic: I assumed there are a lot of similarities between different types of cancer, especially between breast cancer and prostate cancer. I am not arguing about non aggressive prostate cancer where AS seemed to be fine. I am talking about prostate cancer that are aggressive, so similar to typical breast cancers. Here are a few recent researches on delaying treatment and delaying chemo for breast cancer: http://www.mdanderson.org/newsroom/n...-negative.html http://archsurg.jamanetwork.com/arti...icleid=1681805 http://journal.frontiersin.org/artic...014.00087/full It essentially said delaying treatment and chemo reduced survival. I often stayed up at night think about \"what if's\". My conclusion, for me anyway was to throw everything at it as early as possible and with as many modalities as my body could take because a., multiple modalities reduced the chance of mutation and b., earlier gets the cancer before drug resistance or distant met. As for QOL, being cancer free >> on hormone for the rest of my life, even if I have to endure up six months of chemo and two years of hormone. I don't know if the logic makes any sense but as you said it is hypothetical. These are legitimate topics to talk over with your oncologists to see what their views are so in case you have to pull the trigger you have a plan. Regards, A fair and reasonable response. On the other hand, if IHT could control the cancer and keep it 5.0 or lower for five, eight, ten years....is there enough advantage and evidence in terms of earlier intervention with chemo and complete hormone block that it's worth that? And would it be useful to perhaps establish a PSA doubling rate by tracking it after recurrence to determine just how agressive it might be? I don't know the answers but there are certainly two sides worth considering.",
