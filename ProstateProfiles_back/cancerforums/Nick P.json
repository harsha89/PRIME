Still measurable PSA afterwards which led me to salvage radiation in the fall of 2017 along with starting hormonal treatment. Had my 7th lupron injection yesterday. I still can't believe how painless they are. One more to go in April. My PSA has been undetectable for over a year and a half and my Oncologist tells me I have a 50-60% chance of having been cured. If not then it is still very unlikely it will ever kill me. My experience on Lupron has been fatigue, lack of energy, loss of most body hair, zero libido, loss of muscle tone etc etc. Not too big a price to pay and I am assured the effects will reverse once the treatments ends. My care has been managed by the Banner Cancer Health Care Center which is an offshoot of the University of Arizona Medical Center in Tucson. My Oncologist is an MD, PHD and the Director of the Radiation Oncology Department. I feel truly blessed for the care I have received. My hope is that others here will fare as well as I have.",

      "Content": "Hi MM and Rob. Yes, we've corresponded in the past. I don't have my detailed info. I'm 70 now and was diagnosed in 2016 with a gleason score of 8, downgraded to 7 post surgery. T is now <12. While a 50-60% chance of a cure isn't 100%, it's certainly better than the 0% chance I had post surgery, and the low chance of it ever killing me is probably more important than anything else. What I'm curious about is why they gave me these encouraging statistics now and not 6 months or so ago? Perhaps it was necessary to confirm the unmeasurable PSA and be sure I could tolerate Lupron. Wish I had remembered to ask but I was a bit discombobulated by encouraging news and their general upbeat tone. I felt like I was no longer just a victim but closer to a survivor. Sure looking forward to getting off this Lupron but with one more shot in April I guess it will be still quite a while before the boys get back to work producing T. Wishing all the best. Nick",

      "Content": "Hi MM and Rob. Yes, we've corresponded in the past. I don't have my detailed info. I'm 70 now and was diagnosed in 2016 with a gleason score of 8, downgraded to 7 post surgery. T is now <12. While a 50-60% chance of a cure isn't 100%, it's certainly better than the 0% chance I had post surgery, and the low chance of it ever killing me is probably more important than anything else. What I'm curious about is why they gave me these encouraging statistics now and not 6 months or so ago? Perhaps it was necessary to confirm the unmeasurable PSA and be sure I could tolerate Lupron. Wish I had remembered to ask but I was a bit discombobulated by encouraging news and their general upbeat tone. I felt like I was no longer just a victim but closer to a survivor. Sure looking forward to getting off this Lupron but with one more shot in April I guess it will be still quite a while before the boys get back to work producing T. Wishing all the best. Nick",

      "Content": "MM My surgery in 9/16 left me with measurable PSA so we decided to go the radiation route in 9-10/17 with the hope of affecting a cure. Lupron was started in 7/17 just prior to RT. So my current unmeasurable PSA is expected with the Lupron but it may also be the result of the RT doing it's job and knocking out the cancer. I asked this very question, how do we know if the RT worked as hoped when both a successful RT and Lupron will both result in the same unmeasurable PSA? The answer was \"we won't know until you stop the Lupron\". So no cure can be inferred hence the 50-60% likelihood. So why didn't they tell me this before? Upon reflection, I suspect there are new results from ongoing research and that's what they're quoting. Those results weren't available before. Additionally, a low probability of dying from PC in the next 10 years is not that different from a cure. Either way, I feel quite a bit better about my chances than I did a few days ago. Time, our most valuable commodity. Every year there are more treatments and more chances for a cure, but you have to be alive to benefit... Nick",

      "Content": "MM My surgery in 9/16 left me with measurable PSA so we decided to go the radiation route in 9-10/17 with the hope of affecting a cure. Lupron was started in 7/17 just prior to RT. So my current unmeasurable PSA is expected with the Lupron but it may also be the result of the RT doing it's job and knocking out the cancer. I asked this very question, how do we know if the RT worked as hoped when both a successful RT and Lupron will both result in the same unmeasurable PSA? The answer was \"we won't know until you stop the Lupron\". So no cure can be inferred hence the 50-60% likelihood. So why didn't they tell me this before? Upon reflection, I suspect there are new results from ongoing research and that's what they're quoting. Those results weren't available before. Additionally, a low probability of dying from PC in the next 10 years is not that different from a cure. Either way, I feel quite a bit better about my chances than I did a few days ago. Time, our most valuable commodity. Every year there are more treatments and more chances for a cure, but you have to be alive to benefit... Nick",

      "Content": "A PSA of 38 in mid 2016 followed by Da Vinci Surgery in Sept 2016. Still measurable PSA afterwards which led me to salvage radiation in the fall of 2017 along with starting hormonal treatment. Had my 7th lupron injection yesterday. I still can't believe how painless they are. One more to go in April. My PSA has been undetectable for over a year and a half and my Oncologist tells me I have a 50-60% chance of having been cured. If not then it is still very unlikely it will ever kill me. My experience on Lupron has been fatigue, lack of energy, loss of most body hair, zero libido, loss of muscle tone etc etc. Not too big a price to pay and I am assured the effects will reverse once the treatments ends. My care has been managed by the Banner Cancer Health Care Center which is an offshoot of the University of Arizona Medical Center in Tucson. My Oncologist is an MD, PHD and the Director of the Radiation Oncology Department. I feel truly blessed for the care I have received. My hope is that others here will fare as well as I have.",

      "Content": "My prostate surgery was Oct 17th and my follow up appointment with my Urologist/Surgeon in Tucson is on November 29th. The Surgeon requested a PSA test one week before the appointment but for a variety or reasons, my long distance from Tucson requires I have the test done locally, Thanksgiving next week, etc, I had it done today. My concern is that after only 4 weeks since surgery, has my PSA (38 at surgery) had time to settle out by now? Will I show a misleadingly high score now due to the closeness to my surgery? Nick",

      "Content": "Michael - Re \"my PSA (38 at surgery):\" I'm guessing that this PSA of 38 earned you an appointment for your biopsy. If so, then your PSA at the time of surgery was likely > 38. Correct, it was actually a couple of months before the surgery, so I don't really know what it was at surgery but I'm sure it didn't go down. The 1/2 Life of circulating PSA is approx 2-3 days so by 30 days, it should be approaching it's lowest level First time anyone's told me this. Thanks. Did you have a standard or ultrasensitive PSA (uPSA) test? If uPSA, (the result will be out to 3 decimal points), be sure to go to The Same Lab and get The Exact Same PSA test next time. Only then can you compare your first 2 post op PSA values It's the same lab but I don't know if it's ultra sensitive or not. I'll ask. Your final path report downgraded you from G8 to G7. Congrats! This still places you in an intermediate risk category. Yes, that was good to hear and my Urologist/Surgeon said that based on the pathology report follow on treatment in the form of Radiation/Chemo was not indicated, at least not at this time. I'm sure hoping for a PSA of zero but the 4 week interval had me worried.",
