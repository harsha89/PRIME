      "Content": "That's great, Wishbone. Not to rain on your parade but be careful. My wife and I had sex three and a half weeks post op. I was not very firm but good enough for penetration and I did have a dry orgasm which I thought we pretty awesome (like shooting an air rifle.) Later that day I was hitting some flop shots in my yard when I developed an infected lymphocele that made me shake violently with pain and put me back in the hospital for five days. Now I'm home with a drain in my belly. Apparently the lymphoceles are somewhat common post op (undefined sacks of fluid in your abdomen esp. if lymph nodes are dissected). Infections are not as common but can be deadly. The PA for my surgeon said she didn't know if the exertion of sex contributed to the infection or not but she basically told me to do nothing physically till this is resolved. No golf. No work. No sex. No fun.",

      "Content": "I live in Massachusetts. I'm 63 and I am married, a father and grandfather. I still work as a high school teacher. I was diagnosed in May, 2015. I am pretty fit, play a lot of golf, tend a huge garden and cut and split about six chords of firewood each year. For four years my primary care doctor had urged me to get a biopsy because my PSA fluctuated between 3 and 5 and my older brother had prostate cancer in 2011. My urologist, an older doctor, kept saying I didn't need one because my PSA would not go up and down if I had PC. He would do a digital exam and send me on my way. He was the same doctor who operated on me for testicular cancer in 1989 and I trusted him. He finally retired. His replacement on my first visit said I didn't need a biopsy (PSA 3) but when my PSA went to 4.1 told me to have one. Five cores of 13 were cancerous -- three 6s and two 7s (one 4+3). That doctor at UMASS-Worcester did not do robotic surgery but that is what I wanted after everything that I read -- plus my brother and my lead guitar player had robotic and were happy with it. The UMASS doctor acted pissed when I told him I was going with Dr. Adam Kibel, head of urology at Dana Farber in Boston, but, hey, it's my life. One good thing about living near Boston--besides the New England Patriots--is great healthcare. I had the surgery Aug. 6, five days ago. I came home the next day. I'm a little sore where the punctures are and the catheter sucks but other than that -- and a little anxiety -- I don't feel bad. I make sure I walk around with my bag in a bucket and take stool softener and laxatives and have had no problems evacuating. I was worried about that because my brother ended up back in the hospital for eight days because he couldn't pass gas. Once he farted, they sent him home. Dr. Kibel said he took some extra from the left side and from the top because it looked \"suspicious\" but he thinks he got it all. He took the nerve on the left so my sex life could be in trouble. but he said I had a great uretha \"stump\" so he is confident about incontinence issues. The pathology report will take about a week. I have my fingers crossed. Today, five days after surgery, my left hip hurts. Has anyone else had that? I am wondering if it is because of the way they hang you during the operations and that I am just feeling it now because the anesthesia is wearing off. They gave me some Oxycontin but I hesitate to take that.",

Even though I had a rare complication after a few weeks, I was back in front of my classroom, playing golf, and playing with my band in a couple months. Now, 11 months later, I almost feel like I never had the operation. The ED issue was the longest problem but thanks to Viagra/Cialis and a little hair elastic that is pretty much solved. Time is on your side as the Rolling Stones once pointed out. Good luck.",

Living near Boston I decided to go with the best and had Dr. Adam Kibel, head of urology at Dana Farber and Brigham and Women's, do the surgery on Aug. 6. I was out of the hospital the next day. So far so good. My recovery is going great. Just a little incontinence when I cough or laugh and ED shows growing signs that it will not be a problem. I had a consult with a UMASS radiation doc and an oncologist before I made my decision and even the radiologist said surgery was the best option for me. He said if the surgery doesn't get it all you can use radiation but the reverse is not always true. Good luck, brother.",

      "Content": "That's great, Wishbone. Not to rain on your parade but be careful. My wife and I had sex three and a half weeks post op. I was not very firm but good enough for penetration and I did have a dry orgasm which I thought we pretty awesome (like shooting an air rifle.) Later that day I was hitting some flop shots in my yard when I developed an infected lymphocele that made me shake violently with pain and put me back in the hospital for five days. Now I'm home with a drain in my belly. Apparently the lymphoceles are somewhat common post op (undefined sacks of fluid in your abdomen esp. if lymph nodes are dissected). Infections are not as common but can be deadly. The PA for my surgeon said she didn't know if the exertion of sex contributed to the infection or not but she basically told me to do nothing physically till this is resolved. No golf. No work. No sex. No fun.",

      "Content": "I live in Massachusetts. I'm 63 and I am married, a father and grandfather. I still work as a high school teacher. I was diagnosed in May, 2015. I am pretty fit, play a lot of golf, tend a huge garden and cut and split about six chords of firewood each year. For four years my primary care doctor had urged me to get a biopsy because my PSA fluctuated between 3 and 5 and my older brother had prostate cancer in 2011. My urologist, an older doctor, kept saying I didn't need one because my PSA would not go up and down if I had PC. He would do a digital exam and send me on my way. He was the same doctor who operated on me for testicular cancer in 1989 and I trusted him. He finally retired. His replacement on my first visit said I didn't need a biopsy (PSA 3) but when my PSA went to 4.1 told me to have one. Five cores of 13 were cancerous -- three 6s and two 7s (one 4+3). That doctor at UMASS-Worcester did not do robotic surgery but that is what I wanted after everything that I read -- plus my brother and my lead guitar player had robotic and were happy with it. The UMASS doctor acted pissed when I told him I was going with Dr. Adam Kibel, head of urology at Dana Farber in Boston, but, hey, it's my life. One good thing about living near Boston--besides the New England Patriots--is great healthcare. I had the surgery Aug. 6, five days ago. I came home the next day. I'm a little sore where the punctures are and the catheter sucks but other than that -- and a little anxiety -- I don't feel bad. I make sure I walk around with my bag in a bucket and take stool softener and laxatives and have had no problems evacuating. I was worried about that because my brother ended up back in the hospital for eight days because he couldn't pass gas. Once he farted, they sent him home. Dr. Kibel said he took some extra from the left side and from the top because it looked \"suspicious\" but he thinks he got it all. He took the nerve on the left so my sex life could be in trouble. but he said I had a great uretha \"stump\" so he is confident about incontinence issues. The pathology report will take about a week. I have my fingers crossed. Today, five days after surgery, my left hip hurts. Has anyone else had that? I am wondering if it is because of the way they hang you during the operations and that I am just feeling it now because the anesthesia is wearing off. They gave me some Oxycontin but I hesitate to take that.",

In my case both UMass and Brigham and Women's said my biopsy slides contained some 3+3, 3+4 and 4+3, but when I had the surgery the pathology report classified everything at 3+4. I have no opinion about surgery vs. radiation but if you do have surgery you will find out exactly what Gleason levels yours are. Good luck.",

Even though I had a rare complication after a few weeks, I was back in front of my classroom, playing golf, and playing with my band in a couple months. Now, 11 months later, I almost feel like I never had the operation. The ED issue was the longest problem but thanks to Viagra/Cialis and a little hair elastic that is pretty much solved. Time is on your side as the Rolling Stones once pointed out. Good luck.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by ASAdvocate PVD, How did you get generic Viagra in the USA? Pfizer's patent has been extended until 2020. What I did was bring my USA prescription to a walk-in clinic while in Canada, and asked them to re-write the rx for their minimum visit fee of $39. Got 30 100mg tablets of generic sidenafil for about $140 at a Costco there. Then use a simple pill splitter to cut them into quarters. I think that it would cost me over $600 to get the same rx here in the states. My prescription for Viagra was going to cost $48 PER PILL at CVS. I posted something about that and Michigan Man 16 responded that he had used LUEA pharmacy in Swartz Creek,MI with great satisfaction. I called LUEA and they said I needed my P.A. to call in a prescription for 20 mg Sildenafil since that is the only dose they carried. She called for 90 pills and it was just $55 including shipping and I had it in three days. I called it generic Viagra because I understand sildenafil is the active ingredient. Like I said, I don't know if it was the switch from Cialis or time or a combo, but it's working! I don't know if it is cool to put the phone number in (if it's not Highlander can edit it out and you can send me a private message.) The number is 810-635-3355.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by ASAdvocate PVD, How did you get generic Viagra in the USA? Pfizer's patent has been extended until 2020. What I did was bring my USA prescription to a walk-in clinic while in Canada, and asked them to re-write the rx for their minimum visit fee of $39. Got 30 100mg tablets of generic sidenafil for about $140 at a Costco there. Then use a simple pill splitter to cut them into quarters. I think that it would cost me over $600 to get the same rx here in the states. My prescription for Viagra was going to cost $48 PER PILL at CVS. I posted something about that and Michigan Man 16 responded that he had used LUEA pharmacy in Swartz Creek,MI with great satisfaction. I called LUEA and they said I needed my P.A. to call in a prescription for 20 mg Sildenafil since that is the only dose they carried. She called for 90 pills and it was just $55 including shipping and I had it in three days. I called it generic Viagra because I understand sildenafil is the active ingredient. Like I said, I don't know if it was the switch from Cialis or time or a combo, but it's working! I don't know if it is cool to put the phone number in (if it's not Highlander can edit it out and you can send me a private message.) The number is 810-635-3355.",

      "Content": "I had one side of nerves taken too. In just a few weeks I was getting erections that were kind of like water balloons on Cialis (20mg) but they didn't get any firmer in four months. My doc's assistant recommended I switch to Viagra. I did and...Viva Viagra! Thanks to a tip from Michigan Man 16 on this forum I got a prescription from LUEA Pharmacy in Michigan for 90 tabs of 20 mg generic Viagra (sidenafil) for 55 bucks. I don't know if it was the switch or just that I am five months post op but I am a happy camper. My wife is too. Strong like bull!",

Make sure you get a second opinion. Your insurance should cover everything. After my biopsy, my urologist at UMass had me meet with a radiologist and an oncologist there. I also had an MRI and bone scan and a cardio stress test. On my own, I requested a second opinion from Dr. Adam Kibel, the head of urology at the Dana Farber Clinic and Brigham and Women's Hospital. (One of the great things about living in Massachusetts is that Boston, in addition to being the home of great sports team, is world famous for health care). Again, insurance covers pretty much everything. I figured go to the best. All the doctors love doing surgery, btw, so choose one that has done whatever you decide on doing 100s of times. I chose having Dr. Kibel do the DaVinci robotic surgery. My wife and I took a planned vacation in Yellowstone after the pre-op testing and I came back and he did it. Five hour surgery and I went home the next day. The anesthesia takes a while to leave the body and I felt pretty beat up for a week but the small incisions are almost healed up and the bruising is gone now. The catheter sucked, no other way to put it, but luckily it was out after 7 days. It's been 17 days since my surgery and I feel close to great. I'm still a little incontinent but not too bad, mostly just a little squirt here and there. Based on early results I don't think ED will be a problem. I haven't slept that well overall (I keep feeling like I have to pee) but other than that, no great problems. Good luck, man.

      "Content": "Hi Osh, Ditto on the blood. I also had the same thing with my bladder/urethra contracting when I stopped peeing. It was almost painful. Now, 47 days post surgery, that has eased up. I've been lucky with incontinence. Other than one night--when I dreamed about peeing and woke up in a wet bed--I have been totally dry at night. The downside for me is that I still wake up every two hours to urinate. I don't have to pee nearly so often during the day. I sometimes feel a little squirt when I laugh, sneeze or cough but most of the time nothing or almost nothing actually comes out. I had the same problem with the pads and ended up just not wearing them. I've had to change my jockey shorts a couple of times since but the pads drove me nuts and the little ones for women were worse than the bigger ones for men. When I was using pads I found Depends Guards for men to be the best but they all still produced an red itchy scrotum. I used jock itch cream to relieve the itch.",

At my worst, i went through 2 pads a day, that lasted about a week or two (dont remember, and i'm happy about that), and was wearing nothing within 5 weeks. But i do have a friend who was fully continent from almost the moment that the catheter was pulled out, so indeed, its possible, and congratulations to you. Re the golf thing - i was worried about the same thing. I played golf for the first time about 5 months after surgery. Lo and behold, i gripped it, and ripped it, but i didnt drip it at all. I thought about wearing a shield just in case, but decided to be brave and i walked off the 18th green dry as a bone. I didnt even pee until the 5th hole, then went into the woods twice after that. That was truly a great day for me. I hope you won your match!",

At my worst, i went through 2 pads a day, that lasted about a week or two (dont remember, and i'm happy about that), and was wearing nothing within 5 weeks. But i do have a friend who was fully continent from almost the moment that the catheter was pulled out, so indeed, its possible, and congratulations to you. Re the golf thing - i was worried about the same thing. I played golf for the first time about 5 months after surgery. Lo and behold, i gripped it, and ripped it, but i didnt drip it at all. I thought about wearing a shield just in case, but decided to be brave and i walked off the 18th green dry as a bone. I didnt even pee until the 5th hole, then went into the woods twice after that. That was truly a great day for me. I hope you won your match!",

One absolute keys is that you have to take Viagra on an empty stomach or it doesn't work. And it works pretty fast with a small (two hours?) window of opportunity. The other key is I use a hair elastic like a cock ring. That really helps because it allows the blood to flow in but not out. A third key is to have a really patient wife and --this may sound too graphic for some--but you have to take care of her first because if you do you don't need to be hard like an iron bar. Happy wife, happy sex life. Paraphrasing a lyric from Little Charlie and the Nightcats, you can lick this problem by using your head.",

I ran into a rare complication, otherwise I would have been back to work in three weeks. Even with the complication--an infected lymphocele which is so rare that only one guy on this forum had ever heard of it--I am now 5 months post surgery and 100 percent back to normal. No incontinence and just a tad of ED, but even the ED has been straightened out with Viagra. My older brother had the surgery in 2011 and is also 100 percent back. One thing your old man should do is get at least one second opinion. I bet his insurance will cover it. I talked to several specialists and surgeons before deciding to have robotic surgery. A radiologist told me I would not be a good candidate for the seeds because my prostate is too small and the radiation would have a negative effect on my urethra. I ended up deciding on Da Vinci surgery with Dr. Adam Kibel, head of urology at Brigham & Women's and the world renown Dana Farber Cancer Institute in Boston.

The first time I used it the price was $57 for 90 tabs of 20 mg sidenafil. The second time was $63. Your doc has to call in the prescription or send it. then you have to call and pay with a credit card. The pills arrive in just a couple days. I take five tabs at once. The only drawback with sidenafil is you have to take it on an empty stomach and it worked best within a couple hours. When I took Cialis pre-surgery it produced oak-like wood for three days. But I'll take birch now! Paul",

      "Content": "I was petrified of surgery. Hell, I was even petrified of the biopsy. Turns out the biopsy wasn't that bad and neither was the surgery. I ran into a rare complication, otherwise I would have been back to work in three weeks. Even with the complication--an infected lymphocele which is so rare that only one guy on this forum had ever heard of it--I am now 5 months post surgery and 100 percent back to normal. No incontinence and just a tad of ED, but even the ED has been straightened out with Viagra. My older brother had the surgery in 2011 and is also 100 percent back. One thing your old man should do is get at least one second opinion. I bet his insurance will cover it. I talked to several specialists and surgeons before deciding to have robotic surgery. A radiologist told me I would not be a good candidate for the seeds because my prostate is too small and the radiation would have a negative effect on my urethra. I ended up deciding on Da Vinci surgery with Dr. Adam Kibel, head of urology at Brigham & Women's and the world renown Dana Farber Cancer Institute in Boston. If you're in Connecticut you aren't that far from Boston and I only stayed in the hospital one night.",

I did the kegels infrequently but I also delayed peeing while I was awake as much as humanly possible, which I suppose is a form of kegels. I think holding it was a key in my quick return to continence. That was a suggestions I found on this forum and it worked for me. One thing almost everybody finds is that when you initially have orgasms, pee --and lots of it-- will come out. That lasted to some degree for almost a year for me, although the amount quickly lessened. Now, two years out, my ED is totally gone (thanks sildenafil) and my orgasms are as dry as the Mojave Desert. They are just as good as the old ones. Hang in there.",

I also got the address of a legit online pharmacy that sells generic Viagra (sidenafil) cheaply (90 pills of 20 mg for 63 bucks). You need to have your doc call them with a prescription.",

You need to have your doc or PA call in a prescription for Sildenafil (generic Viagra) and then you have to call and give them your credit card. Sixty three bucks for 90 20mg tabs. I take five at a time. They send it out that day. It is the LUEA Pharmacy and the number is 810-635-3355. The sildenafil works great as long as you have sex within a couple of hours. Cialis, which last longer, does not have a generic twin yet and is really expensive. I have a friend, though, who gets it for $3 per 100 mg pill with his insurance and he gives me some. I like to combine small does (ex: a third of Cialis with two 20 mg sildenafil) to expand the window of opportunity.",

Going into the surgery I said to my doc try to spare the nerves. He said \"I will but getting all the cancer is my priority and your continence is second. Your wife will love you even if you have ED.\" My PSA checks since then have both been undetectable. Dr. Kibel saved a good urethra stem and my incontinence problems have been almost non existent. He saved half the nerves. Since then I was able to get semi erections, big as ever but not real firm. On my PA advice, I switched from Cialis to generic Viagra (sildenafil) last week and the early results are promising.",

      "Content": "Hi Jimmy, Good advice from everyone so far. The only thing I'd add is to definitely get second opinions from radiologists and surgeons. After I was diagnosed by a UMass urologist, I saw an oncologist, a radiologist and another urologist/surgeon. The radiologist told me he could do radiation but since I had it before (for testicular cancer when I was 37) it might not be the most effective and that because I had a small prostate he wouldn't do seeds because they would negatively affect my urethra. He recommended surgery. My first doctor only did open surgery and insisted I would heal just as fast as robotic, but I had read that was not true. I did some research and got my second surgical opinion from Dr. Adam Kibel, the head of urology at Boston's world renown Dana Farber Clinic. Kibel has done thousands of Da Vinci surgeries and I went with him. Despite a rare post surgery complication, I am now five months post op and 100 percent back to normal, other than a little ED which Viagra is helping. All of those second opinions (and associated bone scans and MRIs and other pre-op tests) cost me under $800 in co pays. Get as much info as you can, but act quickly with your PSA rising like it is.

      "Content": "To all my brothers and their wives, Merry Christmas and Happy New Year. 2015 was not a great year for us. I was diagnosed with PC in May. Had the Da Vinci operation in August and a rare complication put me back in the hospital in September. Then in October I got facial cellulitis (may or may not have been related to PC operation according to the doctors) and my daughter in law was diagnosed with uterine cancer and had a hysterectomy at 34 years old. On December 2 our beloved 12 and a half year old dog Yaz died and yesterday my wife cracked up her car. But you know what? We're all still here. The kids and grand kids are healthy. My wife didn't get hurt. My daughter in law is doing fine. My four month PSA came back at <0.02 and other than a little ED to remind me I would not even know I had the surgery or complications. My Patriots are heading to the Super Bowl again and my Bruins are one point out of first place. I spent all this week playing guitar and singing with my students, and today I am playing Christmas Eve golf with my buddies because it is supposed to hit 65 here in New England. Life is as good as you make it --so make yours a good one. Merry Christmas.",

      "Content": "Hi Jimmy, Good advice from everyone so far. The only thing I'd add is to definitely get second opinions from radiologists and surgeons. After I was diagnosed by a UMass urologist, I saw an oncologist, a radiologist and another urologist/surgeon. The radiologist told me he could do radiation but since I had it before (for testicular cancer when I was 37) it might not be the most effective and that because I had a small prostate he wouldn't do seeds because they would negatively affect my urethra. He recommended surgery. My first doctor only did open surgery and insisted I would heal just as fast as robotic, but I had read that was not true. I did some research and got my second surgical opinion from Dr. Adam Kibel, the head of urology at Boston's world renown Dana Farber Clinic. Kibel has done thousands of Da Vinci surgeries and I went with him. Despite a rare post surgery complication, I am now five months post op and 100 percent back to normal, other than a little ED which Viagra is helping.

      "Content": "Today marks one year since I had my prostate removed via Da Vinci surgery at Boston's Brigham & Women's Hospital by Dana Farber head urologist Dr. Adam Kibel. This morning I'm sitting in a cottage on the shores of Little Squam Lake in New Hampshire with my wife, my daughter, her fiance and my hound dog Yeats. Yesterday, I went tubing, today I'll go waterskiiing. Two days ago I missed a three foot putt to lose my golf league playoff. In two weeks I'll return to my job teaching high school English. Life is good. One year later, other than a little ED issue that is solved by generic Viagra, it is like the PC and surgery never happened.",

Two or three weeks post surgery in 2011 my brother's bowels stopped working totally.There's a name for it but I can't recalled what it is--something like illyis. He was in incredible pain and his neighbor rushed him to the hospital. He was readmitted for eight days and fed intravenously. The only thing he was allowed to eat was ice chips. He was bored out of his mind. They had him walking up and down the aisles. Finally after eight days he farted and they sent him home. Knowing that, when I had the surgery last year I ate the stool softener and laxatives like candy. Good luck.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by Coyote thanks for the info about \"phantom\" squirts. I'm 13 days post-op and had some dribbles the first few days. The last 3 days a couple times a day it felt like it but nothing. I thought I was nuts.) Yup, Coyote, I remember being baffled by the phantom squirts but it is really common. A lot of guys on this forum have written about it. I wore pads for a few weeks just in case but hated them. My privates got really chaffed no matter which ones I tried. Once I realized they were ghosts squirts I just took a chance (I'm a high school teacher) and went without. I remember running to the men's room at school a couple times during my first weeks back to check my shorts but they were always bone dry. And my wife pointed out that even if a drop came out into my jockey shorts no one would notice. She said it happens to women, especially pregnant women, all the time. One thing that did discourage me for a while is that when I had a (somewhat limp dick) orgasm, pee would come out. At first it was a lot but a few months ago that stopped entirely too. And good timing with generic Viagra and a hair elastic have solved the limp problem.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by Coyote thanks for the info about \"phantom\" squirts. I'm 13 days post-op and had some dribbles the first few days. The last 3 days a couple times a day it felt like it but nothing. I thought I was nuts.) Yup, Coyote, I remember being baffled by the phantom squirts but it is really common. A lot of guys on this forum have written about it. I wore pads for a few weeks just in case but hated them. My privates got really chaffed no matter which ones I tried. Once I realized they were ghosts squirts I just took a chance (I'm a high school teacher) and went without. I remember running to the men's room at school a couple times during my first weeks back to check my shorts but they were always bone dry. And my wife pointed out that even if a drop came out into my jockey shorts no one would notice. She said it happens to women, especially pregnant women, all the time. One thing that did discourage me for a while is that when I had a (somewhat limp dick) orgasm, pee would come out. At first it was a lot but a few months ago that stopped entirely too. And good timing with generic Viagra and a hair elastic have solved the limp problem.",

      "Content": "Rooster, one thing I and many others have found is that, post op, when you have to go, you really have to go. Without that second brake Chuck mentioned, the feeling of urgency can be acute and you need to take care of it ASAP. I peed the bed once in the first month. I had a hard time with the pads chaffing my junk so I didn't use them at all after three weeks but I did answer every call to pee urgently. The only time I peed the bed again was when I took an Adavan to help me sleep three months post op and slept through my bladder's wake up call. That being said, I believe the majority of guys return to full continence. In my case it was relatively quickly, other than pee coming out during orgasm. That took a half year or so to stop. My surgeon said he was able to spare a good urethra stem and predicted incontinence would resolve quickly and it did. Good luck.",

Despite all the complications I had post surgery I have to say I feel great now and almost like it never happened...except for Mr. Softee. I talked to my Physician Assistant about ED--which is always awkward since she's about 30 years old and good looking to boot. I told her my dick grows but does not get real firm, kind of like a water balloon, and when I have an orgasm a little pee comes out. She said the pee thing could be here to stay, at least short term. She said the erections should get firmer over the next year. I have been using Cialis I get from a friend because my insurer won't cover the 5 mg daily prescription. My PA said some guys have found Viagra works better and gave me a prescription for 100 mg pills. If I took that much Viagra or Cialis pre-surgery I would have broke some bedroom windows and knocked everything off the nightstand. That was then, this is now. She also said some guys get their prescriptions for Viagra filled by online Canadian pharmacies. My questions are 1. Has anyone found that Viagra indeed works better and 2. Has anyone used online Canadian pharmacies to fill their Viagra prescription with satisfactory results.",

      "Content": "Hello all, The good news is I went to Brigham & Women's Hospital in Boston for my four month post op and my PSA is still <0.02 undetectable. Yeeha. Despite all the complications I had post surgery I have to say I feel great now and almost like it never happened...except for Mr. Softee. I talked to my Physician Assistant about ED--which is always awkward since she's about 30 years old and good looking to boot. I told her my dick grows but does not get real firm, kind of like a water balloon, and when I have an orgasm a little pee comes out. She said the pee thing could be here to stay, at least short term. She said the erections should get firmer over the next year. I have been using Cialis I get from a friend because my insurer won't cover the 5 mg daily prescription. My PA said some guys have found Viagra works better and gave me a prescription for 100 mg pills. If I took that much Viagra or Cialis pre-surgery I would have broke some bedroom windows and knocked everything off the nightstand. That was then, this is now. She also said some guys get their prescriptions for Viagra filled by online Canadian pharmacies. My questions are 1. Has anyone found that Viagra indeed works better and 2. Has anyone used online Canadian pharmacies to fill their Viagra prescription with satisfactory results.",

      "Content": "Hello all. I haven't been on this forum for awhile. My brother Ed and I have both had surgery to remove our prostates. His was in early 2011. Mine in 2016. His PSA never went to the zero club, although it was close. It stayed at .03 for years but last year started to creep up. It hit 0.7 two weeks ago. The doctor said the Big C was back somewhere. They did an MRI hoping it would be a small spot near the prostate area that they could zap but didn't see one. A bone scan didn't reveal anything. Now the docs say he needs salvage radiation. We both thought we were done with this. We even won a golf tournament together two years ago, and we both had knee replacements last year. After seven years this is a shock. Can anyone who has had salvage radiation give him any advice? How tired did you get? Any other side effects? Did it work? Thanks.",

      "Content": "Hey Oshguy, Feels good to have those tubes out, eh? As far as the positive margins, my surgeon said he is almost positive that my positive focal point is nothing to worry about, just a bit of cancer that got squeezed to the edge when the robot pulled the prostate out. I hope he is right. Maybe that is what yours are too. My guy also had me do a PSA at one month, although many wait for three. It came back <0.02 so I was really buoyed by that. Even though I didn't get a great erection and still don't (more like Mr, Softee), I actually had an orgasm at three weeks. My wife is very sexy and patient and we made it work. The orgasm felt like an air rifle, if that makes sense, and I think a little pee may have come out first although Karen said she didn't feel it. Later that day the infected lymphocele dropped me to my knees and put me back in the hospital. Doctors said the two are not related but I am kind of scared to jump back into the sack. Guess I'll have to man up.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by Southsider is that a safe amount to take? such a high dose probably increases the chances of side effects, and spending an evening in the er for priapism does sound like a great time Hi Southsider, As Ron pointed out, the normal prescribed dose is 100 mg, so five 20s are OK. My prescription says \"take 50 to 100 mg once or twice a week as needed.\" I have found the biggest factor in how it works is to not eat before I take it. If your stomach is full, the food absorbs the sildenafil and it doesn't work as well. I have taken it and waited a while and then ate before sex and it still worked. Drinking alcohol definitely limits the effectiveness too, as does being overly tired.",

      "Content": "Hello brothers, I have great news on the ED med front. There are bunch of places that you can get sildenafil for short money. I found it works great, better than Cialis. The key is to take it on an empty or near-empty stomach. I also found it works best if I don't drink more than a beer or two. I take four or five tabs at a time although 2 or 3 would probably do. Just don't want to let my beautiful wife down. The good news is that you can get deep discounts from Blinkhealth.com and GoodRX.com and probably a host of other online coupons. CVS wanted $460+ for 90 sildenafil 20 mg. tabs but accepted a Blinkheath.com coupon that only cost me $54. A friend of mine who also had PC got 30 tabs for $20 from Price Chopper, a supermarket chain here in Central Mass. You still need a prescription and you can't couple it with insurance but at this price it is cheaper anyway. My insurer wouldn't cover ED meds at all anyway.",

When I had an orgasm for the first year or so pee came out. That is normal and will go away. The ED for me took a little longer. Erections were more like water balloons for the first year. Now,with the aid of sildenafil (generic Viagra)I am back to oak. You can get coupons to buy sildenafil with a prescription just about anywhere and you can get it way cheaper than through insurance. I just bought 90 tabs for $54 through Blinkhealth.com and a friend of mine got 30 tabs for under $20 with a coupon from GoodhealthRX.com. I take five 20 mg tabs at a time. You'll get there.

      "Content": "Hello guys and dolls, My wife and I discovered a trick that works great for ED. I had the robotic surgery in August. I didn't have any real problems with incontinence but my progress with ED was not as fast as I hoped. I had a dry orgasm after just a few weeks but my erections were more like floppy water balloons than like oak limbs. They got a little better when I switched from Cialis to Sildenafil (generic Viagra) and still a little better when I mixed the two (low dose of both) but the erections were still not great. I was starting to think about going with the needle but the thought of anything sharp sticking into Memo the Trouser Monster scared the hell out of me. Not to be too graphic, but last week my wife put one of her little hair elastics around Memo's base and then we started fooling around and. voila--oak, or at least rock maple, and it stayed hard a long time, pleasing both of us. It worked again a couple of days ago. I don't know if it's the elastic or that I am taking longer and knowing she is satisfied too, but my orgasms were great. BTW, these elastics are tiny so don't forget to take them off when you're done.",

      "Content": "Hi Tghag I dreaded a biopsy because my brother told me it was the worst pain he had ever experienced. When I finally had one I didn't think it was bad at all. Surgery is the same--I had a rare complication but even then, in just four and a half months, I feel totally back to normal other than dealing with some ED. I actually felt pretty much back to normal after two months despite the complication. As far as a second opinion goes, you should definitely get one. In my case, it was totally covered by my insurance. The urologist who diagnosed me at UMass wanted to do the surgery but he only did open surgery. He claimed open has the same healing time as robotic. But I had read that is not true so I got a second opinion from Dr. Adam Kibel, the head of urology at Harvard University and Dana Farber/Brigham & Women's in Boston. My wife and I decided to go with Dr. Kibel. Was it the right choice? I don't know. Maybe the complication would not have occurred if I had the surgery at UMass but even then I was still back teaching within two months and haven't missed a day since. My point is the second opinion gives you options. Do some research and find a top doctor who has performed the surgery many times and get your second opinion from him or her. They all have giant egos and love to operate. The only way to know the true pathology is to have the prostate removed and dissected. Good luck. You'll be fine",

      "Content": "I hope that anyone who is facing surgery and perusing this great and caring website sees this. It is not just about having an orgasm in such a short time--that was an unexpected bonus--but also I feel better and better every day. I still dribble a little pee, mostly if I have a beer or two, but my shorts and/or a pad are hardly wet when I take them off before i go to bed. Other than one spillage early on, I have been totally dry at night. I'm going back to teaching high school next Monday, just three and a half weeks after surgery. I know I'll get tired--hell, sophomores could tire out the Energizer Bunny--but I am confident I'll be fine. I mowed two acres yesterday and hit some balls in my yard today. I realized when I took a full swing with a wedge that I should give golf a little more time. It almost seems like having the catheter or peeing pink urine was years ago, and not just a couple of weeks. Other problems-- such as the giant bruises that appeared two days post-op, sleep interruption every 15 minutes for false urination urgency, or a rash on my genitals--have been overcome, often with encouragement or advice from the brothers on this forum. I'm sure they'll be more challenges and I am naturally worried about my first post-op PSA on Sept. 9. But for others just starting this journey I can say definitively that it hasn't been nearly as bad as I feared. I know some have bad experiences--my brother's inability to move his bowels kept him in the hospital for an extra 8 days when he had the surgery four years ago--but most people end up fine. (Even after that, my brother was back at work and on the golf course within two months). Find a good surgeon and with the loving support of your spouse, you'll do fine. I had a cancerous testicle removed in 1989 and a benign brain tumor removed in 2002. As one of my daughters said when I told them in May that I had been diagnosed with PC, \"Well, that's a good cancer, right?\" Odd way to put it, but I know what she meant.",

      "Content": "I too had a PSA that fluctuated mostly in the 3.0-3.9 range for four years and one time even got to 5.7. My primary care doc kept telling me to get a biopsy since my older brother had prostate cancer in 2010-11. Every time I went to my elderly urologist though he would do a DRE and say I didn't need one, reasoning that if I had cancer my PSA would not go up and down, only up. That was fine with me because my brother said the biopsy was the most painful thing he had ever had in his life. That urologist retired last year. My first PSA with his replacement was 3 something so we agreed to wait on a biopsy but when it went to 4.1 in the spring we decided on a biopsy. It wasn't that bad. It was quick--like getting a dozen bee stings in a minute or two and almost no soreness immediately afterward. Biopsy came back positive in five of 13 cores. I had the DaVinci robotic surgery on Aug. 6. My pathology report shows a minuscule positive focal margin which my surgeon Dr. Adam Kibel, head of urology at Brigham & Women's/Dana Farber, said is probably nothing. I hope so. My former urologist is windsurfing in Aruba and I'm sitting here wishing that I had listened to my PCP and went to a different urologist years earlier. My advice Bill is to get a another biopsy. It's not that bad and you don't want to wait like I did and at best be saddled with worry for years to come.",

      "Content": "I just had my first orgasm post surgery. Didn't really achieve a great erection but enough to accomplish penetration with my beautiful and understanding wife. The orgasm felt great even though it was shorter than my pre-surgery ones and nothing came out. I am psyched. The only real problem during my three weeks of recovery, beyond the usual swelling, aches and pains and the damn catheter for one week, was false urination urgency that woke me up constantly and that seems to be solved the last two nights by taking a couple of Ibuprofen before I hit the hay. I also have a little dribbling later in the day, especially if I have a beer or glass of wine, and one night last week I wet the bed like my 3-year-old grandson. (Thank God for mattress protectors.) I can't sleep with a diaper or pad on because my scrotum gets incredibly itchy. I try to wear the pads during the day as seldom as possible for that reason so I just have wash my jockey shorts a lot. I'll have to wear the pads next week when I go back to teaching high school. But back to sex. I feel incredibly blessed by my beautiful and understanding wife. I thought it would take at least three months before I had a big O, not three weeks. I can live with Mr. Softee as long as I can achieve full continence. I have to say the skill of my surgeon, Dr. Adam Kibel, is a huge factor in this rapid recovery. For anyone who is contemplating surgery, make sure you seek out an experienced and highly rated surgeon. Don't worry about hurting someone's feelings--it is your life--and your insurance will cover a great surgeon the same as it covers a beginner. I was a journalist most of my life and used to asking a lot of tough questions. When my urologist at UMASS said he wanted to do traditional surgery because he had never learned to do robotic, my reporter's BS detector went off. I did some research and discovered robotic generally has a shorter recovery period. I looked up Dr. Kibel, head of urology at Brigham and Women's/Dana Farber, and made an appointment for a second opinion consult. I decided to have Dr. Kibel do the surgery in Boston. I'm glad I did--and so is my wife!",

Yesterday I had quite a few daytime squirts and last night I was up every half hour feeling like I had to pee (even though hardly any would come out).. I thought I'd go crazy. Finally, at 3 a.m., i took an Ibuprofen and, voila, I slept like baby till 7:30 a.m. I am hoping that is the key. Today, I've had no leakage whatsoever. For years before the surgery I had occasional urgency problems, but only at night. I would take Flomax to solve them but I would still need to get up at least once a night to urinate. My urologist said at the time that once was normal.",

      "Content": "I too had a PSA that fluctuated mostly in the 3.0-3.9 range for four years and one time even got to 5.7. My primary care doc kept telling me to get a biopsy since my older brother had prostate cancer in 2010-11. Every time I went to my elderly urologist though he would do a DRE and say I didn't need one, reasoning that if I had cancer my PSA would not go up and down, only up. That was fine with me because my brother said the biopsy was the most painful thing he had ever had in his life. That urologist retired last year. My first PSA with his replacement was 3 something so we agreed to wait on a biopsy but when it went to 4.1 in the spring we decided on a biopsy. It wasn't that bad. It was quick--like getting a dozen bee stings in a minute or two and almost no soreness immediately afterward. Biopsy came back positive in five of 13 cores. I had the DaVinci robotic surgery on Aug. 6. My pathology report shows a minuscule positive focal margin which my surgeon Dr. Adam Kibel, head of urology at Brigham & Women's/Dana Farber, said is probably nothing. I hope so. My former urologist is windsurfing in Aruba and I'm sitting here wishing that I had listened to my PCP and went to a different urologist years earlier. My advice Bill is to get a another biopsy. It's not that bad and you don't want to wait like I did and at best be saddled with worry for years to come.",

      "Content": "Getting old is a trip. This week I had four doctors appointments at three different hospitals. I had so much medical stuff going on (doc looked at cyst on my vocal chords, then I had an ultrasound of my kidneys because my creatine level was too high at my last checkup, then I had my two-year endoscopy to look at my Barrett's Esophagus, and finally today I went to my GP to review the blood work and ultrasound.). While I was at UMASS with the cyst doc, my blood pressure was 175/95. At first the nurses said we can't let you leave till it goes down. I told them I have \"white coat syndrome\" and that with their mandate there was no way it would go down. Ninety minutes and several checks later it was 210/102. They finally let me go and when I checked it at home (post one Sam Adams lager) it was 140/77. So far, so good on all the appointments. Cyst is coming out at some point and may change my voice--some would say after listening to my band that any change would be good.--but doc is virtually certain it is not cancer. Ultrasound and blood work showed creatine rise was probably due to walking 18 holes in 90 degree heat a day before initial test without drinking enough water. Now it is back to normal. Endoscopy found more damage to my esophagus since 2015, but it is probably more Barrett's and not cancer. Awaiting biopsy result. Best thing was during my visit with GP to review all this today he mentioned that my PSA was still 0.01 undetectable. I had forgot that I asked him to check off the PSA box on the blood work sheet. I did that because I have a checkup at Brigham and Women's in September and I figured I may as well get the number now. This made me think, though, how distant that PC operation seems now. It was only two years ago I had my prostate out (and I had a knee replaced in the meantime). For anyone just embarking on this journey I hope you will be able to just forget about it in a couple of years like I have. Most of you will. Good luck all.",

      "Content": "Hi wifeinworry, My PSA went up and down for years before I was biopsied and diagnosed. It went from 2 something to 3 something to 5 something--and then it went down to 3 something again. My urologist kept saying it wouldn't go down if it was PC and he never felt anything on a DRE. He retired and my new guy ordered a biopsy when it went from 3 to 4 something and he felt a lump. Did I have PC the whole time? I don't know. The lump he felt was not cancerous, according to the biopsy, but other cores were. Depending on your husband's age, 3.1 PSA may be in the normal range.",

      "Content": "Getting old is a trip. This week I had four doctors appointments at three different hospitals. I had so much medical stuff going on (doc looked at cyst on my vocal chords, then I had an ultrasound of my kidneys because my creatine level was too high at my last checkup, then I had my two-year endoscopy to look at my Barrett's Esophagus, and finally today I went to my GP to review the blood work and ultrasound.). While I was at UMASS with the cyst doc, my blood pressure was 175/95. At first the nurses said we can't let you leave till it goes down. I told them I have \"white coat syndrome\" and that with their mandate there was no way it would go down. Ninety minutes and several checks later it was 210/102. They finally let me go and when I checked it at home (post one Sam Adams lager) it was 140/77. So far, so good on all the appointments. Cyst is coming out at some point and may change my voice--some would say after listening to my band that any change would be good.--but doc is virtually certain it is not cancer. Ultrasound and blood work showed creatine rise was probably due to walking 18 holes in 90 degree heat a day before initial test without drinking enough water. Now it is back to normal. Endoscopy found more damage to my esophagus since 2015, but it is probably more Barrett's and not cancer. Awaiting biopsy result. Best thing was during my visit with GP to review all this today he mentioned that my PSA was still 0.01 undetectable. I had forgot that I asked him to check off the PSA box on the blood work sheet. I did that because I have a checkup at Brigham and Women's in September and I figured I may as well get the number now. This made me think, though, how distant that PC operation seems now. It was only two years ago I had my prostate out (and I had a knee replaced in the meantime). For anyone just embarking on this journey I hope you will be able to just forget about it in a couple of years like I have. Most of you will. Good luck all.",

I broke 80 for the first time, and second and third time, on the links this summer. My recovery was swift, even with a rare surgical complication. I still play with my band, still love my job teaching high school English, and still go to breakfast with my kids and grand kids whenever we can. Three months post op I cut down a 100-foot ash tree and harvested four cords of firewood. In three weeks my brother (prostate cancer and DaVinci in 2011) will play in a member guest. He is 100 percent recovered too. I hope and wish and know your recovery will be even swifter since you are 17 years younger than me. Good luck.",

I know others on this forum have had a lot worse time and more problems--in the midst of all this I did get great news that my PSA is now <0.02--but I feel like a prisoner in leg irons, except my chains are a plastic tube with a bag at the end.

      "Content": "I switched from Cialis to Sildenafil (generic Viagra) after a year with great results. You can get a prescription for Sildenafil from your doc and then you have to find a family pharmacy that will fill it cheaply. The hospital pharmacies and chains like CVS will charge you an arm and a leg but independent pharmacies will sell it way cheaper. I pay $60 for 90 pills (20 mg each)and that is without using insurance. I started off taking five at a time, now I just take a 2 or 3 and it's like I'm 18 again. I live in Massachusetts. At first I was filling it through an online pharmacy in Michigan but now I fill it through a pharmacy 15 miles from my house.",

I broke 80 for the first time, and second and third time, on the links this summer. My recovery was swift, even with a rare surgical complication. I still play with my band, still love my job teaching high school English, and still go to breakfast with my kids and grand kids whenever we can. Three months post op I cut down a 100-foot ash tree and harvested four cords of firewood. In three weeks my brother (prostate cancer and DaVinci in 2011) will play in a member guest. He is 100 percent recovered too. I hope and wish and know your recovery will be even swifter since you are 17 years younger than me. Good luck.",

This has been a long slog--since my DaVinci surgery on Aug. 6 I have had a catheter and/or drain in for 26 days. I know others on this forum have had a lot worse time and more problems--in the midst of all this I did get great news that my PSA is now <0.02--but I feel like a prisoner in leg irons, except my chains are a plastic tube with a bag at the end. Hopefully in four hours the bag, the tube, and the drain will be just a memory and I can go back to teaching, playing golf and the yard work that has been neglected for two months.",

It was caused by leaking lymph node fluid but I know the docs investigated urine leaking from my bladder before they pronounced there was no connection.

      "Content": "Good for you, Oshguy. My brother ended up back in the hospital for eight days two weeks after his surgery in 2011. They fed him by IV and all he could do was chew ice chips and walk. They let him go home once he farted. The condition is called something like illyis and it is when your bowels basically forget how to work. Scared by that when I had my surgery on Aug. 6, I had no problem pooping because i immediately walked and ate the stool softener and laxatives like they were candy. On the drain front, I didn't go home with one but three weeks later I developed an infected and incredibly painful lymphocele and ended up back in the hospital for five days. I've had a drain now for the past 15 days. It was putting out 1200 cc a day for awhile. Yesterday it was still at 100. Today it was 6 cc. If I have another day below 10 cc they will give me a CT scan to make sure the lymphocele is collapsed and then take the drain out.I have my fingers crossed.",

Since my brother had prostate cancer in 2011, my primary care doc kept urging me to get a biopsy. When I went to my urologist, an older doctor who had operated on me for testicular cancer in 1989, he would do a DRE and tell me I didn't need a biopsy. That was fine with me. He said my normal PSA was probably 3 something and that it would not go up--and down--if it was cancer. He retired last year. The new urologist on first examination said my 3 PSA was OK but iif it went up he'd want a biopsy. It went up to 4.1 in February--my wife and I had made love the night before and CPO2 is right--sex does make it go up. I wasn't too worried but I had the biopsy in May--it was positive with three 6s and two 7s (one a 4+3) Gleason. I had robotic surgery at Brigham and Women's last Thursday. Hardly any pain but catheter is a hassle. I got my pathology results yesterday and Dr. Adam Kibel said there is one positive focal margin but he thinks it may be nothing. Good luck.",

      "Content": "Hello guys, I was supposed to have a \"virtual visit\" with my surgeon at Brigham & Women's today. The technology worked on my end--kind of like Skype--but not on his. He called me instead and said he had never received the PSA report from blood I had drawn at a local hospital. (I'm about an hour drive from Boston). I was disappointed because I wanted to hear \"undetectable,\" a word that is magic to my ears. He said the local hospital has to give me the result if I ask, even though when I asked for it previously they said they didn't. I drove to the local hospital, told them what he said, and they gave it to me. The report says 0.01. Every time I had my blood drawn post op at Brigham & Women's it was <0.02. My surgeon is gone for the long weekend and I can't ask him, but it seems to me that I had read on this forum that they are the same, just a different reporting method. Am I correct? Am I still in the zero club?",

My wife said she didn't mind when it happened inside of her but I think she was just being supportive. That stopped completely a couple of months ago. I also found that switching from Cialis to generic Viaga helped but even better was mixing smaller doses of each together. The problem with Viagra/Sildenafil is your window of opportunity is much smaller. It's almost like you have to schedule sex. They say not to mix them together but I also read that means full doses. I went with that reasoning. Another huge help I found is using one of those little hair elastics like a cock ring. Definitely helps get it up and keep it up! Good luck.",

      "Content": "I had sex in three weeks, including an orgasm that felt like an air rifle going off (kind of cool). Not very hard, maybe 50 percent, but hard enough with a patient wife. A couple hours later it felt like Mike Tyson hit me in the stomach and i ended up back in the hospital for five days with an infected lymphocele. After that I had a drain in my stomach for 19 days. Docs said the sex didn't cause the lymphocele or infection but that taking it easy might have been the smarter play. Maybe you should have your girlfriend do the work on top. You are healing, after all.",

      "Content": "Good luck, Gary. My ride home from Boston on Aug. 7, the day after surgery, was about an hour. I didn't have a donut or pillow and didn't need one but you may be different. My aches didn't start until a couple of days later when I noticed my left side, my scrotum and my penis were dark, dark purple and swollen. The bloating/swelling are going down but Ibuprofen is definitely useful. I used the Oxycodone they gave me once but I don't like the drugged feeling i get from that. I also asked them for a script for Adavan because I get wicked claustrophobia at times from things like being on an airplane, MRIs or anesthesia, and having a catheter in. I had the catheter out 7 days after surgery and I have been using Depends Guards and they work fine, better than the CVS brand. I've had very little incontinence in the day and none at night, but at night I wake up every hour feeling like I have to go and I get up and try to go and just pee a little. I haven't got a really good night's sleep yet but other than that I feel great. This is really important: Make sure you use the laxatives and stool softeners they give you too. I had no problem farting or having a BM using them. My brother also had the DaVinci surgery in Boston in 2011 and got a rare something called--phonetic spelling--illyis, which is when your bowels basically forget how to work. They put him back in the hospital for eight more days, fed him intravenously, let him chew ice chips and walk around. When he finally farted they sent him home. He's been fine since. I hope I am and that you are too. I'm not even two weeks out and I am already thinking it wasn't nearly as bad as I feared. If it wasn't so damn hot I'd be chafing at the bit to play golf (which I can't do for two more weeks according to my doc). Good luck.",

      "Content": "Radiation can knock the hell out of you but it probably is still after-effects of the infection. I had to get radiation after I had my left nut removed because of testicular cancer in 1989. I had to get 20 days worth to my lymph nodes but they stopped it after 15 treatments because my white blood count went too low (and that makes you feel really tired). They resumed the treatments after a few days. Also, if you get nauseous you may try taking a hit of pot. It works like a charm. I started puking after a few days and they didn't want me to lose any weight because it would move the tattoos. They gave me a pill called Compazine and I threw it up. My doctor told me marijuana would work and he was right. I'd get the radiation after work, go home and take a hit of pot, eat everything not tied down, and play guitar. It was illegal then but the doctors knew it worked.",

      "Content": "Hi Lilguy, I am four months post op and, like oshguy said, it is almost like it never happened. And that's even with a rare complication, an infected lymphocyle, that put me back in the hospital for awhile and put a drain in my stomach for another three weeks. Then i got facial cellulitis which could have been related to my compromised immune system according to the docs. But, like I said, I almost feel now like it never happened. I teach high school English every day and had eight pars in a round of golf last weekend. I have had virtually no incontinence other than an occasional squirt when i sneeze. I never had to wear a pad after one week post catheter and I never really did kegels much. I just posted that I had a PSA test today and I am still in the Zero Club. The only thing that is still a problem is some ED but that is getting better and my wife and I are working with what I get. Good luck, brother.",

I got lucky and Dr. Kibel spared the right nerves. Five weeks post op (robotic) I am totally continent (except when I suddenly sneeze I feel a squirt) and I am getting erections, but not great ones. I did have an infection in my gut called a lymphocele that put me back in the hospital for five days (and I still have a drain for it in my belly) but that is a rare surgical (<3 percent) complication and just some bad luck to balance my good luck on the other fronts.

I was lucky--my surgeon was able to retain a good urethra stem and I did not have a problem with incontinence after the first couple of weeks. I never really did the kegels that much--at least consciously. I found the pads incredibly uncomfortable and I think I just did a mind over matter thing and decided I was not going to pee in my pants. I always had what they call a \"bashful bladder\" and would have a hard time peeing on cue, especially in public. I could always stop it mid-stream. It may be that I was doing kegels without trying my whole life.",

      "Content": "Hello all, I'm 63 years old and I just had robotic surgery last Thursday. My doctor at Brigham & Women's in Boston said he took some extra off the top and the left side (including the nerve) but was confident he got it all. I was a Gleason 4+3 and my PSA was 4.1. Dr. Kibel called today to say pathology showed everything was good except for a \"positive focal margin\" on the right side. He said it was tiny and that it is probably not cancer but just some crap left over from the surgery. He said at this point he would just want to follow it with PSA tests. Needless to say, I heard \"positive\" louder than anything else he said and my wife and I are now a little worried. I would appreciate hearing from anyone who has dealt with this. I hope I am describing what he said correctly. My urine was pink/red for a while today but my brother (surgery in 2011) said his was too. Now it has changed back to yellow. Catheter is a hassle but keeping the opening clean and using bacitracin makes it bearable. I also ate like a horse today and my puncture wounds are healing up nicely. I haven't had to take any pain meds and I am walking a lot. If it wasn't for this damned focal thing I'd say it was a great day. Actually, I'll say it anyway--I'm still alive.",

It is the size of a ping pong ball.

      "Content": "There is a third option--radiation. I had radiation after testicular cancer surgery when I was 37 in 1989 (luckily you only need one) so when i found out I had PC last year, the scarring pretty much took standard radiation off the table. Also, the radiologist said the seeds would not work for me because my prostate was too small and any placement would radiate my urethra and that would not be good. My brother had PC in 2011 and had robotic surgery. A year later he had no side effects. I opted for robotic surgery too. I immediately found the best surgeon I could at the best hospital in the Boston area--Adam Kibel, head urologist at Dana Farber Cancer Institute at Brigham & Women's--scheduled the surgery, had it Aug. 6, 2015 and a year later I have no side effects, other than a little ED solved by generic Viagra. I actually had almost no side effects after a couple months. Here's my take on it. I was a journalist most of my life and I am use to digging for information. I found that although open and robotic surgery have about the same success rate, recovery is quicker with robotic. My urologist at UMass, who only did open surgery, was pissed when I went with Dr. Kibel but it's my life, and insurance was going to cover it either way. Go with the best you can find if you go with surgery--the quality of your life depends on it. I think the Mayo Clinic has a great reputation in your neck of the woods. As far as active surveillance, that was not an option for me but I think I would not feel comfortable knowing PC was there. Biopsies also do not sample all of the prostate so there is a chance there is more. Whatever you choose, Wbigs, you'll do fine.

I found that although open and robotic surgery have about the same success rate, recovery is quicker with robotic. My urologist at UMass, who only did open surgery, was pissed when I went with Dr. Kibel but it's my life, and insurance was going to cover it either way. Go with the best you can find if you go with surgery--the quality of your life depends on it. I think the Mayo Clinic has a great reputation in your neck of the woods. As far as active surveillance, that was not an option for me but I think I would not feel comfortable knowing PC was there. Biopsies also do not sample all of the prostate so there is a chance there is more. Whatever you choose, Wbigs, you'll do fine. As our moderator Chuck likes to point out, Gleason 6 never kills anyone.",

The robot makes five small incisions in your belly and then pulls the prostate out through the longest one--just a couple inches--near your belly button. I did end up back in the hospital for five days three weeks after my operation because i developed an infected lymphocele. I've had a stomach drain since. I can't wait to get this drain out of my stomach--maybe today! The lymphocele is a rare complication and the odds are your father will not get one.

Cut stomach or somehow different? I dont know. Yes, Marve, the next day. I had robotic surgery using a DaVinci machine. The robot makes five small incisions in your belly and then pulls the prostate out through the longest one--just a couple inches--near your belly button. I did end up back in the hospital for five days three weeks after my operation because i developed an infected lymphocele. I've had a stomach drain since. I can't wait to get this drain out of my stomach--maybe today! The lymphocele is a rare complication and the odds are your father will not get one. With G6 your dad has a great prognosis and should do fine.",

      "Content": "To all the new members or the recently diagnosed, One year ago I was where you are. Actually I was on my way to the golf course when my UMass urologist called to tell me I had prostate cancer. I was not surprised. I knew his nurse would have told me that I didn't if the biopsy was negative so i figured when she said he would call me back it was not good. Plus my older brother had it in 2011. Because my brother was doing fine, and because I had survived testicular cancer when I was 35 and had a benign brain tumor removed when I was 50, I wasn't even that worried. I started to investigate my options and ended up choosing robotic surgery by Dr. Adam Kibel, the head of urology at Dana Farber/Brigham & Women's Hospital. My UMass guy was pissed but, hey, it's my life and I wanted to go with the best. That's an important thing to realize--it's your life, so find the best, most experienced surgeon. I had the surgery in August after a two week trip to Yellowstone with my wife. It went great. Dr. Kibel said he was able to save a good urethra stem and predicted incontinence wouldn't be a problem. He also spared the nerves on one side. I had the catheter out in a week and didn't need a pad after two weeks. I was ready to go back to work--I teach high school English--in three weeks but all of a sudden I got knocked flat by a rare complication, an infected lymphocele. It felt like Mike Tyson punched me in the stomach. That put me back in the hospital for five days and on a stomach drain for two more weeks. They day before I returned to school I played 18 holes and shot an 88. And it's important to note that the lymphocele is extremely rare. Everything since then has been great, so much so that I barely remember the operation and recovery. I still have a bit of ED but thanks to Viagra and an elastic we make it work. I still come on this forum because it was so helpful to me and I want to pay it forward. My message to the newly diagnosed is that the prostate cancer diagnosis may seem like the end of the world but one year later it feels to me like a barely remembered dream.",

The robot makes five small incisions in your belly and then pulls the prostate out through the longest one--just a couple inches--near your belly button. I did end up back in the hospital for five days three weeks after my operation because i developed an infected lymphocele. I've had a stomach drain since. I can't wait to get this drain out of my stomach--maybe today! The lymphocele is a rare complication and the odds are your father will not get one.

I was out of the hospital the next day. I did not have radiation too. I had my PSA tested one month later but I think most wait for two months. Mine was <0.02 (undetectable) which was very good news. My surgeon/urologist is following me. Your dad's Gleason 6 score is the best you could hope for (mine is G3+4+7) and he will be fine. Good luck.",

I am planning to go back to teaching when school starts on Sept. 2 and I feel I could already play golf but my doc said to wait for a month. I am having a hard time sleeping for more than an hour or two at a time--which is why I am writing this at 2:30 a.m.-- because I feel the need to urinate constantly at night when I don't really have to. I've been using pads in the day to catch the infrequent leak. My sexy wife and I fooled around a bit last night for the first time and I achieved a half decent erection for a little while. So far, so good on all fronts of recovery. Having the catheter in sucked and I was really bruised and swollen on my left side and my genitals but that is all gone now. Anesthesia knocks the hell out of you and stays in your body for quite a while but little by little it gets better every day. My brother had the surgery in 2011 and had a couple of problems but even with that he was back to work and on the links in a couple of months. Hang in there, brother. This forum is a godsend. I've used it often and got great info and reassurance from guys who have been down this road already.",

I was on Cialis before and sildenafil definitely works better for me. They are legit--you have to have your doc call in a prescription--and fast. I got my pills in the mail in 3 days. BTW, I was getting Cialis for next to nothing because a friend of mine, a fellow PC survivor, got his insurance company to pay for it. Mine wouldn't and it would have been prohibitively expensive. Plus it didn't work great for me. Prescription Viagra was even more expensive. I called CVS and asked how much it would be for 10 tabs of 100mg and they said 480 buck--48 bucks a piece! Go with MM16's advice. It's the LUEA pharmacy in Swartz Creek, MI.",

      "Content": "I've been really lucky as far as recovery from surgery goes. I was ready to play golf and go back to work after three weeks. Other than a little squirt when I sneeze I have had no problems with incontinence since Day 1. ED is getting better bit by bit. My first post op problem was an infected lymphocele caused by leaking lymph nodes. At three weeks, it hit me like a Mike Tyson punch and put me back in he hospital for five days. Then I had a stomach drain for three more weeks. I finally had that removed on Sept. 25 and returned to work on Sept. 28. While at work (I teach in a high school) my nose started to hurt and turn purple. I went to my primary care guy that day. He took one look at me and sent me to the ER. \"You have facial cellulitis,\" he said. Five hours later, I went home after promising to return to the hospital every day for up to two weeks for IV antibiotics. Every day after school I would drive to the hospital in Worcester for a half hour IV. I had the IV port removed on Oct. 7 and played in a golf tournament with my brother and a gig with my band. Last Friday, a purple spot appeared on my nose again. Now I'm back on IV antibiotics. This is all related to surgery and lymph nodes and I have to say it sucks. Worse, my daughter in law, the mother of my 6 and 3 year old grandkids, just got diagnosed with uterine cancer. Has anyone else on this forum ever dealt with post-op cellulitis?",

I have had no problem with incontinence but ED has been up and down--literally. It seems to be getting better but nothing like pre-surgery. As far as urine leakage in orgasms, that was happening for awhile but disappeared two months ago. Paul",

      "Content": "Hello all, I'm 63 years old and I just had robotic surgery last Thursday. My doctor at Brigham & Women's in Boston said he took some extra off the top and the left side (including the nerve) but was confident he got it all. I was a Gleason 4+3 and my PSA was 4.1. Dr. Kibel called today to say pathology showed everything was good except for a \"positive focal margin\" on the right side. He said it was tiny and that it is probably not cancer but just some crap left over from the surgery. He said at this point he would just want to follow it with PSA tests. Needless to say, I heard \"positive\" louder than anything else he said and my wife and I are now a little worried. I would appreciate hearing from anyone who has dealt with this. I hope I am describing what he said correctly. My urine was pink/red for a while today but my brother (surgery in 2011) said his was too. Now it has changed back to yellow. Catheter is a hassle but keeping the opening clean and using bacitracin makes it bearable. I also ate like a horse today and my puncture wounds are healing up nicely. I haven't had to take any pain meds and I am walking a lot. If it wasn't for this damned focal thing I'd say it was a great day. Actually, I'll say it anyway--I'm still alive.",

It is the size of a ping pong ball. I just put jockey shorts on hoping the support helps--I had not used any support previously and just wore one of my wife's sarongs around the house and even when I walked in the yard.

I did end up back in the hospital for five days three weeks after my operation because i developed an infected lymphocele. I've had a stomach drain since.

This one was much easier--just a half hour-- and the doc said if the cellulitis clears significantly by Thursday she'll switch me to oral antibiotics. Also, I am not sure any of this has to do with me trying to be too active too soon. We all have staph and other germs on our skin and some apparently got into my belly to explain the lymphocele. Or maybe Da Vinci didn't wash his hands after a trip to the robot restroom. The dust in my nose may be the cause of the cellulitis but it's not like I was pushing a an old powerless mower.

      "Content": "Well, I finally went back to teaching yesterday. It was 52 days after my Da Vinci surgery. I was ready to go back on Aug. 31, the first day of school, but on the Saturday before I was laid low by an infected lymphocele and ended up back in the hospital for five days and with a drain in my gut for 19 days. The week before I went back I felt great--even shot an 86 in golf On Sept. 24, I mowed our big lawn. We are in the middle of a severe drought here and i got a lot of dust in my nose. On Friday I developed a pimple just inside my right nostril. By Saturday the outside of my nose became purple and it continued to spread. I tried to relieve it by popping it to no avail. My wife and I went out to eat and I was freezing although no one else in the restaurant was. When I returned to my school all the kids were excited and my fellow teachers were great. The day went well except my nose--which now made me look like WC Fields-- started killing me. I went to my family doctor and he took one look and said, \"you have cellulitis\" and added because it was on my face, I needed to go to an emergency room in Worcester for IV antibiotics. I did--and three hours later I got them. It was five hours by the time I left the hospital . They wanted to admit me but I begged them to let me go home. I just hate being in hospitals. They relented and said I could go if I committed to returning every day for two weeks for more IV antibiotics. I had to call in sick to school to do today's appointment. My nose still looks like Rudolph's but it doesn't hurt today. My family doctor said he thought the cellulitis was just a bad luck coincidence. One of the docs at St. Vincent said it could be related to my post-op infection because my immune system has been weakened. All I know is this is getting really old. I have been really lucky so far with the prostate surgery itself. My followup PSA was <.02. I had little pain and recovery was fast. The ED is getting better a little. I am totally continent during the day and don't even wear pads. I now generally only have to get up twice at night. I urinated in my bed on the seventh day after surgery but had no problem again like that till last night when I peed the bed again. I figure it had to be all the fluid they poured in my through the IV. Yesterday was not my day. Hopefully, today will be better.",

Hi Ron I think it does have to be for sildenafil and if you get it from LUEA it has to be 20mg because that is the only dose they sell. My physician's assistant called it in--90 tabs for 55 bucks-- and it only took a minute. Well worth it. It's basically 60 cents a pill. The phone number for LUEA is 810-635-3355.",

A doc in the ER said he thinks my immune system was knocked for a loop by the infected lymphocele. making it possible for the cellulitis to start. The PA who works with my surgeon said the lymphocele infection was caused by staph that almost invariably gets into a person during surgery. The infectious disease specialist who has been treating me for cellulitis said she doesn't know if they have anything to do with each other although staph is definitely the problem. She kind of took the fun out of the IV removal today by saying that I will probably get cellulitis again. My wife and I went out for blackened haddock fajitas and a pitcher of margaritas tonight.

Since you are in Rhode Island it is a short drive to Boston to the world renown Dana Farber Clinic or many of the other great hospitals there. I was diagnosed in Worcester at UMass, which is a wonderful hospital, and consulted with an oncologist and radiologist as well as a urologist there. But I also immediately did some research and made an appointment with Dr. Adam Kibel, the head of urology at Dana Farber/Brigham & Women's. He reviewed my slides from UMAss as did a Dana Farber pathologist. They also reviewed my MRI and Dr. Kibel ordered some additional tests. The doc at UMass did not do robotic surgery and that is what my wife and I decided we wanted so we went with Dr. Kibel. I feel we made a fully informed decision. It is your life, you should do the same.",

I get generic Viagra but I bet they have generic Cialis too. I get 20 mg Sildenafil since that is the only dose they carry and I take five at a time. I get 90 pills for $63 including shipping. I call it generic Viagra because sildenafil is the active ingredient in Viagra. It works better for me than Cialis. The number for Luea is 810-635-3355. You can call and ask them questions but your doc needs to call in a prescription before you can order.",

They both worked well and the Cialis worked for days--waking up with a giant erection at 4 a.m. for the next two nights was standard and a real pain. Now I'm three and a half months post op--doc took all the nerves on one side-- and fighting with my insurance company over a Cialis prescription. I have still been using it through the generosity of a friend who has a prescription for 30 pills of 20 mg per month. No one in their 60s gets laid that often so he gives me some. It hasn't worked great. I get hard enough for penetration but nothing to write to a porn movie producer about. There are signs it is getting better. I hope it does because my beautiful,wild and much younger wife is talking about dating--a tease which always worked better than Cialis or Viagra in the past.",

      "Content": "I posted this on Facebook Jan. 1 but it is even more appropriate here. Happy 2016. A lot of people had asked me if I\u0092d be glad when 2015 is over. In August I had prostate cancer surgery, followed by an infection that kept me out of school for a month. Then my daughter in law was diagnosed with uterine cancer. Then I had cellulitis which required daily IV antibiotics. Then our beloved dog Yaz died. But, you know what? I still kind of liked 2015. As the late great Jimmy McNally would say, \u0093Any day on this side of the grass is a good one.\u0094 The older I get, the more I see the glass half full. Some might think my 2015 resembled Norm MacDonald\u0092s finger licking career. I even found myself in November saying I couldn\u0092t wait till 2015 was over. But then I spent the week before Christmas playing music with my Clinton High students and the night after Christmas I played with my band at my buddy Kokes\u0092s Black Sheep. The band, with my in-the\u0096pocket son on drums, was rocking. At one point I looked out and my two amazing daughters and my wonderful daughter in law were dancing together. My beautiful wife and my beautiful ex-wife were dancing together. Damn, I must have done something right. Once again in 2015 my brother and I didn\u0092t win the Scituate CC Ringer, but, the important thing is, I got to play golf with my brother again. And I get to spend every school day with 120 wonderful young people. We read great books together, sing together and laugh together. Sometimes a little education for all of us actually slips through. I show my students video clips of my grandkids sometimes. I tell them that it took me nine years to finish college, that I\u0092ve been down and out as often as I\u0092ve been at the top of the mountain, and that I\u0092ve never made a lot of money. \u0094I wish you my kind of success.\u0094 That\u0092s what I tell them, just what Dicky Fox, the old guy, tells Jerry MaGuire. \u0093I love my wife. I love my life. I wish you my kind of success \u0093 I wish it for all of you too. Happy New Year\u0092s everyone.",

The bad news is the treatment is going to disrupt your life for awhile. I had the robotic surgery on Aug. 6 and I was all set to go back to teaching and playing golf on Aug. 30. Unfortunately I had a somewhat rare complication (an infected lymphocele) and that has set me back a few weeks, but again, that complication is rare. I also got a great report from my surgeon yesterday--no PSA now and, like he said, PSA is the smoke of prostate cancer. If there's no smoke, there's no fire. I don't have too much advice for you. Others on this forum know way more that I do, but I will say to definitely get a second opinion. Insurance will pay for it. Also, meet with an oncologist, radiologist etc. and explore your options You have plenty of time. The cancer you have has been growing for years and a few months now won't make a difference. And stay up--like one of my daughters said when I told her, \"that's a good kind of cancer, right.\"",

      "Content": "As you can see from my signature I too was a 7. Fifteen months post op now and it is like it never happened--and that included a month dealing with an incredibly rare surgical side effect. My brother--a 2011 DaVinci veteran-- and I even won a golf tournament last month. Full continence came almost immediately (not the case for everyone). The ED took longer for me but now ol Memo the Trouser Monster is back to fully stiff with the aid of generic Viagra. The dry orgasms are just as good as the old ones. Most importantly my PSA is undetectable. The best advice you will get on this forum is to make sure the surgeon you choose is experienced and good at what he does. This is your life and not all surgeons are the same. They all want to operate just like all quarterbacks want to play, but there aren't many Tom Bradys. Find the best you can. Good luck. I hope you have as good a trip as I've had.",

      "Content": "Hi Alan Welcome, unfortunately. This forum is a great source of information and camaraderie. The good news is that you are not going to die. The bad news is the treatment is going to disrupt your life for awhile. I had the robotic surgery on Aug. 6 and I was all set to go back to teaching and playing golf on Aug. 30. Unfortunately I had a somewhat rare complication (an infected lymphocele) and that has set me back a few weeks, but again, that complication is rare. I also got a great report from my surgeon yesterday--no PSA now and, like he said, PSA is the smoke of prostate cancer. If there's no smoke, there's no fire. I don't have too much advice for you. Others on this forum know way more that I do, but I will say to definitely get a second opinion. Insurance will pay for it. Also, meet with an oncologist, radiologist etc. and explore your options You have plenty of time. The cancer you have has been growing for years and a few months now won't make a difference. And stay up--like one of my daughters said when I told her, \"that's a good kind of cancer, right.\"",

Incontinence has not been a big problem since the first week except when I sneeze and if I feel the sneeze coming on I can do a kegel to block the squirt. I too lost the nerves on one side. I had an orgasm with Mr. Softee early on. I still don't get real hard but my wife (a mere 15 years younger) and I are making it work. I did notice the firmness is starting to increase a bit, aided by 10 mg of Cialis. My insurance company won't pay for it either but I have a friend on a different health plan who gets 30 day supplies of 20 mg for $3 a pop. Nobody screws that much so he sells me the surplus. The one thing that does suck is that when I have an orgasm, some urine comes out. I know other people have written that happened to them but I was hoping it would stop by now. One time when I was, ahem, practicing alone, a lot came out. My wife says that doesn't bother her but I can't imagine it is good for her.",

I've had virtually no incontinence but I did have ED issues. It would get as big as always but would not be very firm.This is getting better since I switched from Cialis to generic Viagra (sildenafil). Also I find if I empty my bladder completely before sex I now avoid the leakage problem. That is just recently so you should be there soon. I had a post-surgery complication with an infection that set me back a month but I also feel completely back to normal energy-wise. I've had two PSA test since surgery and both were <0.02.",

      "Content": "Hi Sky I'm about 70 days post op. Incontinence has not been a big problem since the first week except when I sneeze and if I feel the sneeze coming on I can do a kegel to block the squirt. I too lost the nerves on one side. I had an orgasm with Mr. Softee early on. I still don't get real hard but my wife (a mere 15 years younger) and I are making it work. I did notice the firmness is starting to increase a bit, aided by 10 mg of Cialis. My insurance company won't pay for it either but I have a friend on a different health plan who gets 30 day supplies of 20 mg for $3 a pop. Nobody screws that much so he sells me the surplus. The one thing that does suck is that when I have an orgasm, some urine comes out. I know other people have written that happened to them but I was hoping it would stop by now. One time when I was, ahem, practicing alone, a lot came out. My wife says that doesn't bother her but I can't imagine it is good for her.",
