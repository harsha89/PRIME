      "Content": "I was diagnosed with PC this last year Gleason 6 3+3. My family has urged me to get a second opinion on reading the biopsy slides. I have an appointment March 1 to have this second opinion with MO. Doing research I know this hospital has the 3T MRI. I have already had 2 biopsies with the first being negative. My next primary appointment isn't until March 21 and my next Urology appointment isn't till May. My first biopsy was pretty painless but second was quite painful. I don't relish the thoughts of having a biopsy every year so if it is necessary to continue them, I think it would be best for them to have access to this MRI to guide the biopsy. Can I have the opinions of those who have been through this. I sure appreciate all the information I have gleaned from this forum. Thanks to all",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by Southsider MRI imaging has a more prominent place in active surveillance than it did just a few years ago. Its a lot less invasive that the urologist shoving a cutting instrument into your keister for a biopsy, so its also a lot less likely to have side effects. I don't think you've mentioned where you're at, but if you're at an academic medical center, going for the MRI immediately instead of another biopsy at their suggestion makes pretty good sense. Thanks to all for your opinions on this. My second opinion is to be at UAMS Little Rock, AR which is next door to McClellan VA Hosp where I started my journey. Appreciate the advice. This is an excellent forum for gaining needed info. God Bless",

      "Content": "Hi Andy and Welcome. I too am on AS since Sept of 2017. VA has me coming back in for PSA checks every 6 months. My PSA is going up and May 1st my URO/Oncologist told me come back in 6 months and if still going up, then schedule another biopsy. In your case with PSA going down, there would not be a need for another biopsy. Your URO would be able to better advise. Stand by for others to reply also. Good Luck",

      "Content": "Welcome to Cancer Forums, Littleman. I think the reason you have not received any response is that your husband has not has his appointment to discuss his biopsy results. We are not doctors, just people who have or affected by prostate cancer. The benign means no cancer in these cores. A Gleason score rates cancer from Gleason 6, lowest grade to Gleason 10 highest and most aggressive. Please don't jump to panic mode when you see this Gleason 7. It is only reported in 10% of one core so that means that cancer is present. More will respond as time goes on. This is not life threatning at this time, and no treatment is necessary immediately. When you meet with the urologist, he will be able to explain things a lot better. But for now, this is the time for you to research. All the sticky threads at the top will give you excellent advice on different treatments, biopsies etc. When you get the biopsy results, please do a signature that you can use on all posts. Also a second opinion will be suggested from Dr Epstein from John Hopkins. It would be good to know your husbands age and your location as the members in that area can recommend who to see for surgery, radiation treatments, etc. I am on Active Survellance, which means you are checked with more PSA test every 3 to 6 months, MRI;s and possibly MRI guided biopsy in the future. Best of luck on this journey. Again please don't panic as all of us have had the cancer diagnois also. We are here to help you. God Bless",

He gave same results as first reading which was not a surprise as the same docs work at UAMS. He also told me looked like they were treating me right and no surgery needed at this time. On Mar 21 had appointment with PCP with lab work up. Free PSA at 13.5 low and PSA at 7.98. So would almost bet they will want to do another biopsy when go to URO/Oncology appointment May 1.

And while I am doing this, I would like all the info I can get as well as your educated opinions on which course of treatment is best for my circumstance. I feel like I am pretty well aware of the treatment options, but still value opinions on which options are best. Thanks to all in advance. I know with the stats so far, that I am low risk for now.

And my oncologist told me to expect another after I go back in October. Not fear maybe but dread. I will request the prostatic nerve block next time.

      "Content": "Thanks for posting this. Reminds me of the song \"And may all who come behind us, find us faithful\". I have overcome the initial anexity over the initial diagnois. But what if and when they do another biopsy, will they find more. My first biopsy was painless but the second was quite painful. And my oncologist told me to expect another after I go back in October. Not fear maybe but dread. I will request the prostatic nerve block next time.
