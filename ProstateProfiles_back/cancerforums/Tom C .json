      "Content": "I found out yesterday I have prostate cancer. My family physician found a bump like the head of a pin on the left side of my prostate in November. In January my new urologist took 10 cores and found the left side clean. But the right side had cancer in 2 cores. My psa is .78. My gleason is 6. Sorry, I don't recall the breakdown. My urologist is recommending removing the prostate. He says I'm young and I should just get rid of the cancer and I'll never have to worry about it again. I am going in for a CT scan next week so maybe this post is all premature. I am going to scour the internet and this chat and learn all I can so I can make an intelligent decision. I welcome any thoughts on the subject. Thanks!",

      "Content": "Thanks for the replies! Lots of good info and I'll do my best to become a quick study on the subject! I am 53. My family physician found a bump, he described it as feeling like the head of a pin, on the left side. The biopsy on that side came back clean and my urologist never offered an explanation for the bump. To tell you the truth I was kind of shocked and didn't ask many questions. Pretty much a dear in the headlights! Anyway, the right side has the cancer. When the urologist was doing the biopsy he commented the size and shape of the prostate was normal and I have no symptoms of an enlarged prostate. Never have to get up in the middle of the night to pee or have trouble going. I wish I could remember the name of the cancer. I thought it actually had \"Gleason\" in the name. He said it is a very slow growing cancer and if I had to have prostate cancer I picked the right one. He said if I was 75 or 80 I'd probably out live it. His attitude is at 53 I should just get rid of the problem and move on. I will absolutely be getting other opinions and if anyone here has a recommendation in the Tampa area I would love to hear it. I am not opposed to traveling of course. Not necessarily looking for the cheapest or most convenient medical care! Thanks very much! You all are great! Tom C.",
