      "Content": "Good Morning all New 48 year old user here from New Zealand and have enjoyed generally pretty good health. Last week my Doctor ran some routine blood tests for me and included a PSA test. He phoned the following day having received the results which he said were of concern and could I call and see him, which I duly did the following day. Anyway, I have a PSA level of 40.48. Two years previous, a PSA test gave a result of 0.32. He undertook a DRE which he said revealed an enlarged prostate but it was relatively smooth. I have had no previous symptoms, although, since having this test, I do seem to notice I am up sometimes a couple of times a night to urinate and I do seem to have a bit of back ache, although that is nothing out of the ordinary for me I guess and has been something that comes and goes. An appointment has been made with the Uroligist but that is still a week away and he is going to schedule an MRI and some Bone scans. The worst of it is the waiting and not knowing and at times like this Dr Google is your worst enemy in many ways.",

      "Content": "3T MRI completed yesterday. Now just the continued wait to see the Uro, if the lack of sleep doesn't get me first! Just to answer some earlier questions, I am not on any supplements that would spike Testoserone, I hate riding bikes, and the DRE came after the Blood test. As for the sex part, does dreaming about it count? haha I was not really sure what the MRI will show but from reading here, it seems that it will identify any potential trouble spots, but I would still more than likely need a Biopsy to get a positive (or negative) diagnosis, although I suppose if the MRI and Bone scans show nothing adverse the first step would probably be another PSA test to see if it was just a rogue result?",
