Still waiting to go over the pathology report in another 3 weeks and do another PSA test. How do they determine if RT will be needed? If my PSA is 0 or undetectable, does that alone mean no RT? Just curious. Thanks. Mike",

      "Content": "The 4K Score is not an alternative to a prostate biopsy. Think of it as a preliminary test to determine if you should have a biopsy. The 4K Score test does NOT determine if you have cancer. Only a biopsy can do that. The 4K score test is a blood test that determines if you are at a high risk of prostate cancer and is usually done on men with a PSA > 3.0. While a PSA of 3.0 is acceptable by itself, a 4K score test showing you at a high risk will result in your Urologist recommending you for a biopsy. If it comes out as low risk, then your Urologist may simply continue to monitor your PSA. When my PSA started climbing, I had the 4K score test. When the results showed me as high risk, then I had my biopsy 2 weeks later.",
