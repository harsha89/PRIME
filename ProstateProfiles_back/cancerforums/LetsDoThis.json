      "Content": "Soooo..we finally had the LONG awaited 3 month Post RALP f/u appointment for my husband. We met with our Urologist, a Radiation Oncologist and Medical Oncologist. Good News: PSA Result was <.10 -- so that was encouraging. (They don't use the ultra-sensitive assays.) However because of the Path results - Staging pT3a N1 MO - with Extracapsular extension, Perineural Invasion and the Positive Lymph node they feel like we have a window to get ahead of things and all concurred that the best course of action for him would be to start Hormone Therapy and Radiation. They all feel that we are still talking about a cure at this point, so that was encouraging. Their recommended course of Action would be to start Hormone Therapy next month (Lupron 3 Month shots) and that would last a year. He would then get started with the initial scans/measurements done for radiation in September and then start a 7 to 7.5 week course of Radiation (5 days a week) in October...about 2 weeks after they do the initial scan/measurements. (The idea is to stamp out anything in the prostate bed/lymph nodes.) We kind of expected this next phase, but I think part of us also were in denial too. He is feeling just about 100% back to normal and while the cancer really never left our minds ... things were getting back to 'normal' and the 3 months seemed to drag, we started to think that maybe we wouldn't need any further treatment. He says it's surreal because he never has had any symptoms through his short journey and it's just weird to put yourself through all of this based on test results. But I know we are lucky to have those test results. Husband wants to proceed so unless something major happens, he will start HT in August. Sometimes I don't know what to think as I have ready info that goes either way. (Treat now or wait until a rising PSA.) But hubby feels like he is good hands ---so that's the plan. He's worried/bummed out. I'm a little worried on how this will affect him. I've been reading all I can on what to expect and I know every case is different. A whole new world. As always thank you all for your knowledge and shoulders Gina",

      "Content": "Hi everyone, My 50 year old husband seems to have bought himself a ticket to the club. We got the call last week and have our first doc appt with the Urologist on this Friday. I've been trying to soak everything in and I bought Patrick Walsh's Guide to Surviving Prostate Cancer...but my head is just spinning and I think I've just got information overload on top of a little anxiety. I was hoping I could get a list of questions to ask when we see the doc on Friday? There is a lot I don't know about our situation, and from what I've read here, I think we are in a fortunate place with our initial diagnosis, but of course you always worry about the worst. Here's some info on us: *regular physical in September 2014 (hadn't had one in a few years) *Doc called in Oct because PSA level was a little elevated (5.6) and ordered repeat test *Repeat PSA came back about a point or so higher...I can't remember the exact amount but will find out. Somewhere around 6.7 or 7.something. *Doc referred him to a Urologist *Had DRE the day before Thanksgiving, doc though one side felt a 'little' firm ordered biopsy *Had biopsy Jan. 21st (12-Core) - Did great at biopsy, minimal bleeding - didn't think it was as bad as he anticipated *Doc called with news that there was cancer, Early stage and a Gleason 6 *Sched initial appt with urologist this past Monday but snow so r/s to Fri 2/6 *Husband's Father had prostate cancer, I believe he was diagnosed in his early 70's, and had some type of radiation --possibly seeds -- and I don't believe he had any further issues. He passed from Lung Cancer almost 3 years ago at the age of almost 80. *My husband had unexplained back pain for a few months in the summer/fall, but says he doesn't have anymore. Probably totally unrelated, and probably something we should have addressed, but thinking..could it be related? In the meantime I found this message board and have started on Walsh's book but I just thought I'd seek out some assistance on what info I should be getting at the doc appt. I know it's early on and we are lucky but I also know from what I've read that now is the time to make the best decisions so thank you all for any help you can give me My husband is not really a computer or message board guy. I haven't been able to get him to even pick up Walsh's book either. I'm not sure if I read it here or in the book, but I think he's got that \"ostrich\" syndrome, where he's burying his head in the sand. He's anxious and very surprised by this. He wants the cancer out and thought I was trying to collect on life insurance when I was trying to explain active surveillance to him! (I don't know if that is an option for him, the more I read, the more I don't think it is, but I was just trying to explain it to him. Oy!) So for the doc appt, here is some items I think I should get, but would love any input on what you would ask: *Copies of the pathology report *Breakdown of how many cores showed cancer and the percentage of cancer in each core *Who/Where the pathologist was and do they only do prostate cancer pathology? Do I ask to send the slides out for a 2nd opinion on pathology? If so, where? Also, Suggestions on where to go for a 2nd Doctor opinion? Urologist? I'm in the Lowell/Boston, MA area. (I know little about the urologist we are using, other than the primary referred us and my husband's elderly uncle was treated by him and says they are wonderful.) I'm sorry if I'm asking repeat questions...and I appreciate any help. Thank you.",

I hadn't heard of this test before and didn't know if it was something that any of you have had done? Sounds like it could help make a decision on additional treatment for some men. Just curious.

She has a bag with treats- lemon drops for bad taste- flavor water- and other treats. Along with a card with encouraging words about strength and fighting this cancer. Our grand daughter adds a color picture to bring him joy. I think all the staff is looking forward to the bags of gifts as much as Steve is. Maybe this can start something from all you caregivers and familys out there It is the things people say and do that heals us as much or more than medical science. Awesome idea!

      "Content": "Hi Beeswife! Boy can I relate! Our situation was a little different in pathology, but we think there will probably be add'l treatment due to lymph node involvement. We did not expect the results and stupidly and the doc gave the results to us at the catheter removal appt....so we just weren't prepared with questions. The doc told us the same....recover and wait 3 months for a new PSA reading. The waiting and wondering sucks! But we are trying to make the best of it. My husband is now 4 weeks out. His continence is very good and he stopped wearing pads a few days after...still some very mild dribbling but he's very happy as he thought it would be worse. I know everyone is different. (The ED department is a different story though....although we can see progress so we are hopeful.) He will go back to work a week from Monday and I think he's ready. He still does get tired a lot though and has some aching in his legs but overall is doing pretty good. These guys are great on this forum...as you are already seeing. My husband is just a message board guy either...he gets a kick out of all my 'friends' here and it's such a huge help of being able to see everyone's stories ...we can relate to so much of it. Hang in there and thoughts and prayers to you too )",

      "Content": "Hi Everyone, Just wanted to give an update on my husband. (History is in sig.) But basically he was dx at 50, originally Gleason 6...had Open Surgery at the end of March, upgraded to 7....with lymph node involvement. Stage T3a. First Post PSA was undetectable. So the plan is to use this window to do a 2 year course of Hormone Therapy (Lupron - 3 month shots) and an 7.5 week course of radiation. The docs still feel like this will give him the best chance of curing it. (Sometimes I wonder if we are doing the right thing...since we can't see anything right now....but we're putting our trust/faith in what the team of docs have seen and dealt with.) In August he had his first hormone therapy treatment (shot of Lupron). Side effects are not too horrible so far. Having some hot flashes, mainly at night. He is usually a non-stop guy. He told me he feels a lack of motivation....he has to force himself to go out to mow the lawn, where as before he would be right out there and then do a zillion other things. No incontinence. He still has sexual interest.....but well....can only really go..halfway 'up' at this point. The nurse recently told him that his drive will probably diminish all the way when he gets his next Lupron (Hormone therapy) shot next month. He can't imagine that..LOL. We are dealing though...honestly I kinda think our relationship is closer than we were before. (We are told that drive will come back at end of hormone therapy...he's really hoping that is the case.) Radiation starts this week. He went to get set-up last week. We knew some of what was going to happen..but were surprised at other stuff. He got the tattoo's...which I read about here. Tiny, little dots. (We'll have to save the \"I love Gina\" for next time We both didn't realize that he would have a 'rectal' balloon at each radiation treatment. They put it in...and fill it with water to push the bladder up and out of the way to try and avoid any radiation to that. They are radiating the prostate bed and a wider area to cover the lymph nodes too. Of course he can deal..he just didn't realize it...and the techs were all really pretty too. They were all really awesome though. His plan is to work the whole time, unless he feels like he can't and then he will take time if needed. Otherwise he feels pretty good. He is dealing with weight gain and having a hard time finding motivation to exercise....but we're working on that too. Just wanted to update our experience so far. I hope to get on here and read updates on all of you too. Thanks again for all of you who have helped us on our journey Gina",

By the way, from his signature I did not see his post op/pre hormone PSA posted, was it undetectable? Best wishes. Meant to list that...undetectable.

      "Content": "Originally Posted by Fairwind Best of luck to you...As time goes on, the the side-effects from the ADT will worsen..The hot flashes, the loss of most of his body hair, libido and ability drop to zero. And the lethargic feeling and if you are not careful, the weight gain...But with a positive attitude you can overcome most of these things, you just have to work at it... That's what I'm afraid of. He is struggling with the weight...he's always been a skinny guy, but looks like he has a beer belly now. Definitely trying to keep up the positive attitude. I have to admit..some days I am questioning if all this is really necessary? Is he going through this and all these changes...all for nothing? I guess you just have to have faith it is.",

      "Content": "Hi Everyone, Has anyone ever experienced a receding testosterone level over 18 months after your last Lupron injection? (Last Lupron shot was a 3 month and only had 2 total.) Over the last few months my husband has been experience painful breasts....mainly when he rolls over or something pushes against them. (He did not experience this during the Lupron Treatment.) He had his regular Oncologist appointment this past week and he says it's most likely gynecomastia. (Good news, is that his PSA has been <.01 since treatment!) He then had him get blood work to see what testosterone level is currently at. We just got results back from the portal and the testosterone is receding for some reason. So his last Lupron (3 month) was given in November 2015. Last radiation was mid-December 2015. (Also had prostate out in March 2015) His Testosterone Results: (Standard range according to the hospital portal is 249-836 ng/dl) 5/13/16: 15 8/30/16: 176 11/15/16: 214 5/16/17: 169 We are still waiting to hear back from the oncologist on the result but during the appointment he said it wouldn't be normal for Testosterone to go backwards at this point. I can't seem to find any info on the testosterone climbing back to normal and then receding again. Of course the oncologist said (while we were chatting before this latest test result) that giving him testosterone is not an option -- as that could cause issues with any dormant cancer cells. But there are a lot of medical problems associated with low T levels too. He's had blood in his urine since he finished treatment. He's had (1) Cysto and nothing abnormal noted so they chalked it up to be part of the irritated bladder from the surgery/radiation, etc. He's been in the ER for kidney stones 3x since August. The most recent within 2 a month period. And at each cat scan they don't show any additional stone. So the last one formed quite quickly, within 2 months. Last Cat Scan Kidney also enlarged -- which wasn't an issue the first two stones. Going to see a Kidney Stone specialist on Monday....they say probably unrelated the prostate cancer and treatment...but I don't know....something just feels like it doesn't add up. And now his blood pressure is elevated too. His bladder control is very good. ED still pretty much sucks. He has a feeling there is something more going on although he's trying to stay positive. But he just feels crappy. He's working and trying to live a normal life. Just wondered if anyone has had the testosterone receding again or any input? Thanks guys! Gina",

Of course we have all kinds of 'what ifs\" and I know we shouldn't..but how can you not. Feel like it's going to be a long 3 months..... I don't think either of us were expecting the results last Friday, so we were totally unprepared for questions.

      "Content": "Hi Bright Sky, Sorry to hear about your Uncle's diagnosis. I agree with the others and it seems odd that the Oncologist is being very vague. I would seek another opinion all together from docs that you can ask any question and can get answers that you fully understand. There is still so much that can be done. On the hormone therapy.....there are side effects. But considering what so many others go through with cancer treatment, it is not the worst thing. My husband is currently on Lupron, at age 51. He is experiencing some weight gain, some lack of energy and some heavy duty hot flashes. He did have surgery at the end of March (nerves spared), incontinence was gained back almost immediately after catheter was taken out. However he was dealing with ED before he started Lupron and Radiation. Docs are telling us that there is still help for that. They also still consider him curable. Everyone is different of course. Best of luck to you. These guys on this forum are wonderful! Gina",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by white08gt after coming off of Eligard my testosterone came up into the low 400s after about 6 months. since then has been steadily decreasing to less than 200 with no sign of increasing. I developed gynecomastia, with lumps in both breasts with the left side very tender. when i would roll on my left at night it would wake me up. had a couple of mammograms, thinking breast cancer but not. Doctor more or less said my body was confused from the hormone therapy taking my testosterone to zero. I opted out 6 months after finishing my SRT. could not take the side effects of HT, also think it had something to do with heart problems which I never had had. for me opting out of HT for 2 years has been the right choice, <0.05 for the last 2 years. still have side effects from low T. thinking of starting testosterone replacement therapy, Urologist said I could start but would need to come in for PSA testing every 6 weeks to be checked. Thanks for that sharing that. It's just so weird that it will be 2 years in November since he's had a Lupron shot....and now he's just developing the gynecomastia, never had an issue during. He's having that very same problem, rolling over and waking up to the pain. Still waiting for the oncologist call back to hear what he has to say. I'm thinking he will probably say the same thing..hormone confusion. Man does this disease really stink for you guys. I know our oncologist said he wouldn't give him testosterone but if this keeps up, I wonder if we should explore too.... We did get the Kidney stone results and they are 100% Uric Acid. So they are doing another c-scan and some blood work done to rule out anything else, but if that turns up ok, than they can start him on some meds so those don't happen again. (I really wish the stone was tested after the first attack and we could have nipped this before the other attacks...argh!) So always get those stones tested people Thanks for the welcome back Michael and Dave. I'm sorry I haven't been keeping up with this. Especially when all of you have been just so supportive and such an awesome resource too. I'll try to do a better job. I'll keep you posted if we hear anything else too Wishing everyone a Happy Memorial Day Weekend and Good PSA test results Gina",
