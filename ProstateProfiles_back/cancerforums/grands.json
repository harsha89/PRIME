    "Content": "Hi and thanks for the forum. I had a biopsy around 2 years ago and every 6 months the doctor draws blood for a psa.When I was diagnosed with prostate cancer after a biopsy my psa goes up and down.I was told the cancer is in an area that is slow growing could this be the reason of the psa's are not staying the same? Thanks in advance for your reply! grands",
