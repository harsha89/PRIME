      "Content": "I have been reading this forum for weeks as I feared my husband would receive bad news; which he has. The initial shock and fear have sunk in and now I just want advice and or hope. We were told if he does nothing he will die in a year. He is only 57! I am not looking to be a widow anytime soon. He started on hormone therapy last week (Casodex 50 mg daily) and got a shot of Eligard yesterday. He will have blood work again in April; which seems so far away, that is also when he will have another Eligard shot. Anyone out there with advanced PC that has any advice or inspiration? Thanks!",

I am encouraging my husband to eat more of a raw diet, and join the gym with me. He is agreeable I know he is scared, but I do beleive he will get more engaged and do whatever is needed to enhance his quality of life and survival.
