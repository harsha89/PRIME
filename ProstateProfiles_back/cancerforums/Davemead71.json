      "Content": "I am a United States Navy veteran. I have always been proud of my Tucson VA. Everyone treats me great there. I moved to Arizona in 2009 and immediately transferred to the Tucson VA. Before I moved here, I used the VA in West Los Angeles. As you may imagine, it was a busy VA Hospital. I received great service there and I received everything I needed. No cancer discovered at this point. Before I left the Los Angles VA my PSA was checked annually. In Nov 8, 2007 my PSA was 0.078, September 16, 2008 my PSA was 0.079 and then March 23, 2009 at the Tucson VA a noticeable reading of PSA .89, **October 26, 2009 PSA was .80.. This was an indication to keep a close eye on me and check my PSA regularly maybe even more often than is regular. But VA didn\u2019t! After October, 26,2009 I didn't have any PSA test even though I had been going to the VA for regular check ups. I had no sickness during this time span but I had a surgery for a left arm tendon repair , a surgery for my nose to improve my breathing, and a surgery for drooping eye lids. All these surgeries were done in the OR and blood was taken prior to,surgery. *But no PSA!**I also had other periodic blood work done, 8 times in total. For almost four years*I had NO PSA\u2019s done! During this period my PSA was in High gear and when my PSA was finally checked it was 6.17 H. If I had been taken to surgery at this time I believe they could have removed my Prostate Sac Intact and I wouldn\u2019t be in the fix I\u2019m in now. If I had not requested a testosterone test I would not even know I had prostate cancer now! August 6, 2013 my Primary Doctor ordered a blood test to check my testosterone *level at my request. The PSA came back with the Testosterone test the PSA was 6.17 H,, **( Now this is when I knew I had a problem) at this time If I had prostate surgery I don't think I would be dying of prostate cancer now. *PSA recorded on September 17, 2013 was 6.72 H (I still could have been saved had I had surgery at this Time ),,, **October 21, 2013, PSA recorded at 7.63H, *( I think I*still could have been saved with prostate surgery ) ***December 19, 2013 PSA was 7.62H, but surgery may have save me, *January 28, 2014 my PSA was 7.81H, ( I still could have been saved ), *this next one is when they killed me, *February 13, 2014 my PSA went to 9.47H, ,, surgeon said that not much could be done for me and that most Urologist would not do surgery at this high PSA level however he said that if I were his brother he would recommend surgery. So I agreed to the surgery. My surgery was March 4, 2014,, Radical prostatectomy, unsuccessful as it failed to remove the prostate sac intact. The margins around the prostate showed a positive reading. Nothing in the lymph glands and nothing in the Seminal vessels either.* April 17, 2014, my PSA after surgery was 2.33 , *on May 23, 2014 my PSA elevated *to 2.80, *at this time I was put on an injunction of female hormones ( Eligard ), this does nothing to kill the cancer but I'm told it puts the cancer to sleep for a time. My body can reject the injection at any time. I continue to have the injection and my PSA readings are continuing to come in at less than 0.06, so this is good! * My PSA was recorded early and nothing was done until it became PSA 9.47. At I this point not much can be done for me. Prostate Cancer. I have had radical prostatectomy which included all the seminal vessels, at the time of the surgery on March 4, 2014 the surgeon *caused a fistula that as of this date has not healed and I currently have a colostomy and a catheter, causing me depression. My situation is complicated by the surgeon cutting a hole in my bladder and in my rectum. After surgery I had a catheter inserted and a colostomy. Now this was bad, but the really bad part is that I am unable to have radiation and that left me with only one treatment. Eligard. I continue with that treatment at this time. I asked the surgeon that with his experience what did he think my time left may be. Without hesitation he said I could have between 2 to 5 years. With Eligard, I hope that may increase. Since I began writing this letter, several months have past. I have had a sucessful surgery to repair the bladder and the rectum and several months have past again and I have had the colostomy reversed.!!! Yea!!! I feel great, my attitude is great and I don't have a catheter or a colostomy after 20 months. I feel great again! ** This letter rambles some but I think you may understand my situation. Thanks for listening. David Mead",

      "Content": "TerminL Cancer. In some ways it's good to know your dying. I feel good, I look great. My mind is sharp. and I have a terrific support system. I have time to get my affairs in order. I need to sell my home buy another one that will be easier for my wife to take of. I need to start selling off things that I have saved for years, things I cherish. My situation isn't one that is a ZERO club thing. I don't watch numbers that will never get to the point that I might die from prostate cancer. I know it's a scary thing to have any kind of cancer, however, as I am told most with prostate cancer won't die from it. Some prostate cancer is slow growing and I'm told that most die of old age or some other ailment before prostate cancer will get them. OH how I wish I were in that group of people! Back to the I need to stuff. I need to select where I will be after I die. I think I have that but my wife and I are still discussing it. I want to go to a Military Post Cemetery. When I die, I can be buried there and when my wife dies she can be buried there too. They put my information on one side and my wife's information on the other side of the stone. I like that. I'm going to take my Grandkids camping and fishing at my favorite place in the Sierra Mountains above Minden Nevada. We're going to sleep in a tent and I'll teach them a little about cooking outside and hope this trip may stir their interest and pray they become campers and fishermen. I LOVE THEM SO MUCH! So Much To Do, So Little time to do it!",
