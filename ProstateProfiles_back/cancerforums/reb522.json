      "Content": "10 days post op today. Had to return to surgeon earlier than scheduled yesterday for infection and swelling at the catheter entrance. It was so badly swollen that the surgeon asked if I was circumcised which I am. He had nurse remove catheter and it was extremely painful due to swelling. He prescribed an antibiotic for the infection but did not do a culture or anything. When I urinate, I can't get a straight flow because of the mucous and pus. The doctor told me to come back on Friday for him to recheck it \"because if it gets worse, you can die from it\". Not sure what he meant and I was in too much shock and pain to think about what questions to ask. He also said the surgical biopsy increased my Gleason score to 7 AND that they found cancer at the bladder neck. He told me to wait on any treatment for that until they do my 4 week post op PSA - saying if it was not 0 then we would consider radiation. Very frustrated. Has anyone else had these issues?",
