      "Content": "My father started Zytiga 25th of May 2011 after Casodex, Taxotere (9 years after discovery the desease in terminal stage). Thanks to this forum we tried HD Keto first - too many side effects. Zytiga lowered testosteron level around 10 times - had to be good news. But there were no visible effect of the treatment. Father passed away in July. I have a little more than 1 bottle left. Paid 5700 usd for a bottle (no insurance), including doctor fee and pharmacist fee. If you'd like to try, contact me by email, pay whatever you can pay.",
