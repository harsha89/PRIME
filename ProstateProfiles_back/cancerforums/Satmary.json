Don't let the list of SE's scare you away, but they tend to get worse over time. Have them do 3 month shots and evaluate it as you go. Tom I agree with Tom. Give ADT a try. It is fully reversible. Nothing drops PSA faster than getting rid of testosterone. Also, I would not listen to your doctor's survival prognosis statistics. Everybody is different. According to Sloan-Kettering Nomograms, I should have died 4 years ago. Furthermore, you might find that your quality of life will not suffer on ADT, it will just be different. I was diagnosed 6 years ago, at age 51, and have been on ADT for 5.5 years. At the time of diagnosis, I was a sexaholic, and my wife and I were VERY active in that department. I could not have imagined life without sex, but I wanted to live, and my wife wanted me to survive, as well. Now, I have zero sex, and zero sex drive, but I don't really miss it. My wife is perfectly fine with that, too. We're actually closer and more loving now than ever. ADT does have some other side effects, but they can be managed. I've found that daily Citalopram eliminated hot flashes and stabilized my mood, as well. I wish you all the best. - William",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by Pottk I am 8 months since surgery and still have no control . I am using 12 to 15 pads a day unless i use the alphadry condom catheter. The catheter has given me some resemblance to a normal life but there are still worries. At this with confirmation from my surgeon i have started the process of moving forward with having the AUS installed. Earlier this week i had a urodynamic test done not to sure what that will show but one thing is after my bladder was filled i could not stop the release. I don't want,to be centered around peeing my pants. I seldom use an incontinence pad, but rely almost entirely on a clamp. My favorite is the \"J-Clamp,\" which has been recently discontinued. I wear the J-clamp 24/7, and only remove it for urination or showers. Other clamps, like the \"Cunningham,\" are available, and Medicare will pay for them as well.

      "Content": "Originally Posted by Jebstart Thank you Lance, Fran, and Chuck for putting it in perspective. That is what I like about this board, experience, perspective, and encouragement. I will read this often! Jeb I'm 5 years post-op and still have incontinence. Pads were a pain and embarrassing. I recently discovered the J-clamp (google it). I bought one on eBay for about $50. It changed my life. Then I learned that insurance will pay. Call Urological Supplies Inc. at 855-730-4838 and they will FAX the form to your doctor and ship you the clamp. The clamp is designed break after about 90 days, but insurance pays for 1 clamp every three months. The J-clamp is a small flesh-colored collar that fits on your shaft, just behind the head. A rotating metal clip provides pressure to a ball at the underside of the shaft. Urine flow is restricted, but the collar is shaped to allow plenty of blood flow. It works like a charm!",

      "Content": "During a routine follow-up, doctors discovered an umbilical hernia. An MRI confirmed it, and also revealed an incisinal hernia from my robotic prostatectomy. A surgeon told me that I will eventually need both to be repaired surgically at some point. They don't bother me, so I'm putting off the surgery. I may die from PC before the hernias become problematic. My advice would be to have it checked out, so you know what you're dealing with. Originally Posted by shu246 Don't know. I had rt inguinal hernia repair at age 5, Lt. side at age 17, and both sides re-done about 2001. Then the area got worked over again last year with the prostatectomy. Some sharp single pains, like a pinch or needle poke, was something I had after the laproscopic work in 2001, but not after the prostatectomy. I put it down to surgical staples inside. Several times - every three or four months for a couple of years after the 2001 surgery, I would lift something wrong, or twist while lifting, and swear I'd sprung another hernia. But no, two or three weeks avoiding heavy work, and whatever was torn loose seemed to heal back. Actually it was about 1 year before I could sit for a long period without discomfort, and two years before I felt no more random pains or other problems. Same thing after the prostatectomy. Eight months out I thought I was cast iron again, and pushed up to 10 kilometers daily on the Concept 2 rowing machine. Then groin pains, rt testicle swelling, etc. Totally left off the rowing machine for two months, got an ultrasound of the area, and it's almost back to normal. Started ten days ago back on the rower with 2K, up to 6K now. Just don't push it, Steve. Gotta give it some time.",

      "Content": "For incontinence I use the J-clamp (google it). It works great! Medicare covers most of the cost. Call USI at 855-730-4838. As for impotence, my doctors lied me. Prior to surgery they bragged that they could \"give an erection to a dead man.\" So I opted for the Non-nerve sparing surgery, which was a mistake, since they later learned that PC had already spread to lymph nodes. After a recovery period I tried injections (I forget the brand name). Injections gave me a partial erection, but it was excruciatingly painful, like a bad cramp. Then insurance bought me a fancy pump, which almost works, but the quality of the erection (if successful) was marginal. I never tried TriMix -- I was told that would be pain-free. Then I started hormone therapy and lost my libido. My wife lost hers, either out of sympathy for me or early menopause. So, we don't even try to have sex anymore. Cuddling works fine. I am 56 and she is 45. I've been battling with PC for five years. Prior to PC, we had a VERY, VERY active sex life (wink, wink, nudge, nudge...) So, either God is punishing me for my lustful youth, or he's telling me that I've already had enough sex for ten men, and it's time to call it quits. I'm still on HT, so I don't miss it much. I hope your experience is better than mine, but if not, it's not as bad as you might think.",
