      "Content": "Here's what I know about proton beam: It is extremely expensive ($50,000-$150,000), though Medicaid does cover it. A lot of insurance companies don't. First, they'll surgically implant seeds in your prostate, which they will use to guide the proton beams. Then, you'll get radiated once a day for about 9 weeks. There are NO limits as to what you do during that 9-week period. And there's little if any discomfort during the therapy. The big advantages, to me, are that your chances of leakage are much lower than surgery, and your likelihood of ED is delayed (I've been told anywhere from 6 months to 5 years). The extent of ED is a big unknown for proton beam, which is too bad because it is, to me, a big reason to do it instead of surgery. Guys who have had it seem to swear by it. Unfortunately, there's hardly any good data available on the side effects. And there are none of the other standard surgery risks like, well, death or infection. And no catheter. The biggest disadvantages are that there's no follow-up pathology as there is with surgery, so your PSA test is the only way to know if you are cancer-free. There's also risk of rectal issues, since the tip of the rectum gets radiated in the process. A small percentage (5%, i think, or maybe even less) suffer serious rectal issues that require treatment while more folks suffer temporary stuff like constipation, etc. As with any radiation, there's the slight chance of secondary cancers, which usually develop 8-10 years later, if they develop at all. And, as with any radiation, it makes any prostate surgery difficult, if doable at all, later. Just curious if anyone here has direct experience. thanks",

      "Content": "I am 58 and pretty concerned about post-treatment quality of life, so I've decided to pursue Active Surveillance until circumstances dictate otherwise. My doctor relented even though he points out that 5 of my 12 cores were positive, and one was 50%, both of which are outside of the recommended Johns Hopkins guidelines. I got my biopsy results in May 2013. I had a Gleason Score of 3+3=6, and PSA of 4.5. It was re-tested last week and was 3.9. I even had a Prolaris test, which looks for genetic markers of more aggressive cancers, none of which it determined that I had (I am not sure I'd bet the ranch on this test, but it does support my AS strategy, regardless of its reliability.) I was comfortable with the decision -- the odds are very high that something other than prostate cancer will kill me, and I'll take those odds if I can avoid those possible nasty side effects. Here's the monkey wrench. Last week, I got the results of a second opinion on my biopsy from University of Pennsylvania Hospital. They said they detected 3+4=7 in one of my five positive cores. They suggested I get Dr. Epstein's opinion at Johns Hopkins as the tie-breaking interpretation, and I may do that, but regardless of his interpretation, I'll always know at least one pathologist thinks my prostate cancer is a little more serious than the initial biopsy reading. So I'm just not sure if Active Surveillance is still the way to go. Appreciate any suggestions or insights. Thanks",

      "Content": "I am 58 and pretty concerned about post-treatment quality of life, so I've decided to pursue Active Surveillance until circumstances dictate otherwise. My doctor relented even though he points out that 5 of my 12 cores were positive, and one was 50%, both of which are outside of the recommended Johns Hopkins guidelines. I got my biopsy results in May 2013. I had a Gleason Score of 3+3=6, and PSA of 4.5. It was re-tested last week and was 3.9. I even had a Prolaris test, which looks for genetic markers of more aggressive cancers, none of which it determined that I had (I am not sure I'd bet the ranch on this test, but it does support my AS strategy, regardless of its reliability.) I was comfortable with the decision -- the odds are very high that something other than prostate cancer will kill me, and I'll take those odds if I can avoid those possible nasty side effects. Here's the monkey wrench. Last week, I got the results of a second opinion on my biopsy from University of Pennsylvania Hospital. They said they detected 3+4=7 in one of my five positive cores. They suggested I get Dr. Epstein's opinion at Johns Hopkins as the tie-breaking interpretation, and I may do that, but regardless of his interpretation, I'll always know at least one pathologist thinks my prostate cancer is a little more serious than the initial biopsy reading. So I'm just not sure if Active Surveillance is still the way to go. Appreciate any suggestions or insights. Thanks",

My doctor relented even though he points out that 5 of my 12 cores were positive, and one was 50%, both of which are outside of the recommended Johns Hopkins guidelines. I got my biopsy results in May 2013. I had a Gleason Score of 3+3=6, and PSA of 4.5. It was re-tested last week and was 3.9. I even had a Prolaris test, which looks for genetic markers of more aggressive cancers, none of which it determined that I had (I am not sure I'd bet the ranch on this test, but it does support my AS strategy, regardless of its reliability.) I was comfortable with the decision -- the odds are very high that something other than prostate cancer will kill me, and I'll take those odds if I can avoid those possible nasty side effects. Here's the monkey wrench. Last week, I got the results of a second opinion on my biopsy from University of Pennsylvania Hospital. They said they detected 3+4=7 in one of my five positive cores. They suggested I get Dr. Epstein's opinion at Johns Hopkins as the tie-breaking interpretation, and I may do that, but regardless of his interpretation, I'll always know at least one pathologist thinks my prostate cancer is a little more serious than the initial biopsy reading. So I'm just not sure if Active Surveillance is still the way to go. Appreciate any suggestions or insights. Thanks",

      "Content": "I am 58 and pretty concerned about post-treatment quality of life, so I've decided to pursue Active Surveillance until circumstances dictate otherwise. My doctor relented even though he points out that 5 of my 12 cores were positive, and one was 50%, both of which are outside of the recommended Johns Hopkins guidelines. I got my biopsy results in May 2013. I had a Gleason Score of 3+3=6, and PSA of 4.5. It was re-tested last week and was 3.9. I even had a Prolaris test, which looks for genetic markers of more aggressive cancers, none of which it determined that I had (I am not sure I'd bet the ranch on this test, but it does support my AS strategy, regardless of its reliability.) I was comfortable with the decision -- the odds are very high that something other than prostate cancer will kill me, and I'll take those odds if I can avoid those possible nasty side effects. Here's the monkey wrench. Last week, I got the results of a second opinion on my biopsy from University of Pennsylvania Hospital. They said they detected 3+4=7 in one of my five positive cores. They suggested I get Dr. Epstein's opinion at Johns Hopkins as the tie-breaking interpretation, and I may do that, but regardless of his interpretation, I'll always know at least one pathologist thinks my prostate cancer is a little more serious than the initial biopsy reading. So I'm just not sure if Active Surveillance is still the way to go. Appreciate any suggestions or insights. Thanks",

      "Content": "It was quite a surprise to me how unable urologists are to predict the likelihood that prostate cancer will spread beyond the prostate. A biopsy can suggest that a cancer is widespread and aggressive, but isn't nearly as effective at telling you if you are among the vast majority of people with prostate cancer who have a slow-growing cancer that you can outlive. Thanks, all, for your insights. That second, revised opinion was a real kick in the gut. After weeks of consultations, tests and soul-searching, I'd finally gotten comfortable with Active Surveillance, but now I feel like I'm starting the process all over again. If my real Gleason score is 3+4, I guess I should be thankful someone spotted it.",
