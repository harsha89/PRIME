      "Content": "Hi Sinister74, I had LRP in 2003 at 62 years od age. I had immediate swelling of the left lower leg and ankle. I usually walk 2 mile three or four days a week and that seems to keep it from swelling. I'm 73 now and restarted golfing last year an recently started riding my bike and not walking. My leg started swelling again. It seems that biking doesn't do the job for me. I guess I need to start walking again. It does tire me a lot but it's better than having the swelling. My swelling usually goes down at night but begins first thing in the morning after standing a while.",

      "Content": "Shadowwolf, I think you will be surprised to find that many authorities on the subject have changed their minds after studying the original concept and how one person can affect the entire medical profession views. I've tried to get testosterone for many years but no one will write me a prescript. My level is around 340. I'm thinking if testosterone fuels prostate cancer and my psa is undetectable then I must be cured and should be able to take it after 11 years or my testosterone itself would cause a recurrence. There are doctors prescribing it for some patients. Check out MD Anderson. They are using it for advanced cancer patients and it has brought their psa down to undetectable.",
