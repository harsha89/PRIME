      "Content": "Sorry in advance, if it sounds like one of those \"I'm young and I think I'm dying\" types of posts. I'm 29 and for a few years I've been having some issues which hasn't gone away but feels like it's getting worse. I've always had issues with frequent urination. But it's increased a lot now. It's become a huge issue where if I drink water, I'll have to go within 30 minutes. Sometimes I'll have to urinate multiple times in 2 hour span. Coffee is an activator and for that I barely drink coffee. Lately, for a few months, I've been having pain in my lower left back which has been traveling all the way down my left leg. Sometimes I have burning sensation after urination and after sex but they go away after about 20-30 minutes. No blood in my urine. I've seen an Urologist in the past year who checked my prostate, no issues there. I've also had at least 2-3 prostate exams since 2007 and always been normal. Once back in 2007, the Urologist said \"slightly inflamed\" but both doctor and the latest urologist said, that's not true, not for my age. Cancer doesn't run in my family, although my uncle was the first to die from prostate cancer last year. They found out at last state and he died with in 2 months after. But he was over 70 years of age. What should my next step be since both doctor and urologist says my prostate felt normal.",

      "Content": "Hello Chuck and Lance. My uncle was my dad's oldest brother. The doctors I've visited have all been older doctors that have practiced for decades. The urologist I've seen recently must have been in his 40s. Today I went to see my doctor again. I told him the pain isn't going anywhere and of course, him, knowing my history so far, decided to go in a totally different route. Back in 2001, I had a back injury (fractured back bone - lumber) and being that my pain and frequent urination started back around 2003, he wants to first have an x-ray done. He thinks it could be nerve related because nerves for Large intestine, appendix, abdomen, upper leg, bladder, knees, prostate gland, muscles of lower back, lowe legs, ankles, feet all fall where I've been having all my problems. This also explains all my stomach problems (IBS symptoms, constipation/diarrhea). He tested my urine to see if it was my kidney, which is also fine. He gave me meds for over active bladder to see if that will help frequent urination. Showing him where my pain was, he is very certain that it's not prostate related, bur rather, nerve related. I am hoping after x-ray I will get some news. I will keep you guys informed for sure. Picture Removed. Please read rules regarding pictures in the forum.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by HighlanderCFH Glad to hear it is probably not the prostate. Here's hoping & praying that they find the cause and that it can be treated & cured for you. We'll look forward to further updates. Take care, Chuck Thank you again Chuck. I'll definitely be sure to post updates, even though I am a noob here and may not know enough to participate with as much knowledge.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by lancepeace Welcome. Did you have a PSA blood test? You probably should know your PSA result. I would analyze the PSA and Free PSA percent to figure your next step. Good luck. Thank you Lance, for your reply. Is that usually when blood tests are done? I have to find the paper for it but I've had a full blood test done last year and everything war normal except for my B12 being low.",
