      "Content": "First I want to thank all of you who contribute to this site and the calming effect it has had on me. This is my first post. I have been checking in on the forum since about December of 2014. In Dec. 2007 my psa went from 1.9 to 2.6. As a precaution my urologist thought a biopsy was in order , due to the fact the year previously a rectal exam told him there was a small change to the right lobe. Had the biopsy in Jan. of 08 and 2 of 8 cores came back positive. Happy Holidays to me. I was only 48 so I told him cut it out and lets get rid of it. He agreed for my age it was the best course of action. So, the next month Feb. 08 had the robotic prostatectomy. Final pathology 3+4=7 T2C 30% involvement only took one set of nerves, seminal vessels neg., surgical margins 85% neg. a little concern up near bladder. organ confined 85% neg. capsular penetration neg. First psa after surgery in March of 2008 was .109 , 6/08 .118, 10/08 0.1, 1/09 0.2, 4/09 0.1, 9/09 0.2 Every test after Sept. of 09 until December of 2012 was 0.2 This is the point where I got nervous. Most of you and the literature say that a biochemical reoccurrence has happened when you have two consecutive psa tests of 0.2 or higher. My urologist uses 0.3. So after 4 1/2 years of my psa being 0.2 or lower, it jumped to 0.4 in December of 2012. My urologist didn't hesitate and sent me to a cancer radiologist. She set up 40 sessions of srt and we did one last psa test before starting. It was 0.3 My 40 sessions of srt ended the first week of April of 2013. Treatments went real well I even won the NCAA mens basketball pool that they let me get in on. I bought all those good people pizza with the winnings. Not enough is said about the good people that do that work day in and out. God Bless you all. Well, my first psa after srt was in July of 2013 and it was 0.1 My urologist was happy. Next test was January of 2014 it was less than 0.1 my first undetectable ever, what a great feeling. Next was 5/14 less than 0.1, 10/14 less than 0.1 My next test is in April of 2015. Well that's the end of my adventure so far. Right now its better than it has been since Dec. of 2008. So once again thanks for all of you who write these posts. I am sure that there are many out here reading these posts to get info and encouragement, keep it up it really helps on those bad days.",

Remember you are your own best advocate on what you feel is the right thing to do. Read all you can talk to people that have gone through it already, but make sure what you decide with your doctor and family, that you will have peace of mind about your decision down the road. GOOD LUCK !",

Get the best treatment you can and move on with your life. When you look back on it in a couple of years, when its all said and done you will be so glad you did not hesitate. You don't want those second thoughts to creep in. Trust me I may have hesitated, and there is nothing worse than thinking , should I have pulled the trigger sooner! Good Luck with your choice.",

      "Content": "Sorry to hear read about your situation Gunny. You and I are pretty similar in case histories, I was 48 when DX and had T2c disease also. I made it 56 months at 0.2 or less before jumping to 0.4. Went ahead and had the salvage radiation, and am now back to <0.1 for a year and a half now. So keep your chin up because there is still a good chance that the radiation will kill whats left of that damn cancer and you will be fine. I am living proof. GOOD LUCK !",

      "Content": "Hi Mary, I also agree with Chuck and Ray. 57 is so young, I would not delay on treatment. If it is nearing the prostate wall, dealing with it sooner rather than later is the choice I would make and did in my case. I am also a firm believer that surgery at a young age is the way to go. Get rid of it and go on and enjoy life. Also if there ever was a rise in the psa, radiation will still give you a chance to kill it. Keep us posted and GOOD LUCK",
