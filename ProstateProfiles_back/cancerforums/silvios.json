      "Content": "Thanks Chuck, I will follow your advise. I will go in on April 7 to the same lab the urologist uses. At least on this last test it went a little lower instead of higher. I think my Uro, if not significantly lower, will prescribe a biopsy. My thinking is if that is the case I should go ahead with biopsy just to see if they locate any cancer. What are your thought? Thanks, Silvio",

My Urologist I think wanted to do a biopsy right away. Whem I told him that it was 0.07 in November of 2013 he said to do another PSA in a week. So that is what I will do.",

He told me to wait another week and do a retest. So that is what I am going to do. Any thoughts on the matter would be helpful.",

      "Content": "The DRE was done on March 21st after the draw of blood for PSA. I didn't have sex before the 21st. Evethough a week before when urinating I did feel a discomfort not burning but irrated. However my Urologist contacted me on the 26th with the news to go on the 27th and I did have sex that morning on the 26th before he called. Somewhat worried but irritated and as I said this happened once before. My concern is that if it is cancer it must be extremely aggressive for PSA to go from 0.7 to 3.6 in 4 months. I will keep you posted. I should have results of PSA on April 1.",

      "Content": "Hello Everyone, I'm writing this so that it may help others in the future and also I might learn something. I am 65 years old and go for annual physical with my primary doctor and I visit my urologist also. So I get 2 PSA's every year. Which is probably not neccessary. I have a slightly enlarged prostrate and my PSA has been steady at 0.07 for the past several years. Except back in 2010 my primary care doctor gave me my lab report and I saw a PSA of 2.46. When I mentioned it to her she said that was normal. I know that spikes should be looked into. When I showed the result to my urologist he agreed and retook the test. It came down to 1.5 and 6 months later it was 0.07. Now in Nov of 2013 I went for exam with my primary and PSA was 0.07 and went to see my urologist on March 21. He did a DRE and a PSA. The PSA was 3.6. He thought the test needed to be repeated. I did the new PSA test on March 27 and don't know the results yet. I am somewhat concerned. My thinking is that it is probably inflammation/mistake or an historic aggressive cancer to go from 0.7 to 3.6 in 4 months. Any thoughts? Has anyone experienced a similiar problem?",
