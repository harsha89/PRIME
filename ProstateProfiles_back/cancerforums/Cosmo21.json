    "Content": "So it looks like I am a new member to the club here. A couple months back I was diagnosed with Prostate Cancer, 4.7 PSA - Gleason Score 6, and I am 45 years old. I have met with several doctors and have decided to have the surgery at the end of September. I found a very experienced DR, with over 4000 surgeries, who I feel very confident with going into this. I have already gained a lot of valuable information from this site and hope to continue that as I move closer to the surgery date. Thank you all for the information you provide as it really has been a big help for me in learning about a subject a knew very little about just a few months ago. Cosmo",
