      "Content": "Hello everyone, my father has just been diagnosed with Gleason scale stage 9 prostate cancer. This seems to be a very aggressive and quickly growing form. The doctor wants to jump directly into outside radiation and seed implantation. Like all men, my father is very concerned with both his bladder function and sexual function after these treatments. From what I have read, outside radiation is the most likely to cause sexual, bladder, and potentially bowel disfunction. It seems that the prostatectomy might be a better option, but this whole subject is new to me. I was wondering if those of you who have been through this journey have any opinions or recommendations on radiation vs prostatectomy? Also his doctor seems to think he will be able to get radiation before work daily. His job is labor intensive and I have my doubts that this will be an option. For any of you that had outside radiation, were you able to continue working daily? Thank you so much in advance for your advice ❤️",

MRI showed 4spots on his prostate that looked abnormal. They did an initial biopsy of 24 spots-all negative. However his PSA was still high. They went back in and took 32 biopsies, only one of which came back positive with a gleeson score of 9. I\u0092m sorry that I don\u0092t have more information. Someone recommended a book called \u0093the Great Prostate Hoax\u0094 to him and I don\u0092t want him to take this lightly. I don\u0092t believe the doctor has actually used the word cancer, only tumor. Also my dad tends to just completely trust doctors\u0092 suggestions instead of asking questions to have a better understanding of what is going on. He is one of the healthiest people I know other than this new cancer.",
