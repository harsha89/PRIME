    "Content": "My husband had the da vinci surgery 3 weeks ago. Surgery took 4 hours due to the size of his prostate- it was 140 grams. PSA was 12 and two of the lymph nodes were removed. Spent 4 hours in the recovery room so we got to his hospital room 10 hours after we arrived to the hospital. He was very sleepy, needed a good six more hours to be perfectly clear minded. The first surprise was the severity of the dry mouth and lips. I was dripping water on his lips for a few times before he could open his mouth. He ate little for dinner and wanted to sleep. Took the first few steps around 10 pm, wanted to sleep again and ask me to go home. We live 10 minutes from the hospital so I knew I can be back very quickly if I have to. That was a big mistake, I should know better not to leave him alone overnight. The nurse on duty was less than accommodating and at 7 am I found my husband stressed out. He woke up at midnight hungry, cold, thirsty and they told him to wait until the morning. We happily left the hospital soon and hoped for the speedy recovery. After three weeks we are still waiting it to happen. He really did not have much pain, took Tylenol for a day and he was fine. The bloating started a few hours after surgey and never went away. The scrotal swelling started four day after surgery, got really bad 3 days later and did not change since. Catheter was removed a week after surgery, could urinate only once, 8 hours later at 3 in the morning run back to the ER. He was in a lot of pain and the waiting for the Urologist on call took a long time.Since everything was so swollen it took 5 separate try to put back the Foley before we could leave the ER at 11 am. . Our frustration started to grow but still tried to be patient and eagerly waiting for the catheter to come out the second time. When the same thing happened and he got the third catheter in during our midnight ER trip we got extremely discouraged. I lost fate in the system and would like to get some answers and explanations but nobody is listening. All we get is \"be patient, it could take some time\". After three weeks it is unacceptable for me. All I want is to talk to the doctor who did the operation and that what we are not able to do. Do not go for a surgery unless you have a direct way to communicate with your doctor. What makes me mad that I am sure the doctor very likely does not even know how many times we called, left msg with his staff. Monday the third catheter will be removed and if he needs a new one we will go to an other hospital. We are in Boston and have 10+ hospital within 5 miles. How the insurance will work I do not know. So three weeks after surgery the bloating,swelling is the same as it was 3 days after surgery and nobody mentioned this as a possibility. If anybody had the same experience I would love to hear about it.",
