I dont want to put him through something like this unless its really going to have an impact on us (in a positive way) I know it seems on the outside cold and shallow etc to want to step out.....if you knew us you would know we love each other very much.... but it is hard living in a body that craves what it does, and oral can be amazing but unfortunately i crave more than that...... i struggle every day to stay true...and it has nothing to do with my love for him. Though I guess it seems to read that way. FYI I am sharing these posts with my husband. We are in this together. It\u2019s not easy admitting this problem or admitting that I have these needs. I know it is hurting him...and I feel TERRIBLE GUILT about that. He is the last person I want to hurt and I am very thankful that for now he is cancer free. But we are human and these are real and honest concerns that won\u2019t just go away because I wish them to...... its a struggle and we know we need help.",

He had Erectile Disfunction after the surgery and it never came back. Today we met with a eurologist and the doctor who performed the surgery. The suggestion was to try Viagra first, then Cialias. If those dont work then they suggested Prostaglandon E1. We dont want him to end up in the hospital with an erection that wont go away. What are your thoughts on all of this? Thank you in advance.",
