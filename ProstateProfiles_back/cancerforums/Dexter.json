Had rad and seed implants, lowest psa went was 0.47. Have had lupron every 6 months. Dec psa 1.21 April 3.8 started casodex May 6.76. Have been treated by va uro. ADT failure according to uro now to onc. I was hoping for a longer performance with the ADT. I not sure what will be next for tx, there many I guess. I will be seeing the onc Tuesday and she is doing another bone scan and Ct. The dr said this is very aggressive ca and my response is is poor and not prolonged",
