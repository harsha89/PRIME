      "Content": "Everyone who posts on this, and other, forums seems pretty disappointed by the recovery of erectile function. I am five weeks post RRP and the surgeon (Patel) said useable erections would return in time. I am 43 and had good nerve sparing and he said they have gotten pretty good at predicting ED outcomes. I asked if that meant 100% of what I had before surgery and he said some guys do not recover 100% but I should recover at least good useable, functioning erections in a few months. My question is are there no good success stories or do those guys who recover their erectile function satisfactorily just stop visiting the site? Any encouraging success stories would be much appreciated.",
