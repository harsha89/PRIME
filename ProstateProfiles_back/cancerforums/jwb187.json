      "Content": "Hi Matt, I can relate to what you've just been through concerning the bladder spasms. I had my catheter out for about three days after having davinci surgery, doctor removed it after 9 days which I thought might have been a little quick. One evening as I was sitting on the throne I had the most unimaginable pain in my abdomen which I didn't think was ever going to end. I screamed for my wife and uttered Gxx Dxxx several times. She is a registered nurse and I could tell that she was very concerned about the level of pain which seemed like it went on forever. This was naturally on a weekend about 9pm when all pharmacies in our small town were closed. She called the emergency contact number for my surgeon and she was actually talking to him in about 5 minutes. He said it sounded like bladder spasms which he said were very rare. He asked about a pharmacy and she made arrangements to call our pharmacist and see if he would call the surgeon to make arrangements to come down and open up and fill a perscription. Our pharmacist got the script I guess by fax and filled it for us. It was some type of bladder relaxer which did calm the contractions a great deal. I had the start of one the next night but got right on it and it went away. Never had one since and don't want anymore.....most pain I ever experienced in my 62 years of life. JWB",
