    "Content": "I started losing my hair in my 20s and was quite bald before 30. Therefore, I suppose that I fit the original profile: higher risk of prostate cancer if bald in your 20s. Hopefully, I shall miss out on this latest study: as per my signature, the cancer was Gleason 6 and all negative margins when the prostate was removed last week. Only relatives with PCa were my grandfather (maternal) who died of it in 1964 when it was typically diagnosed at advanced stages and his son, my uncle, who had a prostatectomy in the late 1980s and lived 25 more years before succumbing to multiple myeloma. Both had thick heads of hair. One common factor would be the Y chromosome... John D. T.",
