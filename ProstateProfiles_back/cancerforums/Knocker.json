He said if he treats it with a form of radiation and it in his opinion wont cure it it will mena I may not be able to have the surgery due to problems the radiation may cause.Given my age and so far I think I am fit enough pending the Thyroid problem to undergo surgery and risk the side effects against a more hopefully less troublesome and worrisome life after treatment??? My Uro is well versed and experienced and is only just a few years older than me so I feel comfortable he is switched on and very keen to cure me and not give me false hope, he does say in theory this will happen but says this may happen but he can fix it after surgery, referring to doodle problems etc..... The cancer itself is, in theory localised in both bottom lobes with the right side not too bad but the left side having five out of eleven cores positive and close to the nerves so who knows what will be the end result after surgery but if I get to live another tweny to forty years with my wife and children then hey its gonna be ok.....",

I was referred for a biopsy that confirmed PC my gleeson score accordign to the Pathologist is 4+3 =7 but my Urologist says its a 3+4 =7 either way he said it can be cured with a radical prostactemy and chemo or radiaiton will not cure it but will assist after the surgery. Other test have been carried out and they have also found I have primary hypothyroidism coupled with significant deafness and radiclapathy nerve impingement in my low back and legs.

On discharge I was given my bag and extras for my days with the catheter...cant wait to have this out another 5 days...Having trouble sitting and walking but I am sure I will get better as the days goes by. They took my nerve and Lymph nodes on one side only so fingers crossed all is well and I am cured!!!!",

      "Content": "Hi Type of surgery was open. I was worried before going in but then my surgeon turned up and everything was fine, I woke up and he was there again amazing man. Yes good to be on the brighter side of it... Sarg, when I went in to speak with my surgeon, I had to make sure not just was he capable but did I feel (that old gut feeling) right about it and with him, I did and would tell anyone opting for RP to visit this man!!! Peace... Well fun days been and I am sure more ahead. Visit to the hospital and put in a wheel chair with my heart rate gone to the moon very weak with an inabiltiy to move, but at home and doing ok now.I went back to my surgeons office yesterday and the nurse took the catheter out and staples, then gee was it fun trying to wear a pad!!!! No control on bladder but within a day this appears to be one of those trial and erros as I can feel the need to go and get to the toilet with minimal mess early days. Hope all of your on the road to recovery are doing well!!!! My results were not back in so now I hope to get a present form Santa giving me the all clear.",
