      "Content": "Hello everyone. My father, who's 60 years old has just been diagnosed with prostate cancer. On August 30th his psa was high at 27,50 and after a suspicious DRE he was told to redo the psa plus freepsa test. It came back 43,10 in just two weeks from the first one and the freepsa was only 3,4% of the total. For starters I hope that one of these two tests was wrong cause the doubling time couldn't be so short, right?. After that a biopsy was performed and today we got the results. 11 out of 16 samples were cancerous, with a gleason score of 6. The cancerous cells were detected in both lobes, although the ultrasound showed only a 1,4cm tumor on the left lobe. On Thursday we have an appointment with the urologist to discuss the next steps. Truth is I am very confused by those results, first of all because of the two so different psa tests in two weeks and second from the amount of cancerous samples in spite of the gleason score 6. By the way my father claims that he has no symptoms, although he has chronic back and pelvis pain, which he says is because he does not move a lot, due to neuropathy from previous strokes and alcoholism. That is definitely a tricky case I think, and all the stories I read from you all are very inspiring, but I need to hear what to expect, how to manage it and what are our odds of this being something that we can get through with.. Thank you for your attention. Konstantina, Greece.",

Hope it's just that he doesn't move a lot, he mostly stays indoors due to other health problems(fingers crossed). I will definitely buy the book you suggested, and I hope I can find it translated in Greek to give it to my father as well.",

      "Content": "Thank you so much for your replies. It helps a great deal just knowing you're not alone. My father's prostate gland is showed to be just lightly enlarged, just over 40cc. I do not know yet the exact percentage of the cores or if there are any \"4\" in there, because our urologist talked to me via phone and just told me that the cancer's gleason score is a 6.we have an appointment on Thursday to discuss it thoroughly. When I know something more I will inform you. What worries me the most right now is that extremely rapid rise of the psa in just two weeks! From 27 to 43!! Our urologist said that he has never seen it before and I think that also doesn't stick to that gleason score of 6. Excuse any grammatical etc mistakes, I am from Greece. Thank you again for sharing your stories with me and for your advises and optimism which is so important for me right now.",
