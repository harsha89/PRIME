Originally Posted by HighlanderCFH I noticed that you said your prostate volume is 6.3 cc. This sounds wrong and I'm wondering if you meant to say that it is 63 cc? You're right. 63 cc. And yes, I'm a BPH man. Originally Posted by HighlanderCFH During the daytime, when you are awake and active, urination might tend to be a bit easier than during the night. Others might be able to explain this better than I have. That's the big mistery to me. During the daytime, I'm a normal man, absolutely. Problems come after midnight and I have no clues why.

      "Content": "Originally Posted by Another During the day you are drinking more and urinating more often. With BHP the increased frequency during the day is not as noticeable or disrupting as at night. Early in BHP it is not a problem during the day to urinate more often. Also, the frequent urges to urinate during the day can be consciously suppressed allowing the bladder to fill more before urinating during the day. At night you notice it more because it bothers your sleep. The urge to urinate wakes you and suppressing it keeps you awake so you go to urinate so you can go back to sleep, but it is not as much as during the day so the pressure of the full bladder is less, so less is eliminated out. As the prostate grows it constricts the urethra. The bladder muscle grows stronger to force the urine through. As the bladder muscle grows stronger it thickens. The thickening shrinks the bladder volume, and you hold less. Hi, Another. Good explanations. As you said, yes, I get up once during the night. But it's completely different urinate action comparing to the day. Sometimes, I stay some 3 to 5 (!) minutes waiting the complete elimination, because the flow is too weak and/or it stops to come. I do not force the flow. I wait. And it seems to be actually blocked. Sometimes, I come back to bed feeling that the bladder isn't empty. During the day, I spend 30 seconds to urinate 400 ml, 13.8 ml/sec. At night, it varies, but is about 3 minutes to eliminate 200 ml or less, i.e., less than 1 ml/sec. So, despite your explanations, it's hard to understand that big difference is just because of you said. I suspect there is more to be uncovered. Thanks.",

      "Content": "Hello guys. First, my mother language isn't english. So, excuses in advance for some mistakes. I'm glad to find so extensive and detailed forum about to many health problems, mainly cancer. I've already give some reads on several topics and could saw a vast and big willing to help each other. Pretty nice and useful for everybody. I do not have cancer so far, but too many questions about prostate hyperplasia. I'm 55 and make PSA exams every year. Here my last results: Prostate volume: 6.3 cc PSA: 3.76 I have a regular exercises routine and a healthy habits. Don't ever smoked in my entire life nor drunk alcohol. Overnight, as ordinary for men with increased prostate, I have some difficulties to urinate. Why that? Why I do not have that difficult to urinate during daytime? Along the day, I do urinate normally, no problem at all, full flow and nothing about weak flow. I thought it's because prostate changes its size, becoming bigger at night. But that's not, I guess. Is it because body position? Many hours laying down and pressing ureter and bladder? It's a mistery to me. At 2 ou 3 am, every night, I have to wakeup to urinate. Some nights, it's becoming quite difficult to eliminate all urine. More questions: Is it a good idea to buy a urination probe (or what else name to that) to insert into penis to free urine? Is it possible and realible to do an auto exam? Like breast auto exam for cancer detect? Reading some news about this subject, I know that sex/ejaculation on everyday is a good practice to wash prostate fluids and procedures. Is it real or another myth? That's all for now. Thank you for your suggestions and responses.",
