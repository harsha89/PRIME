      "Content": "Hi Arthro92, My experience with Flomax that I take daily comes from my PC. Well about 10 days into the 45 days of IMRT I started having urinary issues. Having to go 5-7 times a night producing very little pee each time, not to mention no sleep and still work 40-50 hrs. a week. My Onc. prescribed Flomax 1xD taken in the early evening and it made ALL THE DIFFERENCE I COULD HOPE FOR. I still have go 1 maybe 2 times a night and back to normal during the day. I can only tell you how the Flomax worked for me, as I have never taken Saw Palmetto. Hope this helps. Rob",

However, there are a lot of non surgical treatments that have had as good if not better results. Radiation with hormone therapy is a very effective option. This is just food for thought from my own experience as surgery was never an option. I am not a medical professional only a professional patient. I suggest you wait 30 days and get another PSA test just to be sure of accuracy. Remember to avoid any sexual activity or strenuous exercise, caffeine or alcohol the day before you test as this will elevate the PSA. Get Dr. Walsh's book information abound. Good Luck Rob",

There are a lot of knowledgeable great people at your service so be assured you'll get really good advice. Here are some things you'll need to post. The complete Pathology Report (Biopsy) How many cores tested? How many cores were positive and the percentage of involvement? The last PSA test? Any Perineural Invasion? Gleason Grade? Have you had a Bone Scan or a CT Scan if so what are the results? I know this is all new and scary stuff, however, from the info you did share there is no need to panic or rush into any type of surgery or treatment until you have all the tests needed to formulate a treatment plan that YOU! are comfortable with. At this point Active Surveilance could be way to go. Good Luck. Rob",

      "Content": "Welcome Nicnic, and like the others were all sorry you have to be here. Like Jim215 said the more info you can share the better feedback you'll get. There are a lot of knowledgeable great people at your service so be assured you'll get really good advice. Here are some things you'll need to post. The complete Pathology Report (Biopsy) How many cores tested? How many cores were positive and the percentage of involvement? The last PSA test? Any Perineural Invasion? Gleason Grade? Have you had a Bone Scan or a CT Scan if so what are the results? I know this is all new and scary stuff, however, from the info you did share there is no need to panic or rush into any type of surgery or treatment until you have all the tests needed to formulate a treatment plan that YOU! are comfortable with. At this point Active Surveilance could be way to go. Good Luck. Rob",

The amount of cores (2) and the lower percentage of involvement could be that you caught it early enough to be treatable with really good results. The Gleason Grade of an 4+4=8 suggests that you have a little time, a second opinion is never a bad call. Per the pathology a tumor of 7mm outside the rectal wall, is that correct? Just relax and wait until all of the tests are in. Most likely another CT scan, a bone scan and I did not see a PSA. I cant comment on the surgery side of things as surgery was never an option for me. Radiation and Hormone Therapy is the path I'm on. I have 6 of 45 IMRT left to go.

      "Content": "I just did not think to ask the Uro about how the Gleason Score is determined. The Pathology Report is broken down into 12 individual tests. One test for each core of the Prostate, each with it's own Gleason Score. However, not all of the Gleason Scores are the same. I've seen other pathology Reports on the sight and most have just one Gleason Score. My question is how is the Gleason Score determined, are the 12 scores averaged or is the high or lo score used? I should know the answer but I really didn't hear any thing after YOU HAVE CANCER that after noon, so I'm playing catch up on many areas of the process. All comments welcome.",
