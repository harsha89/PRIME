It seems that when sitting to have a bowel movement that the catheter can move slightly up or to the side which causes a leak down the side of the tube. My catheter is out (since about 2 1/2 weeks) and I'm fine! Was going to go have it checked out...but maybe I'll leaving for now.

I think if you are in general good health, you should be ok, but just mark the date in pencil so you will be prepared if there are any complications. My wife and I have been planning to spend our winters (we live in Alberta) for several years now and every year something came up to prevent us from going down for any extended period. This was the year where we said that no matter what...we're going. Then I had this diagnosis in the spring and thought...maybe if all goes well we can still salvage most of the trip. I was mostly concerned about the 3 days in the saddle on the way down and any post op issues that could arise. It will be 5+ weeks after the surgery and I'm keeping my fingers cross all goes well.

One thing I found out very soon was...you don't get much \"rest\" at the hospital. There is a constant chatter and traffic in and out of the rooms is non stop....so if you're a light sleeper like myself...go luck sleeping! As far as pain and discomfort goes...the first day and night after surgery were a little difficult. Day 2 was somewhat better and was able to walk about and even went outside for a stroll. Day 3 was instruction day from nurse and out the door we went...leg catheter on and ready to do the 1 hr trek home. We did have to pull over on a side road once to empty the bag (to much water that morning) but everything came out just fine. Beautiful wife made me a delicious bowl of soup..watched the Astros beat the Dodgers and off for a ten hour well needed sleep. Day 4 amazing just how a great nights sleep can improve your overall attitude...I highly recommend it! Still taking a few Tramacets once or twice a day for the discomfort..but I can see those gone by the weekend. I was fortunate enough to have a bowl movement the very next morning of the surgery and every morning since...but I did notice a small amount of leakage from where the catheter enters the penis.

Had surgery Monday 7:30am and a few hours later woke up in post op. For a guy who never spend any time in a hospital it was quite an eye and ear opener. The nursing staff and all of the doctors were absolutely amazing...always kind and thoughtful of what you went through and I can't say enough about them and the U of A hospital! One thing I found out very soon was...you don't get much \"rest\" at the hospital. There is a constant chatter and traffic in and out of the rooms is non stop....so if you're a light sleeper like myself...go luck sleeping! As far as pain and discomfort goes...the first day and night after surgery were a little difficult. Day 2 was somewhat better and was able to walk about and even went outside for a stroll. Day 3 was instruction day from nurse and out the door we went...leg catheter on and ready to do the 1 hr trek home. We did have to pull over on a side road once to empty the bag (to much water that morning) but everything came out just fine. Beautiful wife made me a delicious bowl of soup..watched the Astros beat the Dodgers and off for a ten hour well needed sleep. Day 4 amazing just how a great nights sleep can improve your overall attitude...I highly recommend it! Still taking a few Tramacets once or twice a day for the discomfort..but I can see those gone by the weekend. I was fortunate enough to have a bowl movement the very next morning of the surgery and every morning since...but I did notice a small amount of leakage from where the catheter enters the penis.

I had mine in for two weeks because the doctor said they like to see things heal up inside real well before pulling it out.

      "Content": "For my RALP I came to this forum to see what the criteria should be for choosing the perfect surgeon. Most of the comments suggested to look for one that had the most notches on his belt which immediately ruled out my surgeon. My surgeon (Dr. Jacobsen Kaye clinic Edmonton) is one of those guys that you feel comfortable with from the moment you meet him. I asked him how many RALP operations he's performed and he checked and said 350...not a high number compared to most. But he was straight about doing everything possible when it came to nerve sparing and my percentages regarding incontinence and ED. He made me feel very comfortable in his knowledge and ability to do everything possible that I can live a normal health life after the surgery. I truly believe he delivered on his promise and aside from the odd dribble...I feel 90% back to normal after only 3 weeks. And not to sound perverse...watching a steamy scene in a movie last night...I was actually a bit aroused. A good sign indeed! My opinion...go with the guy or gal you feel most comfortable with!",

      "Content": "Merry Christmas JJ I had my surgery exactly two months ago and my wife and I were both super positive that we made the right decision going with the RALP. My Gleason score was pretty much what yours was....and as my surgeon explained it to us, \"you can wait, but sooner or later we'll be getting together\" We thought why not get it done while I was healthy and in a positive mood about the whole thing. My surgeon thought most likely the cancer was localized in the prostate, so it just made sense to remove it all together. As much as there is a bit of pain and discomfort for the first couple of weeks...I found after that I felt almost as good as before I went in. That in itself was an odd feeling going in for surgery when you feel 100% inside and out...but knowing the cancer will be gone makes the entire ordeal worth it. You made the right decision and you'll be better for it...Just think cancer free New Year's Eve!",

Then as the conversation went on...he began to explain how the operation went well but the results from the lab showed that some of the cancer was very near the base of the prostate. This being said...he felt most likely isolated to the prostate, but there is a chance it snuck out...and that's the catch! Amazing how your elation can turn into confusion in the matter of minutes. Anyway...he said not to worry that in the off chance there is something...it can be treated! So now it's a wait and see situation. I'm still happy with the >0.1 so Merry Christmas to all of you and may your days be Merry and Bright!",

      "Content": "Hey TP Sounds like everything is going as it should. I agree about the two night recovery in the hospital aside from how noisey it can be and the lack of sleep. I sure made up for it on the first night home and slept for almost ten hours...nothing beats your own bed at home! You should have your appetite back in no time at all...just watch you don't over eat...that can certainly cause you a lot of discomfort as I found out. As much as the catheter is a pain in the ass...the time you have it goes by very quickly and next thing you know it's getting yanked out! I had mine in for two weeks because the doctor said they like to see things heal up inside real well before pulling it out. It must have worked for me...my incontinence only lasted a few days and I was dry all night from day one. I wear a light pad just for the odd dribble....but aside from that I feel 95% after 30 days. I also lost approx. 15 lbs so don't be alarmed if you loose weight...sometimes it's a good thing! Best of luck to you and have a speedy recovery!",

      "Content": "Merry Christmas JJ I had my surgery exactly two months ago and my wife and I were both super positive that we made the right decision going with the RALP. My Gleason score was pretty much what yours was....and as my surgeon explained it to us, \"you can wait, but sooner or later we'll be getting together\" We thought why not get it done while I was healthy and in a positive mood about the whole thing. My surgeon thought most likely the cancer was localized in the prostate, so it just made sense to remove it all together. As much as there is a bit of pain and discomfort for the first couple of weeks...I found after that I felt almost as good as before I went in. That in itself was an odd feeling going in for surgery when you feel 100% inside and out...but knowing the cancer will be gone makes the entire ordeal worth it. You made the right decision and you'll be better for it...Just think cancer free New Year's Eve!",

      "Content": "Wow Jeff...looks as though you are well on your way to 100% recovery. I'm about 5 weeks post and feel 100% aside from a little ED as well as a tiny bit of belly pain when I over due things. I remember having some nasty ass spasms too...I found breathing my way thru it helped a bunch. As far as the catheter...I had mine in for a full two weeks as recommended by my surgeon so that everything can heal properly. I was envious of all the guys on here who had it removed the first week...but looking back now, I think it may have helped with the incontinence quite a bit. I was dry at night since day one and maybe a slight dribble after a week and that was it. Anyway...congrats on a successful operation and all the best in the future!",
