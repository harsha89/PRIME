      "Content": "I'm 63, and my PSAs during last 2-3 years have ranged from 1.5 to 1.9. In February 2015, my PSA was 1.9, but the DRE revealed a nodule. Had a biopsy in May 2015 and the physician noted that there were no abnormalities observed on the ultra sound. However, 3 of 15 cores were positive. Right mid: 2 positive, occupying 13 percent, measuring 4mm of the surface area of the core (3+4) Three samples near the nodule were taken. One was positive (2 percent and 1mm) and scored as 3+3. My urologist suggested I have plenty of time to make a decision, and planned to schedule a MRI and genetic testing (Oncotype DX). I also have consultations with a da vinci surgeon and a radiation oncologist. Also will send pathology report for a second opinion. Based on my very early research, LDR brachytherapy would be number one on my treatment list . Have I covered all bases or am I missing something?",
