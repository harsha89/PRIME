      "Content": "Hello, Am I glad that I found this site!!! Here is a letter that I had just sent to the Canadian Cancer Society. I am putting it here Hello, Yesterday I received quite a surprise. I learned that my PSA blood test results was over 300. (both the initial and confirmation test). I had read your pamphlet on the topic. However in the literature that I could get access to there is no mention anywhere of these type of numbers in the hundreds. Of course I searched for this topic on the internet. I would like your help to guide me towards credible reports and information that deal more directly with the type of results that I just received. My GP is a great person and she contacted me immediately after getting the first results and she just asked me to quickly get another test. Now she is in the process of having me see a urologist and asked if I had any reserves about a nuclear test for my bones. I live in a small community and that person is on holidays this week. I have to admit that I am not afraid of dying. Just last week I got lost in the local mountains. I had to spend the night, all wet, sitting and shivering on my skis till daylight not knowing if my body would produce enough heat to keep me alive. There was no panic and I was in peace, like I am now, with the idea of dying. The only regret would have been to dye because of such a silly mistake. The next day there was enough energy left to allow me to self rescue out of that situation. I just want a clear picture to help me, in consultation with my wife, to make judicious decisions adapted to our own situation. Many years ago, my wife has been a pioneer when she was the first person to receive Avastin to treat wet macula degeneration. Now this is the accepted treatment in BC. I would be delighted to add some sense to my misfortune by contributing to any research that might be adapted to my situation. I am looking forward to hearing from you.

The next day there was enough energy left to allow me to self rescue out of that situation. I just want a clear picture to help me, in consultation with my wife, to make judicious decisions adapted to our own situation. Many years ago, my wife has been a pioneer when she was the first person to receive Avastin to treat wet macula degeneration. Now this is the accepted treatment in BC. I would be delighted to add some sense to my misfortune by contributing to any research that might be adapted to my situation. I am looking forward to hearing from you.

I learned that my PSA blood test results was over 300. (both the initial and confirmation test). I had read your pamphlet on the topic. However in the literature that I could get access to there is no mention anywhere of these type of numbers in the hundreds. Of course I searched for this topic on the internet. I would like your help to guide me towards credible reports and information that deal more directly with the type of results that I just received. My GP is a great person and she contacted me immediately after getting the first results and she just asked me to quickly get another test. Now she is in the process of having me see a urologist and asked if I had any reserves about a nuclear test for my bones. I live in a small community and that person is on holidays this week. I have to admit that I am not afraid of dying. Just last week I got lost in the local mountains. I had to spend the night, all wet, sitting and shivering on my skis till daylight not knowing if my body would produce enough heat to keep me alive. There was no panic and I was in peace, like I am now, with the idea of dying. The only regret would have been to dye because of such a silly mistake.

My health is fine with no problems besides some arthritis in some joints that tempers somewhat my skiing, tennis, hiking and cycling. Today I learned that I had a PSA reading above 300!
