Dr says he does NOT use Rocco stitch...he reconstructs the urinary sphincter. But did have some physical issues not related to surgery!! First, wife and I had coughs and colds week before surgery...was worried about breathing, coughing etc messing up the procedure. Was advised its np as long as no fever. Well, after surgery imagine having to cough and blow your nose all the time?? Then, several hours after surgery, had reaction to anesthetic causing nausea and dry heaves...unbelievable, more agony!!! This was after fasting for 2 days!! My stomach was so painful and raw that I have just got my appetite back (4 days). I also suffer from GERD (acid reflux), so they gave me pepsid to help that and the effects of the antibiotic horse pills. Slowly getting back to normal. I set milestones to track progress..like first bowel movement, being able to tie my shoes..lol Here are couple hints that helped me, don't think I have heard them before: Charmin extra strong TP, good for the bow around the cath tube..stops drips and useful to dry cath connections and cleanups. Infections..use Bactine spray or lots of soap and water around buttocks genital-anal area (last time in hosp I came home with a staff infection!) Wash hands often, use clean towels!! Neosporin for tip of penis. Get a small tube with fine applicator point..so you don't have to use fingers (Dr recommended to me). Keep it lubed..lol Slippers and suspenders may help too. Plan how to use your comp laying down or standing up. Sitting was VERY painful for me. Don't be afraid to cut a hole in pants leg or pocket to route the cath tube. Tell them if you suspect problems w anesthesia and colds! Next milestones are Tues 28 for cath removal and pathology report, Dr was optimistic. Then we'll see the rest of the story. Rgds, Mike",

      "Content": "You are not alone in having a high PSA after surgery...assuming you had a radical. If you look at my signature, that is my history. What they should have explained is that they HOPE it goes undetectable, meaning that all the suspect tissues were removed. If any microscopic cells remain these will add up and be read as a PSA number (not undetectable). I am waiting for my next PSA test in Aug at which time doc will decide if Lupron and Casodex is working. They also look at the half life time it takes for PSA to decrease, and determine new treatments, and how long to stay on Lupron. Please add your history (go to settings where you input your signature), it helps for more advice! Rgds, Mike",

This does keep waking me up, over and over, as before I slept thru the night. No leakage, btw..but lately my sex interest has gone to zero, along with any interest on fixing ED.

      "Content": "Originally Posted by Bravehardon Mikem350, what if any side affects did you have on Lupton, Casodex? B Not too bad at all, worst is hot flashes. They come and go during the day, very mild. But worse at night; either am hot under a cover (and sweating) or cold outside cover. This does keep waking me up, over and over, as before I slept thru the night. No leakage, btw..but lately my sex interest has gone to zero, along with any interest on fixing ED. Kinda like I keep putting things off till tomorrow! Mike",

      "Content": "You are not alone in having a high PSA after surgery...assuming you had a radical. If you look at my signature, that is my history. What they should have explained is that they HOPE it goes undetectable, meaning that all the suspect tissues were removed. If any microscopic cells remain these will add up and be read as a PSA number (not undetectable). I am waiting for my next PSA test in Aug at which time doc will decide if Lupron and Casodex is working. They also look at the half life time it takes for PSA to decrease, and determine new treatments, and how long to stay on Lupron. Please add your history (go to settings where you input your signature), it helps for more advice! Rgds, Mike",

Even the PA who was text-ing me constantly on Sunday when I had the problem peeing. He said he was extremely confident that he got it all. The way he does it is by doing a MRI prior to surgery and then using that as a map to make his first cuts and removal of the prostate. After he removes it he takes several samples and gets an immediate pathology (while this is going on, he went out and talked to my wife). Based on this pathology, he decides if he needs to take more, which he did not need to do for me. All and all, extremely pleased with the results to date. Your doc seems very careful and methodical, exactly the way you would want! I had a cough and cold going in too, then was vomiting in recovery from anesthetic...worse than the operation itself, which was \"uneventful\". From what I have been reading here you are way ahead of the curve. I am 11 days post op, and am just beginning to get urine control..have to remember to keep squeezing my butt hole to prevent leaks, bit sitting or sleeping 100% dry.

Some loss of energy, maybe some memory loss. Definitely less sex interest.... The shot was given in my upper butt, no big deal either. I guess the phrase \"your results may vary\" applies to HT.

I have lost count of how many per day and nite...LOTS From Wiki: The autonomic nervous system (ANS or visceral nervous system or involuntary nervous system) is the part of the peripheral nervous system that acts as a control system that functions largely below the level of consciousness to control visceral functions,[1] including heart rate, digestion, respiratory rate, salivation, perspiration, pupillary dilation, micturition (urination), sexual arousal, breathing and swallowing. Most autonomous functions are involuntary but they can often work in conjunction with the somatic nervous system which provides voluntary control. Very Interesting as to the case for hypnosis. Will bring this up at my next Dr visit next month...lol!",

      "Content": "Jim, Its great the rad therapy worked so well. My bone scan did not show anything so rather than blasting everywhere (radiation) they assume Lupron will work if cancer is in lymph nodes. My wife is already using AARP plan N and Silverscrips part D so I am familiar there. Casodex needs a Plan D or C. Maybe best if I call actual plan provider and check the details. I have no other health issues, so was just trying to see all options! But if anyone else has opinions...am open to hear 'em Mike",

      "Content": "The RO has been reviewing my case, and wont start any rad until he completely understands my condition. This was a real surprise to me because I was fully expecting to be told to hurry up and get the treatments going!!! This is ok to me because my wife needs about 20 more treatments herself, and being her caregiver I need to take her anyway. The issue is why my PSA rose steeply after the RP surgery, even with clean path report. Couple mos later I was put on hormones. The RO wants to see exactly where he needs to irradiate which makes sense to me. I have read many times of others getting the \"prostate bed\" treated after RP but never quite understood that. He is reviewing my path reports, CT scans, PSA history etc. So far no further scans have been mentioned. Being on hormones definitely complicates things! So, still waiting to hear from the RO.....right now he says take my upcoming Lupron shot",

      "Content": "Have been on HT with good success, manageable side effects, PSA is undetectable for approx. 15 mos now. Was rising post surgery. Check my signature. But, when taking my wife to her Radiation Oncologist (her visit as a Lymphoma patient) I discussed my case and he strongly advised me to have radiation. I have read Dr Walsh and this forum (THANKS for ALL THE HELP!) and know the limits of HT and probably will move ahead with salvage RT. So, what is a typical treatment schedule for salvage rad, preparations, and potential bad things happening? My wife took a sodium fluoride PET/CT for bone cancer (neg results)...at a special center, is this for PC? Also, does a urologist normally treat PC or should I use an Oncologist? I asked wife's oncologist and he was very agreeable to have me as a patient. My urologist did the biopsy and gives me the Lupron shots. I do not have the ability to travel to a specialized center as I am primary caregiver for my wife, but there are many local doctors. Thanks, Mike",

So having said that I will have Radiation at a later date which will be focused at the bed of the prostate if every thing else is clear. Could you please clear something? If the scans are clear, how do they know where to irradiate? Radiation is suggested based on rising psa alone? How high is psa now, and your pain level?

      "Content": "Originally Posted by lancepeace Mike, I guess since your PSA was higher, they are assuming micro mets the radiation would not reach. It might be a statistical decision. Your signature shows surgery in 2013, should it be 2014? Lance you are spot on about my typo, and I recall now that's what the Dr said about the micro mets... Too much info to absorb at one office visit! And yes he also indicated that there are other new treatments becoming available...keep up hope. In your sig you mentioned supplements and dietary changes. Maybe we could start a sticky to discuss them?? Or maybe I will just start a new thread. Thanks for your help!! Mike",

      "Content": "I saw my surgeon yesterday and received the horrible news that post RP my PSA is continuing to rise, doubling time of about 6 mos. If you check my signature the numbers are listed. He said that radiation is effective when the cancer areas are clearly defined which makes sense...and in my case recommended hormones (Casodex and 3 month injection to start). Am scheduled for a bone scan next week, but he does not feel that this will show anything anyway. A younger doc in training said bone scans usually only show problem areas when PSA = 25 or so. They feel some microscopic cells escaped to other body sites and lowering my testosterone levels via hormones is the proper treatment. I was HOPING for radiation as I do NOT want the low T side effects...guess you are lucky in your diagnosis. Maybe you can elaborate a little on your Dr recommendation for radiation, your age, and your Gleason score... Wow, realized that I totally hijacked your post...sorry but your story is so close to mine...and I just got more confused...any feedback appreciated! Mike",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by Bravehardon I assume that radiation is not the 1st choice because the cancer currently is to small to target accurately. The last thing you want is a series of Luke Skywalker laser blasts going into your body on a hit and miss bases. You could always ask your doctor for the pros and cons of both. Brave Thank You the more info the better. That's what I think I heard from the doc that its too small or spread to who knows where, so no zapping. Was wondering why the OP was directed to radiation right away instead. My PSA is much higher and climbing. Mike",
