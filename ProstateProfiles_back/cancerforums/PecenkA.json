      "Content": "My dad (60, good physical condition) underwent laparoscopic radical prostatectomy on 18.4.2016. His initial diagnosis was gleason 9 (4+5) and PSA at 8.0. The surgery lasted for 5.5 hours and his surgeon said it was very difficult. After surgery his diagnosis was adenocarcinoma T3b N1 R0. I know what T3b and N1 means but I have no clue about R0? Other than that I don't have any more data except that lymph nodes on the left were ok and 3 out of 14 on the right side were cancerous. His PSA level one month after surgery was 7.4. How long does it take for PSA to drop if it drops at all because of some udiscovered metastases? He is starting hormone treatment in 6 weeks. He is already on complementary treatment by his own choice (cannabis oil + B17). I don't believe in it but if it helps him sleep beter it's fine by me, he won't bankrupt because of that.",

      "Content": "Standard practice here is that the first exam is in one month and consultations 3 months after surgery after everything is properly healed. Dad's not waiting passively but actively seeking second opinions and is generaly well informed. His consultations are this monday. Physical condition now allows him to play tennis again (1 month now). Incontinence issues are improving. He's already decided on hormone therapy but refuses any radiation treatment. He said he'd rather die in 6 months than suffer from any side effects. I know it's his decision but that bothers me a lot.",
