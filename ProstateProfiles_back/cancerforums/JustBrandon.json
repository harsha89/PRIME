      "Content": "Hello all, hope everyone had a wonderful christmas and a happy New Year. As I mentioned, dad was to have his incisional hernia repaired Jan 2nd, and the doctor said it went well, he put a mesh in to reinforce the muscle and tissue wall. He said problems like incisional hernias are quite common following daVinci robot surgery, and he's seen a lot of these cases in his practice. Bleeding was minimal and no complications were noted during the surgery. He does have a sore throat amd hoarse voice, which I'm assuming to be due to the breathing tube put in his throat. He is extremely, extremely sore in his abdomen, especially at the incision site, where the doctor aaid there are some staples. Dad has a big bandage wrapped around his back and abdomen, and it goes halfway up his chest and back. Discharge papers say he can take the bandage off after 48 hours post op, which would put it roughly 2:30-3:00pm ct, so we won't see the op site until then. With his blood clots from the davinci prostatectomy noted, the Dr said for dad to walk 10-15 minutes at least 3 times a day. Dad has already done 2 walks today, so we may go for 4 if he's not hurting too bad. What does worry me a bit is his oxygen saturation, our oximiter shows he had a oxygen sat of 92-94% at last check. I would like it to be at least 95% since he usually ran 97-98% prior to this surgery. Could the large bandage be affecting that? He says its quite tight and makes breathing a little uncomfortable, though he states he is not having shortness of breath. I know if a person's oxygen saturation drops below 90, that requires supplemental oxygen to bring it up. He states he is not nearly as weak this time around compared to his prostate surgery. I am staying extra vigilant with his blood clot history and his low oxygen saturation, and I'm staying awake overnight so I can keep an eye on him. He has the typical no lifting objects over 10-15 lbs for 6 weeks order followong such a procedure, and is to report to the doctor if he develops a fever of 100.5 F or higher. Also, it says on his discharge sheet, and the doctor stated as well, that he may have some drainage from the site, which is normal according to him, but if it becomes excessive, he is to report to the doctor or ER immediately. He has been given 40 hydrocodne 7.5 mg to take every 6 hours as need for pain, 21 antibiotic pills (cephalexin 500 mg) to take 3 times per day, and odansetron 4mg to be taken 1 tablet every 6 hours as needed for nausea. That's probably about it for now, but after talking to the doctor and reading up on some articles on daVinci surgery, I consider myself anti-robotic surgery, as does my father. He said if he could go over it again, he'd have neber considered the robot and went for the open surgery instead, especially if he knew it was going to cause him this misery and near death. But my opinion on the robot is another discussion for another time. Best wishes to all who are facing prostate cancer, and recovering from it, and best wishes to those of you whom may be caregivers to a PCa patient.",

But it has not extended into nearby tissues and has not spread into any lymphnodes. Your pathology report suggests that you had surgery on a moderately aggressive prostate cancer, and that the surgery didn't quite get 100% of it, hence the positive margins. There is no need to do anything before your scheduled post op PSA test. Your results then will dictate what direction you need to go in. Gleason 4+3(7) cancer typically will indicate radiation following surgery anyway. You might not have to do it immediately afterward, but my guess is at some point it will be needed. Fortunately, they would utilize the radiation at that point still with curative intent. Family friend of ours had pT3a N0 Mx prostate cancer upon his surgery, with A Gleason score of 4+4=8, had a PSA just under 12. He had salvage radiation for it, and his PSA has been undetectable for over 8 years now. So while it is unfortunate there was positive margin involvement, and the primary pattern was 4, that by no means spells doom, not at all.",

Surgical treatment is a good option because it will give you and your doctor abdefinituve picture, and you will know if it truly is organ confined, and know for certain the gleason grade. 20% of cases are upgraded to a higher gleason score be c ause the pathologist cannsee the whole prostate, and find higher grade disease the biopsy did not detect. Also, in the event of recurrence, youd have radiation as a 2nd shot to cure the disease. If you did radiation first and cancer returned, surgery wouldnt be likely recommended because radiation created scar tissue that is hard and leathery, and quite difficult to cut through. I think given your biopsy of 3+4, you should do fine, and chances of organ confined disease with no node involvement, or extraproztstic extension is good.

      "Content": "Yup not at all surprised your PSA shot up with all that going on. That's a lot of stress on the urinary system, and can stimulate the prostate into producing excessive PSA. As stated above, PSA is not prostate cancer specific, that's just one of several possible causes of elevation in PSA. Inflammation, infection, recent sexual function are among the chief causes of that, as can riding a bike, or exercises that emphasize the lower abdomen-- it's as if it \"squeezes the gland\", which in turn secretes PSA. Very happy to hear your PSA came down after the regimen of cipro, that pretty much legs it as Infection or inflammation. Very wise idea to have your PSA tested like you did per your brother's history as well.",

      "Content": "Fortunatwly the biopsy indicates low grade, gleason 6 prostate cancer. It is said that wssentially no man is at risk of death from gleason 6 prostate cancer because it lacks the mutations and de-differentiation to allow it to survive outside of the prostate, and therefore does not have the ability to metastasize. 4 cores being positive indicates a possibility of somebhigher grade cancer being present that warrants investigation. Maybe request your samples be sent off to a large facility for second opinion to be sure that it truly is gleason 6, and that there is no pattern 4 present, especially if that pattern 4 were to be the dominant pattern. If truly a gleason 6, you shpuld be fine in any case, and one treatment or another should do you well. Radiation therapy has about the same success rate as surgery in treating low and intermediate grade tumors.

      "Content": "Hello all, hope everyone had a wonderful christmas and a happy New Year. As I mentioned, dad was to have his incisional hernia repaired Jan 2nd, and the doctor said it went well, he put a mesh in to reinforce the muscle and tissue wall. He said problems like incisional hernias are quite common following daVinci robot surgery, and he's seen a lot of these cases in his practice. Bleeding was minimal and no complications were noted during the surgery. He does have a sore throat amd hoarse voice, which I'm assuming to be due to the breathing tube put in his throat. He is extremely, extremely sore in his abdomen, especially at the incision site, where the doctor aaid there are some staples. Dad has a big bandage wrapped around his back and abdomen, and it goes halfway up his chest and back. Discharge papers say he can take the bandage off after 48 hours post op, which would put it roughly 2:30-3:00pm ct, so we won't see the op site until then. With his blood clots from the davinci prostatectomy noted, the Dr said for dad to walk 10-15 minutes at least 3 times a day. Dad has already done 2 walks today, so we may go for 4 if he's not hurting too bad. What does worry me a bit is his oxygen saturation, our oximiter shows he had a oxygen sat of 92-94% at last check. I would like it to be at least 95% since he usually ran 97-98% prior to this surgery. Could the large bandage be affecting that? He says its quite tight and makes breathing a little uncomfortable, though he states he is not having shortness of breath. I know if a person's oxygen saturation drops below 90, that requires supplemental oxygen to bring it up. He states he is not nearly as weak this time around compared to his prostate surgery. I am staying extra vigilant with his blood clot history and his low oxygen saturation, and I'm staying awake overnight so I can keep an eye on him. He has the typical no lifting objects over 10-15 lbs for 6 weeks order followong such a procedure, and is to report to the doctor if he develops a fever of 100.5 F or higher. Also, it says on his discharge sheet, and the doctor stated as well, that he may have some drainage from the site, which is normal according to him, but if it becomes excessive, he is to report to the doctor or ER immediately. He has been given 40 hydrocodne 7.5 mg to take every 6 hours as need for pain, 21 antibiotic pills (cephalexin 500 mg) to take 3 times per day, and odansetron 4mg to be taken 1 tablet every 6 hours as needed for nausea. That's probably about it for now, but after talking to the doctor and reading up on some articles on daVinci surgery, I consider myself anti-robotic surgery, as does my father. He said if he could go over it again, he'd have neber considered the robot and went for the open surgery instead, especially if he knew it was going to cause him this misery and near death. But my opinion on the robot is another discussion for another time. Best wishes to all who are facing prostate cancer, and recovering from it, and best wishes to those of you whom may be caregivers to a PCa patient.",

      "Content": "pT3a N0 Mx(I assume) indicates prostate cancer that has escaped the prostate pseudocapsule-- not a true capsule since this layer does not elsurrouns the entire gland. But it has not extended into nearby tissues and has not spread into any lymphnodes. Your pathology report suggests that you had surgery on a moderately aggressive prostate cancer, and that the surgery didn't quite get 100% of it, hence the positive margins. There is no need to do anything before your scheduled post op PSA test. Your results then will dictate what direction you need to go in. Gleason 4+3(7) cancer typically will indicate radiation following surgery anyway. You might not have to do it immediately afterward, but my guess is at some point it will be needed. Fortunately, they would utilize the radiation at that point still with curative intent. Family friend of ours had pT3a N0 Mx prostate cancer upon his surgery, with A Gleason score of 4+4=8, had a PSA just under 12. He had salvage radiation for it, and his PSA has been undetectable for over 8 years now. So while it is unfortunate there was positive margin involvement, and the primary pattern was 4, that by no means spells doom, not at all.",

      "Content": "Fortunatwly the biopsy indicates low grade, gleason 6 prostate cancer. It is said that wssentially no man is at risk of death from gleason 6 prostate cancer because it lacks the mutations and de-differentiation to allow it to survive outside of the prostate, and therefore does not have the ability to metastasize. 4 cores being positive indicates a possibility of somebhigher grade cancer being present that warrants investigation. Maybe request your samples be sent off to a large facility for second opinion to be sure that it truly is gleason 6, and that there is no pattern 4 present, especially if that pattern 4 were to be the dominant pattern. If truly a gleason 6, you shpuld be fine in any case, and one treatment or another should do you well. Radiation therapy has about the same success rate as surgery in treating low and intermediate grade tumors. Highlander assured me, and many others who have G6 cancer, or have loved ones with it that no man dies from that disease, and all studies and research papers published in regards to gleason 6 verify that finding.",

      "Content": "pT3a N0 Mx(I assume) indicates prostate cancer that has escaped the prostate pseudocapsule-- not a true capsule since this layer does not elsurrouns the entire gland. But it has not extended into nearby tissues and has not spread into any lymphnodes. Your pathology report suggests that you had surgery on a moderately aggressive prostate cancer, and that the surgery didn't quite get 100% of it, hence the positive margins. There is no need to do anything before your scheduled post op PSA test. Your results then will dictate what direction you need to go in. Gleason 4+3(7) cancer typically will indicate radiation following surgery anyway. You might not have to do it immediately afterward, but my guess is at some point it will be needed. Fortunately, they would utilize the radiation at that point still with curative intent. Family friend of ours had pT3a N0 Mx prostate cancer upon his surgery, with A Gleason score of 4+4=8, had a PSA just under 12. He had salvage radiation for it, and his PSA has been undetectable for over 8 years now. So while it is unfortunate there was positive margin involvement, and the primary pattern was 4, that by no means spells doom, not at all.",

      "Content": "Yup not at all surprised your PSA shot up with all that going on. That's a lot of stress on the urinary system, and can stimulate the prostate into producing excessive PSA. As stated above, PSA is not prostate cancer specific, that's just one of several possible causes of elevation in PSA. Inflammation, infection, recent sexual function are among the chief causes of that, as can riding a bike, or exercises that emphasize the lower abdomen-- it's as if it \"squeezes the gland\", which in turn secretes PSA. Very happy to hear your PSA came down after the regimen of cipro, that pretty much legs it as Infection or inflammation. Very wise idea to have your PSA tested like you did per your brother's history as well.",

Well they did a re test today and the doctorbsaid \"Mr Otinger, i Have good news, your PSA has fallen to <0.1, which is essentially ZERO. The ultrasensative assay we use can sometimes glitch and overestimate values, and that is what happened with your January test.

Another test due in november, so we shall see then. I may call the office for a copy of the ecact wirding on the report. I think in a previous post in this thread, i said it as .1 in a reply, but i meant to put the < in front of it. Anything under 0.1 is supposed to be considered negligible. And given that his post surgical pathology confirmed it to be gleason 6, as oposed to say 4+3=7, I figure his odds of remaining negative for BCR are very, very high.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by HighlanderCFH The enlarged prostate is probably making your PSA a bit higher than normal. This could be the full explanation for the reading. At the same time, having a biopsy is a good idea, just for extra reassurance because the presence of PC could still be lurking and be masked by the BPH inspired PSA. Good luck! Chuck Yup, this is certainly possible. My dad's prostate was enlarged and caused urination issues. The cancer was found independently.",

Some articles have mentioned PNI as a negative factor in prognosis, especially if found on biopsy. Other articles have said it is of little significance. What is your take on this? Ill throw it out there that my dad had PNI in both the biopsyand surgical pathology. It was present in the left lobe, but not in the right.",

Im not saying this to scare you or anything, but just to alert you to the small possibility. I saw my dad develop bilateral dvts as a result from his surgery, but his calves were also hard as rocks and he devellped a high fever as well. Warmness is also a concerning symptom in terms of dvt. Have you had cramps in your calves?",

      "Content": "Hello everyone, hope all of yall have a fantastic Independence Day, as we celebrate the birth of our great nation. If you plan on drinking and need to go somewhere, please be sure to have a DD. Let this be a great day for everyone. It has been a long time since I last posted, but as of my dad's most recent PSA test, his level was still << 0.04, as low as the machine his urologist uses will go, basically he said this is pretty much less than 0, and now being over a year post op, that is definitely a big milestone. Cancer recurrence chances seem to go down significantly with each year that passes, up to about 10 years or so. As far as holiday plans, I can't do much, been bresking out in hives since march, been on steroids for what is now my third round, and ive had lip swelling as well, so my doctor gave me some epi pens to carry at all times, as I am at increased risk of anaphylaxis. My doctor basically has me under house arrest until I see him again. I am tl stay indoors at all times unless it is an emergency, and I am also to avoid heat and cannot drive, because one of the meds he prescribed me mskes me VERY sleepy when I take it, and I have to take 1 every meal and 2 at bed time. Kind of a bummer just KNOWING I can't get out and do anything, but I also must not lose sight that I am still more fortunate than a great many people are. Here's to a fantastic Independence Day to everyone, and I hope to see more snd more people join \"The Zero Club\". This is perhaps the only test anyone wants to make a zero on!!",

      "Content": "http://www.sciencedirect.com/science...14388215000259 Interesting read on radical prostatectomy for locally advanced prostate cancer that extends outside the prostate gland and up to N1 nodal involvement. This study seems to indicate rather decent success for certain T3 cancers of the prostate. In gleason scores less than or equal to 8, it seems T3a cancers can still have good results when treated with RP and node dissection. Many men get scared if they are diagnosed with T3 disease prior to treatment. The results of this study indicates successful treatment in a significant percentage of men who have RP to treat their locally advanced prostate cancer. SVI involvement does indicate a poorer prognosis advanced and need for additional treatment. But in T3a cancers where it is only outside the capsule, there is fairly good 5 and 10 year overall survival rates when treated with only prostatectomy alone. In short, this further shows that local advancedndredvanced disease is still quite curable for a rest many men. Just something I thought I would share for those who may have this particular kind of prostate cancer. And of course for anyone in this situation, there would still be radiation therapy available to clean anything missed up.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by Mimi711 Hi all. As soon as we get back to our more normal routines, I plan to write a post about DH's robotic RP which was last week. For now, I have a question regarding lymph nodes. Prior to the surgery, the plan was that the lymph nodes would be sampled with additional nodes to be removed if they looked enlarged. Right after the surgery, DH's surgeon told me that there weren't many lymph nodes there, that there was a lot of fatty tissue on one side, but that he did sample the nodes. The post-op pathology report states that two lymph nodes were removed, one from the right side and one from the left. The report describes the specimen labeled \"left pelvic lymph node\" but then states: \"Sectioning reveals unremarkable adipose tissue, no lymph node grossly is identified.\" It looks as if the surgeon intended to take out a lymph node from the left side but ended up only with fatty tissue. So where are the lymph nodes on that side? We meet with the surgeon later today and I'm not sure what to ask. Has anyone else had this happen? More importantly, should we be concerned, given the size and how close it was to the capsule, that no lymph node sampling was done on that one side? There had to be lymph nodes there, somewhere, right? Thanks, Mimi Here are relevant parts from the path report: Robotic RP on Aug 20, 2014: still 3+4=7 (whew!) Moderately involved, bilaterally, 25% -EPE; -SVI; +PNI; (intraprostatic); -Lymph node Pseudocapsule penetrated but not capsule itself Each person is different, and locations of lymphnodes arr pribably not the exacf same for everyone. Given that it was negative for extraprostatic extension, negative for seminal vessicle involvement, and negative for the node that was sampled, I wouldn't worry myself sick over it. Chances are still very much in favor thst the surgeon \"got it all\". Just keep up with the PSA tests post op that are to come. As long as they come out as zero, or undetectable according to the physician, then he should be in good shape, even if they didnt find the other nodes they intended to examine. If the PSA should rise on consecutive readings, there are several options still available with the intent for cure. Salvage radiation being probably the gold standard for that scenario. But again, as long as those PSA tests show \"zero\" or \"undetectable, then your husband is considered prostate cancer free.",

      "Content": "I agree with dayglo. It's never a bad idea to get a second opinion on biopsies. If you do get another opinion and it is Gleason 6 in that pathologist's opinion, you can take the route of active surveillance and not have to go through treatment. Just keep an eye on that PSA, and if it does not rise, then awesome, nothing needs to be done at that time. If it does rise on subsequent test(s) then you may need to seek treatment. Gleason 6 is the mildest form of prostate cancer. Some even say it's so indolent that it does not have the ability to readily grow and spread. Many Gleason 6 cancers have been present for years, never producing symptoms or evidence of growth because it is such a low grade. Your PSA, tumor quantification, and Gleason score make you a prime candidate for AS. Saving you from side effects and potential complications of treatment. If one has a choice Gleason 6 is definitely the one you \"want\". Best wishes.",

      "Content": "I agree with highlander on the idea of G6 not evolving into higher gradd cancer, and as he alluded to, if higher grade disease was found upon SURGICAL patholofy, it is likely that grade disease was there to begin with, biopsy just didn't find it because a biopsy only samples a very small portion of the gland. Having said that, I wouldn't say it is impossible for cancers such as 4+3=7 prostate cancer, as they exhibit traits of furthrr dedifferintiation, and one can think by further dedifferenation, then perhaps indeed this kind of cancer could perhaps evolve into fulminant G8 disease, and perhaps higher if not treated promptly. G6 cancers still have quite a bit of resemblance to normal cells, you can still make out fairly easily what cells are glandular in nature, and other cells arising from othrr etiolgy, such as squamous cells which make up the lining of pretty much all of the body's organs and major tissues. And thus, being able to easily tell these cells apart means they are well differentiated, and less aggressive than cancers that are not as well differintiated.",

      "Content": "HI there, sorry to hear about your family'so battles with cancer, and your own diagnosis. I lost my mother to stage IV squamous cell carcinoma of the tongue base. June 7th will be 9 years. Regarding your case, it sounds like there is likely a decent amount of tumor inside the gland. Lots of positive cores with some exhibiting a primary pattern of 4, this certainly warrants treatment. You are in good health and not suffering from comorbidities that might affect treatment and side effects (Diabetes, heart disease, respiratory disease, or other metabolic disorders.). As my dad's surgeon said, there is no universal treatment that must be followed exclusively, all treatment choices are patient dependent and depends on their preferences, and their particular cancer. Having gleason pattern 4 is an indicator for treatment rather than active surveillance in a healthy man such as yourself. Surgical treatment is a good option, and so is radiation for localized disease. When done by experienced surgeons and radiation oncologists, success rates are quite similar. The fact that the surgeon you are seeing has done over 1000 of these robotic prostatectomy es is very good. He is well versed and experienced, and this greatly reduces chances of unwanted side affects and surgical complications. Sounds like your pathologist who reviewed your slides is quite experienced in that field, so his findings are likely correct, though a second opinion never hurts should you decide to get one. Cure, continence, erectile function are the goals as stated above, and in that particular order. You definitely want to be cured of the disease, and definitely want to avoid continence issues as much as possible. Erectile function comes in third, as it's not quite of the level of importance as the other two, but still is something you want to preserve as much as possible. Given your age and health, going with a well experienced physician, I think you should do quite well. Side effects should be minimal and I think you will have a good outcome, with the ultimate goal of eradication of the cancer.",

      "Content": "Yikes, hate to hear you have locally advanced prostate cancer, but glad to see the response you had to therapy per your PSA tests.The bone scans being negative and the lymph turning out benign is certainly good. You still have a good shot at cure. Gleason 9 is indeed a nasty cancer, but fortunately your bone scans were negative, and the lymph nodes taken were also negative. When prostate cancer spreads, these are the first places it will go. The lymphatic system is one of the major ways that cancer of any type spreads, and for reasons I don't know,prostate cancer has a preference for bones when it spreads. So the fact both your bones and the sampled nodes we're negative is a very good sign. I'm guessing that when you say another shot, you are referring to another attempt at removing the prostate right? It isn't common for doctors to do prostatectomies after radiation, as there is scar tissue formation that makes it harder to remove the gland, but a good experienced surgeon can indeed work around this. And T3 disease can still be eradicated via surgery.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by HighlanderCFH Another thing to remember is that, although most of us (myself, included) forget that technically the prostate is NOT the only gland that produces PSA. The two Cowper's Glands at the base of the penis (that produce the slick, clear \"pre-cum fluid,\" also produce very tiny amounts of PSA. At least I recall reading this recently. In most cases, these two pea sized glands are spared during radical prostatectomy. In fact, in my case, they still produce that fluid and provides me with \"wet\" orgasms most of the time. Thus,these two glands probably account for -- at least in part -- the microfluxiations that might be present in the supersensitive PSA tests. Mayo says the supersensitive test causes too much unnecessary anxiety. But, as Jim notes, there are situations where it probably can be valuable in certain cases. Chuck That is an excellent point on the cowpers glands, those seem to be overlooked in the vast majority of cases, but that is definirely something people should besr in mind. A tiny rise in psa post treatment, as you said, may just simply be a result of the cowpers glands releasing extremely small amounts of psa, so as long as a rise in psa isn't all that significant, it is likely the product od the cowpers glands. As far as the ultrasensative PSA test, I too believe it can cause unwarranted anxieties in a lot of men, a small rise detected by this tsst might just be due to the cowpers glands. However, I do believe it has some value, particularly in higher grade cancers such as gleason 7(4+3). In these higher grade cancers, the ultrasensative PSA can perhaps(in my theory anyway) detect the signs of possible biochemical recurrence/failure at an earlier time and can therefore lead to retreatment and achieve better results, rhan if perhaps using the standard one decimal place test. As we all know, the sooner anything is detected, the better, including possible disease recurrence.This is all of course just my opinion and theory based on what ive read about prostate cancer, and it should not be used in the stead of trained physician advice. I really do think the ultrasensative psa test can be of benefit for men that had treatment of aggressive prostate cancer, though.",

      "Content": "I have been wondering which test is the best for PSA testing post treatment, specifically following prostatectomy. As you all know from my posts, my dad's PSA since the surgery have all been undetectable, AKA zero. That being said I often womder what is the better method to use. The standard PSA test that uses one decimal place, or thd ultrasensative test that uses two decimal places. My dad's PSA has been under 0.04 since the operation. His surgeon uses two \"less than\" signs on my dad's specific case. PSA <<0.04 . Is the ultrsensative psa test designed to detect ANY level of psa that is detectable, and what do the double less than signs mean? I do not believe the extra less than sign to be a typo. Oh and my dad's most recent PSA test in April was still <<0.04 ng/mL I may have already mentioned that but can't remember. He goes back August 19th for his next PSA test, so he is now on an every 4 month schedule instead of the every three month schedule he was on last year, which I take to be a good thing.",

      "Content": "I agree with highlander on the idea of G6 not evolving into higher gradd cancer, and as he alluded to, if higher grade disease was found upon SURGICAL patholofy, it is likely that grade disease was there to begin with, biopsy just didn't find it because a biopsy only samples a very small portion of the gland. Having said that, I wouldn't say it is impossible for cancers such as 4+3=7 prostate cancer, as they exhibit traits of furthrr dedifferintiation, and one can think by further dedifferenation, then perhaps indeed this kind of cancer could perhaps evolve into fulminant G8 disease, and perhaps higher if not treated promptly. G6 cancers still have quite a bit of resemblance to normal cells, you can still make out fairly easily what cells are glandular in nature, and other cells arising from othrr etiolgy, such as squamous cells which make up the lining of pretty much all of the body's organs and major tissues. And thus, being able to easily tell these cells apart means they are well differentiated, and less aggressive than cancers that are not as well differintiated.",

It isn't common for doctors to do prostatectomies after radiation, as there is scar tissue formation that makes it harder to remove the gland, but a good experienced surgeon can indeed work around this. And T3 disease can still be eradicated via surgery.",

      "Content": "HI there, sorry to hear about your family'so battles with cancer, and your own diagnosis. I lost my mother to stage IV squamous cell carcinoma of the tongue base. June 7th will be 9 years. Regarding your case, it sounds like there is likely a decent amount of tumor inside the gland. Lots of positive cores with some exhibiting a primary pattern of 4, this certainly warrants treatment. You are in good health and not suffering from comorbidities that might affect treatment and side effects (Diabetes, heart disease, respiratory disease, or other metabolic disorders.). As my dad's surgeon said, there is no universal treatment that must be followed exclusively, all treatment choices are patient dependent and depends on their preferences, and their particular cancer. Having gleason pattern 4 is an indicator for treatment rather than active surveillance in a healthy man such as yourself. Surgical treatment is a good option, and so is radiation for localized disease. When done by experienced surgeons and radiation oncologists, success rates are quite similar. The fact that the surgeon you are seeing has done over 1000 of these robotic prostatectomy es is very good. He is well versed and experienced, and this greatly reduces chances of unwanted side affects and surgical complications. Sounds like your pathologist who reviewed your slides is quite experienced in that field, so his findings are likely correct, though a second opinion never hurts should you decide to get one. Cure, continence, erectile function are the goals as stated above, and in that particular order. You definitely want to be cured of the disease, and definitely want to avoid continence issues as much as possible. Erectile function comes in third, as it's not quite of the level of importance as the other two, but still is something you want to preserve as much as possible. Given your age and health, going with a well experienced physician, I think you should do quite well. Side effects should be minimal and I think you will have a good outcome, with the ultimate goal of eradication of the cancer.",

      "Content": "Well my father has decided to go ahead with an operation to repair a hernia at the incision site where the prostate was removed. This doctor said it likely happened because the muscle there is likely still weak and will need extra reinforcement, so he is going to put in 2 meshes. He said he sees this a lot in his clinic after patients have had robotic operations. I am very worried about this surgery due to dad having blood clots following his RALP, but he said they will take every preventive measure they can to reduce the risk of it happening again. I believe the biggest reason he got the clots to begin with was because the nurses failed to utilize the compression device as he stayed overnight. They had it hooked up, but apparently did not have it actively compressing or improperly hooked up and dysfunctional. Of course at the time we were only thinking about the cancer being removed, did not think much of clots. But in hindaight, I believe this was the cause of the clots. I'm really ner ous about this one, but the doc said it will take 30-45 minutes and thus the less time under anaesthesia, the less the risk of such complication. He said he does not like the robotic approach because it is longer in duration and riskier in his opinion.",

      "Content": "Thanks for the reply, it also probably dependsnon stagebof disease and gleason score. Id say as an uneducated, layman's guess, the single decimal psa test probably would be sufficient for those wth confirmed g6 disease, as g6 is pretty easily treated and curable. G7 or higher on the other hand, the ultra sensative psa test would likely be more suitable, as it can detect even the slightest rise in psa, and thus prompt additional treatment if required.",

      "Content": "That is great news that you are getting to take part in the clin8cal trial, and are in the treatment arm of the trial. I would say surgery to remove a cancerous prostate with just one bone met would prove beneficial. I'm no Dr, but to remove the primary tumor would be a good idea in a case like yours. Less cancer is always good. And who knows, perhaps doing such would slow development of new metastasis. Certainly seems worth a shoot in my book. The last 4 lines of your signature are encouraging as it indicates a PSA that has fallen dramatically with Lupron all the way to 4.1 from a high of 62.4. Great response!! And the fact the met doesn't appear on the last scan is quite encouraging as well. I think you've got a good shot at controiling this animal for several years.",

That 1 year mark post treatment disease free is a huge milestone, as is the 18 month mark. Keep those good reports coming!! While there are serious risks to surgery, on the whole the chances of major complications sre quite low. My dad was the exception to that, but certainly not the general rule of what to expect post treatment. He did indeed suffer blood clots, which was a risk the doctor told him was possible, and they broke off to form pulmonary emboli, which lwnded him in sicu for a couple nights and a 5 day overall stay in the hospital. He is also permanently incontinent, but he feels part of that may be because he wasnt doing his kegel excercises properly. Even though all this happened to my dad, the overall risk for rhese complications is still quite low, it just so happened my dad wound up being one of the 5% who do have serious complications.",

      "Content": "Excellent news, the longer you go without a detectable PSA the more likely it is the treatment exterminated the cancer, snd the less likely it is to come back. That 1 year mark post treatment disease free is a huge milestone, as is the 18 month mark. Keep those good reports coming!! While there are serious risks to surgery, on the whole the chances of major complications sre quite low. My dad was the exception to that, but certainly not the general rule of what to expect post treatment. He did indeed suffer blood clots, which was a risk the doctor told him was possible, and they broke off to form pulmonary emboli, which lwnded him in sicu for a couple nights and a 5 day overall stay in the hospital. He is also permanently incontinent, but he feels part of that may be because he wasnt doing his kegel excercises properly. Even though all this happened to my dad, the overall risk for rhese complications is still quite low, it just so happened my dad wound up being one of the 5% who do have serious complications.",

      "Content": "Hello. Free PSA is the percentage of PSA that has not binded to other chemicals in the blood. The lower the percentage of free PSA, the greater the chance of prostate cancer being present. Your psa rising is concerning and definitely needs to be investigated. It does not mean you have prostate cancer but does mean it is possible. Only a biopsy can diagnose prostate cancer. Psa can be elevated to benign conditions such as enlargement of the prostate and prostatits. Your doctor will almost certify want to do a DRE and a biopsy. He will feel for lumps and bumps, and check for firmness. Any of these present raises concern. A biopsy will sample a certain amount of \"cores\",usually 12, though sometimes more or less. They would then be examined under microscope and any abnormalities noted, and if cancer cells are present, they will estimate how much of each core is cancerous and a Gleason grade will be given based on how any cancerous cells look. If they look fairly uniform, and show good glandular formation, they'll be assigned a lower Gleason score. If they do not look unkform, appear haphqzard, and less glandular formation seen, they will be assigned a higher Gleason score. Hopefully you won't have cancer and your psa will be related to benign conditions. If you do get diagnosed wth prostate cqncer, note that prostate cancer is typically slow growing and may not require treatment right away. Many, many men live with low gfade disease that does not threaten their life, and many die from something else other than their cancer. Even if prostate cancer escapes the gland, survival is still good, and cure can still be achievedone as long as it doesn't get to far from the prostate. Let us know how everything goes.",

I just saw something that said for it to be determined to be a true recurrence that the PSAmerican after surgical removal has to be 0.2 ng/ml or above on at least two successive tests. It also said that in many cases, even if there is a recurrence, often times it is on a microscopic level and may not become clinically or visibly evident for several years. He has stated that he has had a lot of trouble going to the bathroom, bowel movements, but urination is ok. So with the troubles with BM, that raises much concern to me. Though it should be noted he's had issues with his colon as well, and this isn't the first time he's had issues with BMW, he does have divermiculite which has caused issues with BM as well. It's just the proximity to the prostate bed and colon that leads me to worry additionally about a possible recurrence. I'm really hoping this morning'so test result was a sampling error, and the next one returns back to the usual <0.04 that his physician's lab defines as zero or undetectable.",

To be faced with such a dire prognosis with the widespread metastases, and now 12 years later, still no signs of disease progression and your PSA still being essentially undetectable; that alone is just amazing, especially taking into account where the mets went to and how many there were. But now you are even GAINING libido and your function is returning, that is just really something else. That is the cherry on top right there. You are a penultimate example for men with advanced, and even metastatic prostate cancer to never give up. Super stoked for you that you have been able to beat back such a demon and that you are having quality of life in the process. Truly remarkable. I am really happy for you.

      "Content": "Hello. Free PSA is the percentage of PSA that has not binded to other chemicals in the blood. The lower the percentage of free PSA, the greater the chance of prostate cancer being present. Your psa rising is concerning and definitely needs to be investigated. It does not mean you have prostate cancer but does mean it is possible. Only a biopsy can diagnose prostate cancer. Psa can be elevated to benign conditions such as enlargement of the prostate and prostatits. Your doctor will almost certify want to do a DRE and a biopsy. He will feel for lumps and bumps, and check for firmness. Any of these present raises concern. A biopsy will sample a certain amount of \"cores\",usually 12, though sometimes more or less. They would then be examined under microscope and any abnormalities noted, and if cancer cells are present, they will estimate how much of each core is cancerous and a Gleason grade will be given based on how any cancerous cells look. If they look fairly uniform, and show good glandular formation, they'll be assigned a lower Gleason score. If they do not look unkform, appear haphqzard, and less glandular formation seen, they will be assigned a higher Gleason score. Hopefully you won't have cancer and your psa will be related to benign conditions. If you do get diagnosed wth prostate cqncer, note that prostate cancer is typically slow growing and may not require treatment right away. Many, many men live with low gfade disease that does not threaten their life, and many die from something else other than their cancer. Even if prostate cancer escapes the gland, survival is still good, and cure can still be achievedone as long as it doesn't get to far from the prostate. Let us know how everything goes.",

With advances made today, you can continue on the path of survival for years to come. Just read the most recent entry in your blog, you mention your PSA remains undetectable and if it stays that way on the next test, your doctor will take you off your medications. That is beyond fantastic, spread the word that there IS hope, even in the midst of advanced prostate cancer.",

Though it should be noted he's had issues with his colon as well, and this isn't the first time he's had issues with BMW, he does have divermiculite which has caused issues with BM as well. It's just the proximity to the prostate bed and colon that leads me to worry additionally about a possible recurrence.

      "Content": "I agree with the others, a biopsy is the best thing to do to give you the best clinical picture possible. They aren't perfect, as they can miss areas of cancer, or areas of more aggressive cancer, but they are usually correct in most cases. You said your PSA went up to 5 and back down to 3.8. Sounds like some poteial inflammation/prostatitis going on in there. An enlarged prostate is quite possible too. The older you get, the larger the prostate tends to get. Enlarged prostates can raise psa. It is also possible on the flip side there may be some cancer there. My dad had a PSA of 4.2 with an enlarged prostate, and biopsy revealed gleason 6 in 5/12 cores. The biopsy itself isn't that bad. The Dr will anesthetize the area, and give you aneed antibiotic to take before and after the procedure just to safeguard in the unlikely hood of infection. If you are anxious, he or she may give something like a Valium or low dose Xanax before the procedure to relax you. They gave my dad Valium before his biopsy and he was pretty well chill during and after the procedure. 15 minutes or so and it's done.",

      "Content": "That is outstanding. To be faced with such a dire prognosis with the widespread metastases, and now 12 years later, still no signs of disease progression and your PSA still being essentially undetectable; that alone is just amazing, especially taking into account where the mets went to and how many there were. But now you are even GAINING libido and your function is returning, that is just really something else. That is the cherry on top right there. You are a penultimate example for men with advanced, and even metastatic prostate cancer to never give up. Super stoked for you that you have been able to beat back such a demon and that you are having quality of life in the process. Truly remarkable. I am really happy for you. Heres to a couple more decades of similar results. Take care.",

      "Content": "Thanks for your input Jim, and I am sorry that you have had to deal with PC as well. My dad is now 67 and the Dr considered everything reading less than the 0.04 mark to be zero. I just saw something that said for it to be determined to be a true recurrence that the PSAmerican after surgical removal has to be 0.2 ng/ml or above on at least two successive tests. It also said that in many cases, even if there is a recurrence, often times it is on a microscopic level and may not become clinically or visibly evident for several years. He has stated that he has had a lot of trouble going to the bathroom, bowel movements, but urination is ok. So with the troubles with BM, that raises much concern to me. Though it should be noted he's had issues with his colon as well, and this isn't the first time he's had issues with BMW, he does have divermiculite which has caused issues with BM as well. It's just the proximity to the prostate bed and colon that leads me to worry additionally about a possible recurrence. I'm really hoping this morning'so test result was a sampling error, and the next one returns back to the usual <0.04 that his physician's lab defines as zero or undetectable.",

      "Content": "Hello there. Hate to read that your husband was siagnosed with prostate cancer, but at least on biopsy, it was not a terribly aggressive cancer. The pattern 4 component usually knocks people out of qualification fir Active Surveillance, so getting it treated was a good move. Gleason 3+4, wh8le not nearly as bad as gleason 8, or even 4+3, still does have the ability to metastasize thanks to the pattern 4, but fortunately, it takes it a while to do so, if it ever does. That said, i think the chance of treatment success in his case is very good, and he should do quite well. However, that psa doubling is rather concerning, especially the jump from 6 to 12 in such a short time. It COULD be possible there was some higher grade like 4+3 or gleason 8 in there, but only the pathologist can determine that by looking at the whole specimen. The doctor usually gets the pathology report back in about a week, and then he or she can discuss the true status of the disease in detail. He or she can tell you then if there was higher grade cancer present or not, ehether or not it broke through the capsule (extraprostatic extension), whether or not it invaded the seminal vesiclea, and if any lymph nodes were sampled, that can tell whether or not the cancer spread to the lymphnodes. And it can tell if the margins were positive or negative. Negative means no cancer cells were seen involving the cut plane, whereas positive would mean there was some cancer invading into the cut plane. Often times, even if margins are positive, its insignificant because it cut through the tumor in the gland, and with no gland, those cancerous cells at the margin cannot survive, and they die, depending on just how much of the margin was involved. And by having surgery, that means radiation therapy would still be available as a curative treatment in the unlikelihood that it comes back down the road. But rest assured, with a skilled surgeon,the likelihood that they \"got it all\" is quite high, and the more skilled the surgeon is, the more likely they can spare the nerves, helpinh to keep sexual function intact, and continence issues can be minimized. The goals of treatment are as follows in order of most important to least: 1. Cancer cure 2. Continence 3. Preservation of sexual function. Let us know what the pathology report says, and then in.about 3 months, he should get his first post op psa, that will be vital for treatment success. A post op PSA test is about the only test i can think of that the goal is to make a \"zero\", in which case it's considered a success, and the patient is considered free of prostate cancer. Best Wishes.",

Of course any of this would ultimately come down to your father's wishes. But a good discussion with specialist in prostate cancer wouldn't be a bad idea, as they can let your father know about trewtments from which he could satisfactorily benefit from.

      "Content": "Hi there, if you had to get cancer, this one would be the least of all the evils. Gleason 6, less than 3 positive cores, and such s small percentage makes active syrveillance a hreat choice for you. Gleason 6 has never killed anybody that i know of, and doednt even hsve the ability to metastasize to lymphnodes. So actuve syrveillance is a hreat and prudent choice here. You get to avoid the side effects that come with treatment. Of courde with it being just a biopsy sample, there is no guarantee there isnt higher grade disease in there somewhere, but actuve surveillance does involve periodic testing, and that can pick up on potential signs there might be something more lurking in there. But for now, you dont have to worry about treatment, and you can go about your daily business as usual. And always, we are here to give advice and answer questions that you msy hsve. Lots of knowledgeable people here, so you are certainly in a good place. Long as that PSA remains low, and furure DREs remain normal, you wont have to worry about syarting treatment sny time soon, if at all. Best regards.",

You said his imaging studies show widespread metastases, with some in the pelvis essentially coalescing into one big, nasty blob of tumor in his pelvis. But his PSA has fallen from 30 to way down to .02, now THAT is an impressive responsevand treatment effect. To see shch bulk amount of cancer respond so dramatically is veey, very impressive, and is just indicative of very effective treatment. Him still being physically active is a favorably prognosticator, at least in the short term. It cannot be cured, but it CAN be controlled, as evidenced by the current response. This can be managed for possibly a long time before it becomes refractory to treatment. Best wishes Brandon",

Hes about 99% continent now, and only has issues doing strenuous activity (steel worker). But other than that, he doesnt experience issues. Be sure to do those kegel excercises, they'll help tremendously in regaining continence. It strengthens the sphincter and bladder muscles.",

      "Content": "Hi there, hopefully you will not have to \"join the club\", but should that time come, this forum is a treasure cove of knowledge and advice. I see in your signature that the DRE estimates your gland to be 25 grams. That is a normal size prostate. Whatever that tells me I'm a man your age is that there is quite possibly some inflammation going on in there, ie prostatitis, this can raise psa levels a couple of points. One general rule of thumb I have heard some Dr's use is \"it ain't cancer unless it is diagnosed and confirmed to be such\". The PSA rising is a bit concerning, but again, this could be due to prostatitis, a fairly common occurrence in men over age 50. But a biopsy is the only thing right now that can give us a concrete idea of what's going on, sans-serif having the gland removed. Prostate biopsies while perhaps seemingly daunting, are not really that bad. Your Dr will be sure to anesthetize the area well, so as to minimalist any pain or discomfort. He or she will likely also give you a couple antibiotic pills to take before and after the procedure to safeguard against the low chance of post biopsy infection. He or she may also give you a benzodiazapine such as Valium to help you relax, that's what my dad's urologist did anyway, and he was pretty chill throughout the process. You might experience some soreness following the procedure, and you might have minor blood in the urine for a couple days afterward, but this is normal, nothing to worry about, and doesn't always happen. You might hear some clipping noises during the procedure, and that is simply the tool taking snippets or little \"cores\" of prostate tissue to be examined. Best wishes, and let us know what your biopsy report says.",

      "Content": "I am happy to report that my dad has made another zero on the PSA test. He is now just 6 months Way from the 5 year mark in which most doctors consider the official cured threshold. The Dr said if it returns as zero then as he expects it to, he will readily and happily use that \"other\" c word--CURED!! Thought I'd share the good news and provide an update. Had that scare in January when it read .13, but I asked th3 Dr today about that, and he said that was a sampling or machine error.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by ddayglo Congrats! You and especially your dad had enough \"excitement\" in 2013. Here's wishing for a nice, quiet, uneventful, \"Zero-Club\" 2014! Thanks!! Yeah that's putting it mildly. In retrospect, the blood clots caused more harm than the cancer did, and at times, that made me think we made a mistake going with surgery. However, I now believe the decision to have surgery was a sound idea, as it gives the doctor an actual view of the prostate, and the pathologist the opportunity to find the true grade and extent of the disease. Whereas with radiation, brachytherapy, or AS, it is more of an educated guess, which sometimes hits it spot on, and misses in other cases. For this reason, I would consider myself a \"surgery guy\" like highlander when it comes to prostate cancer that is organ confined.",

      "Content": "Hello everyone, hope all is well, it has been a while since my last post, but i come with great news. My dad had his PSA checked this past monday, and it was once again 0. Officially <0.04 ng/mL. He now only has to get it checked on a yearly basis, and has the option to come in at any time of his choosing should he want it checked sooner than that. Doctors are very tight lipped when using the words cured and cancer in the same sentence, but the urologist was very blunt and not hestitant in saying \"Congratulations Mr. O'tinger, your PSA on our test today is once again 0, and this is your 5th year of 0 PSA after your surgery, so it is with great pleasure that I declare you cured of your prostate cancer.\" It is almost hard to believe it has already been 5 years since the diagnosis and treatment. Had a rough go of it in the initial post operativve phase with the DVTs in his legs and the resulting pulmonary emboli that sent him to SICU for a few days, and the months of blood thinner that followed. It took him roughly 2 years to recovery completely from that. But now, all is well, and we can celebrate the fact he is now a 5 year cancer survivor, a mark that sadly many others do not reach. Here is to hoping that the rest of you who are battling prostate cancer, or know someone who is, can also reach that big milestone, and live a happy and fulfilled life.",

      "Content": "Perineural invasion in prostate cancer that is low grade seems to be a topic that has different arguments. It has been said in many cases that PNI in low grade disease is not terribly significant, but I've also read online that PNI can perhaps turn an otherwise indolent prostate cancer into somewhat of a higher risk disease. These perineural spaces run through and out of the prostate through microscopic holes in the capsule. And it has been mentioned that even with Gleason 6 disease, the presence of perineural invasion may warrant a more proactive approach, as from what I've read, prostate cancer can travel along these perineural spaces and exit the prostate and perhaps spread locally, ie to seminal vesicles and nearby tissues, such as fat. Perhaps this doesn't make Gleason 6 wit perineural invasion present a particularly high risk, but a somewhat greater risk than Gleason 6 with no perineural invasion present. My dad had expressed regret over surgery due to the blood clots, and incontinence issues. But from what I read about prostate cancer utilizing perineural spaces to perhaps escape the gland, I'm still glad he had it done, I didn't want him to take any chances (not to mention having confirmation of true Gleason 6 on his surgical pathology;as many people are found to have higher grade disease). What are your takes on this topic? Does presence of perineural invasion on biopsy make active surveillance less likely for men with Gleason 6 prostate cancer?",

      "Content": "Hi, i posted my dad's last PSA result, and it was 0, as we hoped, but alas, didn't truly get to enjoy it right away. Couple days after that, he started having flu symptoms, this keot going on for several days until sunday, December 3rd, he was so weak he couldn't stand without a walker. Immediately went to urgent care dacility that day, where he had a high grade fever of 104.3 and some hypoxia, O2 sat was 87/88% on room air. He wss then taken to x ray, where they did an anterior and lateral view. Both views showed significant opacity in the right middle, and right lower lobes of his right lung. He was then put on oxygen at 3L at which brought his O2 back to about 93%. Disatisfied with this, the Dr gave us a copy of the visut reoort, and CD of the X ray and told us to go to the ER immediately, as it appeared he had pneumonia and was compromised to some degree in both oxygenation and blood pressure. So we get to the ER, and go up to the registration desk requesting urgent care as suggested by the clinic dr to get him into the ER department quicker. Got triaged and high fever and low saturation and low blood pressure persisted, so we were sent to a room immediately. And not pne of the regular rooms, but the trauma/resuscitation bay-- one that had defibrilators and crash cart already in the room, and significany cooler than the rest of the department, so apparently they felt dad was borderline hemodynamically and respiratoraly unstable. There he had blood draws which revealed a very high WBC of 18.7 with normal.values for their lab being between 6.2 and 10.6. Was also revealed to be quite dehydrated and low on potassium. Urine was tea colored, and potassium was 3. Normal values on that were 3.5 to 5.2, so he was given fluid and 40 mEQ of potassium chloride. He had noted thst his legs from the knee down were in significant pain, which was refractory to tylenol. So based on his answer of 9/10 on the pain scale, ge was given dilaudid over a slow drip. This made him sleep. There, his oxugen improved some after recieving a shpt of rocephin and dekasol. Was 95% on 3L of oxygen. He was then hooked up to a telemetry monitor, which covered the usual HR, RR, O2 sat, and BP, with BP raken every 15 mi ures and automatically timed and recorded. We were in this resuscitation room for a good 4 hours. Turns out that though it wss requested he be admitted by his PCP fir inpatient observation, there were no beds available at tge time on the med floor. Finally, ER doctor comes back in and confirms the diagnosis of pneumonia, which had arusen from the flu, and she finally got us ready fir a room. It only became available after a patient died. So after housekeeping had time to clean the room, and gwt new linen, we finally got into the room at 1:12 am, and adnitedly, both of us were a little wary of being in a room and on the very bed where the previous patient had \"expired\" -- hate it when tgey use that term. To tge best if my kbowledge, we don't spoil like milk...... Anyway, he was given some very strong IV antibiotics, some hydro for his pain, and more fluid to help his hydration status. Nurses were in and put about every 4 hours taking vitals, so it was ratger difficult for us to really rest. They also gave him nebulizer treatments every 4 hours to help open his lung up. Slowly he began to respond to antibiotics, fever was coming down, and he was able to tolerate a lower flow of oxygen and sustain a decent O2. 96% there over the course of the night on 2L instead of 3L of oxygen. Next day showed no change on the x ray, still had opacities in the right middle, and right lower lobe, so he was kept for another night to be observed. Held steady on 02 sats and his temperature finally started to break. At this point, the dr was pleased, and said within 2 days we shpuld get to go home, as his temp inproved and heart rate lowered, and blood pressure stabilized. Dad cpuld have went home the next morni g, but he opted to stay one more day just to be on the safe sude when asked by the Dr. X ray the next morning dhowed slow clearing of the opacities, and with that and improved hydration, good bp, good oxygen on room air, he was finally able to go hone that wednesday, 3 days after admission. Left tge hospital with a 10 day orescription of levoquin 750 mg, and follow up with PCP. Got the follow up visit done and had another x ray done there, and it showrd slow, but continued clearing of the opacities. Ge was then cleared to go back to work the next day, which he did, and hes been hammering away since. Home pulse oximeter shows 97-98% oxygenation now, and he was able to gain his stamina back quickly. Did lose about 12 lbs while he was sick. Now with all that said, we can finally enjoy the 0 PSA and carry on. Just about 6 months or so will be that big 5 year mark, which we certainly look forward to. And we agreed that when ge starts getting sick like that again, he will go to the Dr if hes not any better after 3 days, instead of trying to tough it out. Who knows, if we had waited 1 more day as bad off he was, he might have required ICU admission. And he definitely doesn't want that stuff again and not have to miss several days work, so hes going to go to the Dr a little more promptly tge next time he feels ill. Whew.",

My dad having it puts me at higher risk myself down the road, so I'll definitely be getting those recommended screenings when I hit 40. I should note that what I read does not say that PNI on G6 disease definitively makes it riskier, though it did say it is possible, but debatable . I just don't see Gleason 6 becoming metastatic disease.",

      "Content": "Yeah, PNI on surgical pathology is quite frequent, it's just when it's present on biopsy that makes me wonder, since biopsy only samples a very tiny portion of the prostate. If it is found on biopsy, even in Gleason 6, would that make G6 in that case higher risk than G6 without pni. I definitely still think Gleason 6 w/pni is better than a more aggressive cancer without it, g7 4+3 -pni for example. I also still can't imagine a G6 tumor metastasizing. And on a side note, low risk prostate cancer is considered that of Gleason 6 or less, no more than two cores positive, and under a certain percentage of those cores involved with cancer. Though I'm not sure what the cutoff there is. So what should we tell someone with G6 disease with more than 2 cores positive and say for example cores being 40% involved with cancer?",

      "Content": "I would say your bladder infection is the source of your pains, and enlargement(benign prostatic hyperplasia, bph), inflammation of the prostate(prostatitis) can cause your PSA to be elevated. Prostate cancer is typically slow growing, and most men if they die, do so WITH prostate cancer not BECAUSE of prostate cancer. That being said, you don't need tonworry yourself sick, see what the medicine does first, rule out other conditions before ruling in prostate cancer. A biopsy can tell you about the state of your prostate, and it can find cancer if any is present as well, but because the biopsy only samples a very small portion of the gland, it is possible to miss cancer, or miss higher grade cancer. You have not stated your age, as a general rule of thumb, the older a man gets, the higher the threshold for what is considered a \"normal\" PSA value becomes since the prostate tends to enlarge with age anyway. A PSA of 4.11 isnt terrible if it is indeed elevated according to age. IF cancer is indeed present, PSA levels under 10ng/mL indicate low grade, organ confined disease, and therefore a very treatable and curable cancer, and depending on factors suchnas gleason score, number of cores positive for cancer on biopsy, immexiate treatment may not be needed, and in fact may even be advised against depending on factors such as age and presence or absence of significant health problems like COPD and heart disease.",

      "Content": "Hello everyone, hope all is well and you all had a happy new year. It has been a while since I last posted , but we are considering sueing my dad's urologist. Not because of the blood clots, but because of the hernia that developed which further set him back and has caused him to go into depression due to not being able to work. The urologist failed to mention that the incision could herniate, and as such, this was not even on our mind as dad considered his treatment options. I just wonder if failure to warn of that possibility can be considered negligence on behalf of the surgeon, and therefore something that we can pursue legal action over. I do not intend to start drama, and if this post does start drama, I sincerely apologize in advance. As we all know, outcomes of surgery rely heavily on the competence and skill of the surgeon. When dad got the news he had prostate cancer, he asked the doctor how many robotic prostatectomies he had done, and the doctor replied \"tons of em\". That was it, no specific number or estimation, just a vague \"tons of em\". In hindsight, that should have raised a red flag and perhaps we should have sought advice from another urological surgeon, or even two. I feel they should be able to at least give a ball park estimate of how many procedures they have done. 500 I think, if I read correctly on here and other websites, is the threshold for a doctor to be considered proficient in this kind of operation. The doctor who repaired the hernia(a general surgeon) said that the area did not heal properly, and that left it predisposed to herniating. And he also said he isnt a fan of the robot because of its cost, and said in many cases, it actually takes longer to do than a standard laporoscopic approach. Of course, he could have just been saying that out of bias, but even so, it gave us second thoughts. Whats done is done though, cant go back and undo the operation, but if we had to do it all over again, I think we may have avoided this surgeon and gone with a standard laparoscopic procedure. I doubt we could make a case against the company that made tne robot, as I believe it came down to an error and lackof warning on the doctor's part. He should have been a little more specific when asked how many of these things he has done. It seemed like it offended him slightly when dad asked him.",

We had to stop due to pneumonitis developing from the chemo. I was on docetaxel and am taking lupron shots every 3 months. I am 56 years old my gleason score is 4 + 4 = 8 on all the categories. Roughly 80-90% on all of them as well (don't know what this means) My PSA was 0.071 then went to 0.163 then went to 0.309 and now is 0.5 I know this is low but does slow blips of rising PSA like this mean anything? This is my only concern. Thank you hope you all have a great day! Sorry to hear of your ordeal, how fast has your PSA been rising(PSA doubling time).",

Ask if extraprostatic extension was present or not, status of the seminal vesicles; whether they were psitive or negative for involvement. And ask him abut the status of the nerve bundles as well. And as far as one core being 4+3 vs the rest of them being Gleason 6, it does supercede the rest of the cores being lower grade. On biopsy such as yours, your cancer I'll be considered 4+3=7 even though the others were Gleason 6. Also keep in mind sometimes on surgical pathology, more aggressive disease is found, this happens around 30% of cases. And in less frequent cases, it can be found to be less agressive tan what the biopsy indicated. At this point the most important factors will be thestatus of the margins, if the are negative, the less likely it is the cancer has spread, Gleason score on the surgical pathology report, and whether or not it involved lymph nodes and/or the seminal vesicles.",

      "Content": "Based on the information you've provided, it sounds like your pc is so insignificant that it isn't affecting your psa at all. Just two positive cores, low percentage, and Gleason 6, you are a prime candidate for active surveillance, and you may not ever face problems with your prostate cancer. You can pretty much go about business as if you don't have pc, but do keep having the psa. Checked to be sure nothing changes. Gleason 6 is a very indolent form of the disease, and it has been said thst it is difficult for G6 to survive outside the prostate. Others have stated on here thst they've not heard of fatal cases of G6 prostate cancer, and from what I've looked up online, I couldn't see evidence of any fatal G6 prostate cancers.",

      "Content": "Hello everyone, hope all is well and you all had a happy new year. It has been a while since I last posted , but we are considering sueing my dad's urologist. Not because of the blood clots, but because of the hernia that developed which further set him back and has caused him to go into depression due to not being able to work. The urologist failed to mention that the incision could herniate, and as such, this was not even on our mind as dad considered his treatment options. I just wonder if failure to warn of that possibility can be considered negligence on behalf of the surgeon, and therefore something that we can pursue legal action over. I do not intend to start drama, and if this post does start drama, I sincerely apologize in advance. As we all know, outcomes of surgery rely heavily on the competence and skill of the surgeon. When dad got the news he had prostate cancer, he asked the doctor how many robotic prostatectomies he had done, and the doctor replied \"tons of em\". That was it, no specific number or estimation, just a vague \"tons of em\". In hindsight, that should have raised a red flag and perhaps we should have sought advice from another urological surgeon, or even two. I feel they should be able to at least give a ball park estimate of how many procedures they have done. 500 I think, if I read correctly on here and other websites, is the threshold for a doctor to be considered proficient in this kind of operation. The doctor who repaired the hernia(a general surgeon) said that the area did not heal properly, and that left it predisposed to herniating. And he also said he isnt a fan of the robot because of its cost, and said in many cases, it actually takes longer to do than a standard laporoscopic approach. Of course, he could have just been saying that out of bias, but even so, it gave us second thoughts. Whats done is done though, cant go back and undo the operation, but if we had to do it all over again, I think we may have avoided this surgeon and gone with a standard laparoscopic procedure. I doubt we could make a case against the company that made tne robot, as I believe it came down to an error and lackof warning on the doctor's part. He should have been a little more specific when asked how many of these things he has done. It seemed like it offended him slightly when dad asked him.",

      "Content": "Hello flag, first and foremost, thank you for your service. Fortunately, as others have stated, with a clinical stage of T1c and a PSA elevated, but under 10, it's quite likely your cancer is still inside the gland and curable. With the primary grade in your Gleason score being 4, it's probably a good idea your dr has you on ADT, this will help make it more sensitive to treatment, radiation in particular if you so choose. When prostate cancer is still inside the gland, surgery is always an option, but as with any other treatment, there are side effects. And when in the prostate, radiation has as good a success rate as surgery. Again it too has side effects to take into consideration. G 7(4+3) is a bit more aggressive than G 6 or the 3+4 pattern, but it certainly isn't as dire as an 8,9, or 10. And again with your clinical stage and PSA under 10, chances are very much in your favor that it is prostate contained, and you have several venues of treatment that are all effective in treating it. Basically it's going to come down to what YOU want to do, and when dealing with cancer, having choices is certainly a good thing. Best of luck to you, and cheers to a post procedure \"zero\".",

Hopefully your case, and my father's will both turn out to be an error in the machine or sampling, hence why they say that the PSA must be elevated on successive tests to make a diagnosis of biochemical recurrence. If I read everything correctly, you had no EPE, negative margins, and negative lymphovascular involvement. Your gleason 7 was fortunately of the less aggressive, 3+4 is much better than 4+3. Also stated were no involvement in the seminal vesicles, that too is a good thing. Not having extraprostatic extension(cancer that escaped the inside of the gland), no lymph involvement, and no seminal vesicle involvement presents a significantly lower chance of a recurrence than a case where any of that was positive. Negative margins is very big too in lessening the chances of recurrence. Let us know what happens on your next test.",

Can you tell us more? how many cores were positive(involved by cancer), the % of each core that was positive for cancer, exactly how much was graded pattern 4? it is never a good diagnosis, b ut going on what you have posted thus far, I would imagine your cancer is not outside the prostate, has not spread either locally or distantly, no spread to lymph nodes, and as stated, there does not appear to be cancer at or penetrating the capsule, all of which are definitely good things, and favorable prognosticators. no seminal vessel involvement is also a big vheckmark in your favor as well. I think you will do quite well with your treatment, and I think your treatment will be successful in eradicating the cancer. You will likely not be a candidate for active surveillance with the pattern 4 present, and you may also be looking at a couple treatment modalities in your plan.let us know what you and your doctor discuss and figure out what you think is best in your case. always remember that when treating prostate cancer there is no such thing as a right or wrong choice.",

      "Content": "I am so sorry to hear such a serious diagnosis. Gleason 8 and 9 are way on up there in terms of aggressiveness. As such, it is not surprising there is bone involvement and a sky high PSA level. However, advanced prostate cancers typically will respond to aggressive treatment, at least for a while. Combination therapies such as radiation and hormone therapy can significantly reduce tumor burden, and delay progression and further metastasis. Even with serious casesvlike that, men have been known to live sevdral years following their diagnosis. At this time surgery is not an option, so the first step is to meet a medical oncologist specializing in advanced prostate cancer, and a good radiation oncologist. I've heard of men with similar stats living 8+ years. While it cannot be cured, it can be controlled and managed. With prompt and aggressive treatment, your husband can live many more years, progression free and with a good quality of life. And who knows what breakthroughs may be around the corner.",

      "Content": "After going back, reading kther topics, informqtion about my dad's case as well, given that his was proven to be gleason 6 on surgical pathology and his PSA was \"only 4.2\" with it having cancer AND being enlarged, I am just about as close to 100% certain it was truely an indolent, organ limited disease as one can be. In hindsight he vrry well could have chose active surveillance instead of treating it right away, but given that the enlargement of the gland was causing him to urinate frequently, experience major urges to go, etc, I'd say the surgery was in the end, the best thing for him to do, as radiation of either modality would have onky treated the cancer, and not the enlargement, he still would have been going to the bathroom alot. And he would have continued to have urinsry frequency and urgency if he had chosen AS. So despite he experienced blood clots and wound up in sicu because of it, surgery was the best option in his case. It got the cancer out and relieved his urinary symptoms caused by the glanx enlargement. He's still on one pad a day, and unfortunztely, the doc said at this point in time that the incontinence has resolved as much as it was going to, without surgical intervention such as implanting a sling to control it. However that is a small price to pay in order to be rid of the cancer and it is worth it in our opinion. He can still have that sling procedure if he wants, but given that henis pretty much surgery weary at this point ( hernia repair the yesr before the prostatectomy, and another operagion this past January to repair an incisional hernia ghat came up at the largest prodtatectomy incision site 8 months after the prostate ordeal), and he doesn't feel its worth the blood clot risk again for an elective operation. He says all that matters now is the cancer is gone, and given that he wishes to remain single now, all other side effects such as ED are more than acceptable since it got rid of the cancer. We are both pretty much as close to as 100% sure prostate cancer will never again be an issue for him, but we are also aware of the very, very minute off chance it coulx return. So it sounds cliché, but we are 99.99999999999% confident the cancer is gone and will never return.",

      "Content": "Active surveillance is a good option for you with Gleason 6 cancer and only one core being positive, and 20% of a single core isn't much at all when you look at the prostate as a whole. You are also a good candidate for surgery a t your age and biopsy results. You being young would make for an easier and quicker recovery than it would in older men. And if the tumor is indeed confined to the gland, then yes, removal of the gland would be considered a cure. With you being rather young for a man with prostate cancer, your recovery from any incontinence issues should be quick, provided of course you do have surgery. If one had to have cancer and was able to pick what grade, you definitely got the best one. Not to be a downer, but in 20-30% of cases in surgical specimens, the Gleason score is upgraded a bit, because sometimes higher grade cancer is found than what the biopsy found. Usually a Gleason 6 that is upgraded, is upgraded to a 7, haven't really heard of many G6 cancers being upgraded to 8 or higher grades.",

      "Content": "Gleason 6 prostate cancer is the \"best\" prostate cancer to have. While the gleason scale does go from 2 to 10, hardly do you ever hear of anything less than gleason 6 being found. Some people might think \"6 out of a scale of10 is kind of high\", but in practice today, gleason 6 is the lowest grade prostate cancer to be found. Hardly, if ever do you hear of men dying from gleason 6 disease. If they have, it is likely in those cases there was a much more aggressive, higher grade cancer present among the G6. That PSA while elevated, is not too bad, and indicates an early stage disease when combined with the gleason score. With PSA that low, and Gleason 6 disease, active surveillance is possible, depending on tne number of cores involved, unless im mistaken, to be considered for AS Gleason score should be G6, PSA under 10, and no more than two cores positive for cancer. As Highlander mentioned, AS is somewhat of a risky thing to do, even if biopsy only shows G6 in 2 cores or less, it is possible for higher grade cancers to be missed because the biopsy only takes a very small portion of tissue to be examimed. Most of the time, an astute pathologist gets it right on the biopsy. However some less practiced pathologists may underestimate the cancer, but the only way to find the true grade, stage, and extent of prostate cancer, is to have the gland removed. The pathologist can sample the entire prostate and seminal vesicles in this case, and it can confirm the biopsy assessment, and the gleason score remains the same, or in up to 20% of cases, post surgical pathology reveals more extensive, higher grade prostate cancer. In rare cases, surgical patholovy may reveal less aggressive disease, but this is the exception and not the general rule. Not uncommonly do hou hear of g6 cancers being upgraded to g7. And g7 is usually 3+4 or 4+3. A 3+4 g7 prostate cancer is less aggressive than 4+3 g7 prostate cancer. Fortunately it sounds like this cancer was detected early and there are many options for treating iit and achieving a good outcome. Radiation is quite effective on g6 disease, as is surgery, hormone therapy is not curative, it is used to slow the progress of prostate cancer, and perhaps can make radiatiom more effective. Youve mentioned hes been on AS for a few years, and you said his recent PSA was 5 and it is gleason 6 cancer. If that hasnt changed and no more than 2 cores are positive, AS can be continued. But perhaps for peace of mind, treatment wouldnt be a bad idea either. Some understandably find it hard to leave cancer in their body, and want it out asap. My dad was one of these. Even though he had 5 cores positive, 3 ocer the recommendation of 2 or less for AS, his urologist did offer him AS, and time to decide on trestment. Dad decided right then when he got his biopay results that he wanted surgery, as he didnf like thr idea of cancer being leff inside , no matter how \"indolent\" it may have seen. Surgery does carry risk, and you can see in my signaturr the complications my dad had as a result of his surgery. And his is one resson why I think men with g6 disease shouldnt rush into treatment, as the side effexts/ complications can be quite significant, whereas they can avoid it altogether by choosing AS and only deciding to treat it, if it shows signs of progression.

      "Content": "Hello there. Gleason 3+4 isnt the worst to have by any means, but unfortunately with a core having 50% involvement, that pretty much makes AS not an option. Given your heart condition, radiation therapy is a grear choice of treatment, and is pretty much as effective as surgery in treating prostate cancer. Can you guve us some mlre info? Things such as: DRE results: was it normal, or did the dr note lumps, bumps, indulation, or firmness? PSA: What was your psa level, and if it had been measured several times, what were the trends? Overall biopsy results: was that the only positive core, ir were there others? Aside from your heart condition, are there medical issues such as diabetes? Diabetes can hinder recovery from.radiatuon therapy. There are nomograms developed by sloan kettering that can give you an idea on how likely it is your disease is to br organ confined, and how likely you are to be free of disease at 5 years with radiation therapy. Your Gleason score and PSA are the most important factors in this nomogram. Note that since you are not having surgery, your PSA will not drop down to zero as you will still have a gland to produce psa, so dont worry if post treatment tests show some levels of PSA being detected. Good luck on your treatment, and let us know how it goes.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by FredM I'm new here and don't know much about prostate cancer. Can you guys let me know if this is a reasonable course of action, or should I be asking more questions or doing something different? Here's my situation: 43 years old, good health, no symptoms, no history of prostate cancer in relatives, but I don't have many relatives, just my dad and two brothers, no uncles or cousins. Primary care doc found a possible nodule on right lobe of prostate during DRE as part of annual physical. Because of this he ordered a PSA and referred me to a urologist. PSA came back at 0.4 Urologist did DRE and said prostate was not enlarged but agreed with PCP that there was a hard area. He believes it's unlikely to be cancer, but wants to do a rectal biopsy, guided by ultrasound. From what I gather, they use local anesthetic on the biopsy using a needle. He gave me a script for 3 days of Levaquin 500mg starting day before biopsy and they will give me a shot with another antibiotic the day of. Also wants me to do an enema before the biopsy. This is all overwhelming to me and seems like a pretty involved procedure. Does doing a biopsy in my situation seem reasonable or is there another course of action that would be better and less invasive? Should I be asking more questions? Please give me any advice you have. Thank you. Hello there, with there being a nodule felt on the rectal exam, biopsy is definitely advised and warranted. The antibiotics are standardbprocedure to prevent infection after the biopsy. You will be under local anesthesia for the procedure, and as such, you shouldn't endure much pain, if any at all. The standardnprostate biopsy is usually 12 samples around the most comm8n areas in the prostate that cancer may develop. You may also be given something like a valium prior to the procedure to help you relax, at least thats what they did with my dad anyway. And I would suspect your doctor may have your PSA re tested prior to the biopsy. They don't like to do psa tests after the biopsy because nthe biopsy irritates the prostate slightly and can spike the PSA as a result. The next course ofmaction will depend on the results of your biopsy. Keep in mimd, the nodule may or may not be cancer, only examination of cells umder a microscope can determine whether it is or isn't cancer. If it is cancer, thw pathologist will assign a score to the cancer, called the Gleason Score. What this is, it is an evauluationof how abnormal rhe cells look under the microscope. There are two main components to the gleason score, and they are the primary pattern, and the second dary pattern. Primary pattern is the majority of the celluar make up, and the secondary is the pattern that composes thelesser amount of gleason grade. There is also sometimes a tertiaty pattern, which ia typicallyna higher grade than the mainntwo patterns, of it is indeed present. The g eason score ranges from 2-10 and is prpduced bybthe sums of the two biggest patterns. Lowest is gleason pattern 1 amd highest, and most aggressive is gleason pattern 5. So for example, if the primary pattern is 3 and the secondary pattern is 4, then you get a gleason score of 3+4=7, making it a Gleason 7 cancer. Of note is that in today's practice, gleason scores 5 and less are rarely used, as they are considered very mild, so the lowest score a man can get in terms of his camcer's aggressiveness is Gleason 6, 3+3=6. This is a very slpw growing cancer, and , ay not ever even tjreaten a man's life depending on their age. Gleason 7 is somewhat tricky, as it depemds on which os the primarybcomponent, amd which pattern is tje secondary component. The 3+4 bariant of Gleason 7 disease is less aggressive than the 4+3 variant. Gleason scores 8-10 are considered high grade, aggressive cancers, and require more extensove, and earlier treatment. Foetunqtely, gleason 6 is by far the mpst common form of tje disease, and is easily treated, amd very rarely, if at all spreads putside of the prostate. Men who have this lpw grade camcer jave likely had it for many years before it was diagnosed. Treatment tions depend on a person's age, overall health, Gleason score, PSA level, and whwther or not it is suspected to have penwtrated the proatate. Found early enough, basically all tions are available, including the tion of monitoring PSA , Digital rectal exams, and biopsies, this is called active surveillance. Men who choose active surveillance sont get treated right away, they simply monitor the status of the cancer through tje aforemwntioned, PSA tests, biopsy, and digital rectal exam. If these tests do show a change in the cancer, show it growing larger or becoming more aggreasive, then these men initiate treatment. Treatment for prostate cancer includes the following options: surgery, which os commonly performed with a robot now, instead of the traditional open, large incision operation. Radiation therapy: external beam radiation therapy, o4 brachytherapy, which is the implantayion of small, radioactive seeds placed in the prostate, these don't emit enough radiation to harm you, but do emit enough to successfully treat the cancer. Hormone therapy: this includes agents that block the reception of testosterone in prostate cancer. This is not curative, but cam be used with rafiation to male the tumor mpre susceptible to radiation.. At your ypung age, if it is determined you have prostate cancer, and it is not of a high grade, and appears contained to the prostate, surgery would likely be recommended foe you, given that in a healthy man with no signifocant existing diseases like heart disease, and life expectancy of at least 10 more years, and id say at your age, youd more than exceed that 10 year life expectancy. Of course if you do not like the idea of surgery, you can go with the other options as well. Since itnis very highly likely your life expectancy will far ezceed 10 more years, active survei lance peobably wont be offered, this is usually reserved for older men(generally 65 and older), and/or those who have existing conditions that may make treatment riskier and benefits outweighed by risks. I apologize for the humongous wall of text, and plethora of spelling and grammar errors, I just wantes to give you some advice and help answer ypur questions. Keep in mind each treatment has its risks and aide effexts, so IF you are diagnosed with cancer, be sure to look at the risk and side effects of each one and then make your decision based on what you are most comfortable with, and what you feel like offers the greatest benefits to you.

Primary care doc found a possible nodule on right lobe of prostate during DRE as part of annual physical. Because of this he ordered a PSA and referred me to a urologist. PSA came back at 0.4 Urologist did DRE and said prostate was not enlarged but agreed with PCP that there was a hard area. He believes it's unlikely to be cancer, but wants to do a rectal biopsy, guided by ultrasound. From what I gather, they use local anesthetic on the biopsy using a needle. He gave me a script for 3 days of Levaquin 500mg starting day before biopsy and they will give me a shot with another antibiotic the day of. Also wants me to do an enema before the biopsy. This is all overwhelming to me and seems like a pretty involved procedure. Does doing a biopsy in my situation seem reasonable or is there another course of action that would be better and less invasive? Should I be asking more questions? Please give me any advice you have. Thank you. Hello there, with there being a nodule felt on the rectal exam, biopsy is definitely advised and warranted. The antibiotics are standardbprocedure to prevent infection after the biopsy. You will be under local anesthesia for the procedure, and as such, you shouldn't endure much pain, if any at all. The standardnprostate biopsy is usually 12 samples around the most comm8n areas in the prostate that cancer may develop. You may also be given something like a valium prior to the procedure to help you relax, at least thats what they did with my dad anyway. And I would suspect your doctor may have your PSA re tested prior to the biopsy. They don't like to do psa tests after the biopsy because nthe biopsy irritates the prostate slightly and can spike the PSA as a result. The next course ofmaction will depend on the results of your biopsy. Keep in mimd, the nodule may or may not be cancer, only examination of cells umder a microscope can determine whether it is or isn't cancer. If it is cancer, thw pathologist will assign a score to the cancer, called the Gleason Score. What this is, it is an evauluationof how abnormal rhe cells look under the microscope. There are two main components to the gleason score, and they are the primary pattern, and the second dary pattern. Primary pattern is the majority of the celluar make up, and the secondary is the pattern that composes thelesser amount of gleason grade. There is also sometimes a tertiaty pattern, which ia typicallyna higher grade than the mainntwo patterns, of it is indeed present. The g eason score ranges from 2-10 and is prpduced bybthe sums of the two biggest patterns. Lowest is gleason pattern 1 amd highest, and most aggressive is gleason pattern 5. So for example, if the primary pattern is 3 and the secondary pattern is 4, then you get a gleason score of 3+4=7, making it a Gleason 7 cancer. Of note is that in today's practice, gleason scores 5 and less are rarely used, as they are considered very mild, so the lowest score a man can get in terms of his camcer's aggressiveness is Gleason 6, 3+3=6. This is a very slpw growing cancer, and , ay not ever even tjreaten a man's life depending on their age. Gleason 7 is somewhat tricky, as it depemds on which os the primarybcomponent, amd which pattern is tje secondary component. The 3+4 bariant of Gleason 7 disease is less aggressive than the 4+3 variant. Gleason scores 8-10 are considered high grade, aggressive cancers, and require more extensove, and earlier treatment. Foetunqtely, gleason 6 is by far the mpst common form of tje disease, and is easily treated, amd very rarely, if at all spreads putside of the prostate. Men who have this lpw grade camcer jave likely had it for many years before it was diagnosed. Treatment tions depend on a person's age, overall health, Gleason score, PSA level, and whwther or not it is suspected to have penwtrated the proatate. Found early enough, basically all tions are available, including the tion of monitoring PSA , Digital rectal exams, and biopsies, this is called active surveillance. Men who choose active surveillance sont get treated right away, they simply monitor the status of the cancer through tje aforemwntioned, PSA tests, biopsy, and digital rectal exam. If these tests do show a change in the cancer, show it growing larger or becoming more aggreasive, then these men initiate treatment. Treatment for prostate cancer includes the following options: surgery, which os commonly performed with a robot now, instead of the traditional open, large incision operation. Radiation therapy: external beam radiation therapy, o4 brachytherapy, which is the implantayion of small, radioactive seeds placed in the prostate, these don't emit enough radiation to harm you, but do emit enough to successfully treat the cancer. Hormone therapy: this includes agents that block the reception of testosterone in prostate cancer. This is not curative, but cam be used with rafiation to male the tumor mpre susceptible to radiation.. At your ypung age, if it is determined you have prostate cancer, and it is not of a high grade, and appears contained to the prostate, surgery would likely be recommended foe you, given that in a healthy man with no signifocant existing diseases like heart disease, and life expectancy of at least 10 more years, and id say at your age, youd more than exceed that 10 year life expectancy. Of course if you do not like the idea of surgery, you can go with the other options as well. Since itnis very highly likely your life expectancy will far ezceed 10 more years, active survei lance peobably wont be offered, this is usually reserved for older men(generally 65 and older), and/or those who have existing conditions that may make treatment riskier and benefits outweighed by risks. I apologize for the humongous wall of text, and plethora of spelling and grammar errors, I just wantes to give you some advice and help answer ypur questions. Keep in mind each treatment has its risks and aide effexts, so IF you are diagnosed with cancer, be sure to look at the risk and side effects of each one and then make your decision based on what you are most comfortable with, and what you feel like offers the greatest benefits to you.

      "Content": "Gleason 6 prostate cancer is the \"best\" prostate cancer to have. While the gleason scale does go from 2 to 10, hardly do you ever hear of anything less than gleason 6 being found. Some people might think \"6 out of a scale of10 is kind of high\", but in practice today, gleason 6 is the lowest grade prostate cancer to be found. Hardly, if ever do you hear of men dying from gleason 6 disease. If they have, it is likely in those cases there was a much more aggressive, higher grade cancer present among the G6. That PSA while elevated, is not too bad, and indicates an early stage disease when combined with the gleason score. With PSA that low, and Gleason 6 disease, active surveillance is possible, depending on tne number of cores involved, unless im mistaken, to be considered for AS Gleason score should be G6, PSA under 10, and no more than two cores positive for cancer. As Highlander mentioned, AS is somewhat of a risky thing to do, even if biopsy only shows G6 in 2 cores or less, it is possible for higher grade cancers to be missed because the biopsy only takes a very small portion of tissue to be examimed. Most of the time, an astute pathologist gets it right on the biopsy. However some less practiced pathologists may underestimate the cancer, but the only way to find the true grade, stage, and extent of prostate cancer, is to have the gland removed. The pathologist can sample the entire prostate and seminal vesicles in this case, and it can confirm the biopsy assessment, and the gleason score remains the same, or in up to 20% of cases, post surgical pathology reveals more extensive, higher grade prostate cancer. In rare cases, surgical patholovy may reveal less aggressive disease, but this is the exception and not the general rule. Not uncommonly do hou hear of g6 cancers being upgraded to g7. And g7 is usually 3+4 or 4+3. A 3+4 g7 prostate cancer is less aggressive than 4+3 g7 prostate cancer. Fortunately it sounds like this cancer was detected early and there are many options for treating iit and achieving a good outcome. Radiation is quite effective on g6 disease, as is surgery, hormone therapy is not curative, it is used to slow the progress of prostate cancer, and perhaps can make radiatiom more effective. Youve mentioned hes been on AS for a few years, and you said his recent PSA was 5 and it is gleason 6 cancer. If that hasnt changed and no more than 2 cores are positive, AS can be continued. But perhaps for peace of mind, treatment wouldnt be a bad idea either. Some understandably find it hard to leave cancer in their body, and want it out asap. My dad was one of these. Even though he had 5 cores positive, 3 ocer the recommendation of 2 or less for AS, his urologist did offer him AS, and time to decide on trestment. Dad decided right then when he got his biopay results that he wanted surgery, as he didnf like thr idea of cancer being leff inside , no matter how \"indolent\" it may have seen. Surgery does carry risk, and you can see in my signaturr the complications my dad had as a result of his surgery. And his is one resson why I think men with g6 disease shouldnt rush into treatment, as the side effexts/ complications can be quite significant, whereas they can avoid it altogether by choosing AS and only deciding to treat it, if it shows signs of progression.

      "Content": "Hi Ken, sorry to hear that you too have seen a rise in your post op PSA. Hopefully your case, and my father's will both turn out to be an error in the machine or sampling, hence why they say that the PSA must be elevated on successive tests to make a diagnosis of biochemical recurrence. If I read everything correctly, you had no EPE, negative margins, and negative lymphovascular involvement. Your gleason 7 was fortunately of the less aggressive, 3+4 is much better than 4+3. Also stated were no involvement in the seminal vesicles, that too is a good thing. Not having extraprostatic extension(cancer that escaped the inside of the gland), no lymph involvement, and no seminal vesicle involvement presents a significantly lower chance of a recurrence than a case where any of that was positive. Negative margins is very big too in lessening the chances of recurrence. Let us know what happens on your next test.",

Gleason 6 as Highlander said, virtually doesn't kill anyone. Active surveillance could have been an option pwrhaps, but they usually recommend that for cases with 3 or less positive cores. Which leads us to youre current dilema: how to treat this cancer. As you know, there is no universal be all, end all treatment for prostate cancer patients. Each case, while similar in many ways to other men, is unique in its own way. Some guys a are much younger than the average age of diagnosis (roughly 65), and you at 44 fall into this category. Others may be of advanced age, say over 75 where treatment might not be recommended treatment due to life expectancy. Also, some men may have significant exidting conditions that may disuade againsr certain treatments. For those who do have treatment, there are many cancer specific factors thst you can use to decide ahat is best for YOU, based on your preferences, and desires to avoid side effects and risks of a certain treatment modality. At 44 years old, and with your low gleason score, im pretty sure your dr has recommended surgery, as they are naturally biased toward their specialty. But you also got to take into account your preferences, what you wish to do, and what you think gives you the bedt chsnce of successful trestment while minimalizing side effects and complications. Surgery and radiation therspy have similar success rates in treating organ confined disease. Surgery runs the risk of infection, stroke, heart attack, blood clots (my dad duffered these). Radistion side effects are generally more delayed and has its own unique side effe ts and complications. And the cyberknife radiation slunds promiding, as it is supposed to target specifically the tumor area (or areas. Prostate cancer is often multifocal), and spare healthy tissue from the ill effects of radiation. You mention that you have spoken with a surgeon who hasdone thousands of open prostatectomies as you said. Experience is VERY important in choosing a physician to treat you, no matter what modality you go with. This surgeon having done thousands of them epuld be thd kind of surgeon to go to if you do choose surgery. Hes well past the learning curve, and at having done so many of them, hes very proficient at it. A surgeon like that invreases suvcess rstes dramatically, and preservation of continence and sexual function kd much greater with a well versed surheon like that, than it would be from one who's only done a couple hundred. With Gleason 6, time is on your side, youve got plenty of time to make a decision. Assess the pros and cons of each treatment modality, and choose one that you feel best suits your goals, and kffers you the least risk of unwanted side effects.

      "Content": "Heal as much as you can and get ready for the radiation. It was a high grade, aggressive prostate cancer, so having the operation done now was definitely prudent. Glad you got a doctor that is staying on top of the ball. With such a high Gleason score, I'm wondering if they will order imaging studies and bone scans-- normal protocol for high Gleason score cancers. The fact there was some margin involvement is not surprising, given the Gleason score, but at least there was no SVI and no angiolymphatic involvement, that's a favorable prognosticators. Radiation as soon as you are healed enough to tolerate It is a must. Sooner you can initiate that, the better off you'll be. I think you probably got to it in time going by the clear CT and bone scans, and no evidence of node involvement. Had you waited around, it might have been considerably worse.",

      "Content": "As many of you know, my dad suffered bilateral DVT and bilateral massive PE. This was a risk of any surgery, and in gwnwral, the longer your under sedation, the higher your risk. Noone IA to blame as it is just an inherent risk of surgwry. Was 63 at the time now 65, for a long time he couldn't so a lot of stuff he used roo because of the damage done by the PEs. Now however, hes at least 95% back to where he was prior to the operation. He's gained a lot of strength and endurance back over the last several months. He got his CDL license reinstated and is intending on at leat coming partially out of retiremwmt, and is job hunting now. He is also back to doing yard work and even trimming and cutting bushes, which can be quite taxing at times. It is great to see this, it was hard watching him being down and out and not really himself. We had gotten worried the PEs had done extensive permanent damage. But after reading stories of other pe zurvivors, it takes a lot of time to fully recover from such a devastating medical crisis. He can be quite ornery at times, but I am so very thankful he's here and is doing a lot better. I'd rather see him ornery than a she'll of his formerself. PSA continues to be zero, or undetectable 2+ years post op, so things look great in regards to the PCA too. He has another psa test in december, and while we are quite aware a recurrence is possible, we don't dwell on that. We believe and continue to expect more zeros in the future. He's now on two x per year tests instead of theach every 3-4 months that he was 8nitially, so the surgeon is quite happy as well. Looking forward to more zeroes, and they said since the PEs were provoked (ie resulting from surgery or trauma) they don't really forsee a recurrence of the blood clots.",

      "Content": "Heal as much as you can and get ready for the radiation. It was a high grade, aggressive prostate cancer, so having the operation done now was definitely prudent. Glad you got a doctor that is staying on top of the ball. With such a high Gleason score, I'm wondering if they will order imaging studies and bone scans-- normal protocol for high Gleason score cancers. The fact there was some margin involvement is not surprising, given the Gleason score, but at least there was no SVI and no angiolymphatic involvement, that's a favorable prognosticators. Radiation as soon as you are healed enough to tolerate It is a must. Sooner you can initiate that, the better off you'll be. I think you probably got to it in time going by the clear CT and bone scans, and no evidence of node involvement. Had you waited around, it might have been considerably worse.",

      "Content": "Hi Ken, sorry to hear that you too have seen a rise in your post op PSA. Hopefully your case, and my father's will both turn out to be an error in the machine or sampling, hence why they say that the PSA must be elevated on successive tests to make a diagnosis of biochemical recurrence. If I read everything correctly, you had no EPE, negative margins, and negative lymphovascular involvement. Your gleason 7 was fortunately of the less aggressive, 3+4 is much better than 4+3. Also stated were no involvement in the seminal vesicles, that too is a good thing. Not having extraprostatic extension(cancer that escaped the inside of the gland), no lymph involvement, and no seminal vesicle involvement presents a significantly lower chance of a recurrence than a case where any of that was positive. Negative margins is very big too in lessening the chances of recurrence. Let us know what happens on your next test.",

At this point, anti biotics might bring the PSA down a bit if there is infection present in the prostate, but it will have no affect on the cancer like highlander said. Your signature shows he was diagnosed with Gleason 6 cancer and no lumps, bumps, or firmness was not found on the DRE, this is good. However, the PSA increasing in that amount of time and reaching what it is, is concerning. A PSA over 10 could perhaps be suggestive of higher grade, more aggressive cancer that the biopsy may have missed. A prostate biopsy only samples a very tiny potion of tissue and commonly(up to 30-40% of cases) misses higher grade disease. It might be suggested to get a second biopsy some. A saturation biopsy where much more than the typical 12 core biopsy is taken. This could find hidden disease the standard biopsy missed. If evidence continues to indicate it is organ confined, surgery would be the best course of treatment. With this, you would know the true nature of the disease, whereas with radiation, you are going on the biopsy report, which as mwntioned, can be uncertain. With that PSA level, it would be a good idea to get on it sooner than later, before that treatment/cure window may close. Best wishes to you and your husband.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by mom2two my dad had his bone scan last week Thursday and we haven't heard anything yet. Dr. said he would not call us for negative results only if something showed up.....he does have a follow-up on the 15th of september but it's so hard to wait. Tech told us the result would get back to the dr in about 3 business days so sometime this week....I've never wanted the phone to not ring so badly.....I keep telling myself that if the CT scan was negative the odds are the bone scan will be too.....sorry to keep hashing out the same concerns....but I feel safe posting here becaue I know I'll get good advice and that you all really understand.... Definitely understand your concern there, I too would tend to think that the more imaging modalities turning up negative, the less likely it would be for something to turn up afterward. The CT cant see prostate cancer inside the prostate, according to my dad's surgeon, but it can perhaps find suspicious areas outside of the gland. And if so further imaging studies such as a bone scan can be more specific. But I believe youll be fine, even though you do have a rather high gleason score, the cancer can still be eradicated. The no evidence of extracapsular extension is favorable for you as well as the lack of seminal vesicle involvement and no evidence of lymph node involvement, these all points towards a cancer, that while is qn aggressive form, it is still confined to the prostate.",

      "Content": "PSA of 28 is conderning, particularly with a normal sized gland. Your previous biopsies as you mentioned, have yet to find anything. Your DRE was normal, which is certainly good, at least it isntnblatantly obvious cancer qccording to that. But with a PSA that high, one must be suspicious, even with the previous biopsies turning up negative. The saturation biopsy should be able to find cancer, if it is indeed present. It will sample portions of the proatate that are typically not checked with a standard 12 core biopsy. If you do turn out to have cancer, you may be looking at a two pronged treatment since that psa is so high. If it appears to be within the prostate, you could have surgery(if you so choose), and since the PSA is so high, radiation may be recommended afterward to eliminate any possible stragglers left behind. Or perhaps you could have hormone therapy combined with radiation therapy, hormone therapy in this instance would be used to make the cancer more sensitive to radiation, therefore jncreasing the liklihood of success. Of course all of this depends on your preferences, your overall state of health, gleason grade, and if the saturation biopsy even finds cancer. But with that PSA so high on a normal size glad, I'd be rather suspicious there may be cancer lurking in there. Until you reach that road(again, if cancer is even found), do your homework, research prostate cancer and the side effects of it and its treatments, arm yourself with as much knowledge as possible and go from there. And above all, this still isn't a time for panic, as cancer producing that high of psa, again provided it is found in your prostate, it can still be cured and you can still enjoy many years of good health.",

      "Content": "Hate to hear that you have some G8 disease, or any for that matter. With you having some G8 cancer, I would suspect the doctor will probably order bone scans and biopsy some of the nearby lymphnodes to check for possible spread to bones and nearby lymph nodes. Then those results will help guide you as to what treatment(s) you can get. If it is all within the prostate, you can have surgery to rempve the prostate, followed by radiation or hormone therapy, dependjng on you and your doctor's preferences. If it has started to break through the prostate gland, surgery might still be possible so long as it does not invade nearby tissues and structures such as then seminal vesicles. If it is invading nearby structures and possibly into local lymph nodes, you would not be a candidate for surgery, and thus radiation wojld be recommended, along with perhaps hormone therapy during and/or after radiation. Main thing is to get to it before it starts spreading, especially to distant parts of the body. Chemotherapy is generally only used for incurable disease and palliative purposes only. Hope you have a good report and get started on tackling this thing.",

      "Content": "I am so sorry to hear such a serious diagnosis. Gleason 8 and 9 are way on up there in terms of aggressiveness. As such, it is not surprising there is bone involvement and a sky high PSA level. However, advanced prostate cancers typically will respond to aggressive treatment, at least for a while. Combination therapies such as radiation and hormone therapy can significantly reduce tumor burden, and delay progression and further metastasis. Even with serious casesvlike that, men have been known to live sevdral years following their diagnosis. At this time surgery is not an option, so the first step is to meet a medical oncologist specializing in advanced prostate cancer, and a good radiation oncologist. I've heard of men with similar stats living 8+ years. While it cannot be cured, it can be controlled and managed. With prompt and aggressive treatment, your husband can live many more years, progression free and with a good quality of life. And who knows what breakthroughs may be around the corner.",

And if the tumor is indeed confined to the gland, then yes, removal of the gland would be considered a cure. With you being rather young for a man with prostate cancer, your recovery from any incontinence issues should be quick, provided of course you do have surgery. If one had to have cancer and was able to pick what grade, you definitely got the best one. Not to be a downer, but in 20-30% of cases in surgical specimens, the Gleason score is upgraded a bit, because sometimes higher grade cancer is found than what the biopsy found. Usually a Gleason 6 that is upgraded, is upgraded to a 7, haven't really heard of many G6 cancers being upgraded to 8 or higher grades.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by FredM I'm new here and don't know much about prostate cancer. Can you guys let me know if this is a reasonable course of action, or should I be asking more questions or doing something different? Here's my situation: 43 years old, good health, no symptoms, no history of prostate cancer in relatives, but I don't have many relatives, just my dad and two brothers, no uncles or cousins. Primary care doc found a possible nodule on right lobe of prostate during DRE as part of annual physical. Because of this he ordered a PSA and referred me to a urologist. PSA came back at 0.4 Urologist did DRE and said prostate was not enlarged but agreed with PCP that there was a hard area. He believes it's unlikely to be cancer, but wants to do a rectal biopsy, guided by ultrasound. From what I gather, they use local anesthetic on the biopsy using a needle. He gave me a script for 3 days of Levaquin 500mg starting day before biopsy and they will give me a shot with another antibiotic the day of. Also wants me to do an enema before the biopsy. This is all overwhelming to me and seems like a pretty involved procedure. Does doing a biopsy in my situation seem reasonable or is there another course of action that would be better and less invasive? Should I be asking more questions? Please give me any advice you have. Thank you. Hello there, with there being a nodule felt on the rectal exam, biopsy is definitely advised and warranted. The antibiotics are standardbprocedure to prevent infection after the biopsy. You will be under local anesthesia for the procedure, and as such, you shouldn't endure much pain, if any at all. The standardnprostate biopsy is usually 12 samples around the most comm8n areas in the prostate that cancer may develop. You may also be given something like a valium prior to the procedure to help you relax, at least thats what they did with my dad anyway. And I would suspect your doctor may have your PSA re tested prior to the biopsy. They don't like to do psa tests after the biopsy because nthe biopsy irritates the prostate slightly and can spike the PSA as a result. The next course ofmaction will depend on the results of your biopsy. Keep in mimd, the nodule may or may not be cancer, only examination of cells umder a microscope can determine whether it is or isn't cancer. If it is cancer, thw pathologist will assign a score to the cancer, called the Gleason Score. What this is, it is an evauluationof how abnormal rhe cells look under the microscope. There are two main components to the gleason score, and they are the primary pattern, and the second dary pattern. Primary pattern is the majority of the celluar make up, and the secondary is the pattern that composes thelesser amount of gleason grade. There is also sometimes a tertiaty pattern, which ia typicallyna higher grade than the mainntwo patterns, of it is indeed present. The g eason score ranges from 2-10 and is prpduced bybthe sums of the two biggest patterns. Lowest is gleason pattern 1 amd highest, and most aggressive is gleason pattern 5. So for example, if the primary pattern is 3 and the secondary pattern is 4, then you get a gleason score of 3+4=7, making it a Gleason 7 cancer. Of note is that in today's practice, gleason scores 5 and less are rarely used, as they are considered very mild, so the lowest score a man can get in terms of his camcer's aggressiveness is Gleason 6, 3+3=6. This is a very slpw growing cancer, and , ay not ever even tjreaten a man's life depending on their age. Gleason 7 is somewhat tricky, as it depemds on which os the primarybcomponent, amd which pattern is tje secondary component. The 3+4 bariant of Gleason 7 disease is less aggressive than the 4+3 variant. Gleason scores 8-10 are considered high grade, aggressive cancers, and require more extensove, and earlier treatment. Foetunqtely, gleason 6 is by far the mpst common form of tje disease, and is easily treated, amd very rarely, if at all spreads putside of the prostate. Men who have this lpw grade camcer jave likely had it for many years before it was diagnosed. Treatment tions depend on a person's age, overall health, Gleason score, PSA level, and whwther or not it is suspected to have penwtrated the proatate. Found early enough, basically all tions are available, including the tion of monitoring PSA , Digital rectal exams, and biopsies, this is called active surveillance. Men who choose active surveillance sont get treated right away, they simply monitor the status of the cancer through tje aforemwntioned, PSA tests, biopsy, and digital rectal exam. If these tests do show a change in the cancer, show it growing larger or becoming more aggreasive, then these men initiate treatment. Treatment for prostate cancer includes the following options: surgery, which os commonly performed with a robot now, instead of the traditional open, large incision operation. Radiation therapy: external beam radiation therapy, o4 brachytherapy, which is the implantayion of small, radioactive seeds placed in the prostate, these don't emit enough radiation to harm you, but do emit enough to successfully treat the cancer. Hormone therapy: this includes agents that block the reception of testosterone in prostate cancer. This is not curative, but cam be used with rafiation to male the tumor mpre susceptible to radiation.. At your ypung age, if it is determined you have prostate cancer, and it is not of a high grade, and appears contained to the prostate, surgery would likely be recommended foe you, given that in a healthy man with no signifocant existing diseases like heart disease, and life expectancy of at least 10 more years, and id say at your age, youd more than exceed that 10 year life expectancy. Of course if you do not like the idea of surgery, you can go with the other options as well. Since itnis very highly likely your life expectancy will far ezceed 10 more years, active survei lance peobably wont be offered, this is usually reserved for older men(generally 65 and older), and/or those who have existing conditions that may make treatment riskier and benefits outweighed by risks. I apologize for the humongous wall of text, and plethora of spelling and grammar errors, I just wantes to give you some advice and help answer ypur questions. Keep in mind each treatment has its risks and aide effexts, so IF you are diagnosed with cancer, be sure to look at the risk and side effects of each one and then make your decision based on what you are most comfortable with, and what you feel like offers the greatest benefits to you.

      "Content": "Originally Posted by FredM I'm new here and don't know much about prostate cancer. Can you guys let me know if this is a reasonable course of action, or should I be asking more questions or doing something different? Here's my situation: 43 years old, good health, no symptoms, no history of prostate cancer in relatives, but I don't have many relatives, just my dad and two brothers, no uncles or cousins. Primary care doc found a possible nodule on right lobe of prostate during DRE as part of annual physical. Because of this he ordered a PSA and referred me to a urologist. PSA came back at 0.4 Urologist did DRE and said prostate was not enlarged but agreed with PCP that there was a hard area. He believes it's unlikely to be cancer, but wants to do a rectal biopsy, guided by ultrasound. From what I gather, they use local anesthetic on the biopsy using a needle. He gave me a script for 3 days of Levaquin 500mg starting day before biopsy and they will give me a shot with another antibiotic the day of. Also wants me to do an enema before the biopsy. This is all overwhelming to me and seems like a pretty involved procedure. Does doing a biopsy in my situation seem reasonable or is there another course of action that would be better and less invasive? Should I be asking more questions? Please give me any advice you have. Thank you. Hello there, with there being a nodule felt on the rectal exam, biopsy is definitely advised and warranted. The antibiotics are standardbprocedure to prevent infection after the biopsy. You will be under local anesthesia for the procedure, and as such, you shouldn't endure much pain, if any at all. The standardnprostate biopsy is usually 12 samples around the most comm8n areas in the prostate that cancer may develop. You may also be given something like a valium prior to the procedure to help you relax, at least thats what they did with my dad anyway. And I would suspect your doctor may have your PSA re tested prior to the biopsy. They don't like to do psa tests after the biopsy because nthe biopsy irritates the prostate slightly and can spike the PSA as a result. The next course ofmaction will depend on the results of your biopsy. Keep in mimd, the nodule may or may not be cancer, only examination of cells umder a microscope can determine whether it is or isn't cancer. If it is cancer, thw pathologist will assign a score to the cancer, called the Gleason Score. What this is, it is an evauluationof how abnormal rhe cells look under the microscope. There are two main components to the gleason score, and they are the primary pattern, and the second dary pattern. Primary pattern is the majority of the celluar make up, and the secondary is the pattern that composes thelesser amount of gleason grade. There is also sometimes a tertiaty pattern, which ia typicallyna higher grade than the mainntwo patterns, of it is indeed present. The g eason score ranges from 2-10 and is prpduced bybthe sums of the two biggest patterns. Lowest is gleason pattern 1 amd highest, and most aggressive is gleason pattern 5. So for example, if the primary pattern is 3 and the secondary pattern is 4, then you get a gleason score of 3+4=7, making it a Gleason 7 cancer. Of note is that in today's practice, gleason scores 5 and less are rarely used, as they are considered very mild, so the lowest score a man can get in terms of his camcer's aggressiveness is Gleason 6, 3+3=6. This is a very slpw growing cancer, and , ay not ever even tjreaten a man's life depending on their age. Gleason 7 is somewhat tricky, as it depemds on which os the primarybcomponent, amd which pattern is tje secondary component. The 3+4 bariant of Gleason 7 disease is less aggressive than the 4+3 variant. Gleason scores 8-10 are considered high grade, aggressive cancers, and require more extensove, and earlier treatment. Foetunqtely, gleason 6 is by far the mpst common form of tje disease, and is easily treated, amd very rarely, if at all spreads putside of the prostate. Men who have this lpw grade camcer jave likely had it for many years before it was diagnosed. Treatment tions depend on a person's age, overall health, Gleason score, PSA level, and whwther or not it is suspected to have penwtrated the proatate. Found early enough, basically all tions are available, including the tion of monitoring PSA , Digital rectal exams, and biopsies, this is called active surveillance. Men who choose active surveillance sont get treated right away, they simply monitor the status of the cancer through tje aforemwntioned, PSA tests, biopsy, and digital rectal exam. If these tests do show a change in the cancer, show it growing larger or becoming more aggreasive, then these men initiate treatment. Treatment for prostate cancer includes the following options: surgery, which os commonly performed with a robot now, instead of the traditional open, large incision operation. Radiation therapy: external beam radiation therapy, o4 brachytherapy, which is the implantayion of small, radioactive seeds placed in the prostate, these don't emit enough radiation to harm you, but do emit enough to successfully treat the cancer. Hormone therapy: this includes agents that block the reception of testosterone in prostate cancer. This is not curative, but cam be used with rafiation to male the tumor mpre susceptible to radiation.. At your ypung age, if it is determined you have prostate cancer, and it is not of a high grade, and appears contained to the prostate, surgery would likely be recommended foe you, given that in a healthy man with no signifocant existing diseases like heart disease, and life expectancy of at least 10 more years, and id say at your age, youd more than exceed that 10 year life expectancy. Of course if you do not like the idea of surgery, you can go with the other options as well. Since itnis very highly likely your life expectancy will far ezceed 10 more years, active survei lance peobably wont be offered, this is usually reserved for older men(generally 65 and older), and/or those who have existing conditions that may make treatment riskier and benefits outweighed by risks. I apologize for the humongous wall of text, and plethora of spelling and grammar errors, I just wantes to give you some advice and help answer ypur questions. Keep in mind each treatment has its risks and aide effexts, so IF you are diagnosed with cancer, be sure to look at the risk and side effects of each one and then make your decision based on what you are most comfortable with, and what you feel like offers the greatest benefits to you. Best regards.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by mikesimm I spoke with my RO, Dr. Shah, today. His reply to my note (see above) is that he is ok with waiting until my PSA ticks up to 0.03 to start RT treatments, whether that is 6 months from now or 6 years. He says it's the PSA that matters, not the elapsed time since surgery. He also said there is a \"few percentage points\" side effects advantage to Proton therapy treatment as opposed to IMRT due to less \"scattering\", but he is ok with either. So for now, I will get another PSA about Sept. 1, and every three months thereafter for a while, and if it goes to 0.03, I'll be getting zapped pronto, most likely on Proton as every little advantage helps! Mike in Kerrville Excellent idea to be ready to tackle it when/if the PSA should reach 0.03 again. I believe in that case getting it done then would be most beneficial to you, and would quite likely be a successful treatment result. I certainly like it better than waiting til say like 0.2 like many physicans like to do. And of course if it does not reach that 0.03 threshold, then no action would be neccessary at the time, and you would get to avoid those side effects. I agree with the doctor that PSA is more important than time that has passed by since surgery. PSA is far more of accurate assessment of what prostate cancer does, and if it has returned after treatment. Hopefully it wont reach 0.03 and you wont have to begin therapy for it, but if it does come to that, I think you would do well.",

Given your post surgical stats, I am inclined your most recent test is also a blip. Don't freak out. Just follow your doctor's instructions and take it from there. Id be willing to place money it's still undetectable.",

The only time he now mentions it is a day or two before the next test, other than that, it's always on the back burner for him(though certainly not OUTRIGHT forgotten). Your thoughts about your PSA and the cancer will ebb as well, as time goes along.

      "Content": "Considering they still kept it as a pT2c even with the 2 mm margin involvement at the bladder neck, it sounds like they believe no additional treatment will be needed. And from what I've cone to understand, it's not uncommon to have very small foci of cancer at the bladder neck following prostatectomy. If all is true about Gleason 3, then that 2mm should not cause problems on the future. If it had been pattern 4 at the positive margin, it may have been a different story. Key will be the post op psa in a few weeks, that should tell the tale. But from what I see, I think he will be just fine. He tolerated the surgery well, and was up and about rather quickly and able to walk the halls not long at all after the surgery. Very good sign. Be sure to tell us that post op psa here on a few weeks",

      "Content": "Hi, take a deep breath, you are getting a bit ahead of yourself. A 2.8 increase in one year on your PSA is certainly warranting of investigation and work up by a urologist, but by no means is it an indicator of \"Fatal prostate cancer\". There are other things that can cause a spike in PSA like that, prostate enlargement(BPH), and inflammation(prostatitis) of the gland can do that, especially inflammation. And of course, prostate cancer should always be considered a possibility, but there should not be any conclusions drawn. Good rule of thumb that I have seen doctors use is that \"You don't have cancer until you are formally diagnosed\". While there may be some fallicies with that line of thinking, it is a good thing to take into consideration with prostate cancer, and it can help curb unneccessary worrying and anxiety. IF, and that is a BIG if-- your doctor suspects the possibility of prostate cancer, he or she may recommend a repeat biopsy just for confirmation, and if that too reads elevated, then he or she will likely decide to do further work up, such as a DRE and a biopsy. If they decide on doing a DRE, keep in mind that it needs to be done AFTER any PSA test, as that can cause a false high reading, a DRE stimulates the prostate, and causes it to secrete more PSA into the blood stream. And then if based on the PSA and DRE, your doctor can determine your need for a biopsy, most of which are the standard 12 core biopsies, where they take 12 samples from various areas of the prostate, then they send those samples to pathology for determination of if there is malignancy present or not. A biopsy is the way to go in determining whether or not someone has prostate cancer, as it gives you a more direct look at the behavior of the cells in the gland-- a PSA test cant differentiate between cancer, and prostate enlargement or prostatitis. The biopsy is generally pretty safe with no complications, though some people have had a rough time with it. One of the complications that comes from a prostate biopsy is an infection, but this is relatively uncommon now, as the ordering physician will give you some anti biotics to take before and after the biopsy in order to cut down the risk of an infection following the procedure. With a standard prostate biopsy, you will be given a local anasthetic, you wont be put to sleep unless you request to, and they will likely prescribe you one or two anti anxiety pills to take prior in order to help you relax. It doesn't hurt, you might feel a bit of pressure and you might feel a tug when the doctor pulls the samples out, but it really is not a painful procedure. After that is done, go home and relax, and when you are ready, go back to doing your usual activities and await the appointment to discuss the results of the biopsy, which should be about a week afterward, 10 days at most. And at that time, you can decide what to do if anything needs to be done, based off the results.",

      "Content": "Hello, my name is Brandon and my father was diagnosed with prostate cancer this year after a blood test on January 25 revealed his PSA was 4.2 . He was then referred to a urologist whom did a DRE and then a biopsy on March 8th after that. Results were discussed March 19th, and the doctor said unfortunately the biopsy revealed 5 out of 12 cores positive for cancer. Gleason grade was 3+3 for a gleason score of 6, and based on these findings and normal DRE, the urologist said this was clinical stage 1 PCa. He gave dad several options in which to approach this cancer: Surgery, external beam radiation, brachytherapy, hormone therapy, and active surveillance. Dad asked what the doctor thought offered the best chance of long term survival, and the doctor said surgery offered the best chance. So dad decided for that, even though the doc said he could take a couple weeks to decide. Surgery was done April 23 and afterward the doc came out and said it appeared he got all the cancer and there was no kbvious signs of cancer outside of the prostate. He stayed overnight and went home early the following afternoon. He had a MAJOR, life threatening complication 15 days later that I will elaborate on at a later time. Got the surgical pathology report back and it has something in it that I dont like. I will provide the main details here. Clinical history: malignant neoplasm of prostate Microscopic diagnosis: Prostate, radical robotic prostatectomy; adenocarcinoma, gleason 3+3=6, Focal minimal equivocal involvement of margin(block , pt2c pnx mx, see cancer checklist and comment. Comment: The area of questionable margin involvement in block 8 consists of ink at a somewhat distorted glandular structure immediately adjacent to an area exhibiting unequivocal perineural invasion. The area in question is at the apex of an instrumentation defect into the prostate tissue with discontinuous prostate tissue external to this area of equivocal involvement. In my judgement this most likely represents focal minimal margin involvement. It is possible, however, that others may disagree with this assessment. CAP APPROVED CANCER CASE SUMMARY CHECKLIST Procedure: Radical robotic prostectomy on 63 y/o patient Prostate Size: 56 grams Size: 4.5 x 4.5 cm Lymphnode sampling: No lymphnodes present Histologic type: Adenocarcinoma Histologic grade: Primary pattern Gleason 3 Secondary pattern gleason 3 Total gleason score: Gleason 6 Tumor quantitation: approximately 10% of prostate involved by tumor. Some extending to other lobe Extraprostatic extension: Not identified Seminal Vesicle invasion: not identified Margins: Equivocal minimal involvement(block Lymph-vascular invasion: present(perineural) Pathologic staging: pT2c pNX pMX A fairly decent report except for the margin mentioned. Could this mean some cancer remains/was missed? It worries me with the positive margin it may come back. I have already lost my mom to stage 4 base of tonfue squamous cell carcinoma 5 years ago. Losing dad would be devasting. I will explain his life threatening complication(dvt and bilateral pulmonary embolism as a result of the surgery) later, but my hands are cramping and my eyes are strained from typing on and focusing on this tablet screen.",

      "Content": "Thanks again and im guessing with the stage being t2 nx mx, the doctor felt no need to assess for lymphnode and distant metastasis based on his psa and gleason score. He is now almost 7 months out from the bilateral pulmonary embolism that caused him to collapse in the yard. When I got to him, I thought he was gone because his eyes were rolled to the back of his head. It was determined the clots developed from the surgery and he was put on xarelto to dissolve as much of them as possible. He is now off of that and hopefully wint have another vte event. He still hasnt gotten his strength back, but at least he is still here. He does unfortunately have a hernia at one of the incision sites that he is going to address this month. Gotta be sure to tell that doc about his clots from the PCa surgery.",

      "Content": "Hello all. I went in for bloodwork on myself yesterday. And though I'm uninsured, my office has a program going where if you are in good standing with them-- no overdue payments, unpaid copays, etc, you can get your lab work done with a wide range of assays-- BMP, renal function, liver function, glucose, electrolyte, CBC, etc, and get all that done for $16 bucks!!! Before, it was ~$270 for a similar set of assays. Anyway on to the relevant point. Given that my dad had prostate cancer, my physician went ahead and included PSA as part of the assays to be done, not only to screen as per family history, but to establish a baseline down the road. I got my results today, and he said my PSA was 0.53 ng/mL, which he said is excellent. His lab uses 2.5 as the cutoff threshold for what would constitute an elevated PSA, so mine fell very well within normal parameters. Given my dad's history, I will be getting PSA screens every 5 years when I go in for general blood work then(I will of course get all my regular assays done once a year as I've been doing for a while now. Now, I know it may seem silly for a 31 year old to get a PSA test done, but considering I was already there, and that there is nothing else special required to do it, and it being super cheap through their good standing program, I figure why not? It was of no inconvenience to me, and it sets a baseline for the future. Of course I know with age at some point, the gland will begin to enlarge, and that itself will increase PSA to a limited degree, but given my dad's history, I think getting an early start on watching for it is a good idea. I feel like this way I can stay a step ahead of the curve. FWIW: All other assays, including glucose and total cholesterol were very good. HDL could use a bit of an increase, but dr was happy since it was actually up from the prior assay. I feel like by noting what went on with my dad's bout with PC, and reading the stuff from here and other reputable sources, I will be more than prepared should the day(heaven forbid) come that I get diagnosed with prostate cancer.",

Does have polyneuropathy in his feet now-- Dr said quite likely from years and years of standing on a concrete floor at work-- he's an ironworker.Been pulling 64 hour weeks up till the past two weeks or so. Just got his DOT physical to keep his CDL, and he passed it with flying colors too. Looking at him now, you would never have known he had cancer or suffered pulmonary embolism from surgery.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by hollienbilly My name is Hollie and my husband (45) was diagnosed with prostate cancer on 1/14/14. He has no signs or symptoms of the cancer. They started him on hormone therapy and after 6 weeks his psa fell to 139 and then after another 6 weeks it is down to 39. I am very glad to see the numbers drop but does this mean they will go back up faster as well and the cells become resistant? I have so many questions just not sure where to start?? Hello Hollie, I must say that is an astronomically high PSA level, I dont want to be a downer or negative perspn, but that almost certainly signifies advanced proatate cancer. But he has at least had a drastic response based on the hufe drop in his PSA. Unfortunately, these kind of cancers do become resistant to hormone therapy over time, but don't give up. Even after the pca becomes hormone resistant, there is still the option of immunotherapy. Perhaps now the moat well known form of immunotherapy for advanced prostate cancer is Provenge. It will not cure the cancer, but it can slow the progression of it and perhaps extend patients' lifespans. What they do with Provenge is they take immune cells from a patient's body, they then send them off to a lab, where they make the Provenge formula. Basically this \"Programs\" the patient's immune system to attack the cancer cells more effectively, and slow tje growth of the cancer. Again this will not cure the cancer, but it can perhaps slow it down, provide symptom reloef, and prolong life.",

      "Content": "Thanks all my dad is now 65, was 63 at the time of the operation. Surgeon did give him the option of having a pelvic sling implanted, but dad decided it wasn't worth risking another episode of blood clots and another potential surgical hernia. He's come to to conclusion that he can accept the incontinence if it means the cancer is gone. He has had some regrets about choosing surgery over brachytherapy, but that's a moot point now, and plus with perineural invasion present, I think it was still a wise idea to have it removed. Seems that perineural invasion can turn an otherwise low risk cancer, such as Gleason 6, into a higher risk because of the proximimitg of those nerves to the capsule of the prostate. It's said that cancer cells can use those perineural spaces as a pathway to escape the gland.",

      "Content": "Hi there, I hate to see such a high level of psa. Even in an extremely enlarged gland likely would not secrete that much PSA into the blood stream, but strange things happen. A general of thumb I've hears Dr's say is that \"you don't have cancer until or unless you are confirmed as suche. But that DEFINITELY needs to be looked at, it is highly suspicious for PCa, and a biopsy needs to be done. And I would say imaging tests such as a bone scan, MRI, etc need to be done just on the safe side. My suspicion with such a high psa is that there may very well be cancer lying in there, and it's likely to be of a more aggressive type, such as 4+3=7 or gleason 8. But even then, that NY NO means would make eradication impossible. We need more information to get an idea of where he stands, and we can take it together. Remember, if it, and I mean IF, it does turn out to be cancer, know that you are not alone, and we will be more than happy to provide suport and advice. We are all in this thing together.",

      "Content": "Hello everyone, long time no see, haven't been here in a while; but first let me get to the topic. April 23rd marked the 2 year anniversary of my dad's prostate surgery. He had his last PSA test in May, and once again, it read undetectable so looks like the focal minimally involved margin was of no significance. Still free of PCa. Unfortunately, he is permanently I continent to a degree now. His continence level is about 75% percent and he goes through two diapers a day. But al things considered, that's a small price that's well worth to. Pay to be rid of the cancer. I'm sorry I've not been here in a long time, I've not felt well for several months. Been having issues with my heart rate sky rocketing upon standing leaving me feeling dizzy and tired at times, so I haven't had the energy to do much. It's not as bad as it was but it's still there. At the worst it was shooting from 55 bp resting to over 110 to 120 the instant I stood up. Anyway just wanted to let y'all know how dad is doing and wish everyone the best and hope all of y'all continue to see good results as well. And for those new here, sorry to see you're a member of this \"club\", but this is a great place for advice and insight, plus you know you Are not alone. Hope everyone had a great Christmas and new year, and I plan to be on more now. Here's to more \"Zeroes\" and \"undetectables\". The post treatment PSA test I think is about the only test one wants to make a zero on!!",

But he is feeling Nausea after his prostate biopsy (no appetite for meals). I can see that he getting weaker. Is it normal for people who undergoes these treatments, and oral medicines (hormonal therapy)? Probably related more so to the radioactive material used in the nuclear scan than the biopsy, that is my opinion anyway.",

      "Content": "At 71, he is on the borderline in terms of surgery vs radiation. If he doesn't have significant comorbidities such as heart disease, or pulmonry disease such as COPD, surgery should be ok for him. It indeed would be wise to consult with a radiation oncologist prior to the operation as well, given that it is Gleason 8 prostate cancer. As far as the bone scan goes, if it is positive, then the cancer is most likely not curable, but can still be treated quite well for symptom control, and extension of life and ptogression free survival. Here is something important to note. If surgery is chosen first, you still have another \"sword\" with radiation as adjuvant(planned secondary treatment to make the surgery more likeoy to be successful), or as salvage treatment that can still offer cure if surgery fails to rid the cancer in its entirety, provided the \"missed cells\" are still within the region of the prostate(prostate bed where the organ once layed before its removal. If radiation is chosen first, surgery is not likely(but not 100% out of the question) a second option, because radiation creates scar tissue, and that is very difficult for surgeons to operate through. Even though it is high grade cancer, he has several factors in his favor: no evidence of lymphnode invasion, no extraprostatic extension detected, no perineural invasion noted, only 2 cores positive, and total involvement 10% or less(your dad's being 8% as your signature tells us).Based on these vital statistics, I would say your fathervhas a pretty good chance of cure. With it being a high grade cancer, PSA tests post treatment are likely to be more frequent than that of a person with Gleason 6 cancer, because gleason 8 has a higher chance e of returning, though certainly not guaranteed to do so by any means. Your dad has a lot in his favor, so id say his prognosis is good.",

      "Content": "Hi there, I hate to see such a high level of psa. Even in an extremely enlarged gland likely would not secrete that much PSA into the blood stream, but strange things happen. A general of thumb I've hears Dr's say is that \"you don't have cancer until or unless you are confirmed as suche. But that DEFINITELY needs to be looked at, it is highly suspicious for PCa, and a biopsy needs to be done. And I would say imaging tests such as a bone scan, MRI, etc need to be done just on the safe side. My suspicion with such a high psa is that there may very well be cancer lying in there, and it's likely to be of a more aggressive type, such as 4+3=7 or gleason 8. But even then, that NY NO means would make eradication impossible. We need more information to get an idea of where he stands, and we can take it together. Remember, if it, and I mean IF, it does turn out to be cancer, know that you are not alone, and we will be more than happy to provide suport and advice. We are all in this thing together.",

Get to walking whenever you can to help encourage blood flow and resuce the risk of blood pooling in your legs. If you don't feel like walking, you can flex your feet up and down for a few minutes several times a day, and/or you can take your feet, raise them a bit and use your ankle to make circular motions with your feet, this can also encourage good blood flow.
