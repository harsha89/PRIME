      "Content": "Since it\u2019s Thanksgiving weekend and I have a lot to be thankful for, I\u2019ll share my story. I\u2019m 56 now, and in reasonably good health. Both my grandfather and father had Prostate Cancer, so I sort of knew it was going to be hard for me to avoid the genetic lottery. However both were diagnosed later in life (Grandfather at 88 (lived to 94!)) and my father at 75. My dad went with the pellet implants, and he passed at 86. Last December (2013), at my annual physical, my PSA was 4.5, nothing felt with DRE, so my physician gave me an antibiotic to eliminate any chance of a prostate infection. PSA didn\u2019t change, so he recommended visiting urologist. Nothing felt by urologist with a DRE, and his PSA test said 4.8. Urologist recommended a biopsy, but I decided to wait a while. At follow up with physician in July, PSA was 4.9. Decided to proceed with biopsy, had it done in late July. Result was 1 core positive for PC, right apex, 15% involved, Gleason 4 + 4. Although as I said earlier, I wasn\u2019t really surprised, it was still a lot to process for me. After discussion with urologist, we both agreed at my age, family history, etc., the best course of action was to have my Prostate removed. My local urologist told me he only did the open prostatectomy. I went and got a 2nd opinion at a much larger Urology clinic about an hour away (state capitol city). Met with a couple doctors that were amazing. Discussed Da Vinci procedure, which they performed. My complication was that I had an umbilical hernia repaired several years ago, with a mesh implant used. Doctors were not concerned about this and also recommended re-reading the biopsy slides at another lab. Re-read of slides came back as Gleason 3 + 4, which was encouraging for me. Made the decision to have Da Vinci surgery, but wanted to wait until November, as I had signed up to walk a half marathon with my family in early November. Doctor prescribed Proscar, and said have fun, see you in November. Fast forward to a few weeks ago. Did the half marathon on Sunday, November 9th, and had my surgery on Tuesday, November 11. Spent 2 days in the hospital, with a little pain, but not anywhere what I had expected. Doctor wanted my new constant companion (catheter) to remain in for 2 weeks, mainly due to some mild issues with scar tissue from hernia surgery which made re-attaching my urethra a little more difficult. Made it thru those 2 weeks uneventfully, but as most of you know, it\u2019s a grind. Finally, this past Wednesday was my day to lose my dance partner, and boy was it a relief to say good-bye! Also got the good news that the final pathology report was Gleason 3 + 3! I\u2019m now doing my Kegels and trying to get control back. I\u2019ve noticed I leak more when I\u2019m tired, and also when getting up from sitting. So far, I\u2019m mostly dry when sleeping in my bed (which is a relief, had to sleep in recliner with my catheter because I just could not get comfortable in bed). I know I\u2019m relatively early in this part of the process and have to be patient, but I\u2019m glad I\u2019m now on the back side of the process. I\u2019m so glad to have found this forum and got a lot of comfort from reading about the experiences and advice of others that have gone through this process. I\u2019m not really a huge forum poster, but will update somewhere down the road. Cheers, Wheelar",

      "Content": "Thanks for all the warm wishes and welcomes. This is a great community and has helped me a lot! Quick question this morning. Is unitary continence a \"straight line\" of improvement or are there good and bad days/nights? 4 days post catheter I've experienced both. Been doing a lot of reading but don't see much on the day to day trials and tribulations. Hope everyone has a great day. Thanks in advance for your input!",

      "Content": "So I\u0092m a little more than 1 week post catheter now. Think I\u0092m making progress. Some random observations: Dr. prescribed antibiotics when my dance partner was removed, and I\u0092ve finished them. I get some mild burning when I urinate, but from what I\u0092ve read it\u0092s nothing to be concerned about and will go away. My guess is all the plumbing is healing but is still raw in spots. Also passing very, very small clots from time to time. Kegels are easy to so when you\u0092re watching TV. My Dr. told me to do 4 reps of 8 per day, and after reading the Mayo instructions, I\u0092ve ended up compromising and doing them twice a day, morning and afternoon. I can almost feel the muscles getting tired when I do them. But I do think they are getting stronger! Sitting down and getting up is pretty much a dry event now. If I\u0092m staying around the house, I can use the same pad all day. Sleeping is also better, but I\u0092m still getting up every 3 hours to pee. It\u0092s like having BPH all over again\u0085..I wear a diaper for now just in case but am considering transition to pads for overnight use soon. My bladder has seemingly shrunk, because even during the day I have no \u0093holding capacity\u0094. Seems like it wants to join the \u0093getting smaller\u0094 club with my penis\u0097although I was never a porn movie candidate before all of this began\u0085. My strength is slowly returning. Other than walking, I really didn\u0092t do much in the 2 weeks my constant companion was with me after the surgery. I\u0092m amazed just how much endurance I\u0092ve lost, but am working on rebuilding it. It is coming back. Heading out of town in mid January so have to be ready. I'm a little apprehensive about the plane flight wearing pads, but I should be better off by then.... It was a little scary venturing back out into public the first time\u0097had visions of leaking all over in Sam\u0092s Club. But no worries in the end, a successful trip and I didn't embarrass myself! My wife has been an absolute godsend thru all of this. I simply could have not made it thru without her. She is amazing and put up with my crabbiness, helped my dry off after that first shower, cooked, cleaned, and basically filled in for me with all my household chores. I'll never be able to thank her enough! All in all, I think I\u0092m well on the road to recovery. Just wanted to share my progress. Thanks to all that participate--we're all now part of a fraternity!",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by Pratoman Thanks Wheelar. Please keep us posted on your progress through this thread. It's helpful to those of us trying to mentally prepare. Where did you have the surgery if I may ask. Did the surgeon give you any assessment after the surgery or did he jus say you need to wait for the pathology? Did you get the final pathology back? (May have missed that if you mentioned it in another thread, if so, sorry) Did you do Kegels or other exercise before the surgey? I've been doing 3 sets of 10-12 per day (some days I forget and do 2 sets.) and I've been walking 3-4 miles a day 5-6 days a week. I'm scheduled at Mt Sinai in NY with dr Tewari January 6th. My surgery was November 11 at Baptist hospital in Little Rock, Arkansas. Surgeon was Dr. Langford. He is awesome. Talked to me after the surgery and said everything looked confined to my prostate. Bostwick had said Gleason was 3+4, but final pathology came back as 3+3, which was the best news I could have possibly asked for. I never did Kegels before surgery, but was doing a lot of walking and in pretty good shape (did a half marathon with my family 3 days before surgery) and I credit that to helping me recover more quickly. I'm still working on endurance but all in all the entire process was FAR less painful and involved than I could have ever imagined. My surgery was 4 weeks ago tomorrow and I really do feel great. Continence is coming back which is the only obstacle I've faced post-surgery, and I went in expecting far worse. Hang in there and once you're on the back side of your surgery hopefully you'll feel similar to how I did. Feel free to ask me any questions, I got a lot of support reading thru this board before I went in (along with the recommended books) and I'm happy to pass along my experiences. Cheers, Wheelar",
