      "Content": "Hi:- I am wonderung how your doctor can possibly tell by the \"slope\" of your PSA if the cancer is still in the prostate bed or if it had spread to a distant site. If this were possible one could skip radiation and start systemic treatment (ADT) right away. Unfortunately it isn`t. Radiation of the prostate bed is your second (and last) chance for a cure and you should not shy away from it. There is a 25% chance of success. Reinardo",

      "Content": "Hi Winorygun. Since you decided on robotic surgery to go for a cure I suggest you become friendly with the idea of salvage radiation, this being your last chance for a cure. Salvage radiation, after surgery has failed, has a success rate of roughly 50%. HT for a short period of time will improve your chances. Of course, waiting for a couple of months to observe the rise (or not) of PSA and recover from the side effects of surgery will also be a good thing to do, always staying in close contact with your doctor of confidence. Wishing you all the best, Reinardo",

      "Content": "Hi. In our support group we are discussing the Friedman book \"How you and your doctor can fight Breast Cancer, Prostate Cancer and Alzheimer's\". Friedman is a biologist currently working with the University of Chicago. His main idea being that not testerone is the villain that causes prostate cancer to grow but rather estradiol being converted from testosterone by means of the aromatase enzyme. Blocking the conversion by means of an aromatase inhibitor (AI) Friedman suggests to fight prostate cancer by supplementing an aging person's testerone up to teenage level. Do any of you fellows know about doctors in the United States who offer this treatment and are there studies or doctor`reports on Testesterone Replacement Therapy (TRT)? Thanks for replying. Reinardo (Germany)",
