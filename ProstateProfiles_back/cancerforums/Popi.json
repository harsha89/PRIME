      "Content": "Just found out that I can order my own PSA test through my hospital's lab. ($30) I will not use the results to self-diagnose, but I fret, and waiting until the end of February for my next test is killing me. Not knowing any better, I had sex within 24hrs of both tests (they only mentioned bike riding), so I'll be taking the test on Friday to see if a week of abstinence will make a noticeable difference. EDIT: For anyone near a Sentara Lab, there's 20 tests from which to choose: http://sentara.3dcartstores.com/Sent...-Menu_c_1.html",
