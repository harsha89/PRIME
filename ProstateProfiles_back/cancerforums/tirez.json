      "Content": "Hi all, I'm a 33-year old male who has been having some bowel-related issues recently, which I have posted elsewhere on this forum (https://www.cancerforums.net/threads...lly-worried-(). Basically, I went to the doctor yesterday and she gave me a rectal exam. She said she thought she could see a haemorrhoid (but wasn't entirely sure) and then went in deeper. She said she noticed that my prostate felt slightly \"inflamed\". I pushed her on this because I suddenly got a bit scared that this meant there was some kind of lump, so I asked her what this meant. She replied by saying she wouldn't class it as a lump of the kind that you might find with a tumour, but that it wasn't quite as smooth as she would expect. I'm a bit worried by this. Is she just trying to humour me by saying that, so that I don't get anxious about it? Or is it possible for the prostate to become irritated and then go back to normal afterwards? I haven't really had any prostate-related symptoms of late - I did have a period of 4/5 days where I was going to the toilet a lot, but that died down and my peeing habits are back to normal. No pain or anything to speak of. Has anyone else been through this? Not really sure what to think, and trying to distract myself at the moment, but it is a bit difficult truth be told. Thanks in advance.",

      "Content": "Thanks again for your advice and suggestions. I'm a bit nonplussed as to what's going on at the moment. Had a bit of a break in the constant peeing yesterday afternoon - didn't go to the bathroom for about four hours and thought: great, it's back to normal. Then, within the space of two/three hours I went three times, woke up at 1am to pee, and then 7am. It's only 10am here and I've been twice since then. No other symptoms, except that I'm peeing a lot every time, despite drinking the usual amount. Went to the sexual health clinic last night. No trace of UTI from urine sample and she thought an STD was unlikely, but am getting a full round of tests, the results of which will be with me in 2/3 weeks. Her best bet was some sort of irritation from things being \"new\" with my girlfriend, but she couldn't say for sure. Not really sure what to do at this point. Should I wait for a couple of weeks before re-booking a GP appointment and asking for a referral to the urologist? Does this pattern of frequent urination sound like something that happens with PC? Indeed, *is* there any pattern?",

OK, the frequent urination symptoms are definitely back. I went to the toilet around 8 times yesterday, although the urge seems to settle after around 7pm it seems. I went to the doctor this morning and she said that I should provide a urine sample to test for a UTI, but also go to the sexual health clinic just to make sure everything is OK. I'm pretty sure the latter isn't an issue, as my girlfriend went to get tested when she picked up the pill a few months back and everything came back clear. She is also my first sexual partner, so no STD issues there. What kind of got me worried again though, is that the doctor said her colleague found that my prostate was a little \"rough\" (her words), but that because of my age (33) it was unlikely that it would be anything sinister. However, as I understand it, isn't finding a \"rough\" patch on the prostate typical of PC?",
