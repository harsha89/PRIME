I curently have kaiser permanente for my insurance and they declined a consultation with the surgoen that i choose because he is out of network. I just had a secound meeting with The current Dr and he has done approx 200 davinci surgerys total and states he is very comfortable and proficient with the machine. i can still have the guy that has done 1500 + prostate only surgerys i would just have to private pay or pay a substantial amount more. Anyone have experience going out of network with their insurance?",
