      "Content": "I had two negative biopsies, a MRI , and a PCA3 test and they all indicated I did not have cancer. At the time my PSA was 24. The uro that did these test did not want to do anything else unless it went up ten points. I went to another URO six months later (as quick as I could get in) and he suggested a saturation biopsy, which I was all for. PSA ended up at 40. Saturation biopsy was about like the other two with the exception of being put under. I did/do ( first post surgery PSA is in March) have cancer G7, (3+4) in three of the 26 samples. I had been dealing with this for about two years and already decided I was going to have surgery if it cam to that. Surgery was 12/4/2017 and I could not be happier. Prostate was 67 grams and the doctor is pretty sure it was confined, not trying to be pessimistic but I would push for the saturation biopsy, I wished they had done mine about a year earlier. Good luck,it can be a long road with a lot of decisions , I truly wish you the best as I have been there and done that.",

The last group I saw was Alliance Urology in Greensboro, North Carolina and they have been nothing short of great. Again good luck to you and I hope you get it figured out.",

I met with a surgeon,radiologist, and a onocologist all in the same day before I chose which way to go. All were helpful and pretty much laid their thoughts on the line. Once you decide try not to second-guess yourself. Keep your chin up and good luck. I was also a G7 mine were all 3+4, and there were I think 4 positive out of 40. My last biopsy was a saturation and I was a little fuzzy when I talked to the doctor. Like I said good luck, and try not to let it get you down.",

Sorry if I am rambling but I am at my wits end here and really don't know what else to do.

He suggested we do a biopsy which I was very much inclined to agree with. He did a 16 core sample and it was negative. We go six months and do another blood test, this time it is 24. Another biopsy was done shortly after and it also came back negative. He is also doing DREs' and says everything feels normal. Well another six months has gone by and another PSA check. Had my appointment Tuesday and it is 27,another DRE and he says everything feels fine. So now he has ordered a MRI which I do on 12/23. I asked him at the last appointment if he thought I had cancer and his reply was he did not know, I am oddly looking at him trying to figure out what the 2 biopsies were for. Any body else ever had anything like this and if you don't mind how did it play out.

You would think with 32 samples even a blind hog finds a acorn now and again. I appreciate your response,I really don't anyone else to vent to. Just talking about it seems to help.",

I am scared to say the least and I think what scares me most is the feeling that I am not in any type of control. From what I had read when the first biopsy was negative I figured surely the second one would tell me something. You try not to worry but I have learned it is a task. The MRI I am set up for is just a MRI, haven't heard anything about a biopsy connected to it. The doc said it may help identify problem areas where he could concentrate another biopsy. I don't think he will be doing the third one. I like the guy but he is affiliated with a small hospital and I am sure I would be sent somewhere else for treatment. I really appreciate all the responses and I really think I can deal with the outcome,I just don't know when the end will be in sight. The hospital does have a portal but he never updates it, another frustrating fact.",

      "Content": "Been dealing with this for almost a year and a half. I am 62 now and other than blood pressure take no other meds. During a routine physical about 18 months ago psa came in at 19. Regular doc referred me to a urologist in Eden,NC. He put me on Cipro for I think 30 days and did another PSA test. Same results ,a 19. He suggested we do a biopsy which I was very much inclined to agree with. He did a 16 core sample and it was negative. We go six months and do another blood test, this time it is 24. Another biopsy was done shortly after and it also came back negative. He is also doing DREs' and says everything feels normal. Well another six months has gone by and another PSA check. Had my appointment Tuesday and it is 27,another DRE and he says everything feels fine. So now he has ordered a MRI which I do on 12/23. I asked him at the last appointment if he thought I had cancer and his reply was he did not know, I am oddly looking at him trying to figure out what the 2 biopsies were for. Any body else ever had anything like this and if you don't mind how did it play out. I am worried and I have been for the last 18 months as soon as it went to 19 everybody decided I had cancer until the biopsies, and apparently now I don't know whether I do or not. Thanks in advance.",

      "Content": "We have similar stories,mine went on for about two years. My PSA started at 19, went to 24 and finally forty. During the time I had three regular biopsies and the last one was a saturation I think he took 28 samples. The first thing I had to do was come to terms with myself. Once I calmed down , I realized you have to play the hand you are dealt. I was scared,super anxious, and pissed off that this had happened to me. I found a lot of solace on this forum,cause people that have not dealt with it really don't have a clue. It ended up that I had cancer, G7 and my numbers seemed to be a bit confusing at least to me. The saturation biopsy revealed 4 positive samples 1-3+3 and 3-3+4. I had surgery on 12/4 and do not have another PSA test till March. Try and stay calm read and learn as much as you can, during the bad times and there will be some, get on here and talk to people. I did not realize how many people that I knew that had been through this, there are a lot out there. As stated I realized I had too roll with it cause when it first started I did not have any control over it. There are a lot of treatments and a lot of options out there, keep your chin up and good luck for the best outcome.",

Urologist did the 30 days of antibiotics followed by another test which was still 19. He did a 12 core biopsy that was negative. 6 months pass and PSA was 24, another biopsy also negative. Suggested a mri which was done and was told it was normal. I decided to change doctors and started going to Alliance Urology in Greensboro,NC. He did a PCA3 test which came in at a 20 and another blood test. PSA came back at 40 and he suggested a saturation biopsy which was done on 9/12/2017. He did a 26 core sample. Got the call today,out of the 26 one was 3 plus 3, and two were 4 plus 3. . He says it needed to be treated and I have a consult set for 9/27/2017. Thanks to everyone for answering all the questions I had. I guess this will start chapter 2.",

      "Content": "The first biopsy I had my urine was like blood for about a week. The second one was not as bad. The third was a saturation biopsy and I figured it would be terrible as so many samples were taken. Urine was a brownish color but cleared in about three days. I did not have any problems but I did eat a soft diet on all three for several days. My last biopsy was in the middle of September and my surgery was the fourth of December. The only thing they ever told me in regards to the biopsies was to take it easy for several days and watch for major clots being passed or a tempature. Sorry he is having problems,tell him to keep his chin up.",

I was on Cipro for 30 days and had another PSA test two weeks after. The cipro was making me feel pretty bad by the end of it but my PSA (19) remained the same. He did a biopsy about two weeks later and it was negative. Went back 6 months later and PSA was at 24 and another biopsy also negative. Another blood test on 12/13/2016 and the PSA was 27 after this he ordered the MRI. I wished I had found this site early on,te guys on here have some great info and do not hesitate to share. I am sure someone will be along shortly to add to this. If there is anyway he will talk to you about his situation he needs to get in front of this and if his doctor is like the one I started off with he may need to find another one. He may have wanted him to wait to let the entire course of the antibiotic run it's course, don't know about that one but if I were him I would be asking the doctor.

      "Content": "I spoke with a relative this afternoon, and he said just the person I wanted to talk to. He had his first PSA test a couple of weeks ago, his doctor, a internist also did a DRE. The doctor told him the gland may be a little enlarged but other than that felt normal. His PSA came back at 140 and he is concerned to say the least. Trust me, I know the feeling. It seems to me a bone scan at this point is putting the cart in front of the horse since he has not been diagnosed. I advised him to have the doctor refer him to a uro, since I figure that is where it will wind up anyway. I also told him about this site. I had surgery about 14 months ago and really do not know what else to say at this point. The PSA is a monster but it could be something other than cancer. I had several biopsies before mine was found. My bone scans and MRI were after the dx. Any other suggestions that I could tell him would be appreciated,all you guys were a big help when I went through and I would like to pay it forward.",

I wanted it gone and if need be a second bite at the apple. Won't know till March whether I need that bite or not. Surgery was not something I would want to do every year, but there wasn't much pain. There was a lot of soreness which started leaving quickly after the third day. Looking back now it has been like a bad dream, and I hope and pray it is over. I guess each person has to make their own decisions, so far I have no regrets with mine.",
