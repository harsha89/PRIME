      "Content": "My urologist phoned me today with the biopsy results from last week. He said it showed 4 positive areas for PC, up from 1 area found in 2014. My last PSA was 3.4. My primary care physician said the DRE I had in 2014 was what found PC initially even though my PSA was in the high normal range. The current biopsy indicated the same Gleason 6 3+3. My uro said he is not immediately concerned and I could remain on active surveillance or opt to have it removed or radiated. He said they could probably spare nerves on one side and possibly more. I have an appointment next month with him. I told him I am not interested in radiation. My prostate size increased in size from 40 to 50s gram. I'm actually fine with this but will probably be joining the prostate removal club and then, hopefully the zero club. I want to avoid the probability of having to catheterize every time I have to urinate as I grow older. My urologist is at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, Boston. I met him once for an evaluation and then the second time when he did the biopsy. So, I don\u0092t have a history with this doctor but when asked, he said he has done 500 robotic surgeries.

      "Content": "I had a biopsy in 2014. 1 core positive <<5% Adenocarcinoma. Gleason 6 3+3 Active Surveillance Second biopsy 2017. 4 cores positive < 30% Adenocarcinoma. Gleason 6 3+3 So does that mean I'm safe? Seems to me, all currently available treatments are from the caveman era. It's pretty disappointing. And then it seems you have to do a coin flip to choose the doctor that you want to mutilate or burn you. How sick is that. Sorry to be so frank in my opinion. I'm ready to deal with the after effects so I'll be flipping the coin soon. Time to move on to the rest of my life. I'm realizing that I have to develop a sense of humor to trudge through this mess to get to the GOOD SIDE. I guess comedy and tragedy really are two heads of the same coin. PSA 3.3 Dec 2014 DRE revealed hard spot Biopsy revealed <<5% adenocarcinoma in 1 of 12 samples Gleason 6=3+3 Active Surveillance: altered diet to fish/veg PSA 2015 was 2.2 PSA Aug 2016 was 2.7 Active Surveillance: returned to regular diet PSA Feb 2017 was 4.7 (This was tested after DRE) PSA Apr 2017 was 3.4 May 2017 Biopsy revealed: 4 cores positive for Gleason 3+3 disease, relatively low volume (at most 30% involved in each core). Options include continued surveillance vs definitive treatment. Gleason 6=3+3 Age 67",
