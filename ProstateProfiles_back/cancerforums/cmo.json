      "Content": "Mike, It sounds as though you are doing super! There is a small but caring prostate support group that meets once a month at the GMC in Danville. I sent you a pm with a bit of info, if your interested. If you have a physical job, like myself, I thought 6 weeks was a far better choice. While I still haven't updated any info on myself, to this site, I visit regularly and greatly appreciate the posters who share about their experiences. It has helped me a lot before and after my surgery on 9-15",
