      "Content": "Had an acumin scan done last Wednesday, with follow up today with RO. Scan showed locations of traces of possible cancer - to assist with salvage radiation that should begin next week. All indications are that it is confined - no lymph nodes or bones. Scan did pick up something on my pancreas that RO was not all that concerned about - doubts very much that it is cancerous. However, I am making an appointment to consult with a gastro to rule out anything dangerous. Scans I had prior to surgery did not pick up anything. Thgat's all I need! Final PSA before radiation was done last week. Result was PSA <.1. Have been on Casodex and Telstar for a couple of months and it seems to be doing its job as intended. Altogether, I feel pretty good (and optimistic) about where I am, considering where I started. PSA >40 and Gleason 8-10. We'll see where it goes. Thank you all for your support and wisdom. Mike",

      "Content": "Friends, Hard to believe it has been a couple months since surgery. Feeling great - walking 15-20 miles a week - playing golf - pretty continent - limited side effects with HT - still non-smoking - blood pressure medicine cut in half - lost about 5 pounds. Got results of 60 day blood test. PSA is now down to .3. Considering my stats below, I've come a long way I think. Getting close to joining the zero club if things continue as they have! However, I am realistic to understand I will most likely be fighting this well into the future (hopefully :smile). Have consult tomorrow with URO who plans to link me up with a RO. Hope to get that scheduled as soon as I can - my summer work hours are as flexible as I want. Most of you have reported few side effects with the radiation and that encourages me. Any advice? Do you have a choice of the time you want to schedule your daily session? One day I will have the experience and expertise to help others as you have helped me.",

      "Content": "Friends, Has been awhile since I last posted because there really was nothing to report. As my signature shows, I had Robotic surgery almost exactly a year ago. Doctor immediately put me on HT - Casodex and Trelstar - and 6 weeks later had 42 sessions of Radiation. Got a PSA reading of <.1 in October (doctor does not do ultrasensitive), and a repeat in January. About a month ago did labs with my primary care and PSA had risen to .167. Past week did another PSA and it now is at .2. I was hoping for a cure but it doesn't look like that is in the cards (unless there is a medical breakthrough). My URO does not seem all that concerned on hearing about the .167 -said there are many options and a long road ahead. Not sure what the options are. I am still on Casodex and Trelstar - wonder if he will take me off that and try something else? Don't have a clue. I have an appointment with him for late July. I feel better than I have in years - dealing with SEs of ADT - doing a lot of exercise and have lost almost 15 pounds. 10 more to go! Any advice and/or recommendations are welcome. Mike A",

      "Content": "Friends, Has been awhile since I last posted because there really was nothing to report. As my signature shows, I had Robotic surgery almost exactly a year ago. Doctor immediately put me on HT - Casodex and Trelstar - and 6 weeks later had 42 sessions of Radiation. Got a PSA reading of <.1 in October (doctor does not do ultrasensitive), and a repeat in January. About a month ago did labs with my primary care and PSA had risen to .167. Past week did another PSA and it now is at .2. I was hoping for a cure but it doesn't look like that is in the cards (unless there is a medical breakthrough). My URO does not seem all that concerned on hearing about the .167 -said there are many options and a long road ahead. Not sure what the options are. I am still on Casodex and Trelstar - wonder if he will take me off that and try something else? Don't have a clue. I have an appointment with him for late July. I feel better than I have in years - dealing with SEs of ADT - doing a lot of exercise and have lost almost 15 pounds. 10 more to go! Any advice and/or recommendations are welcome. Mike A",

      "Content": "MM and Fairwind, Thank you for advice. I see my current URO in late July to see what he thinks the next step in the plan should be. He was the one who did the surgery and is well regarded throughout NJ. He also lists as a credential \"minimally invasive uro-oncology.\" Not sure what that means except it is probably the reason he has not yet passed me off to a full-time medical oncologist. With this BCR, that may change. I plan to retire next year and move to Dallas/FW area to be closer to our kids. As you both suggest, I will be looking to transfer my care to a major medical/cancer center out that way. I am thinking MD Anderson at either Houston or one of their clinics. Should I wait until I get out there to transfer my care? Alternative is to look into MSK which has just opened a satellite center in Middletown NJ. Or maybe current URO / minimally invasive uro-oncologist (also surgeon) has some standard plan in mind that will tide me over until next summer. Ironically, I feel healthier and in better shape that I have been in over 10 years. Advice? Mike",

      "Content": "Had Da Vinci on 17 April - almost 4 weeks ago. For month prior to surgery, I quit smoking (after 50 years) and walked 4-5 miles a day, building up to about 3.6 MPH. Got myself in pretty decent shape and I think it has paid off. Since surgery, I have begun walking again. Gradually building up to about 3-4 miles per day in the last week, but keeping pace at around 3.3 MPH. I feel I am getting some decent exercise, but not pushing it to point of any pain or tiredness. A day or so ago, at the end, I felt a little pull developing on right side of groin, so took yesterday off. Woke up today without the pull and did my normal 3 and a half mile walk. All this to ask how much is too much? Is 3-4 miles of walking a day too much after 4 weeks? Is the pace I'm walking too fast?

      "Content": "Well, has been almost a year post RP, Radiation, and ADT (Casodex and Trelstar). PSA has been below .1 since a month after starting it (April 2017). Continence not all there yet, but manageable with a pad during the day. Generally satisfied with process except for the usual SEs of ADT: Fat gain, hand joint pain, occasional sweats, urination frequency. But now I think I have a complication - maybe caused by the ADT (?). Came off a 10 day cruise. Did a lot of workout and sweating on board ship - hour a day of fast walking and limited weights. Day 7, after a hard workout - I started drinking water a lot - almost continuously for the next 24 hours. Chalked this up to possible dehyrdration - thirst symptom gradually went away over the next 3 days. Urinated about every hour through the night for the first day. Otherwise felt fine. Got home and weighed myself. I had actually lost 3-4 pounds on the cruise - from 225 to 222. ? Since three weeks ago, I have lost a total of 5 pounds. Unexplained. I suspected onset of diabetes. Got one of those devices from Walgreen's to test blood sugar and came up with readings in the 300-level! Did some research (google) and found a couple of articles that linked ADT with increased blood sugar level and diabetes. Will call my uro this morning to report this. I am supposed to be on ADT for 2-3 years - I wonder if treatment of high blood sugar will trump continuing on ADT? Has anyone experienced rising high blood sugar while on ADT? Advice?? Mike",

      "Content": "I agree with MM - Your husband is ideal candidate for Radiation and HT. I did have a PET scan (Axumin) prior to beginning RT. They say it is sensitive to very low PSAs (less than .1). It really facilitated mapping for the Radiation regimen - ability to target and focus radiation. I have been on HT for about 3 months. Main reason, the URO told me, was to weaken PC cells to make radiation more effective. However, he insists I will be on HT for 2 years. I have experienced minimal side effects thus far, although early in the process.",

      "Content": "First wife passed away from Colon Cancer 15 years ago. I found the support provided by a forum invaluable as we went down the road. Now it's my turn: Just diagnosed with prostate last week. Gleason 8, PSA 40 (up from normal 2 years prior). Doctor followed up with bone scan, CT, and bone scan which I just did. Will meet with urologist in about a week. Very anxious of course - hoping for the best, bracing for the worst. Question: Will the urologist recommend treatments other than surgery or radiation? At what point will an oncologist become involved? Will he pick the oncologist, or can I go out on my own? Question: I was referred to my current urologist who did the biopsy and ordered the follow up tests. However, I just found out that Memorial Sloan Kettering just opened up a facility in NJ about 30 minutes away. If surgery is offered by current urologist, can I have it done by him and then use MSK for follow-on treatment? I am 67, and up until about 2 months ago whenI had my PSA spike, had no symptoms. Now I just have to urinate more frequently (every couple of hours) than I have in the past. Mike A",

At what point will an oncologist become involved? Will he pick the oncologist, or can I go out on my own? Question: I was referred to my current urologist who did the biopsy and ordered the follow up tests. However, I just found out that Memorial Sloan Kettering just opened up a facility in NJ about 30 minutes away. If surgery is offered by current urologist, can I have it done by him and then use MSK for follow-on treatment? I am 67, and up until about 2 months ago whenI had my PSA spike, had no symptoms. Now I just have to urinate more frequently (every couple of hours) than I have in the past. Mike A",

      "Content": "I've been on Trelstar and Casodex for almost a year. My URO says he wants me on this regimen for another year or two. He has thrown everything at my situation (Surgery, Radiation, ADT) with hope for cure or long term remission. Side effects for me: Hot flashes 2-3 times a day or night, weight gain, joint pain (especially hand), some tiredness at end of work day, some return of continence issues (not a major distractor). No sex interest or capability at this time. All these side effects are manageable, but will be glad to get off ADT. Want peace of mind in future to say I did everything I could. My URO/Surgeon is a true warrior and I trust him. I feel comfortable being the \"follower.\"",

      "Content": "I agree with MM - Your husband is ideal candidate for Radiation and HT. I did have a PET scan (Axumin) prior to beginning RT. They say it is sensitive to very low PSAs (less than .1). It really facilitated mapping for the Radiation regimen - ability to target and focus radiation. I have been on HT for about 3 months. Main reason, the URO told me, was to weaken PC cells to make radiation more effective. However, he insists I will be on HT for 2 years. I have experienced minimal side effects thus far, although early in the process.",
