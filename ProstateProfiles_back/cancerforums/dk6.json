It will take so getting use to when walking around but I was fortunite and the weather was nice. I put the bag in a 5 gal plastic bucket, held the bucket by the handle and started walking. Sleeping was fine, for the first time in years I did not have to get up in the middle of the night. I did not experience any real pain with the bag but again it's is uncomfortable sleeping. I sleep on my side anyway so it was no big deal. Sitting up is no problem. After I left the hospital, I did not need anything as far as pain meds. I do wish you well Don",
