Urologist orderd a mri.. My husband is 42. DR Said psa should be no higher than 2.50... Got the Mri results back and they found 3 leisons.. 1-15mm, 9mm and 7mm. The 7mm got a pirad 3 and the other two were pirads4. They set him for a biopsy. I'm having the hardest time wrapping my head around all of this. From the mri report. lymph invasion, bladder or bone all show unlikely.. Any thoughts on why it went down on its on. What to expect after biopsy.. I'm being told multiple leisons won't show benign.",
