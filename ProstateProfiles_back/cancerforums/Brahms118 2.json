      "Content": "Hi all, first post! So what am I to say here? I guess I'll just lay it all out, boring as it is. PSA 2 years ago began increasing above 4, and I had a biopsy that was negative in all samples. The urologist & I were not a good fit. We parted ways. A year ago PSA of 19, still PO'd about the urologist and ignored the PSA test. Repeated the PSA in December, 36 this time. Found a new Urologist who took another biopsy. Diagnosed in January, 2 of 12 core samples showed cancer with a Gleason 9. February, bone scan - clear, CAT scan - clear. I was told that it was inoperable. I began Lupron injections in March. PSA 3 weeks ago was 3.9, 2 weeks ago the markers were placed. Radiation begins on Wednesday, 43 treatments, should end on July 31 my 64th birthday. I've been rather cavalier about the whole ordeal, more like it's happening to some one else and it's no big deal. Until tonight when I found this site, and read a few threads. After reading, I'm am rattled a bit. Gleason 9 is really a bad apple, but I let it go in one ear and out the other. I don't know why I'm here on this site, I just showed up, like a cat on the front porch. ill ramble more some other time, but this was it in a nut shell. Brahms118-2",

      "Content": "Thanks to all that responded to my first post back in June. Sorry I haven't been on here since then. The radiation treatments finished up a month ago. Smooth and easy, a cake walk really. I have no further news of the cancer, PSA won't be done until the end of October. (end of my sugar coating!) I am in my 6th month of the Lupron injections. I've read a few posts about Lupron on this site, and more from other sources. Peoples experiences range from just a few hot flashes all the way to being permanently disabled from it. MANY say that the side affects never go away after you quit the Lupron. For me, I can't stand it another minute, but there's nothing I can do about it. Lupron has made me a mad man, a lunatic - an insane person. I can't think, I can't remember, I can hardly speak sometimes. I can't sleep for more than 3 hours at a time, I'm exhausted & lethargic at all times and don't feel like working, and I'm angry toward everyone. None of these things were me prior to this prostate fiasco that began 8 months ago. I won't even cover the physical atrophy aspects of the side effects. I've read the articles about the Lupron law suits and the drug companies admission of guilt about the drug test trials, as well as the petitions to have the drug banned. That doesn't help me feel better. I wan't to quit the Lupron, and have no further injections. But I feel trapped. The Radiation Oncologist informs me that radiation without 2 years of Lupron has a survival rate less than 30%. And so, I AM trapped. People tell me living with the Lupron side affects is easier than dying with the pain of prostate cancer. REALLY, you think so huh? This isn't living as I remember it prior to 8 months ago. This is the Lupron speaking in my brain, I'm not like this normally. (end of vent!) Thanks for letting me vent. I intend on discontinuing the Lupron, I hope this Lupron Brain all goes away.
