      "Content": "Doctors who perform robotic-assisted prostate cancer surgery aren\u0092t proficient and able to remove all the malignant cells surrounding the tumor until they have done the procedure more than 1,600 times, researchers said. Results from a study suggest the operations using Intuitive Surgical Inc.\u0092s da Vinci robot are being performed too often at community hospitals by surgeons without enough experience, said Prasanna Sooriakumaran, lead author and urologist at the Weill Cornell Medical College in New York. Doctors have embraced the approach because studies show it can be learned quickly, uses smaller incisions, causes less blood loss and speeds recovery. More than 90,000 men in the U.S. have their prostate gland removed each year because of cancer, according to the American Society of Clinical Oncology. The surgery is done mainly with robotic technology introduced in 2000 by Sunnyvale, California- based Intuitive Surgical, typically by doctors who perform 100 or fewer procedures annually, Sooriakumaran said. \u0093The operation is not easy to perform and it takes a lot of experience in order to get the best results for our patients,\u0094 he said in a conference call. \u0093The enthusiasm in the United States needs to be tempered in terms of what sort of hospital needs to be purchasing this equipment and what sort of surgeons should be allowed to do these operations.\u0094 The researchers tracked three surgeons learning the technique over a six-year period at high-volume centers at the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia, Karolinska Institute in Stockholm and Weill Cornell in New York City. Surgery times decreased with each operation, while the doctor\u0092s ability to remove all the cancer increased, Sooriakumaran said. Removing Cancer Cells The surgeons needed to perform more than 1,600 operations before they were able to gauge with at least 90 percent accuracy how much tissue surrounding the tumor they needed to remove to get all the malignant cells. Leaving stray cancerous cells in the margins, at the edge of the tissue removed during surgery, can lead to recurrences of the disease. Every hospital has its own system to train surgeons and it\u0092s not up to the company to determine when the doctors reach proficiency, said Calvin Darling, a spokesman for Intuitive Surgical. While he hasn\u0092t yet seen the study, the 1,600 number \u0093strikes me as absurd,\u0094 Darling said today in a telephone interview. Training Time \u0093The average time it takes to get to proficiency as defined by our hospitals in their training protocols is typically mid- double digits,\u0094 he said. \u0093This is an order of magnitude higher.\u0094 Intuitive Surgical reported $660.3 million in 2010 sales of the da Vinci system, according to a company filing. The company\u0092s shares fell $1.20, or less than 1 percent, to $339.99, at 4 p.m. New York time in Nasdaq Stock Market composite trading. More than 700 operations a year are done in medical centers that specialize in the surgery, compared with just a handful a month for smaller, community-based hospitals, Sooriakumaran said. The procedure needs to be centralized so that surgeons can get the amount of experience needed to gain the best results for their patients, he said. The results will be presented tomorrow at the Genitourinary Cancer Symposium in Orlando, Florida. The investigators are now gathering information on additional surgeons to expand their findings. It is likely that other doctors, who are in lower- volume medical centers, will take even longer to get the experience they need, Sooriakumaran said. Intuitive Surgical has provided funding for Ashutosh Tewari, an author of the study and a urology professor at Weill Cornell. Increased Use Use of robotic technology is growing exponentially, said Nicholas Vogelzang, an oncologist at the Comprehensive Cancer Centers of Nevada in Las Vegas and chair of U.S. Oncology\u0092s developmental therapeutics committee. Doctors need to ensure their abilities are keeping up, he said. \u0093This data today will make everyone pause,\u0094 said Vogelzang, who pointed out that traditional open surgery also requires years of practice. \u0093Maybe it\u0092s time to go a little bit farther before we rush into this surgery. Experience really does matter.\u0094 http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2011-0...udy-finds.html",

Abstract AIM: The aim of this study was to define the learning curve for positive surgical margin (PSM) rate and operative time (OT) for robotic assisted laparoscopic radical prostatectomy (RALP); while the learning curve appears shorter for surgical safety for RALP compared to other surgical modalities, this has not been well established for the above parameters. METHODS: We performed a retrospective cohort study of 3794 patients who underwent RALP between Jan 2003 and Sep 2009 by three surgeons (DL, PW, AKT) from three centers (UPenn, Karolinska, Cornell). Mean overall PSM rates and mean overall OT were calculated for all three surgeons at intervals of 50 RALPs per surgeon, and learning curves for these means were fit using a loess method. R version 2.71 was used for all statistical analysis. RESULTS: The learning curve for PSM rates for all patients demonstrated improvements continued with increasing surgeon experience, with over 1600 cases required to get a PSM rate <10%. When pT3 patients were evaluated, the learning curve started to plateau after 1000-1500 cases. Mean OT plateaued after 750 cases though with further surgical experience the OTs started to climb again. CONCLUSION: The learning curve for RALP is not as short as previously thought, and a large number of cases are needed to get PSM rates and OTs to a minimum. This suggests that RALP should be performed by high volume surgeons in order to optimize patient outcomes.",

      "Content": "Salesmen in the Surgical Suite When Fred E. Taylor arrived at Harrison Medical Center in Silverdale, Wash., for a routine prostatectomy, he expected the best medical care new technology had to offer: robotic surgery, billed as safer, less painful and easier on the body than traditional surgery. The operation, on Sept. 9, 2008, was supposed to take five hours. But it was marred by a remarkable cascade of complications and dragged on for more than 13 hours, leaving Mr. Taylor, who had been an active 67-year-old retiree, incontinent and with a colostomy bag, and leading to kidney and lung damage, sepsis and a stroke. Mr. Taylor survived his injuries but died last year. Now, his wife, Josette, is suing Intuitive Surgical Inc., the company that makes the equipment and trained the surgeon to use it. As it turned out, the surgeon, Dr. Scott Bildsten, had never before used the robotic equipment without supervision. \u0093We are the old school, where you trust the doctor,\u0094 said Mrs. Taylor, who noted that her husband\u0092s life was so limited after the operation that he used to cry about being \u0093trapped in this body.\u0094 It is not the first time patients have claimed they were harmed by Intuitive\u0092s robotic surgical equipment, called the da Vinci Surgical System. But the Taylor case, set for trial in April, is unusual. Internal company e-mails, provided to The New York Times by lawyers for the Taylor estate, offer a glimpse into the aggressive tactics used to market high-tech medical devices and raise questions about the quality of training provided to doctors before they use new equipment on patients. Intuitive, based in Sunnyvale, Calif., declined to comment on the lawsuit but said studies showed that its robotic equipment results in better outcomes than conventional open surgery. \u0093The most objective and therefore best measure of efficacy for all of those involved in training \u0097 from Intuitive Surgical, the hospitals, the proctors and the surgeons themselves \u0097 is represented in the comparative clinical outcomes of da Vinci surgery,\u0094 said Angela Wonson, the company\u0092s vice president for communications. According to Intuitive, 1,371 hospitals in the United States have purchased a da Vinci system, and many have purchased two. Nearly half a million procedures worldwide were performed robotically last year, including prostatectomies and hysterectomies, among other operations. A surgeon using the da Vinci system sits at a console with a camera that provides a high-definition, three-dimensional image of the surgical site. He or she manipulates miniaturized instruments; computer and robotic technology translates and scales the surgeon\u0092s hand movements. Hospitals are responsible for setting the credentialing standards, or training requirements, for physicians who will use the equipment on patients. But internal company e-mails suggest that Intuitive\u0092s sales representatives were intimately involved in the process, presenting themselves as experts and pressing for lower standards in order to ease the training path for busy surgeons, to increase use of the equipment and to drive sales. In an e-mail dated May 31, 2011, a Western regional sales manager for Intuitive noted that area surgeons had used robotic equipment only five times, although the company\u0092s goal was to see 36 robotic operations performed by the end of June. He urged sales staff to persuade surgeons to switch upcoming cases to robotic ones. \u0093Don\u0092t let proctoring or credentialing\u0094 \u0097 shorthand for supervised surgery and hospital certification \u0097 \u0093get in our way,\u0094 the e-mail said. In December 2009, a sales representative urged a hospital in Billings, Mont., to ease up on its credentialing requirement, saying in an e-mail that requiring surgeons to do five supervised operations using the robot before going solo was \u0093on the high side\u0094 and could have \u0093unintended consequences.\u0094 Hospital officials replied, saying, \u0093We will review and most likely will decrease the 5 down to 3.\u0094 Ms. Wonson, the Intuitive spokeswoman, said the company does not get involved in determining who is qualified to operate its robotic equipment, which is the responsibility of the hospitals. \u0093We do not make recommendations,\u0094 she said in an e-mail. Dr. Bildsten was one of six doctors given free training by Intuitive, including one day of hands-on training at the company\u0092s facility in California. He also had done two practice runs on the equipment with a more experienced surgeon before operating on Mr. Taylor, he said in a legal deposition. Still, he said, no one warned him that a patient like Mr. Taylor, who weighed nearly 300 pounds, was not a good candidate for robotic surgery. He did not respond to telephone messages requesting comment. Company e-mails submitted in the Taylor case also suggest that members of the sales staff at Intuitive worked diligently to persuade surgeons to choose the da Vinci procedure for patients even when they were planning to use a different method. In one e-mail on June 28, 2010, a clinical sales director urged the sales team \u0097 whose compensation was linked to filling a quarterly quota of operations \u0097 to \u0093scrub\u0094 doctors\u0092 schedules and get procedures moved up by a few days in order to make the quarterly goal. \u0093Let\u0092s bring it home!\u0094 she wrote. \u0093Be sure you scrub all schedules, identify cases on Thursday and Friday that can be moved up.\u0094 On Aug. 9, 2010, a clinical sales director wrote to his team: \u0093Be proactive in finding cases to convert. Be prepared to challenge each trained surgeon every time you see a lap or open case. Be unsatisfied with the thought of ending a day without a converted case.\u0094 (\u0093Lap\u0094 refers to laparoscopic procedures, an alternate form of minimally invasive surgery.) The sales representatives were often in the operating rooms, where they offered advice to newly trained surgeons who were having technical difficulties with the robot, according to legal depositions in the Taylor case. The representatives also appear to have had access to the operating room schedules and were urged to \u0093partner\u0094 with surgical teams \u0093to review and select appropriate cases,\u0094 according to court documents. On March 3, 2011, a sales representative wrote in an e-mail to his team that he had met with a gynecologic surgeon in Utah who was trained a year earlier but had stopped doing robotic cases. The surgeon subsequently \u0093agreed to convert the next two to da Vinci.\u0094 In depositions, some Intuitive sales representatives defended their involvement, saying that it was important for surgeons to use the robotic system frequently in order to maintain and improve their skills. The Food and Drug Administration allowed the sale of the da Vinci system in 2000 under a controversial process called \u0093premarket notification,\u0094 often used to bring medical devices to market without the rigorous trials of safety and efficacy typically required of new drugs. Manufacturers are able to exempt devices from the rigorous trials by claiming they are similar to existing devices already on the market. When devices are brought to market this way, the F.D.A. \u0093cannot require training programs as a condition of clearance,\u0094 said Synim Rivers, an agency spokeswoman. Before allowing this type of market clearance, the agency twice asked Intuitive for more information about how doctors would be trained to use company equipment. Intuitive provided details of a 70-item exam for surgeons and a three-day hands-on training protocol. By 2002, however, the company had revamped its training program, replacing the 70-item exam with a 10-question online quiz and reducing the time spent in hands-on training at Intuitive\u0092s facility to one day. The largest study to date of robotic hysterectomies has questioned the use of robot-assisted surgery over more conventional forms of minimally invasive surgery. A study published in February in The Journal of the American Medical Association evaluated outcomes in 264,758 women who had laparoscopic or robotically assisted hysterectomy and found no overall difference in complication rates between the two groups. But the researchers did find that robotically assisted surgery for hysterectomy costs on average about one-third more than laparoscopic surgery. Last week, Dr. James T. Breeden, the president of the American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, publicly urged patients \u0093to separate the marketing hype from the reality\u0094 when considering a surgical method for hysterectomy. \u0093Just because it\u0092s newer and higher technology,\u0094 he said, \u0093doesn\u0092t mean it\u0092s better.\u0094 http://www.nytimes.com/2013/03/26/he...=0&ref=science",

      "Content": "Saw this at another cancer forum today, well worth reading. Bottoms up! Bioactive compounds in coffee may have anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects http://www.fhcrc.org/en/news/release...ncer-away.html SEATTLE \u0096 Aug. 26, 2013 \u0096 Coffee consumption is associated with a lower risk of prostate cancer recurrence and progression, according to a new study by Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center scientists that is online ahead of print in Cancer Causes & Control. Corresponding author Janet L. Stanford, Ph.D., co-director of the Program in Prostate Cancer Research in the Fred Hutch Public Health Sciences Division, conducted the study to determine whether the bioactive compounds in coffee and tea may prevent prostate cancer recurrence and delay progression of the disease. Stanford and colleagues found that men who drank four or more cups of coffee per day experienced a 59 percent reduced risk of prostate cancer recurrence and/or progression as compared to those who drank only one or fewer cups per week. They did not, however, find an association between coffee drinking and reduced mortality from prostate cancer, although the study included too few men who died of prostate cancer to address that issue separately. First study to assess the link between tea and prostate cancer outcomes Regarding tea consumption, the researchers did not find an associated reduction of prostate cancer recurrence and/or progression. The study also did not draw any conclusions regarding the impact of tea drinking on prostate-specific death. \u0093To our knowledge, our study is the first to investigate the potential association between tea consumption and prostate cancer outcomes,\u0094 the authors wrote. \u0093It is important to note, however, that few patients in our cohort were regular tea drinkers and the highest category of tea consumption was one or more cups per day. The association should be investigated in future studies that have access to larger populations with higher levels of tea consumption.\u0094 The population-based study involved 1,001 prostate cancer survivors, aged 35-74 years old at the time of diagnosis between 2002-2005, who were residents of King County, Wash. Participants answered questions regarding their diet and beverage consumption two years prior to prostate cancer diagnosis using a validated food frequency questionnaire, and were interviewed about demographic and lifestyle information, family history of cancer, medication use and prostate cancer screening history. The researchers followed up with patients more than five years after diagnosis to ascertain whether the prostate cancer had recurred and/or progressed. Those who were still living, willing to be contacted and had been diagnosed with non-metastatic cancer were included in the follow-up effort. Of the original 1,001 patients in the cohort, 630 answered questions regarding coffee intake, fit the follow-up criteria and were included in the final analysis. Of those, 61 percent of the men consumed at least one cup of coffee per day and 12 percent consumed the highest amount: four or more cups per day. The study also evaluated daily coffee consumption in relation to prostate cancer-specific death in 894 patients using data from the initial food frequency questionnaire. After the median follow-up period of eight-and-a-half years, 125 of the men had died, including 38 specifically from prostate cancer. Daily coffee consumption was not associated with prostate cancer-specific mortality or other-cause mortality, but with few deaths these analyses were limited. \u0093Our study differs from previous ones because we used a composite definition of prostate cancer recurrence/progression,\u0094 said first author Milan Geybels, a doctoral student at Maastricht University in the Netherlands who was a graduate student in Stanford\u0092s Prostate Studies group at Fred Hutch when the study was conducted. \u0093We used detailed information on follow-up prostate-specific antigen levels, use of secondary treatment for prostate cancer and data from scans and biopsies to assess occurrence of metastases and cause-specific mortality during follow up. Using these detailed data, we could determine whether a patient had evidence of prostate cancer recurrence or progression.\u0094 The results are consistent with findings from Harvard\u0092s Health Professionals Follow-up Study, which found that men who drank six or more cups of coffee per day had a 60 percent decreased risk of metastatic/lethal prostate cancer as compared to coffee abstainers. Phytochemicals in coffee have anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects Further research is required to understand the mechanisms underlying the results of the study, but biological activities associated with consumption of phytochemical compounds found in coffee include anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects and modulation of glucose metabolism. These naturally occurring compounds include: Caffeine, which has properties that inhibit cell growth and encourage apoptosis, or programmed cell death. Previous studies have found that caffeine consumption may reduce the risk of several cancer types, including basal-cell carcinoma, glioma (a cancer of the brain and central nervous system) and ovarian cancer. Diterpenes cafestol and kahweol, which may inhibit cancer growth. Chlorogenic acid, which, along with caffeic acid, can inhibit DNA methylation, a biochemical process involved in the development and progression of many cancer types. Additional studies needed to confirm whether coffee can prevent cancer recurrence The researchers emphasize that coffee or specific coffee components cannot be recommended for secondary prevention of prostate cancer before the preventive effect has been demonstrated in a randomized clinical trial. Further, there\u0092s ongoing debate about which components in coffee are anti-carcinogenic, and additional large, prospective studies are needed to confirm whether coffee intake is beneficial for secondary prevention. Coffee drinking may even be problematic for some men, Geybels said. \u0093Although coffee is a commonly consumed beverage, we have to point out that increasing one\u0092s coffee intake may be harmful for some men. For instance, men with hypertension may be vulnerable to the adverse effects of caffeine in coffee. Or, specific components in coffee may raise serum cholesterol levels, posing a possible threat to coronary health. Patients who have questions or concerns about their coffee intake should discuss them with their general practitioner,\u0094 he said. The investigators also noted limits to their study, which included a lack of data on how coffee consumption might have changed following diagnosis, whether the coffee that participants consumed was caffeinated or decaffeinated, and how the coffee was prepared (espresso, boiled or filtered), a factor that may affect the bioactive properties of the brew. The National Cancer Institute, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Prostate Cancer Foundation and Dutch Cancer Society funded the research.",

      "Content": "Hi, The number of seeds will depend on the size of your prostate. Aside from being able to place them closer to the edge of the gland, one of the other reasons they're stranded is to prevent seed migration. The seeds are loaded into needles and those needles are inserted and the seeds introduced into the gland. There is very little blood. The first urination post-implant isn't that bad honestly. It didn't feel like razors. It burned but less than, for reference purposes, having \"the clap\" does. It's worth it. \"How are the seeds placed into the prostate? We use a preloaded needle technique in which needles with seeds inside are inserted through the template, through the skin of the perineum and directly into the prostate gland according to preplanned map. The needle position is verified by both physicians on the ultrasound screen and then double checked by measurement. A stylet in the needle allows the seeds to be gently placed in to the planned position. It usually takes approximately 45 minutes to one hour from anesthesia to completion. Most procedures require 16 to 28 needles and 60 to 130 seeds.\" http://www.prostatecancertreatmentce...edImplant.aspx 2004 paper by Grimm detailing the advances in brachytherapy: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1472866/ There are a few myths regarding brachytherapy: surgery can't be performed post-radiation radiation opens a man up to risk of secondary cancers (a minute risk) radiation is best for older men (due to #2) Being a Gleason 7, my thinking was why have surgery when there was a strong chance I'd need salvage radiation - 30% of biopsies are upgraded/downgraded post-surgery pathology. I see many men on these forums who have surgery only to have a recurrence and then have to have radiation therapy. The stats, from Grimm, show that brachytherapy has the edge as far as cancer control, maintaining continence and sexual function. I am 56.",

      "Content": "Hi there, I had brachytherapy in March 2013 - 66 Pd-103 seeds. It was an agonizing decision of bouncing between the three modalities (with all their variations) but I finally settled on brachytherapy because, based on research, I strongly feel that brachytherapy is near being the \"Gold Standard\" for treating PCa. My top three concerns were/are: cancer control continence sexual function (although as crazy as it sounds - and it does sound crazy but a lot of men feel this way - this is almost #1 for me) I was riddled with anxiety pre-surgery (I never had surgery before). Once I received the IV pre-surgery 'cocktail' (I believe it was Versed) they could have done anything to me. Shortly afterward, they wheeled me into the surgery room and the anesthesiologist put me out. I woke up a bit groggy about an hour later. As soon as I could pee, I was allowed to leave and my wife drove us home. I burned for about 2-3 days when I urinated (catheter burn). That's it. I was sore but needed no medication outside of an occasional Tylenol. The doctor put me on Rapaflo to help me urinate (which I am now weening off of without too much of a problem). Sexual function: Erections are strong. No medication needed for them. If anything, my sex life has gotten better post-cancer. I feel stronger and harder than ever - \"harder than penitentiary steel.\" My desire has increased. The only disquieting thing about sex was orgasms with little to no ejaculate. It took me some time to get used to it but we were having sex a few weeks post-surgery. I was concerned about shooting one of the seeds out of me but they're stranded together these days so little chance of that. Continence: I have no real urinary issues. Cancer control: My PSA was cut in half first post-brachytherapy PSA. I get another one in about a month or so. I consider myself cured. Time will tell the tale. Sometimes if feels like *something* is going *in there* but this is the radiation working. It feels like a low sort of burning. Good luck. I am sure you will be fine and afterward be happy you picked brachytherapy.",

      "Content": "Hi, The number of seeds will depend on the size of your prostate. Aside from being able to place them closer to the edge of the gland, one of the other reasons they're stranded is to prevent seed migration. The seeds are loaded into needles and those needles are inserted and the seeds introduced into the gland. There is very little blood. The first urination post-implant isn't that bad honestly. It didn't feel like razors. It burned but less than, for reference purposes, having \"the clap\" does. It's worth it. \"How are the seeds placed into the prostate? We use a preloaded needle technique in which needles with seeds inside are inserted through the template, through the skin of the perineum and directly into the prostate gland according to preplanned map. The needle position is verified by both physicians on the ultrasound screen and then double checked by measurement. A stylet in the needle allows the seeds to be gently placed in to the planned position. It usually takes approximately 45 minutes to one hour from anesthesia to completion. Most procedures require 16 to 28 needles and 60 to 130 seeds.\" http://www.prostatecancertreatmentce...edImplant.aspx 2004 paper by Grimm detailing the advances in brachytherapy: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1472866/ There are a few myths regarding brachytherapy: surgery can't be performed post-radiation radiation opens a man up to risk of secondary cancers (a minute risk) radiation is best for older men (due to #2) Being a Gleason 7, my thinking was why have surgery when there was a strong chance I'd need salvage radiation - 30% of biopsies are upgraded/downgraded post-surgery pathology. I see many men on these forums who have surgery only to have a recurrence and then have to have radiation therapy. The stats, from Grimm, show that brachytherapy has the edge as far as cancer control, maintaining continence and sexual function. I am 56.",

I do agree with the other post about your surgeon being very experienced. Our surgeon had done around 1200 so we were very comfortable .

      "Content": "Well, it has been nearly three weeks since my implant (March 6 2013 at the wonderful Chicago Prostate Center). The reason for using 103Pd over another isotope for my G7 PCa Gleason grade has been, in the past, the primary determinant for picking an isotope. Early open (laparotomy) implant experience with I-125 with moderate grades (2-6) was quite favorable but not so favorable with high-grade tumors (Gleason 8-10). We therefore initially elected to treat patients with low to moderate grades (2-6) with Iodine 125 and higher grades (7-10) with Palladium 103. To date, this has worked out well. For Gleason scores 5-7, either isotope is probably effective. However the studies that have evaluated whether one isotope is superior to another have demonstrated no difference. What is 103Pd Palladium-103 is a radioisotope of the element palladium which has uses in radiation therapy for prostate cancer and uveal melanoma. Palladium-103 may be created from palladium-102 or from Rhodium-103 using a Cyclotron. Palladium-103 has a half-life of 16.99 days and decays by electron capture to rhodium-103, emitting gamma-rays with 21 keV of energy. The Half-life of 103Pd Palladium has a half-life of 17 days. Within two months it has given up 90% of its energy and has lost almost all of it by six months. Again, there are advantages to both isotopes. Palladium gives up its energy quicker but this does not mean that it is necessarily better or stronger. I am feeling pretty good. On occasion I get tired but that has pretty much faded. I have urinary symptoms like low flow, the feeling of urgency and a very low-level burning feeling (but it is a very low-level). I take Rapaflo for urinary issues and it helps but it still sometimes urine dribbles out of me slowly. I chalk that up to \"normal\" at this stage of the radiation destroying the cancer. I am not having any problem with erections but still have not had sex. I am scared of a painful orgasm or even getting a strong erection. I keep going over \"shooting\" a seed in my mind and remember the blood from the biopsy (and the flippin' catheter - hate them). It is funny how mental tricks work on our organ. I am still sore when sitting too long or on a hard surface. I accidentally sat down hard and felt it a bit but nothing too bad. I take Aleve on occasion but really never needed any pain medication other than that. It was a painless procedure and recovery. There is still a little discoloration where the seeds were inserted but it doesn't look too bad. No bowel issues. Regular movements without any pain at all. As far as the general feeling I will say this: it feels like something is going on. It is hard to pinpoint. It feels like a low burning or a warmth at times. I assume this is radiation at work but it could be in my head. In two and a half months or so I will get my first post-seed PSA and expect to get see it moving down. \"Down down down and the Devil called out my name\" goes the song but this time it is the cancer going down.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by 35coupe Thanks everyone. And about the comment about radiation. I'm just saying if it comes down to it I would go with surgery. Two months of high beam radiation versus a few days in the hospital is an easy choice for me. HDR is complete within a week, LDR within an hour and you're done. Both have cure rates equal to, or greater than, surgery with less side effects and recovery time. Good luck.",

      "Content": "A friend of mine - A Yooper - posted this at Healing Well today. It is food for thought for any man deciding on what to pick as far as treatment to beat this Hellish disease. I just came across a study presented at the European Society for Radiotherapy and Oncology (ESTRO) April 19-23, 2013 in Geneva, Switzerland, that analyzed research findings from six recent overview studies involving 55,000 patients. The investigators involved evaluated disease progression and outcomes, and associated costs extrapolated over a 10-year period. I have requested a copy of the full study and am waiting for that; in the meantime they did send me the abstract: Abstract: PD-0371 Comparative cost / QALY of guideline-recommended prostate cancer treatments: a UK cost perspective Purpose/Objective To estimate the expected comparative costs/Quality Adjusted Life Year (QALY) gained of the guideline recommended treatments Active Surveillance (AS), Radical Prostatectomy (RP), Brachytherapy (BT), EBRT and appropriate combinations hereof incl. Androgen Deprivation Therapy (ADT) in patients with low, intermediate or high risk prostate cancer over a time horizon of 10 years from an UK-NHS cost perspective. Materials and Methods A decision analytic model was developed considering survival, health related quality of life and costs associated with 1) initial treatment and 2) management of relapse, local recurrence, metastasis, and 3) treatment-associated complications and morbidities. The wide range of appropriate treatments to be compared for low, intermediate and high risk prostate cancers were based on NICE, EAU, AUA and NCCN guidelines. Survival, relapse, recurrence, metastasis and complication rates, as well as health-related quality of life and cost data were based on systematic reviews of the published literature and expert opinions where required. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis, using 10000 Monte Carlo simulations, quantified the joint decision uncertainty surrounding model outcomes at the prevailing threshold of £20k-30k/QALY. Results In low risk prostate cancer, AS has the highest probability for being cost-effective (C/E), i.e. 70%. When AS is unacceptable to a patient, BT dominates EBRT by generating more QALYs/patient (+0,06) at lower cost (-£14k) over 10-years. EBRT is C/Evs. RP as shown by the incremental C/E ratio of £7k/QALY which is far below the WTP threshold. In intermediate risk, EBRT+BT is the dominating treatment (5,02QALYs at £14.7k; 65% probability C/E), followed by BT as monotherapy (4,98QALYs at £16.9k; 35% probability C/E). RP generates the lowest QALYs at relatively high costs (4,06 QALYs, £28.8k). In high risk, all mono and combination radiation treatments dominate RP which generates 3,96 QALYs at £35.4 over 10 years/patient. EBRT+BT (4,7 QALYs, £35.1k) is most C/E compared to monoradiation treatments by generating more QALYs at only slightly higher total costs. BT (4,65 QALYs, £32.5k) dominates EBRT (4,62 QALYs, £32.5k) and EBRT+ADT(4,47 QALYs, £37.7k). Conclusions Across risk groups, RP is likely to perform worse than radiation treatments in terms of expected costs/QALY. In intermediate and high risk prostate cancer, EBRT+BT is expected to provide highest QALYs at acceptable or lower cost than monoradiation treatments and RP. In low risk prostate cancer, AS is preferred in terms of QALYs, while BT dominates EBRT and RP in terms of costs/QALYs. Co-authors L.M.G. Steuten1, V.P. Retel2. 1PANAXEA bv / University of Twente, Enschede, The Netherlands. 2Netherlands Cancer Institute, Amsterdam, The Netherlands. QALY by nature includes cost factor, which I have put secondarily to treatment outcomes - none the less an interesting study.",

      "Content": "Not sure what happened to my previous post but I will go ahead and write it again from memory. It went something like this: Most men come to forums looking for treatment answers. Many have not decided what treatment to do. I didn't. If you look on cancer forums you will see many men show up undecided. After research they decide. As far as moderation goes: saying radiation is for \"old men\" is not the words of an unbiased moderator but of someone very biased against treating PCa via any radiation treatment and such a person should probably not be a moderator if he can't keep that bias to himself. Bias can hurt people. In the pursuit of truth we have to say that there is no Gold Standard for PCa treatment. There has never been head to head trials. That is why doctors offer all treatment modalities for men to pick from (unless there is a medical reason not to). Stating that \"surgery is the Gold Standard\" is recommending a treatment and is also saying that all other treatments are inferior. Facts just don't back up that statement. MODERATOR'S NOTE: Blank, I am not going to tolerate the attacks you are presenting up above. Things that I have said are only repeats of what TOP DOCTORS have said. The comments did not originate with me. I will ask you one more time to stop being so limited in your acceptance of what others here happen to say. I guess what I am asking is for you to grow up a bit and be more tolerant of those who do not conform to your own opinions.",

I understand if you have radiation and it fails surgery is difficult, at best. I have read the sx are about the same for both? My robotic surgeon tells me outcomes are better for surgery and said there were studies on PubMed to back that up. I haven't found them so far. If I knew I'd have to have radiation because the cancer was extending into the nerves (?) I'd just go with radiation but I guess they won't know that until they get my prostate out?",

      "Content": "Not sure what happened to my previous post but I will go ahead and write it again from memory. It went something like this: Most men come to forums looking for treatment answers. Many have not decided what treatment to do. I didn't. If you look on cancer forums you will see many men show up undecided. After research they decide. As far as moderation goes: saying radiation is for \"old men\" is not the words of an unbiased moderator but of someone very biased against treating PCa via any radiation treatment and such a person should probably not be a moderator if he can't keep that bias to himself. Bias can hurt people. In the pursuit of truth we have to say that there is no Gold Standard for PCa treatment. There has never been head to head trials. That is why doctors offer all treatment modalities for men to pick from (unless there is a medical reason not to). Stating that \"surgery is the Gold Standard\" is recommending a treatment and is also saying that all other treatments are inferior. Facts just don't back up that statement. MODERATOR'S NOTE: Blank, I am not going to tolerate the attacks you are presenting up above. Things that I have said are only repeats of what TOP DOCTORS have said. The comments did not originate with me. I will ask you one more time to stop being so limited in your acceptance of what others here happen to say. I guess what I am asking is for you to grow up a bit and be more tolerant of those who do not conform to your own opinions.",

      "Content": "Hi there, Welcome and I'm sorry you've got cancer. It's a startling diagnosis and takes times to sink in. I imagine you'll go through the range of emotions most of us: disbelief, anger, denial, etc. If I were in your shoes I'd see a doctor in each specialty (or two) and make a list of questions. All treatments provide roughly the same cure levels (based on a particular man's age and other stats - for example a 40 year old *might* be better served by surgery while a 70 year old *might* be better off with radiation). If the cancer is confined to the prostate it doesn't matter if you can't have surgery after radiation. There is a good deal of controversy as to where surgery is possible after radiation depending on what doctor you talk to - I've heard all sides of it from doctors but if the radiation is a success (and I believe the only reason it would not be is because the PCa had already escaped the gland) you would not need it. It is the same for surgery: if the cancer is truly confined to the prostate you won't need salvage radiation because the surgeon - if he is a good one - removes the cancer with the gland. Most places do something of a blind biopsy taking X amount of cores and sometimes they *miss* areas (the anterior apex to be specific). Later the pathologist sometimes upgrades the Gleason (again I think this happens in 25-30% of cases but don't quote me on that) (and I wonder if the fact that most biopsies don't get the anterior apex is the reason many are later upgraded upon removal of the gland?). Based on a Gleason 6 you have some time to research and decide what to do. The biggest factor after deciding is the competence of the doctor doing the procedure. I saw one RO who only had 20 under his belt for HDR brachytherapy. He was off my list in a hurry (UCLA has done over 5000 of them to give an idea). I'm not a doctor and new to this (was dx'd in November). I decided on brachytherapy and will be having it done March 5th. I was pretty squirrelly until I decided. This kind of thing gnaws at us - at least it did me. I was scared. Really scared. I still am but not like I was. I have every confidence brachytherapy will cure me. Good luck.",

I see people saying this a lot but I feel it is a bit misleading (maybe on a few levels). If radiation, or surgery, fails it is because the PCa has escaped the prostate correct? That's my understanding. Surgery to remove the prostate would not be the treatment option in that case under any circumstances would it? I just am not following the logic here.",

All treatments provide roughly the same cure levels (based on a particular man's age and other stats - for example a 40 year old *might* be better served by surgery while a 70 year old *might* be better off with radiation). If the cancer is confined to the prostate it doesn't matter if you can't have surgery after radiation. There is a good deal of controversy as to where surgery is possible after radiation depending on what doctor you talk to - I've heard all sides of it from doctors but if the radiation is a success (and I believe the only reason it would not be is because the PCa had already escaped the gland) you would not need it. It is the same for surgery: if the cancer is truly confined to the prostate you won't need salvage radiation because the surgeon - if he is a good one - removes the cancer with the gland. Most places do something of a blind biopsy taking X amount of cores and sometimes they *miss* areas (the anterior apex to be specific). Later the pathologist sometimes upgrades the Gleason (again I think this happens in 25-30% of cases but don't quote me on that) (and I wonder if the fact that most biopsies don't get the anterior apex is the reason many are later upgraded upon removal of the gland?). Based on a Gleason 6 you have some time to research and decide what to do. The biggest factor after deciding is the competence of the doctor doing the procedure. I saw one RO who only had 20 under his belt for HDR brachytherapy. He was off my list in a hurry (UCLA has done over 5000 of them to give an idea). I'm not a doctor and new to this (was dx'd in November). I decided on brachytherapy and will be having it done March 5th. I was pretty squirrelly until I decided. This kind of thing gnaws at us - at least it did me. I was scared. Really scared. I still am but not like I was. I have every confidence brachytherapy will cure me. Good luck.",

      "Content": "I had brachtherapy at the Chicago Prostate Center March 6. I am 56 and in good health. I had no urinary issues or ED pre-treatment (or post-treatment). Outside of urinary urgency (handled by Rapaflo) I have no complaints. My sexual side effects are dry orgasm (hard to get used to and heightened by the Rapaflo). I am erect and have had no loss in penis length (as is sometimes the case with surgery). My recovery time was a few days/weeks (I say weeks because if I wanted to work out I had to wait weeks despite feeling well enough in a day or so). I'd say whatever treatment you decide on get a very experienced doctor. Mine had 15,000 seed implants under his belt. If I had picked surgery I'd have picked open (I feel it is superior over DaVinci) over robotic and made sure my surgeon had near 1000 surgeries. Deciding on which road to take was a very tough choice for me. I agonized for months. Good luck.",
