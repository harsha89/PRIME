I am currently on leave from work until early next month, and am wondering how I would work having to go through 8 or so Depends pads a day.

      "Content": "Well folks, I have officially joined the club. Got a call from my urologist this morning, and I have prostate cancer. He informed me that my cancer (and it feels weird for me to say those words) is \"high risk.\" I will need surgery and likely radiation. The long and short of it is that the right lateral mid is a Gleason 4 + 4, so he informed me that if we don't treat it, it will metastasize. I want to thank you guys for being such a great support as I went through my cystoscopy and transrectal prostate biopsy. The next steps, he informed me, will be to get a bone scan done to make sure it has not spread to my bones, and a CAT scan to make sure it has not spread to my lymph nodes and surrounding tissues. I will let you know when these results come in. Thanks again. Max.",
