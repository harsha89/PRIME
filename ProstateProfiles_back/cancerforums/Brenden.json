      "Content": "Was wondering if any of you have ever set off the alarm when you've gone through TSA's airport full-body security scanners while traveling by air. I just returned from a trip and set off the alarms in every airport full-body scanner I went through (i.e., Denver, Chicago, Dayton, Portland, Or.), which required that I be subjected to full body pat downs by TSA's agents each time. What's amazing is that over 60% of my body lit up and I have no idea why, nor does TSA. It's unlikely that it was caused by my radiation levels since I finished my rad treatments nearly 4 years. I'm Stage 4 (lots of bone mets) and the only drugs I'm on are Lupron (3-month injections) and Xgeva (monthly) Any ideas?",

      "Content": "Nope; haven't had any type scan in nearly a year. That's why I'm thinking the cause might be some chem compound that's in either the Xgeva or Lupron. I've got an appointment with my doc this Tue, and I'll ask him if he has any ideas, but I doubt he will. I've Googled for answers to the problem but didn't find any possible causes. If I learn anything I'll do a follow up post to let you all know what I found out. Anyhow, thanks for your feedback.",

      "Content": "I was diagnosed as a Gleason 9 PC guy about 3.5 years ago. Was treated with radiation and was on Lupron for 9 months until I stopped taking the shots because of the energy-draining side effects I was experiencing. As expected, my PSA has steadily risen, and was around 400 the last time I had it checked. My PC has now spread throughout my entire skeletal structure. Besides pain meds and pot, the only other med I\u0092m taking is Casodex. My doc is a pretty optimistic guy and thinks I might it another year. I sure hope so, but I suspect my time might be coming up sooner. The reason for my post is that I\u0092m looking for an honest rundown on what I can expect my life to be like during my final few months. Can any of you regular posters point me to a previous post that might help me look ahead to where I\u0092m headed?",
