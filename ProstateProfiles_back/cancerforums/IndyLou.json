I would work with my doctor to get your testosterone levels back where they're comfortable and decreasing all of these other nasty side effects. But, I would also discuss active surveillance of your prostate so that if you do come down with PC, you catch it early and can act on it quickly.

There may be many ways, including thermography, of detecting things in the body that look like cancer.

Knowing exactly the type of cancer and the cause is crucial sometimes, in selecting the proper treatment. I am very much insulted with the statement that people with cancer have not been cured.

      "Content": "I am a head & neck cancer survivor, so I cannot speak specifically to prostate cancer, but I'd like to share my thoughts. First, I think it's wise that you're considering the \"big picture.\" I think all cancer patients have to deal with two basic options: 1) don't treat; 2) treat and deal with the side-effects. Sometimes, the side effects are so severe and the subsequent quality of life so degraded that the patients elect not to treat. If no treatment is taken, that patient may succumb relatively quick to the growing cancer inside their body. That is choice to weigh. If a treatment is taken, the patient must deal with any side effects which could remain to some degree, for their remainder of their lives. That said, if the treatment allows the patient to live a relatively long and mostly-normal life, is dealing with the side-effects a good trade-off? When it came to \"signing off\" on my treatment (one that included RT, targeted monoclonal antibodies and subsequent surgery), I had complete faith in my medical team, including my oncologist. They presented me with the potential outcomes and side-effects, though to be honest, I could not have anticipated the degree at which some of the effects were felt. Some things, like my swallowing, are still a slight issue three years out. But I'm cancer-free, and I'm enjoying my family and friends and life, nearly as before. If your father's health is in good shape and he would otherwise have many good years in front of him, I'd advise him to talk with his doctors, ensuring he understands all the options and their outcomes. If he elects for the HT and there are side effects, can they be managed? Cancer changes everyone to some degree; you (or your father) must ask whether or not the \"juice is worth the squeeze,\" so to speak.",

I tried to emphasize some points that I thought visitors to this forum would find interesting. I am involved with a lot of early-phase clinical trials in my line of work, dealing specifically with the study drug. In many of the Phase 1 trials, I see a lot of blinding performed by the site pharmacist. Typically, they prepare a dose of either study drug or placebo, then give it to the clinician for administering to the patient. Again, great job with the initial content!",

      "Content": "Hello, Djin--very good information you shared. I would like to add a couple comments about \"blinded\" trials. To prevent bias from creeping into some trials, sometimes, the study design will incorporate blinding. Blinding can be done in several ways, but the two main types are: - Single-Blind: this means the patient alone is not aware of the treatment they're receiving. - Double-Blind: this means that both the patient AND the doctor or clinician administering the medicine is not aware of the treatment they're administering or receiving. The treatment--the medicine used in a clinical trial--can be blinded in a number of different ways. It can be blinded by manufacturing the control medicine and the study drug to look the same way; i.e., same color, shape, size, package or label. In some cases, it's not possible to alter the medicine's appearance, so the packaging may include some kind of barrier to prevent patients or clinicians from seeing the material. Sometimes, the study drug is blinded to see how it performs against a comparative drug, and sometimes a study drug is used against a placebo, to see the difference in results. A placebo is a non-medicinal product that looks like the study drug, but contains no active ingredients. (Typically, these are made of starch-like materials.) It should also be known that for serious, life-threatening diseases (including cancers), it is considered unethical to administer only placebo to a patient. For cancer patients, it's typical to choose a treatment that's considered a standard of care (SOC) for a particular disease. For example, enzalutamide is often given to prostate cancer patients, and would be considered a SOC for that disease. A study design could include that SOC + placebo as a control group in one arm, and the SOC + a different study drug in the test arm. In both arms, the SOC is given, but never placebo alone. I hope others find this helpful.",

      "Content": "Those are all great points, Djin. Honestly, books could be written about all the specifics that go into clinical trials (and they have!) I tried to emphasize some points that I thought visitors to this forum would find interesting. I am involved with a lot of early-phase clinical trials in my line of work, dealing specifically with the study drug. In many of the Phase 1 trials, I see a lot of blinding performed by the site pharmacist. Typically, they prepare a dose of either study drug or placebo, then give it to the clinician for administering to the patient. Again, great job with the initial content!",

      "Content": "Personally, I would not get too caught up in the \"x\" value, favoring one doctor over another. You can quickly get to a point of diminishing returns, when all you really might need is a surgeon with a reasonable amount of experience. Before any surgery, discuss the procedure with your doctor or surgeon. Ask them questions such as, - How many of these types of surgeries have you performed? - What is the typical outcome? - Is there anything about MY situation that concerns you, anything that might present a problem that could affect the outcome? - What risks, if any, come with this surgery? (They should spell all of these out in the consent form--if you see anything that alarms you, you should definitely ask about it.) - Should I expect any side effects from the surgery? Will it be permanent or if not, how long should my recovery be until I return to normal? I'm sure there are many other questions you could ask, but have a discussion. When you do, gauge the comfort level of your doctor--are they completely comfortable with the procedure? Do they sound confident, or do they have concerns? If you feel at all like they may not be the best for you, ask them if you should seek another surgeon.",
