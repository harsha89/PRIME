      "Content": "About 5 years ago I had RRP. After my surgery my urologist suggested that I use the Pos-T-Vac Therapy System to help with the healing process. Not only will the Pos-T-Vac pull new oxygenated blood to the penis helping the healing, but it also helps so the penis is not shortened by pulling it up into the body and losing some of your length. Almost every time you have a procedure on the prostate ED maybe a side effect. It could be short term but it also could turn out to be long term. I was extremely happy with the results that I achieved with the pump. I would suggest this form of therapy to any man having prostate or Erectile Dysfunction problems.",
