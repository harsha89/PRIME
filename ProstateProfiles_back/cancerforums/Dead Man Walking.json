      "Content": "Yes, a very interesting read indeed! It offers a completely different point of view of cancer as a whole, and resonates with the peculiarity of my case of refractory leukemia which is now also indolent. My \"disease\" was discovered by accident due to a pre-op physical, and I had absolutely no symptoms at all. Subsequent genetic analysis in several BMB's turn up a small percentage of a very lethal and refractory mutation (inv) t(3:3) which normal chemotherapy cannot touch, but the percentage of this mutation is minimal and stable. In the real world, my immune system appears to be nearly bulletproof, since my 18 month old grandson managed to give his mother and both grandmothers a grand mal puking malady that I avoided despite giving him itchy old Grandpa zerbers on his bare belly. (Repeatedly, at that!) Up until now I had thought that perhaps it was the azacitidine therapy which might have turned the tide, but the concept that I am simply \"barren ground\" for leukemia would explain a whole lot about why I'm still here. The parallel theory that I have been harboring is that I'm still here due to divine providence due to the work that Annabelle and I do, and at least in my own head I doubt that these pathways are mutually exclusive or substantially different. Trained as an organic chemist, I have certainly had plenty of benzene exposure, as well as decades of exposure to different solvent based adhesives, so I have to be in the top 3% of all people who have been exposed to benzene and other organic solvents in their lifetime. It's impossible to tell if this exposure caused my leukemia, or caused me to become barren ground, or both, so there's little point in dwelling on that. This concept, however, does provide a reason why MDS (under 20% blasts) and AML (over 20% blasts) can be so radically different in progress and lethality.",

      "Content": "After sitting at this post and staring at it for a few minutes, I think there are a couple of different ways of looking at it. The 1st is age, and in my case my oncologist is probably in her mid 30's with a fair amount of postdoctoral background, and we get along very well, probably because she is addicted to Annabelle! However, it's pretty obvious that somebody in their early 60's will have tons more experience, and if he's the head of the leukemia department, then that's a further step up. So far as diagnoses are concerned, age/experience in the field is desirable. Moving on to treatment, you're pretty much \"out in the swamp\" and there are multiple ways to look at it. The first is the \"bookmaker approach\", and it's valuable to have somebody who can most accurately give you the correct odds for your case. The 2nd tier beyond bookmaker is someone who can give you correct odds, and THEN integrate in whatever it is that you \"want\". By this I mean, you could want longevity over quality of life, or just the opposite, or some combination? You need to think about this and decide what it is that you're really after. For a concrete example, compare a married guy in his 40's with PC, versus a widowed guy in his late 60's. Them's two different ballparks! If the doctor leads you through this discussion, that's an obvious plus right there! The last is the personal connection, and this will depend on your own personality and your goals, and talking to somebody that seems to behave in a similar fashion. For two afternoons a week I am literally immersed in every kind of medical personnel, and patient, and family member that you can think of, and so I get along best with the quick talkers and dog grabbers who see what I'm sharing and want some immediately. That is the personal connection! In conclusion, while the personal connection is easy to spot and relate to, when your butt or your \"Johnson\" or your life is on the line, you really have to consider everything, and spend some time thinking about it too. If they all look the same to you, then maybe some more introspection on your part is required.",

Does your brother have years of experience building and flying aircraft already, or did this passion arrive with the prostate cancer? If the answer is the latter, then what your brother is attempting is the equivalent of him getting to the controls of a particle accelerator and trying to use it to cure his own cancer. I apologize for the drama, but building an aircraft is an incredibly complex and demanding project, and then attempting to learn how to fly ON a homebuilt aircraft is essentially suicide. The only good news here is that you are a psychologist, so at least you have a background to help your brother, provided he wants help. If you have any details about what he is attempting to build, you can PM me with the details, and I have a source that is still in the EAA side of aviation. My hopes and best wishes that your brother can recover from whatever psychological damage the cancer did to him. Best regards, DMW",

If you have any details about what he is attempting to build, you can PM me with the details, and I have a source that is still in the EAA side of aviation. My hopes and best wishes that your brother can recover from whatever psychological damage the cancer did to him. Best regards, DMW",

      "Content": "To the OP: I have no idea and nothing to contribute as far as your brother's cancer experience, but as someone who was a hang glider pilot for 13 years and also was involved, unfortunately, with the fatality side of kit airplanes and the Experimental Aircraft Association, building your own aircraft of any sort is an incredibly dangerous undertaking. Does your brother have years of experience building and flying aircraft already, or did this passion arrive with the prostate cancer? If the answer is the latter, then what your brother is attempting is the equivalent of him getting to the controls of a particle accelerator and trying to use it to cure his own cancer.

Then again, the 7-3 rubicin regimen is also supposed to be the mainstay of leukemia treatment... Based on the fact that he is still conscious and capable of expressing himself, if that's what he wants, then that's what's going to happen. While it's your dad who has the cancer, you might consider adopting the attitude that us \"hard cases\" in here have, which is simple, unconditional, acceptance. Once you're diagnosed, all the bargaining and wishing and hoping isn't going to accomplish diddly squat, so you might as well just heave all that dead weight overboard! You might also have a short talk with him about this, and simply tell him you will honor his wishes through this journey. That might bring some mental peace to him and also your relationship with him, and it will let you off the hook in your own mind!! No matter how much he suffers, this is what he wants, and you may want to keep telling yourself that as things go along. I hope and pray that you can find some peace in this unpleasant situation.

In addition, since saw palmetto is a natural plant extract and has NOT undergone rigorous clinical testing which is supervised and approved by the FDA, it falls into the very suspect \"herbal supplement\" category of medical treatment that is positively infested with fake cures for every disease out there. There is some evidence that saw palmetto may have some clinical benefit, but at present it is NOT an approved or proven medical treatment for ANY medical condition currently known. Attached is a link from Sloan Kettering describing evidence which may suggest some clinical benefit, but that's as fat as it goes, and this is 2017 information. https://www.mskcc.org/cancer-care/in...s/saw-palmetto Caveat emptor, [let the buyer beware!!] Dead Man Walking",

      "Content": "Dear Jennifer: My deepest sympathies for all the misery you dad and you are going through, and it certainly sounds like he is getting near the end. Have you looked into hospice care yet? At some point in a battle with cancer, when there is no quality of life left, changing direction and opting for palliative care can be a blessing to the patient and the family. Hospices can use medications as they see fit for the sole purpose of making the patient comfortable, and they also may have grief counseling and some religious support as well. You can ask the hospital where your dad is located about these resources, and you can also Google hospices in your area. I pray you and your dad find the support you need to finish his journey in peace. Best regards, DMW",

Today the large medical system in New Orleans that I volunteer for had a men's health day at the New Orleans Saint's training facility, and my manager suggested I show up with Annabelle just for the heck of it. They had about 20 stations where you could get blood drawn for various tests, like PSA, and all the rest of the tests for the prostate that I can never keep straight. The patient flow was light, so Annabelle got petted by EVERY nurse and doctor there. As it turns out, the senior urologist in his 50's came up and petted her, and he has a female poodle at home. Her name?? . . . . . . . This is her REAL name... . . . . . Rigid Bardot!!! . . . . .",

The azacitidine is supposed to leach out of your fat layer, but the irritation for the days 1-4 can drive you nuts. Creams fail because they occlude the skin and make the pain underneath last longer. Greasy sprays, same problem. the one thing that has worked for me is \"cooling itch relief spray, which is a non-greasy aerosol with 1.0% hydrocortisone. It allows the skin to breath but kills off most of the pain and itching. Now: I think this may be a good solution or a bad idea, but you're \"going to have to ask Mr. Johnson\".

      "Content": "Well, as the Official \"Dead Man Walking\", I'm not sure whether to give you a whack on the head for encroaching on my turf, of telling you that people in here can indeed have some positively dreadful diagnoses, and that you could be here for a verrrrrrryyy looooonggg time. Cancer is not an exact science, and all sorts of things can happen. There are a LOT of people in here that had only a 1% chance of survival, and yet we're still here. The most serious mistake diagnosed newcomers like yourself make is to try hanging on to some sort of hope based on the ups and downs of their disease, and you need to lost this linkage entirely!! I was the lucky one in here because I pitched the whole concept of worry into the dumpster and have NEVER looked back. If you can get to that point, you can enjoy a fairly decent quality of life living with cancer, and with a diagnosis that I'm going to live another 3-5 years, I have to completely rearrange my priorities because I never expected to live to 70, much less 72! If your PC has metasticized to your bones, then the fat is in the fire and you might as well enjoy the ride for as long as it lasts. Luckily for you, the PC guys are the largest segment of this forum, so there will be lot of war stories and people to talk to. So welcome aboard, and get used to your new home. Sincerely, DMW",
