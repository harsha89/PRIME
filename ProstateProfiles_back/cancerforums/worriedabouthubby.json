      "Content": "Don't know if my signature with hubby's stats will show- so here's his stats so far Age 57 First ever PSA due to life insurance 'physical'- Aug. 10 PSA 73.76 PCP repeated PSA and did DRE on Aug. 20- PSA 81, DRE- 'firm' Uro- did DRE (firm) Aug. 28- scheduled biopsy Biopsy- Aug. 30 8 out of 8 cores positive Gleason 5+4=9 cores range from 50% to 90% involved (lowest gleason core was 4+3=7) CT and bone scan on Sept. 5- no sign of spread DaVinci scheduled for Oct. 9 Hubby chose surgery because URO told him he couldn't have surgery after radiation, but could have radiation/ HT after surgery if needed. Fully prepared for ED, incontinence, etc. Knows uro can't use nerve sparing techniques. Wants it out! Also want to 'really know' if it's contained, 'real' Gleason, etc. Hubby truly believes scans are 'right'- I tried to explain that they won't 'show' any spread until it's significant- esp. the CT. There will be no more tests prior to surgery and no second opinion at this time- I've accepted that. Putting things out for him to read, more discussions, etc. would only anger him. NOT going to do that. My biggest concers are 1-the very fast rising PSA (doubling rate about 8 weeks), 2-high gleason (which I expect surgery will show is really a 10), 3-90% involvement in some cores which to me indicates very high possiblity of extracapular involvment, 4-and sympotms hubby has show over the past year (which he is in denial about)- more frequent urination,fatigue, back, neck, jaw and foot pain. My questions now are- Can they do Free vs attached PSA, PAP, PCA3 tests sometime post surgery? I know they will do a regular PSA about 3 months after surgery. Would an MRI be more likely to show mets than a CT and/or Bone scan? Why / how? This won't happen prior to surgery- but I may push for one sometime post surgery. What pain (and other symptoms) should I watch for - especially for bone (and other) mets? He doesn't handle pain well in the first place. What I've read so far indicates bone mets are extrememly painful. Not to brag, but I know a good bit of anatomy - even have a very basic medical understanding, and have taken some biology and pre-EMT/first responder classes in the past- so know advanced first aid and can 'speak' /understand 'doctor' rather well. I know where his lymph glands are - they do swell regularly since his bout with rock mt. spotted fever 8 years ago. I recognize nerve bundles when I massage his feet/legs/back/neck, etc. and can 'follow' his pain. It may sound weird- but I am somthing of an empath. I just want to be ready and able to help him. Knowledge is power to me. Another 'weird' thing about me (at least in my family)- I'd rather prepare for and expect the worst- then if things turn out better I'm ok. I HATE to be 'blindsided' by 'worse' news. THANKS SO MUCH FOR LISTENING and for all the advice. I know I sometimes over react to criticism of how 'he' is proceeding. But that is just frustration on my part.",

      "Content": "Hello! I just found this forum. I thought I'd share where 'we' are and what is about to happen and see if anyone has any advice for me. My husband and I were trying to get some new life insurance policies. Had to have blood work done for them. He had his first ever PSA (he seldom goes to the doctor- lots of reasons- but last previous visit was 8 years ago when he had Rocky Mt. Spotted Fever) on Aug. 10. It came back as 73.76. I immediately got him in with my primary care doctor. they repeated the PSA and did a DRE. The PSA came back as 81 and doctor said prostate was 'firm'. Referred to a Urologist. He did a DRE and said hubby needed a biopsy. 8 cores- all positive with Gleason of 5+4=9 (some cores were 90% involved- some as little as 50%). Had CT and Bone scans- they came back 'negative' (ie- no detectable mets). Hubby decided on Davinci surgery- now scheduled for Oct. 9. I have been trying to prepare for the 'post surgery' time. I have some disposable mattress pads (left over from caring for mother-in-law), wipes, and plastic bucket/container. We already have a recliner chair, and he has some loose shorts and sweat pants. I will be getting alcohol wipes, and neosporin or cortizone or other 'lubricant' for use with catheter( will ask uro about which). I picked up a sample pack of 'real fit' depends and have ordered a sample pack of their pads. I'll buy whichever (or both) he decides he wants. Are there any other things I should have on hand for that first week home after surgery? He will have the surgery on Tues. and dr. expects to send him home on Thursday. (my sister-in-law will be taking care of mother-in-law for me that week). I've done alot of 'caring' for others in the past few years - helped my mom with my dad his last few months, cared/caring for mom-in-law for last 5 years (strokes, heart problems, broken hip, etc.) and help my mom some (back surgery, bad knees, etc.). But this is harder- it's my husband! And he's nervous (of course)- but doesn't want to really talk or make many decisions (I've asked what kind of jello and soup, etc. he wants me to have on hand - but he said wait......). I handle my nervousness by thinking and planning..... Thanks for any help.",

      "Content": "I have tried to get my husband to get another opinion. Originally we thought surgery would not be an option- plus he really didn't want it- afraid of the catheter. But once the scans came back 'clear' he became convinced that it is contained, we're getting it before it spreads, etc. I can't convince him otherwise. He won't go for anymore opinions. He cna be VERY stubborn when he makes up his mind. He is absolutely convinced this doc is the best and won't even think about talking to a radiologist or oncologist. I can't push anymore without making him REALLY angry- and neither of us needs that.",

      "Content": "Congratulations on your good news. I hope you get a great post-surgery blood work report. My husband is scheduled for a DaVinci procedure in 2 weeks. though his initial numbers are much worse than yours were, I hope he has as smooth an experience as you. He is really dreading the catheter (he almost chose NOT to have surgery just because of it). Additionally, he is deathly afraid of needles (nurse broke one off in his arm as a child- and he has VERY small veins and they roll and colapse easily...). He is starting to get really nervous- but won't talk about it- just acts grouchy and tells me not to mind him! I hope things continue to go well for you.",
