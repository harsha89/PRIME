Here's one it's easy to find others . http://www.europeanurology.com/artic...l-implications Unfortunately I do have first hand knowledge of \"T\" use. After struggling with anemia for a long period, I was introduced to a Physician that thought he could help me. After a undergoing a broad panel of blood/urine tests, he advised that since I was low to very low on many things, including \"T\" that he suggested six weekly injections followed with another test. I specifically ask if there wasn't a connection between Testosterone and PCa. His reply was that \" Testosterone does not cause Prostate Cancer\". I was too naive to ask the now obvious follow up: does exacerbate existing or latent Cancer? After 6 weeks of injections tests showed that it had indeed enhanced many of my low values. It had also shot my PSA to 6.5 from 3.?. He quickly washed his hands of me and sent me off to a Uro that specialized in Da Vinci. An incredibly unpleasant biopsy came back positive in 2/12, 3+3=6 5%. 22 months later I was 4+3=7 2/12 60%. After careful deliberation with several well reputed Drs. in different disciplines, I elected to be treated with Proton Therapy at Provision Proton Therapy in Knoxville Tennessee. I'll be very glad to pass more info along to anyone interested but the procedure was a breeze with no, AND I MEAN NO SIDE EFFECTS! Because of my experience there, I have volunteered to become an Ambassador for the program, assisting anyone desiring information about the process or helping with daily life while in residence here for treatment. The decision to treat is extremely personal and certainly one size does not fit all, so I would just like to second all of the posters here that advise exploring ALL methods of treatment and do not let your health professional tell you what to do. As Warren Buffett says, \"don't ask your barber if you need a haircut\". Good luck! .",

      "Content": "Gentlemen (and Ladies present), After months of sitting on the sidelines, kibitzing from the cheap seats, I have finally gotten most of my major pre-winter projects completed and found some time to compose some thoughts about my recent diagnosis of PCA. From a former outsider, I was struck by the amount of information, candor and above all, compassion for the members of the forum. I also appreciated that in trying to portray your situation, many of you also told a great deal about yourselves. I will try to do the same, starting with the fact that I was in RVN during 69 and 70. I only bring this up as I was in and around areas where Agent Orange was used. I do not know if this is pertinent to my diagnosis, but I have loose knowledge that the Veterans Administration may use this information. Perhaps another member of the forum has more knowledge. After 20 years in the military, I quickly transitioned to the freight biz and worked as a \"freight dog\" until mandatory retirement at age 60 in 2007. Since then, I have been thoroughly enjoying life here on the Tennessee River. My time has been gleefully spent on my bike, playing or coaching ice hockey, in a kayak or in the mountains, either riding mountain bikes or parked under a telescope. I also taught TOEFL classes at a local community college. Retirement also gave me time to train as a triathlete for the last few years. 2012 was a particularly good season with a number of wins and an invite to the Nationals. Along the way, and as part of the training, I devoted a great deal of time and effort to effective training including diet. My training diet allowed me to lose a little weight and function at a reasonably high level, but it also had another result: anemia. I have always been at the borderline of anemia as are many endurance athletes, but this was not borderline. I attempted to modify my diet with everything that should work but to no avail. Then one of my friends suggested that I consult a Physician specializing in sports performance which I did. The Doctor went over my recent blood work and history making some suggestions about diet. He also noted that I was at the low threshold of Testosterone and suggested that I try a brief course of T Shots for 6 weeks and retest (everyone see where this is going?). Having only a vague understanding of the relationship between Testosterone and PCA, mostly from the commercials on TV touting T-Gel, I specifically asked if it was safe. He assured me that Testosterone does not cause Prostate Cancer. For 6 weeks, I trained with my tri group, drove down the street and received a shot of Testosterone. On the 6th or 7th week, I swam, ran and rode my brains out just prior to getting my blood work done. Little did I know that PSA was to be a portion of the blood test or I certainly would not have ridden the bike prior to the test. When the results came back, the good news was that I was no longer anemic. The bad news was that my PSA was 6.5, up from 4.5 the previous year. I was scheduled with a local Urologist and just as promptly scheduled for a biopsy. The biopsy came back with 2/12 positive for PCA, with another area determined suspicious. The slides were sent to Johns Hopkins for review by Dr. Epstein who confirmed that the areas, E and L were positive, both 3+3=6, both <5%. Subsequent PSA's have been 6.03 and 6.22. All DRE's before and after have been negative. My Uro, an overly enthusiastic, but talented Surgeon with over 1000 Da Vinci procedures wanted to do surgery on me yesterday, claiming that I was his perfect patient. After briefing my wife and me on all of the possible solutions, leaning heavily on a Da Vinci procedure of course, we opted for a second opinion with a physician from an outside group in another discipline. I was scheduled and met with a Hematology/Oncologist recommended by my CPA. Upon learning that I had been diagnosed with PCa, my CPA (that's wierd) was adamant that I consult with this Physician because he was instrumental in setting her up in the MD Anderson \"Moonshot\" cancer research program. PCa is one of the 10 cancers targeted by the Moonshot Program. (google MD Andersen Moonshot). After a very through review, the Oncologist recommended that I consult with a Radiation Oncologist at the University of Tennessee Medical Center. Again, after a lengthly workup, I had a very in depth conversation with this Physician about the benefits of Brachytheraphy and why I was a good candidate for the procedure, ie, relative low PSA, small volume prostate and in overall good health. More importantly, he was quietly reassuring in that I was not in a situation where an immediate decision had to be made. After I was diagnosed, I sought to be as proactive about my situation as I could. I began preliminary work to enter into a clinical trial called MEAL, Male Eating and Living study. The study is headquartered in San Diego with satellite programs at many Universities and Cancer Centers around the US. Unfortunately for me, the nearest was 3 hours east at Pardee Cancer Center in Hendersonville NC. After a lot of back and forth with the project coordinator, I eventually completed the preliminaries and set out for North Carolina early one morning. Unfortunately, about 20 miles from home, the coordinator called and notified me that I had been disapproved for the study because my Urologist didn't think that I could stay in Active Surveillance for two years recommended for the study. So here I am, biding my time in AS, waiting for the next 4 month PSA for my Rad/Onc and 6 month PSA for my Urologist or until something mandates immediate treatment. Stay tuned.....",

Again, after a lengthly workup, I had a very in depth conversation with this Physician about the benefits of Brachytheraphy and why I was a good candidate for the procedure, ie, relative low PSA, small volume prostate and in overall good health. More importantly, he was quietly reassuring in that I was not in a situation where an immediate decision had to be made. After I was diagnosed, I sought to be as proactive about my situation as I could. I began preliminary work to enter into a clinical trial called MEAL, Male Eating and Living study. The study is headquartered in San Diego with satellite programs at many Universities and Cancer Centers around the US. Unfortunately for me, the nearest was 3 hours east at Pardee Cancer Center in Hendersonville NC. After a lot of back and forth with the project coordinator, I eventually completed the preliminaries and set out for North Carolina early one morning. Unfortunately, about 20 miles from home, the coordinator called and notified me that I had been disapproved for the study because my Urologist didn't think that I could stay in Active Surveillance for two years recommended for the study. So here I am, biding my time in AS, waiting for the next 4 month PSA for my Rad/Onc and 6 month PSA for my Urologist or until something mandates immediate treatment. Stay tuned.....",

      "Content": "Gentlemen (and Ladies present), After months of sitting on the sidelines, kibitzing from the cheap seats, I have finally gotten most of my major pre-winter projects completed and found some time to compose some thoughts about my recent diagnosis of PCA. From a former outsider, I was struck by the amount of information, candor and above all, compassion for the members of the forum. I also appreciated that in trying to portray your situation, many of you also told a great deal about yourselves. I will try to do the same, starting with the fact that I was in RVN during 69 and 70. I only bring this up as I was in and around areas where Agent Orange was used. I do not know if this is pertinent to my diagnosis, but I have loose knowledge that the Veterans Administration may use this information. Perhaps another member of the forum has more knowledge. After 20 years in the military, I quickly transitioned to the freight biz and worked as a \"freight dog\" until mandatory retirement at age 60 in 2007. Since then, I have been thoroughly enjoying life here on the Tennessee River. My time has been gleefully spent on my bike, playing or coaching ice hockey, in a kayak or in the mountains, either riding mountain bikes or parked under a telescope. I also taught TOEFL classes at a local community college. Retirement also gave me time to train as a triathlete for the last few years. 2012 was a particularly good season with a number of wins and an invite to the Nationals. Along the way, and as part of the training, I devoted a great deal of time and effort to effective training including diet. My training diet allowed me to lose a little weight and function at a reasonably high level, but it also had another result: anemia. I have always been at the borderline of anemia as are many endurance athletes, but this was not borderline. I attempted to modify my diet with everything that should work but to no avail. Then one of my friends suggested that I consult a Physician specializing in sports performance which I did. The Doctor went over my recent blood work and history making some suggestions about diet. He also noted that I was at the low threshold of Testosterone and suggested that I try a brief course of T Shots for 6 weeks and retest (everyone see where this is going?). Having only a vague understanding of the relationship between Testosterone and PCA, mostly from the commercials on TV touting T-Gel, I specifically asked if it was safe. He assured me that Testosterone does not cause Prostate Cancer. For 6 weeks, I trained with my tri group, drove down the street and received a shot of Testosterone. On the 6th or 7th week, I swam, ran and rode my brains out just prior to getting my blood work done. Little did I know that PSA was to be a portion of the blood test or I certainly would not have ridden the bike prior to the test. When the results came back, the good news was that I was no longer anemic. The bad news was that my PSA was 6.5, up from 4.5 the previous year. I was scheduled with a local Urologist and just as promptly scheduled for a biopsy. The biopsy came back with 2/12 positive for PCA, with another area determined suspicious. The slides were sent to Johns Hopkins for review by Dr. Epstein who confirmed that the areas, E and L were positive, both 3+3=6, both <5%. Subsequent PSA's have been 6.03 and 6.22. All DRE's before and after have been negative. My Uro, an overly enthusiastic, but talented Surgeon with over 1000 Da Vinci procedures wanted to do surgery on me yesterday, claiming that I was his perfect patient. After briefing my wife and me on all of the possible solutions, leaning heavily on a Da Vinci procedure of course, we opted for a second opinion with a physician from an outside group in another discipline. I was scheduled and met with a Hematology/Oncologist recommended by my CPA. Upon learning that I had been diagnosed with PCa, my CPA (that's wierd) was adamant that I consult with this Physician because he was instrumental in setting her up in the MD Anderson \"Moonshot\" cancer research program. PCa is one of the 10 cancers targeted by the Moonshot Program. (google MD Andersen Moonshot). After a very through review, the Oncologist recommended that I consult with a Radiation Oncologist at the University of Tennessee Medical Center. Again, after a lengthly workup, I had a very in depth conversation with this Physician about the benefits of Brachytheraphy and why I was a good candidate for the procedure, ie, relative low PSA, small volume prostate and in overall good health. More importantly, he was quietly reassuring in that I was not in a situation where an immediate decision had to be made. After I was diagnosed, I sought to be as proactive about my situation as I could. I began preliminary work to enter into a clinical trial called MEAL, Male Eating and Living study. The study is headquartered in San Diego with satellite programs at many Universities and Cancer Centers around the US. Unfortunately for me, the nearest was 3 hours east at Pardee Cancer Center in Hendersonville NC. After a lot of back and forth with the project coordinator, I eventually completed the preliminaries and set out for North Carolina early one morning. Unfortunately, about 20 miles from home, the coordinator called and notified me that I had been disapproved for the study because my Urologist didn't think that I could stay in Active Surveillance for two years recommended for the study. So here I am, biding my time in AS, waiting for the next 4 month PSA for my Rad/Onc and 6 month PSA for my Urologist or until something mandates immediate treatment. Stay tuned.....",
