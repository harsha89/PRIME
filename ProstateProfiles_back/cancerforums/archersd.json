      "Content": "Hello , my name is Steve and i was diagnosed with prostate cancer about an month ago. Initial psa around 2 then a year later almost 6. Biopsy and the rest is history. 4+3 in 2 sites and 2 other low risk sites as well. Bone scan and CT clear. I have talked with my urologist who is a good open surgeon but did reccomend I go see a radiation oncologist just to get all the info. Had a very good meeting for almost an hour but in some ways am more confused. I think each specialty has its own take and bias' on the mode of treatment. It has been very helpful to read some of the posts on the forum. I have another meeting with a surgeon who does do lap/robotic surgery next week to go over the surgical option. I am 48 and am still struggling with the idea of the whole thing. 3 kids and a great wife. Need to do what is the best long term solution. In British Columbia the cancer institute has some pretty good stats on the seed therapy. Any comments.",
