      "Content": "I went to talk to a Robotic Surgeon, he had me get a MRI before he would advise me on whether to have surgery or stay on WW. He said basing MRI on a 1-10 score, it was a 1 and told me if I was his Dad, he would delay surgery and feel comfortable to stay on WW. I told him I had a biopsy coming up at the V.A. in a few months. He said it can't hurt to get the biopsy. Went for biopsy last Thursday. At biopsy Dr. told me PSA went from 3.0(as of last PSA) to 4.6 while on Finasteride, which shouldn't happen. Wait another week for results. If readings are worse than last year's biopsy, guess I'll be contacting Robotic surgeon again and get the prostate out. Bottom line MRI showed nothing to worry about a few months ago, and now PSA reading possibly showing a need to take action now ????? ( V.A. uro doc wasn't impressed that I went for MRI on my own )",

I have been looking outside VA in this area for another UroDoc. I Found one that's got a lot of experience with DaVinci Robotic. When I talked to VA today, I was told my UroDoc is suppose to be back by end of March now. VA here only does Open surgery, but my Urologist has a lot of surgeries on his belt. I now have to decide on staying with my surgeon, or the other. I know it's my decision, but need help deciding. Are there any members here that had Open surgery and regret it ?

      "Content": "Hi all, Thought I was all set for RP on 4/25. RIGHTTT !! V.A. sent me letter to reschedule 3/10 PSA and counsel. I called and was told my Uro was going on medical leave ??? I was told I could come in 4/19 for PSA and counsel. I said I'll be in Aruba then. How about 4/22 ? Was told I could get blood drawn at 6am, see anesthesiologist at 9am and Uro at 9:30. Still have RP the 25th. I said I thought Uro was out on medical leave ? He is , you'll get a different surgeon. I said I never even met the doc, I don't think so. I'm not trusting my morbidity to a stranger. I can't believe they thought I would be ok with that. So now I have to see a Humana in network primary doc to get referral to a Uro. Guess only good thing may be that V.A. only did open RP and Uro doc's on the outside round here do Robotic. Maybe it's a Godsend. Stay tuned......",

      "Content": "Am responding to Highlander and Jim. In response to head spinning and why I haven't done anything yet. When my VA urologist told me my PSA went to 9.54, he told me I should think about treatment. After reading benefits of Robotic, I started searching for a Robotic surgeon. Meanwhile my VA urodoc put me on Finasteride to keep prostate from enlarging till I got back from vacation. When I got back, I finally found Robotic surgeon that was approved by Humana Ins( A real PITA ). I had two follow up PSA's that showed my PSA dropping ( 2nd one showed 3.0). VA doc said that's a good sign and I could stay on AS. I went to Robotic surgeon and he said he wouldn't advise me either way without 3T MRI ( He was surprised nobody suggested me getting one before ). Got MRI results and he said no sings of spreading outside prostate and vary low grade. He suggested staying on AS, because at my age(66) I have NO issues with ED or incontinence. He said a high % of issues after operation, depending on individual. I told him I had a biopsy coming up at VA and he said would be good idea to have it done. He said if I need him further, he's there for for me. Robotic surgeon is first surgeon in S.C. to do operation. Has great reviews. Had biopsy (12 cores, that's all they do) done last Thursday and go back to VA for results on the 21st. I mentioned the MRI that I had done and he really didn't seem impressed. He told me day of biopsy, that my PSA went up to 4.6 which is not good since I'm on Finasteride. I'll see what the results are. If results show cancer got worse. I'll call Robotic doc and make appointment for surgery. The other thing that I think about is statistics of cancer survival after treatment or not doing anything. From what I've seen chances are ya don't live any longer, either way. So live with cancer and still have sex and no dripping, or get rid of it and no sex and dripping( ain't getting injections to get hard either). Now MY head is spinning and Thanks guys for listening !!!!! John",

Why if I have it done, am going down to Charleston( non VA hospital) for Robotic. End up paying more out of pocket, but quicker recovery, less blood loss and less chance of infection. At least that's what I've heard. John",
