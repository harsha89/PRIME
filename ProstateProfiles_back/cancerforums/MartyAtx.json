      "Content": "Hi Everyone, I've been going over my path report and have updated my signature. Did I miss any information? I do have a few questions that I'm wondering about. When I was discussing my path report with the Dr., I asked him about the positive margins. His explaination was that the prostate was enlarged and he went as far as he could. I guess this makes sense to me. He also gave me a printout of my Han Table: Recurrence Probabilty 3 years after surgery 10% 5 years after surgery 16% 7 years after surgery 23% 10 years after surgery 28% To me, this sounds like as time goes by with an undetectable PSA, the chances of a recurrence increases. I've always heard with other cancers that if you pass a certain time period undetected, then you are considered cured. So, when can we, if ever, consider ourselves cured? It's been 3 weeks post surgery and I am still a little sore when I sit. But, feel so much better. I have dribbles occasionally when I stand, sneeze, or cough and but am able to stop urinating midstream without any problem. I did do Kegel for 3 months prior. I've tested my erection status and that's not there yet. The Dr. has not given me any medication yet. However, this is what I was very, very pleasantly surprised at. With the help of my beautiful wife, I was able to achieve orgasm! This was really strange to me. No erection, no nothing! Just an orgasm with nothing coming out. Not just an orgasm, but a good solid one! It even felt like it lasted longer than the traditional orgasm! And, I felt satisfaction just like before and I know she also loved it just as much as before! Minor suggestion, urinate before intamacy! Looking forward to the possibility of joining the 0 club in a couple of months. Hope this is encourging to some... Thanks again, Marty",

      "Content": "njs, They took 2 nodes from each of the right and left pelvic lymph nodes. Originally Posted by njs Hi Marty, While the risk of recurrence does continue to increase with time even out past 15 years, the slope gradually levels off so the incremental risk with each year is less and less. The apex is the most common location for positive margins with organ confined (pT2) disease due to the nature of the anatomy. If you are going to have positive margins, apical are probably the best as several studies suggest that they pose lower risk of recurrence than positive margins in other locations. Out of curiosity, how many nodes did you have taken out?",

      "Content": "Hi Everyone, I was going to post a question, but conveniently saw this today. I just had my 1 year PSA test and consultation with my Urologist. My PSA has been <0.05 for the past year. Now my results are 0.06. (One hundredth up). Last month I had an anual physical which also included a PSA test of .1. (Always comes back this way from my primary physician). My urologist didn't seem to concerned about the results. In fact, he scheduled another test in six months. He said he's seen small fluctuations like this before and not to worry. Yea, right.... Chuck has mentioned the Cowpers glands. Recently, mine have become quite active and have been leaking and squirting out with an orgasm. I'm wondering if anyone else is experiencing this. Hope everyone is well, Marty",

When I reviewed the report with my doctor, he told me that he would like to do another biopsy. He explained that now he knows what area to concentrate on. And, he was right. The second biopsy was positive and I'm fortunate that my doctor wanted to do another one. They say it's like finding a needle in a haystack. Good luck, Marty",

If it is the needle, ask your pharmacist for #30, it is extremely fine and injection is virtually painless. You can use a thicker needle to draw the trimix into the syringe and then change the needle before injecting. Brave The needle wasn't a problem. The medication worked, really worked! However, after using Trimix about six or seven tries, it was just too uncomfortable. I tried taking Tylenol with it. That didn't work either. So, I stopped injecting altogether. Marty",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by PCNewbie I'm curious what you are doing now then. Edex not good enough, Trimix too painful. FYI...i've been doing a lot of reading, and I've read several times that when the pain is too much (not from needle, but from Trimix), it is often a sign of too high a dose. What does your Dr. think about it? Also, some reading I've done has indicated many are getting better results if using a C Ring too. Although, I'm a bit confused as to when you put that on. I have ordered a couple different ones to try. My ED is slowly recovering. I know it will take a while, but I feel it will come back eventually. I can notice a difference from a few months ago. Semi erections now. Zero a few months ago.. The first time I had knee surgery (45 years ago) I remember my whole kneecap was numb. I asked the Dr. why and he said \"The nerves have been disturbed, the numbness will go away in time\". And it did, about two years later. Common sense and research lead me to believe that the nerves will heal and come back in time. If they don't, then I will still continue to enjoy a healthy, robust, sexual relationship without penetration! Marty What am I doing now? Having wonderful orgasms with my girlfriend without penetration.",

      "Content": "Great report, I am about 10 weeks out of surgery. I go for my first post op PSA in about two weeks. Sounds like your are progressing very nicely. I have a dribble problem when I cough or stand up without remembering to kegal. I am down to one pad a day and none at night. I get up several times to urinate during the night. I also find it helpful to empty my bladder whenever I am near a restroom whether I need to or not. So easy because it flows out like a fire hose! I find that I don't leak as much when I do this. As far as erections go, I have nothing yet. I was very active prior to the surgery with solid erections. Now nothing! I would rather be cancer free than have erections. Hopefully, this will improve with time as the nerves recuperate. I would like to add that without erections or ejaculation, you can still achieve a great orgasm. Strange at first, but still happening. Sounds like you may be from Texas. I had my surgery done in Austin, Tx. Best of Luck to you, Marty",

      "Content": "I wanted to provide an update on my Trimix experience. I picked up the Trimix on Tuesday. After a lengthy discussion with the pharmacist, I felt very comfortable with the procedure. He told me that he makes about a hundred of these compounds a week. He also said that after I find my right dosage, he can make the compound stronger so I can use less. We'll see about that. Tuesday night, I prepared the injection (without my girlfriend knowing) and injected .1 ml. The shot was hardly noticeable except for a little pinch. After massaging the injection site for several minutes, I sat down and waited for something to happen. Well, about ten minutes later, I noticed some bulk in my penis. Nothing big, just a kind of swelling. After about 20 minutes I was about 75% hard. Not enough for penetration, but the first time I've had any kind of response down there since the surgery. I didn't tell my girlfriend, because I wanted to surprise her. Ok, not enough for penetration, but now I know the next time may be better with an increase in dosage. I wanted to give it another try the next day, but thought it best to wait. On Thursday night, I injected myself with @1.5 ml. This time, after about 30 minutes, I was extremely hard and ready. This stuff works. I went downstairs, stood in front of my girlfriend and whipped open my robe and said \"I'mmmm Back......!). You should have seen here face! Well, the rest is history. I do have to say that with both injections, I did feel a dull ache in my penis. Like an aching boner as we used to say. Also, per the Doctor's instructions, I took a Sudafed when I was done Everything worked well. I can't wait to try again, Marty",

      "Content": "I went to my Urologist yesterday for my 3 month post op appointment. He confirmed my 0.05 PSA test and I have another appointment in three months to check it again. I asked my Dr. for Trimix and he looked excited when I asked him for it. Apparently, not many patients ask for shots in their penis'. I told him I am a member of a top forum and have gotten tons of info about it. He wrote me a prescription and wanted me to come back in a week to show me how to use it. I told him I had watched youtube videos and had done my research. I explained to him how I was going to inject myself and he said \"go for it\" and wrote the script. As I was walking out of the office, I thought to myself. \"Tonight's the night!!!!\" It's been over three months without penetration. I immediately headed over to the pharmacy only to discover that there are only three pharmacies in Austin,Texas that are able to make sterile compounds. They gave me the address to the closest one and I ran over there. Well, they had just closed! So, this morning I went to the compounding pharmacy hoping that I could get my Trimix for tonight. I walk in, give them the prescription. The first thing the Pharmacist says is \"This will take two to three days, We'll call you when it's ready\". Ok, now I'm looking forward to this weekend. Seems like we're always waiting for something!! Also, the cost, which I had to pay up front was $95 for three months or $140 for six months. They told me the shelf life was six months, so I got the six month supply. Marty",

The test is new and the cost is $4,000. They asked my permission before sending my prostate off. The cost was picked up by my urologist because I was one of the first to have this test. The test predicted a 5.9% chance of PC returning after 5 years. The results are combined with all my other stats such as positive margins, Gleason, etc. I don't have the full report in front of me, but if anyone is interested, I will be happy to share more.

No. This doesn't make me worry at all. The national average is 6% (According to the results). Since I had positive margins, there's always the chance, and most likely that I'll need SRT down the road. Since I'm prepared for the possible outcomes and scenarios, it doesn't bother me. We'll cross that bridge when it comes.. Marty",

      "Content": "I wanted to provide an update on my Trimix experience. I picked up the Trimix on Tuesday. After a lengthy discussion with the pharmacist, I felt very comfortable with the procedure. He told me that he makes about a hundred of these compounds a week. He also said that after I find my right dosage, he can make the compound stronger so I can use less. We'll see about that. Tuesday night, I prepared the injection (without my girlfriend knowing) and injected .1 ml. The shot was hardly noticeable except for a little pinch. After massaging the injection site for several minutes, I sat down and waited for something to happen. Well, about ten minutes later, I noticed some bulk in my penis. Nothing big, just a kind of swelling. After about 20 minutes I was about 75% hard. Not enough for penetration, but the first time I've had any kind of response down there since the surgery. I didn't tell my girlfriend, because I wanted to surprise her. Ok, not enough for penetration, but now I know the next time may be better with an increase in dosage. I wanted to give it another try the next day, but thought it best to wait. On Thursday night, I injected myself with @1.5 ml. This time, after about 30 minutes, I was extremely hard and ready. This stuff works. I went downstairs, stood in front of my girlfriend and whipped open my robe and said \"I'mmmm Back......!). You should have seen here face! Well, the rest is history. I do have to say that with both injections, I did feel a dull ache in my penis. Like an aching boner as we used to say. Also, per the Doctor's instructions, I took a Sudafed when I was done Everything worked well. I can't wait to try again, Marty",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by Bravehardon Wintertexan, I was fully continent 7 weeks after post op (65). If I feel the risk of a stress leak from sneezing, etc, I brace for it and there is no leakage . I have very minute leakage with ejaculation, I would guesstimate it as 6-10 drops. I could be wrong but I attribute this to the success in surgery plus faithful kegel exercises that I perform 3 times/day (total of 1 hour). I am sure there are many others who achieve zero leakage but I'm not bothered with a few drops. B Tomorrow will be 4 months since my surgery. I have been using two pads a day for the past couple of months. Lately, the pads have been dry when I change them, so I decided to try and go without one to see. This past week, I've been 99% continent. Yes, I have the few drops, if that, Brave has also. In fact, I do exactly the same as Brave. Brace myself (Kegal) before a cough or a sneeze. Now I do it without thinking. Try squeezing out some gas without dripping. That's when I knew I was coming back. What I wanted to say is that after my catheter was removed, I would leak all the time. Almost no control. The improvement will come gradually, some sooner than others. But it will come. Marty",
