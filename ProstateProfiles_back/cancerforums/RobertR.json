      "Content": "I'm in Canada, i'm 46 and my psa is 3.3 and my urologist thought i better have a prostate biopsy. I was reluctant that morning as i just read some pretty scary stuff on the internet. I ended up having it done and i did not tolerate it well at all, it was very uncomfortable. By 2:00am i was in a state of uncontrollable chills and i knew i had a fever and was in trouble. Made my way to my family physicians office and got worse actually shaking uncontrollable, my temp was 40.5 and i couldn't follow simple instructions. I had to take an ambulance to the hospital. I had become septic and the hospital spent the next 5 days giving me antibiotics/ iv bolus to rid me of the ecoli and raise my b/p. My b/p was as low as 83/43 at one point so i was very ill. I took the antibiotics as directed 1 day before, the day of and 1 day after and it didn't matter. In my opinion this is a dangerous procedure and they need to find a less invasive procedure to find out if someone has prostate cancer. I am [email protected]#$$% livid and i want everyone to know what the reality is. They push people to get this procedure because they get paid for it...then what if you do have cancer that f'n needle might just spread it to other parts of the prostate...it's a joke but i'm not laughing. I might just go to the local newspaper also.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by okadam Yes, terrifying. Yes, bad experience. Probably worth having a medical review board double-check to be sure all procedures were followed correctly. There is a risk with all surgical procedures. I had to sign a form that said that I acknowledged that one of the possible outcomes was death. On the other, hand, a biopsy confirmed that I did, indeed, have cancer, and ultimately saved my life. Do I miss having an erection, sure, but there is more to my life than just that. I think I can still enjoy another 20-25 years without one--and I've been given the option of a technique that would allow me to create erections at will, but it's just not worth it to me. One year after surgery, life is great and I've have even found a partner that accepts for what I have, not for what I don't have. I'm 46...i'm not going to get any treatment if i have it...like i said i won't believe them. I actually believe they create disease to get paid. I actually believe there are Dr.s on this site weaving their colossal bullshit....",

Can you even begin to comprehend that. What it translates into is a horrifying level of distrust. They messed with the wrong person. What they didn't understand is that i don't have a wife or kids or a girlfriend. Why would i want to stay alive for another 30 years without the ability to get an erection when i want to have one....horrifying! That's the problem with the health system, they got paid for this biopsy, the urologist and that dickhead radiologist who i would ktfo if given a chance. I will go to the media, these people need to be stopped. It DOES NOT happen in 1% of the cases, rather 20-30% and for me 100% so it doesn't matter anyway. Thanks for your support though.",
