Not sure if that affects PSA. I also take a daily 81 mg aspirin and saw palmetto on the advice of my primary. In October of 2016 I began exhibiting all the signs of BPH confirmed by DRE by both my primary and urologist. Put on Flomax which I've continued to take. During my followup visit to my urologist in 12/17 he expressed concern with PSA velocity and scheduled a biopsy in January. Said DRE was smooth and symmetrical. Both my father and his father suffered from BPH but were never diagnosed with PC. Dad made it to 85 and Gramps to 83. Both succumbed to heart issues. Nervous as hell over the biopsy. Interested in thoughts on my situation and also thoughts on the newer 3T MRI's now available for prostate scans and if suspicious areas found using the MRI for a guided biopsy. Seems like a better approach than a TRUS biopsy which seems somewhat random. I turned 59 in 10/17. Looking into getting a PHI test but neither my uro nor my primary care doc offer it. Thanks in advance to all you knowledgeable folks.",

When first diagnosed with BPH was getting up 10 to 15 times a night, at the time I was scheduled for a MRI of the brain due to asymmetrical hearing loss in my left ear so the ENT wanted to check for an acoustic neuroma which stressed me out and probably exacerbated the condition. MRI was negative. Flomax helped almost immediately and I've been taking it ever since. My wife tells me repeatedly to stop reading about all this stuff but I find myself driven to learn all I can so I can be prepared for the worst.

      "Content": "Hello all, My PSA numbers - 12/13 - 1.6 12/14 - 1.7 12/15 - 1.6 12/16 - 1.9 12/17 - 3.24 The night prior to the 12/2017 blood test I went to the gym and lifted heavy, as is my habit. Not sure if that affects PSA. I also take a daily 81 mg aspirin and saw palmetto on the advice of my primary. In October of 2016 I began exhibiting all the signs of BPH confirmed by DRE by both my primary and urologist. Put on Flomax which I've continued to take. During my followup visit to my urologist in 12/17 he expressed concern with PSA velocity and scheduled a biopsy in January. Said DRE was smooth and symmetrical. Both my father and his father suffered from BPH but were never diagnosed with PC. Dad made it to 85 and Gramps to 83. Both succumbed to heart issues. Nervous as hell over the biopsy. Interested in thoughts on my situation and also thoughts on the newer 3T MRI's now available for prostate scans and if suspicious areas found using the MRI for a guided biopsy. Seems like a better approach than a TRUS biopsy which seems somewhat random. I turned 59 in 10/17. Looking into getting a PHI test but neither my uro nor my primary care doc offer it. Thanks in advance to all you knowledgeable folks.",

      "Content": "Chiguy thanks much for the tips and info - Never heard of the heavy lifting effect but makes sense. When first diagnosed with BPH was getting up 10 to 15 times a night, at the time I was scheduled for a MRI of the brain due to asymmetrical hearing loss in my left ear so the ENT wanted to check for an acoustic neuroma which stressed me out and probably exacerbated the condition. MRI was negative. Flomax helped almost immediately and I've been taking it ever since. My wife tells me repeatedly to stop reading about all this stuff but I find myself driven to learn all I can so I can be prepared for the worst. Doesn't help my stress or sleeping patterns though LOL. I'm new at this stuff but looking at your signature stats you are on AS at the moment ?",
