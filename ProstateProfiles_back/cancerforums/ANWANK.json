      "Content": "Originally Posted by HighlanderCFH Hi, Yup, as Semiramide noted, the general rule is to wait about 3 weeks post-op before trying to have sex, orgasm, etc. So he should definitely check with the surgeon before attempting it again. The surgeon called me back yesterday and I told him what everyone here has been saying. I explained that we did not know this and there was nothing in his paperwork about restrictions on sexual activity. He told us that if he is not in pain, to go for it. He stated that if he is able to have sex already and is comfortable doing so that he should have sex as much as possible. We have not done it again since because I was so worried after all of this. But talking to his dr was a relief because I started to panic that we may have done something to impede his recovery!",

      "Content": "So to start off this post, my fiance got his pathology back and his cancer was contained to the prostate. It does say he was gleason 7 instead of 6. But I suppose that is not relevant anymore if they got it all. So the doctor said no radiation would be necessary since his margins were clear! YAY I do have some questions about sexual function following this surgery. He is exactly one week out today and still has the catheter in. He was teasing with me today and actually got about a 50% erection with the catheter in. He said that he gets a tingling sensation when he sees me getting dressed and such. Has anyone experienced this? I am wondering if this is abnormal and a sign that he will not have erectile dysfunction for long or if this is normal and he will still struggle with it. Obviously I have no idea what men experience so any advice is so much appreciated.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by ANWANK Hello everyone. I am new here and posting on behalf of my wonderful fiance. This last month has been quite stressful and I am trying to learn and understand everything that I can. So I will give a brief description of what has been going on. In December, my fiance went in for a check up at his gp. Much of this was due to my urging because of his family history and I just wanted to make sure he was doing good. His 48 year old brother had his prostate removed one year ago this month due to prostate cancer. His father also had prostate cancer. So I had been pushing him to go get examined because I wasn't sure if this was hereditary. Anyways, he had no issues such as symptoms and is a very active and healthy 45 year old man. He goes to dr and she draws his blood for psa test. We did not even know what that was. I just thought she would do a dre, which she did and it was negative. A few days later she calls and says he needs to go to urologist. His psa was 4.04. I started researching and thought that was not really high but we went earlier this week. Dr does another psa, dre and schedules a biopsy. DRE negative again and psa 4.1. He also said that his psa should not be over 2.5 at his age and typically should be about 0.7 or so. He recommended genetic testing. He stated that if his biopsy comes back negative he will submit to his insurance for an MRI guided biopsy. I guess I am slightly confused. I understand his family history plays a factor but with two negative dre,no symptoms, and slightly elevated psa, why does this urologist seem pretty confident that there is cancer? Has anyone here had a similar experience? Thank you everyone for ur responses. Dr office just called and said they also did a percent free psa. They said it was 15.7%. Is that good or not? I have no idea about this test",

      "Content": "Hello everyone. I am new here and posting on behalf of my wonderful fiance. This last month has been quite stressful and I am trying to learn and understand everything that I can. So I will give a brief description of what has been going on. In December, my fiance went in for a check up at his gp. Much of this was due to my urging because of his family history and I just wanted to make sure he was doing good. His 48 year old brother had his prostate removed one year ago this month due to prostate cancer. His father also had prostate cancer. So I had been pushing him to go get examined because I wasn't sure if this was hereditary. Anyways, he had no issues such as symptoms and is a very active and healthy 45 year old man. He goes to dr and she draws his blood for psa test. We did not even know what that was. I just thought she would do a dre, which she did and it was negative. A few days later she calls and says he needs to go to urologist. His psa was 4.04. I started researching and thought that was not really high but we went earlier this week. Dr does another psa, dre and schedules a biopsy. DRE negative again and psa 4.1. He also said that his psa should not be over 2.5 at his age and typically should be about 0.7 or so. He recommended genetic testing. He stated that if his biopsy comes back negative he will submit to his insurance for an MRI guided biopsy. I guess I am slightly confused. I understand his family history plays a factor but with two negative dre,no symptoms, and slightly elevated psa, why does this urologist seem pretty confident that there is cancer? Has anyone here had a similar experience?",

      "Content": "My fiance had his surgery on Wednesday. They took him back at 8:30 and I did not get to see him again until almost 5 pm. The surgery lasted 4 hours but his post op blood work in recovery showed elevated potassium, low magnesium and low hemoglobin so they kept him in recovery until the surgeon came to see him to clear him to go to a room. Unfortunately they did not tell me why it was taking so long so I spent hours in a panic attack! Eventually he went to a room, and they gave him magnesium intravenously, his potassium improved and his hemoglobin has always been lower because he is anemic. He is doing ok with the abdominal pain. He says that the catheter is the most uncomfortable part. I have been lubricating it but he still hates it. He does have a very hard and big lump near one of his incisions and I am waiting for the doctor to call me back about that. Not sure what it is. He will have the catheter removed next Friday. The dr said he will have the pathology report back Monday. He said if his margins are clear everything will be good but if not he will have him do a little radiation. So that is our experience so far. Thank you everyone for all the support on here thus far. If anyone has any advice on making the catheter more bearable, please share because he doesn't even like to sit or lie down over it. He says it feels better to stand.",

      "Content": "As some of you know, my fiance recently got the cancer diagnosis at 45 years old. He will be having the Da Vinci in April. His father and brother both had prostate cancer at a young age. His brother is a little more than a year out, 48 years old, just getting urinary control and complete ed. My fiance is extremely active. He is 7 years older than I, and can run laps around me! He is in a very physical line of work building homes since he was young, exercises daily, participates in sports. I know this is going to be a huge and dramatic change for him. On weekends that he is off work, if he hasn't done anything on Saturday, by Sunday he is stir crazy and wants to get out and do some cardio. He is also very sexually active. I like to tease him and tell him he is in heat! Not to be graphic, I have known him for 22 years, been together for the last 5 years and we have an active sex life. He has zero issues there except the occasional moment where if he knows I am sick or something, he has a mental block because he is very much a gentleman. Any advice from men on here on the things that your partners did to help you through this? Was there any defining moments where you just thought, \"wow, this woman has my back\"? I love this man with every single fiber of my being. I want to do everything I can to help him through it",

      "Content": "Thank you all for your replies. My guy is a very quiet person, a man of few words. He does not do too well with talking about things that worry him or bother him. So I hope that I can get him to open up through it all without being pushy. I know he appreciates all the research I have done on all of this leading to this point. He has told me he feels much more informed. At the end of his last appointment, his dr looked at him and told him that he was lucky to have an advocate like me because he was surprised at how much I knew and my questions. That is all I want to do, is know as much as I can so that I am better equipped to help him through it. And hopefully regardless of how long it takes him to get back to himself, I can fully support him and know all the right things to say to him. Like I stated in a previous post, I have also survived cancer. I was 23 at the time and it was hard after surgery knowing I could never bear another child. I definitely felt like less of a woman so I can certainly understand the mental and emotional effects of all this.",
