      "Content": "I am 63, married and have been disabled since I was 50. I worked 29 years for Rowe Furniture and farmed besides. I have a myriad of health issues....fibromyalgia, arthritis, glaucoma, insomnia, depression. I was nauseated the entire 2 years I was getting Lupron. I have had gallbladder surgery, back surgery, umbilical hernia surgery., pacemaker......also taking Dilaudid for pain...not many good days, have been suicidal. My father died with colon cancer and my brother died with liver cancer. I have 2 brothers and 3 sisters living. I am the 5th child of 7. I was taking testosterone shots and developed cancer. Have not had T level checked. I have been to a zillion Drs (it seems). Had colonoscopy, endoscopy, bone scan, blood work galore, trips to ER and immediate care. My wife is wonderful, but I feel I have put her through so much! There is a guilt and feeling that she deserves better. I have days when I am emotional. Thanks for the encouragement. I am glad I wrote. I do not feel alone, but just wonder if I will ever feel better and thought someone out there may be going through something similar. I know people that have had the prostatectomy and seem to be fine. I sweat all the time. I don't feel like exercising. I was diagnosed with PTSD as a result of sexual abuse as a child. Jazzi63",

      "Content": "I was told the cancer was inoperable, so I took 44 radiation treatments and had Lupron injections every 4 months for 2 years. Had PSA tested last week. Got results today and they were great. I was told in the beginning that I would probably die in 3-5 years. I was diagnosed with a very aggressive prostate cancer that had already spread outside the prostate. I assume I will be tested again in 6 months. I have no energy, am depressed, emotional and sweat profusely. I hardly get out of the house because I feel so bad. Has anyone out there had a similar experience? Will this get better? Some one said the beast came back? Is this likely?",

      "Content": "Thank you so much. PSA was 10.4 when I was diagnosed and now it is 0.1. The urologist and oncologist said the prostate tissue had already attached itself to surrounding area when I was first diagnosed.I have not received a Lupron shot since August 2014. I feel so bad and have tried nearly every depression pill out there. I wrote because I am wondering if anyone else feels so bad after treatment. I assume I will never be able to have a normal testosterone level in my body again. I have talked to doctors and they say a lot of people are never negatively affected by the treatments. They definitely do not understand how bad I feel. Thanks again, Jazzig63",
