      "Content": "Hello all, I had a biopsy in November, 2011 after my PSA was 6. The DRE seemed fine. 5 of 12 samples tested positive, Gleason score of 6. Pelvic xray and CT scan both indicated the PC ws confined. I was 51yo (now 52). I really liked my surgeon who recommeded the DaVinci procedure. He also indicated there was no rush to the OR. In spite of my comfort I started getting more opinions. I live in SE Pennsylvania and there are many excellent healthcare options. I also started reading this board (a great resource to my wife and me). I met with another surgeon and an oncologist that specializes the Proton therapy. Everyone seemed to agree on the DaVinci procedure. I scheduled the procedure. Then I found that the surgeon did not have the experience with this procedure (less than 100) that I had hoped. The second surgeon had done over 600 and trained at Johns Hopkins with Patrick Walsh. I switched surgeons (that was a little uncomfortable but I had to do it for piece of mind). I should have asked everyone thier experience level as soon as I met with them. I had the procedure on Sept 26, 2012. My PSA had risen to 7. After the procedure my surgeon told me the Gleason in the removed prostate was 7 (3+4). He seems confident he got it all. I see him again in January. FYI, the catheter came out 9 long days after the surgery. The only discomfort I really had thoughout was the catheter. It was not really painful just annoying. I am taking 5mg of Cialis 2X/week. I started back to the gym 4 weeks after the surgery. Three weeks and a day after the surgery I was able to achieve an erection. Not like college but I will take it! The incontinence is another issue. I do not have problems at night while asleep but during the day I need to go to the bathroom frequently. I am doing the Pelvic Floor Exercises but thought I would have more control by now. Do any of you have any other recommendations to speed this process along? Maybe I am on normal pace and just impatient. Any thoughts would be appreciated. One recommendation I would pass along. After I got the news I joined a gym and started building strength and stamina. I will never pass for an olympic athlete but I am convinced being in half decent shape helped my recovery and got me back to work quickly. Thanks to all who have and continue to post. Your advice has been very helpful.",

      "Content": "I am 2 months out from robotic surgery. My situation was very close to yours(Gleason 3+3) including geographically. I met with professionals at Bryn Mawr and was very impressed. In the end I had the surgery at Penn. My decision was driven by the experience of the surgeon, Tom Guzzo. The surgery went well and I have been able to work through the side effects. Prior to the surgery I wanted to meet with an Oncologist that specialized in PC. I was referred to Justin Bekelman (215-662-7266) at Penn. I really liked him and thought he gave advise he would have given himself. He went into great detail specifically about the Proton Therapy. In the end my wife and I decided the surgery was the right path for me but every situation is different. I know this is a shock to find this condition. If I can offer you some encouragement it would be that in SE Pennsylvania we have so many experts and options close by we are lucky. I took my time, got answers to any questions and am confident I made the right choice for me. I really feel as though I can put the PC behind me and move forward. Good luck! If I can be any type of resource I would be happy to help. Also, don't watch Eagles games, it will only depress you more!",
