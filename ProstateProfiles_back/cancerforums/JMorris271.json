      "Content": "Thank you for the tips DD. The only data I have in hand or mind at this time is my path report from the initial bio. I do understand the need that a surgeon have the operation experiance but I don't know how to find the right surgeons to ask in the first place. I can't afford to go door to door and inquire about the number of procedures they have performed. I am reading Dr. Walsh's book which I find very good so far and am trying to become as informed as possible about PC and be able to ask the right questions and understand the answers in return. Even if I were to go to Duke or JH,, how do I know whom to start asking My problem is not about PC knowledge but rather how to find the right professional to help me.",

I was just informed that I had joined the 7 (3+4) club 3 weeks ago. and have been trying to glean what I can to have my cancer treated. One point that resonates with me is to find the best surgeon, Rad/oncol possible. I'm at a loss of how to go about that. With no contacts in medical circles or first hand knowledge of my areas talent. Does anyone have suggestions on where I can begin researching and rating my doctor options? Thank you so much and Merry Christmas.",
