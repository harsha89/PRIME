      "Content": "Thank you guys. I don't know if you remember, but my guy has a similar story to yours in that his prostate was, I think, about 100 gr. His surgeon said it was the size of his head but I'm sure that's an exaggeration. :-/ That caused difficulties before surgery so his nerves took a beating I'm sure. He gets a partial erection, but not usable and we are 23 months out. It's hard not to believe the odds are against us, but I know there are options out there. Another problem is that he has never been very cooperative in following the doctor's directions on penile rehab. I'm not inclined to nag, but have encouraged him to use the pump for rehab. He's a grown man and it's up to him to do this, but I wonder how much it really helps anyway.",

      "Content": "It been a while since I've posted but wanted to check in and say hello. Since I was last on my guy and I got married in July. He is still showing undetectable PSA's almost 2 years post RP. He is totally continent but ED is still very prevalent. We are both thinking that ED will not be going away due to the time that has passed but the VED works well for us. I can tell it bothers him and because of that, I have to make the moves to get things started, but he is willing. I wish he felt as enthusiastic about sex as I do but he said he is still tramautised. Damn this disease Oh a happy note, we are crazy in love and he's alive. That's really all that matters.",

      "Content": "Hey friends: My guy is one year post RP and still experiencing ED. I know that is not uncommon so I'm not worried about that. I want to make sure we are giving him the best opportunity for near normal love making. We currently use the VED successfully. He gets about half mast during foreplay, but we've seen no difference with or without generic Viagra. He is hesitant to take a full 100 mgs, but has done so with no real difference. The half mast doesn't last long enough nor is it hard enough for intercourse. My questions: 1) The generic V we got from an online source from India. I won't post the name of the company since I'm thinking it's not allowed, but the name starts with an A (hint). I've heard the company is reputable, but I've also heard there is no real generic V and the pill could be dangerous. Thoughts? 2) Can he take the pill and have a small meal afterwards instead of starving? If so, how long after? I wonder if his stomach is really empty when taking it a couple hours after dinner. Thanks for your help and advice.",

      "Content": "Hi, I'm 53 and my guy is 60 years old. I've been reading the threads and seeking what I can do to help this great guy's rehabilitation physically and mentally. He had a RP using the robot surgery with bilateral nerve sparing. His cancer was very early stage and the biopsy showed no cancer cells in surrounding prostate tissue. Whew! His follow-up PSA was right at O and prognosis is excellent with no other prescribed treatments. To me that is the most important thing. I lost my husband to colon cancer 7 years ago so I know the other side of cancer all too well. Now, 6 months out, his incontinence has resolved itself but the ED is profound. He had struggles before the surgery and could achieve an erection without pills but struggled with staying power. In his mind this lowers his odds of full healing. I love him so much that in no way is this a deal breaker and I hope to be his wife when he's ready. I think this will delay our progress because of his feeling like he can't perform and may be cheating me in some way. He told me that there are other guys out there that I could find who have no ED problems. I said maybe but they wouldn't be you. (We've been together 4 wonderful years and I'm not going anywhere.) That's a little background. I'm fully supportive and willing to experiment with no judgements or expectations. To me this would be rehabilitation play designed to help us both. How should I proceed in a non-threatening way? He can be shy in this area.",

The ED is still there but he is realizing that you can still have a full life while living with the side effects of a prostatectomy.
