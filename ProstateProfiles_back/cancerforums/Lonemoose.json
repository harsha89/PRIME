      "Content": "At age 49 my wife started insisting I go for a check up, I refused saying I felt great, which I did. Well after 2 years of her insisting I finally went for a routine physical. The doctor told me he felt something and I should go see a specialist. Which I did. Long story short on my 52nd birthday I was told I had stage 2 prostate cancer. Instead of being upset and feeling sorry for myself I could not help but be thankful for my wife's constant \"insisting\" that I go for a checkup. I found out a couple of months later that a friend of mine had waited to long to go and get checked, he was diagnosed with stage 4 prostate cancer and at age 60 he passed away. I firmly believe that had he gone sooner he would still be alive today. So I now relate this story to all who will listen. Cause baby you never know.",

      "Content": "I had the DaVinci surgery, no radiation. It has been 6 months and my Doctor tells me I am ahead of the curve! Thanks for having this forum. My eyes have been opened. I like most people thought cancer only happened to other people. Looking back I was afraid of cancer and unwilling to admit it. A wise man once told me \"your a long time dead\" enjoy every second of your life. I never quite understood how true that statement was until now.",
