      "Content": "I had surgery last Monday 8-26-13 I was under for 8 hours because there was a fly in the operating room and caused a 2 hour delay. I also had umbilical hernia surgery after the prostatecomy. The catheter came out 9-3-13 and I hated it the hole time it was in I am not a difficult person and tried to be fair with it but my body started to reject it immediately, this is my second full day without it. I used 3 pads and a diaper yesterday but I was pretty inactive, I only went for one 1.5 mile walk. Today I have been more active as my wife is home and forcing me to be. I have went thru one pad and the second one is damp but not wet. I am doing well so far I think. Yesterday I was really down on myself because I was like a leaky Lucy and whizzing every time I got up to walk. Today is much better. I do have a question every time I feel myself leak I do a kegel I am wondering if this is normal and am I supposed to let some leaking happen? Thank you Krugzz",
