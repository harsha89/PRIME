I am a 45 year old and had my prostate removed after being diagnosed with Stage 1 Cancer. 2 weeks after having my prostate removed I was having erections using low dose Cialis. 3 weeks mark I was able to have sex with my wife....... it was a little different but successful! I realize that it may be rare, but as my doctor said everyone is unique and every surgery is different.... I had the Da Vinci procedure. I hope everyone the best of luck and my support! Timothy",
