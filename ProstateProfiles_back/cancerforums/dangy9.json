    "Content": "Hello,I am a 51 year old Male. I had the davinci robotic prostate surgery on Jan 22. Just some back ground first. My PSA was 16 prior to surgery ,my biopsy had the results of 9 out of the 12 core samples. and they were according to the Dr. very aggressive the remaining 3 had cancer but not that aggressive. The cancer is still inside me at the \"apex of the prostate\" now since the surgery I'm experiencing alot of pain on the right side of my abdomen. has anyone out there experienced any such pain this is not just soreness but very severe pain just on the right side sneezing coughing and walking around make this worse I would appreciate any input . Thanks",
