    "Content": "My dad is 53 and was diagnosed with prostate cancer 5 years ago. His prostate was removed right after being diagnosed, has gone through radiation 3 times, and chemotherapy once. Hes been on hormone therapy for years now. Recently his cancer has started to spread rapidly. This is what his was diagnosed with: C61- Prostate Cancer Metastatic to intra abdonimal lymph node, C77.2 Secondary and unspecified malignant neoplasm of intra-abdominal lymph nodes, C61 Prostate Cancer Metastatic, C79.51 Secondary malignant neoplasm of bone, T66.XXXS Radiation effect, sequela. Sooo to the average 21 year old girl, all of this is pretty much a different language. From what I have gathered from his oncologist, His cancer has spread to his lymph nodes, bones, and has a tumor on his upper spinal cord, which was just declared inoperable. His cancer is declared to be extremely aggressive and is not curable. He is classified as stage IV. His PSA level is at 83 and is still rising. The last time he had radiation therapy, it was ineffective. From what I have found online his survival rate for the next year is at 40%. Does anyone have an insight on this? I'm trying really hard to just fully grasp where he is at. He tries to protect me by keeping me in the dark, but I would love to have as much information as possible, and to mentally prepare myself for the worst case scenario.",
