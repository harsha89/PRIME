My dad and brother are alive and they are not aware of any prostate issues that they might have. * I had a Biopsy done on Fri, 8/24/12 and the results came back negative.

My biggest fear is that somehow I now have PC and it is in advanced stages. Am I thinking to much into this (I tend to worry to much)?

      "Content": "Originally Posted by njs Well its definitely good that he wants to monitor your PSA closely, although I'm a little surprised he wouldn't want to try antibiotics again (but for more than 10 days) to test for a likely benign cause for the increase. The DRE result is good but definitely doesn't rule out possible PC. Because you've had a negative biopsy the PCA3 urine test could be an appropriate next step to consider at some point if PSA does remain high. But since he wants to see you again in 3 months, I don't think there is any need to get too anxious about the \"inaction\" at this point but you can discuss further action next time if it remains high. Good luck. Thanks NJS, good advice. On one hand I'm gad to hear that he felt I'm ok, but I do want to stay proactive. I asked for a PSA free test and he said it wasnt necessary at this point. He also said they do not offer the PCA3 urine test and even if they did he doesn't recomend it at this point. He said for me to do PSA blood tests every three months and then come back and see him in one year. Unless the PSA readings double or something big like that then he would see me sooner. He did say that he wants to limit the number of biopsies unless he really feels I need them.",

      "Content": "Thanks Michael, your suggestions are very helpful and I will definitely bring them up with my Urologist. I think they mentioned BPH before but not prostatitis. I will have to double check tomorrow. My big concern is the PSA spike and that somehow my 2012 biopsy did not detect PC and it has been growing since. I am glad to see you caught your PC early enough and were able to treat it accordingly. Originally Posted by Michael F Hi Garza! We understand your concerns!!! Your PSA is elevated and needs to be investigated. There are conditions, including prostate cancer (PC) that can cause PSA elevations. You did not mention if you have BPH or prostatitis. These can cause elevated PSAs. Your negative biopsy in 2012 is encouraging; however, it is possible for biopsies to \"miss\" PC. It is also possible that PC has either since developed or progressed. Seeing the Uro tomorrow is definitely the right course of action. He/she will likely do a thorough exam to narrow down the possible causes of your elevated PSA. Questions/Issues you may want to discuss, if PC is suspected or needs to be ruled out are: - Can a Multiparametric 3T MRI detect any areas of suspicion? - Can this MRI be \"fused\" with a future TRUS Biopsy to help 'guide' the biopsy needles to areas of suspicion? - PSAFT test. The ratio of Free PSA/Bound PSA will indicate the \"risk\" probability of PC - PCA3 test. Following an aggressive DRE, a urine sample is collected. The result will also indicate the \"risk\" probability of PC. Meanwhile, try to relax, stay calm, and be optimistic! Hoping you will not qualify for membership to this Club! Good luck & keep us updated! MF",

      "Content": "Hi everyone, Here's my story. I am Mexican-American and just turned 47 this past July. I went to my doctor for my annual physical (7/29) and all my normal bloodwork and exams went well. For whatever reason, my doctor also ordered a PSA blood test for me. My first reading came in at 2.89. My doctor had me re-take the PSA test and it came in at 3.24. She put me on antibitoics (Ciprofloxacin) for 10 days and my third PSA test came in at 3.06. I am not aware of any prostate issues with my family. My dad and brother are alive and have never mentioned any prostate issues with me. I have been very worried since my doctor told me about the first elevated PSA test. I was scheduled for a biopsy this afternoon (8/16) but my doctor had to cancel his afternoon appointments for a surgery emergency. It has been rescheduled for next Fri, 8/24. A few days ago my lower back started to hurt and my anxiety has risen since I have read that this is one of the symptoms of advanced prostate cancer and that the antibiotics did not reduce my PSA level. I can't believe I have to wait another week to see if I have cancer or not. My biggest fear is that I have had prostate cancer for a number of years with no symptoms and now it has advanced with no cure and starting to feel the symptoms. I'm married with two boys and I am scared of leaving them so soon. Any advice or phone numbers that I can call for peer advice would be appreciated. Thank you.",

I have scheduled a follow up visit for tomorrow (Mon, 8/20) with my primary doctor to check out my back pain and perform a prostate exam. My doctor ordered a PSA test during my physical exam but did not do a prostate exam at the time. I have asked for the exam in hopes of trying to get more info. prior to my biopsy scheduled for Fri, 8/24. Here is some additional info. * I spoke with my dad and asked him if ever had cancer or was tested. He said he had a \"colonoscopy\" done two years ago and everything came back ok. He says he has had physicals in the past with everything coming out ok but I'm not sure if he had PSA tests done. * The PSA reading of 2.89 was the first PSA reading I ever had. * The Biopsy I have scheduled for this coming Fri, 8/24 is being done by Dr. Daniel Gordan Smiley, MD in the Kaiser - Urologic Surgery Dept. in San Diego, CA. (how do I find out more info. about him? I was originally scheduled to have the biospy done with Dr. Eric William Gerber, MD.) * I have not had any urination problems, my only symptom is the lower back pain I started to have last week. I'm still trying to stay positive and your posts and this blog has helped. Thanks again and will keep you updated.",

      "Content": "Hi everyone, Here's my story. I am Mexican-American and just turned 47 this past July. I went to my doctor for my annual physical (7/29) and all my normal bloodwork and exams went well. For whatever reason, my doctor also ordered a PSA blood test for me. My first reading came in at 2.89. My doctor had me re-take the PSA test and it came in at 3.24. She put me on antibitoics (Ciprofloxacin) for 10 days and my third PSA test came in at 3.06. I am not aware of any prostate issues with my family. My dad and brother are alive and have never mentioned any prostate issues with me. I have been very worried since my doctor told me about the first elevated PSA test. I was scheduled for a biopsy this afternoon (8/16) but my doctor had to cancel his afternoon appointments for a surgery emergency. It has been rescheduled for next Fri, 8/24. A few days ago my lower back started to hurt and my anxiety has risen since I have read that this is one of the symptoms of advanced prostate cancer and that the antibiotics did not reduce my PSA level. I can't believe I have to wait another week to see if I have cancer or not. My biggest fear is that I have had prostate cancer for a number of years with no symptoms and now it has advanced with no cure and starting to feel the symptoms. I'm married with two boys and I am scared of leaving them so soon. Any advice or phone numbers that I can call for peer advice would be appreciated. Thank you.",

      "Content": "Hi everyone, Thank you for taking the time to respond to my initial post. I have scheduled a follow up visit for tomorrow (Mon, 8/20) with my primary doctor to check out my back pain and perform a prostate exam. My doctor ordered a PSA test during my physical exam but did not do a prostate exam at the time. I have asked for the exam in hopes of trying to get more info. prior to my biopsy scheduled for Fri, 8/24. Here is some additional info. * I spoke with my dad and asked him if ever had cancer or was tested. He said he had a \"colonoscopy\" done two years ago and everything came back ok. He says he has had physicals in the past with everything coming out ok but I'm not sure if he had PSA tests done. * The PSA reading of 2.89 was the first PSA reading I ever had. * The Biopsy I have scheduled for this coming Fri, 8/24 is being done by Dr. Daniel Gordan Smiley, MD in the Kaiser - Urologic Surgery Dept. in San Diego, CA. (how do I find out more info. about him? I was originally scheduled to have the biospy done with Dr. Eric William Gerber, MD.) * I have not had any urination problems, my only symptom is the lower back pain I started to have last week. I'm still trying to stay positive and your posts and this blog has helped. Thanks again and will keep you updated.",
