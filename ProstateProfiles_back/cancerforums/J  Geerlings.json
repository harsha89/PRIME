    "Content": "Im 57 yrs. Old, w/m and very healthy. I was notified by my doctor on nov 1st that i have prostate cancer. I'm scared,panicking and stressed. My biopsy revealed 8 core samples good and 4 bad out of a 12 sampling test. The 4 bad ones are 5% each. Gleason score 3+3=6. Psa 1.0 bone scan and cat scan negative. Cancer screen blood test in body besides prostate -negative. Slightly enlarged prostate. Prostate nodule -left mid zone -2.2x 1cm . Clinical stage t1c prostate volume -34cc. I feel great and working out every other day. Eating good and no pain in body. Am i a candidate for robotic surgery or is something else better for me. Do i have time to decide? Please help!!!!!!!!!!!!!",
