      "Content": "Originally Posted by ASAdvocate Stage 1 prostate cancer should usually not require radical treatment. But, your testing should tell you if there is additional cancer not found previously. Are you eligible for radiation? The cure rates are at least equal to surgery. There are many chemicals, plants, and potions being touted as cancer cures. Some people claim they have helped them, but, if that were universally true, oncology would cease to be needed, and I doubt that is going to happen. Thanks for replying! Second Bio in two weeks ! Do you know about proton therapy as apposed to radiation ??",
