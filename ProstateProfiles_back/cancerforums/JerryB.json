I shall certainly hope to be posting here later on regarding progress with my HIFU treatment. As Replicant says, HIFU is no more a certain 'cure' than any other form of treatment, and the longer term oncological data has yet to be proven. However, for me, I think - hope - it's the right way forward. I don't delude myself - as apparently notme did - that it is a treatment without side-effects, some of them potentially fairly serious.

However, on balance, it seems to offer reasonable hope as a potentially straightforward process for someone like me who is fortunate enough to still have prostate-confined cancer. Watch this space!

      "Content": "I guess it had to happen, and I'm sure that the air will be clearer now that the decision has been taken. Thanks to the Board for getting things done. I shall certainly hope to be posting here later on regarding progress with my HIFU treatment. As Replicant says, HIFU is no more a certain 'cure' than any other form of treatment, and the longer term oncological data has yet to be proven. However, for me, I think - hope - it's the right way forward. I don't delude myself - as apparently notme did - that it is a treatment without side-effects, some of them potentially fairly serious. However, on balance, it seems to offer reasonable hope as a potentially straightforward process for someone like me who is fortunate enough to still have prostate-confined cancer. Watch this space!
