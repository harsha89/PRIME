      "Content": "Hi My brother in law has just had prostate removed, he was told it was aggressive but had not gone into the lymph nodes or bones, he has been for his 4 week check and has been told that it had gone into the lymph nodes and that he has to have radio therapy, also that they are not sure if they have got it all out and that after the op most men have (got no idea what this is as he can't remember) have a 20% of something but his is 90% he is 54. Any idea what they mean? (they only found the cancer due to a hernia going wrong) Due to this my husband his brother who is 56 has been for tests, his blood count psa is normal as was his bloods and urine test, however his one testicle is larger then the other and appears to have a growth of some kind and his prostate is lumpy, his Dr has said it is probably nothing to worry about but he has been sent for a biopsy and a scan on both the testicles and the prostate. Some people have said it could be benign, has anybody had this ad it has turned out to be cancer? any help would be appreciated",
