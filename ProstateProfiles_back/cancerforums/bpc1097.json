      "Content": "Hello all, I was just diagnosed 2 weeks ago with pc. I am 56 yoa, my psa have been slowly raising the last year up to 4.66. My biopsy results are below confirming pc. Spent over an hour with my Urologist going over the test results and my options. He made it clear it is my choice on which treatment I chose. He is recommending I have RALP done due to my age and the one GS of 4+3. I have scheduled appointment with both the surgeon and the radiation oncologist. I have found lots of information on the internet, but yet at the same time I feel as if I have found no information. It is nice to have found this forum where I can read personal stories and not just facts. Right base of prostate, needle core biopsy: - Adenocarcinoma, acinar type. Gleason score: 6 (3 + 3), (grade group 1) Number of cores involved: 1 of 2 Total length of tumor: 1 mm Percentage of tumor: 5% of specimen volume >50% tumor in any core: No Perineural/lymphatic invasion: Absent B) Right mid prostate, needle core biopsy: - Adenocarcinoma, acinar type. Gleason score: 6 (3 + 3), (grade group 1) Number of cores involved: 2 of 2 Total length of tumor: 9 mm Percentage of tumor: 45% of specimen volume >50% tumor in any core: Yes (This is the optimal block for additional testing) Perineural/lymphatic invasion: Absent C) Right apex of prostate, needle core biopsy: - Adenocarcinoma, acinar type. Gleason score: 6 (3 + 3), (grade group 1) Number of cores involved: 2 of 2 Total length of tumor: 6 mm Percentage of tumor: 25% of specimen volume >50% tumor in any core: No Perineural/lymphatic invasion: Absent D) Left base of prostate, needle core biopsy: - Adenocarcinoma, acinar type.

The surgeon Brian Helfand from Northshore Hospital system, is very highly recommended and is doing 4 surgeries a week. The surgery is scheduled for mid Aug. I feel this the right path for me at this time Thanks Bpc1097",

      "Content": "Good luck with your RALP. I had mine done on 15 Aug 17, by Dr Brian Helfand at Northshore University Health System. He does the entire sugery, hmself, My surgery was at Glenbrook Hospital in Glenview. My results were outstanding. I felt very comfortable with Dr. Helfand who is highly qualified. They have a great support staff also. Every person I talked to spent as much time with me as needed (usually well over an hour). Never felt rushed at the appointment. The most important job you have now is finding the right Doctor for you. There are tons of qualified surgeons out there, but find the right one for you. And start your Kegels and walking. Good Luck BPC1097",
