First thing on the site asks if you are 18 and over, don't worry it's not a porn site! It looks like a good option for some. I originally was going to post it on the thread about the woman with a high sex drive but its locked. Sorry again about the link!",

Has anyone heard of the RXSleeve? Not sure how much pleasure it would give the men but it might simulate some normalcy for couples. <link deleted>",

      "Content": "Kristen, I don't have any advice but just wanted to say that my dads in a similar situation. 67, Gleason 4+3, cancer appears to be confined to the prostate. Only difference, other than a few years, is his is on both sides. One side had a few positive samples the other much more. He is still in the research and plan stage but right now is leaning towards robotic removal and going to The City of Hope for treatment. He too is very concerned about incontinence, as I'm sure anyone would be, but knows the alternative isn't great either. Good luck to your father! It's a strange place to be in as an adult child. I've always seen my dad as this un-breakable man and it is hard to see him faced with something like cancer. He is handling it like he does everything, obsessive research and lots of logic. His first week or so were spent trying to find stable ground again but he is much better now that he's put on his boxing gloves preparing to fight this thing.",
