My question is that today I am seeing more blood in my urine then I did when I was in the hospital. Is this normal? It's not a ton, just enough to give a slight red tinge to my urine.",

I would love to here comments and progress of others who have had PC in their 40's. I had a PSA of 26 and my biopsy showed 7 out of 14 sections with cancer. Gleason score of 7.",
