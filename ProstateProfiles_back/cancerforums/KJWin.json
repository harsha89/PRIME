      "Content": "Originally Posted by Otago Two weeks is really too short of a time... If the jump up is temporarily caused by some version of prostatitis... even asymptomatic prostatitis, then two weeks is not enough time to allow it to calm down. A jump from under 2, to over 8, is much more likely caused by such a inflammatory situation than by cancer. However, given your father's experience, I doubt you or your doctor are willing to wait 3 months. So go ahead and get the test... two weeks is NOT waiting too long by any means. Good that at age 40 you got a benchmark measurement of your normal psa, which assuming this latest one is due to a \"itis\" of some sort, will leave you with a mark from which to judge future psa results. Let us know the results. I would love to find out that this is all caused by some inflammatory situation. I've been reading articles all over the place looking for another cause which fits my symptoms, or lack thereof. I think the two week retest was more to validate the accuracy of the first test rather than see if something had changed in me in two weeks. In the meantime, I went in for the urinalysis earlier today and the results came back amazingly quickly. Everything looks to be within normal ranges. WBC was 0/HPF which seems to rule out asympomatic prostatitis (though that's based on my poor use of Google rather than a discussion with the urologist since their office is closed). Also, unrelated, I realized as I was looking up test results that I was wrong about my initial PSA a year ago... it was 1.8 not 1.35. Not sure how I messed that up. I am currently swinging wildly between \"it must be something else, just need to figure out what\" and \"it must be cancer\". Waiting and not knowing is terrible. Thanks all for listening - it helps to have a place to vent/share. Jason",

      "Content": "I'm 40 years old and had my first PSA test a year ago after my father died of aggressive prostate cancer at the age of 66. My result then was 1.35 and though this was a bit high, my doctor told me not to worry about it and have it retested in a year. Now, a year later, I just received a call from my urologist's nurse telling me that the test this year was 8.1. She asked about the possibility of a UTI but I don't seem to have any of the symptoms of that. She said they thought it could be a lab error and they want me to go in to have it retested in two weeks. I am, quite frankly, freaking out. After watching my dad go through it - and with two kids in my house under four years old, I'm trying hard not to be fatalistic. I have a couple questions if anyone has advice. First, how important is time right now? Is waiting two weeks for a retest a big deal? Objectively it doesn't seem like that long but emotionally it seems like an eternity during which things could go from bad to even worse. How worried should I be? This seems like a really high velocity assuming the test was accurate. Would this mean that the cancer is very aggressive or that it's already spread? Anything else I should be thinking about or doing right now? Thanks everyone for any advice. Jason",
