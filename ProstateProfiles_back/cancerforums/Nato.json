      "Content": "I can understand your dilema. This is my story. I had a radical prostatectomy 3 years ago after 3 years of roller coaster PSA levels, 3 biopsies and finally an RMI which indicated that there was cancer present. I was given all the literature and checked as many web sites as I could find and considering the risk for incontinence and impotency decided that the surgery was the \"best\" option for me. I was 55 at the time. The day before the surgery I jogged and my wife and I had sex as if it were for the last time. I had it done the front way and have the scar from below the navel downward to prove it - no more bikini swim trunks! Even though there are hospitals in the area ( I live south of Boston MA) I decided to use the local hospital. The surgery went well - four hours. The worse part was the catheter. Boy was I glad to have that removed 2 weeks later - I had bladder spasms. I started jogging 6 weeks later. My urologist told me before hand that if there were a potency problem Viagra would take care of it. I kept waiting for an erection those first days after the catheter was removed. I did kegels to get my bladder in working order and was able to stop using Depends within a week or so. I also tried to keep my weight down thinking that it would contribute to problems. I decided not to labor over the erection issue and one morning while brushing my teeth I suddenly got a full throbbing erection. I read an excelent book on healing after illness and found that I had became psychologically impotent. Once I got that out of my mind and with my wifes patience thing started to improve. My wife does not like the idea of Cialis or Viagra because it is not \"natural\" and has forced me into situations where I did not have time to take them and was able to penetrate with some difficulty, which she says prove that I don't need it. Everything hasn't been perfect. For a period of time after she reached orgasm, it would take me from 15 minutes to a half hour before I could reach orgasm. I would be totally exhausted from thrusting for so long. Now it is more like 5 - 15 minutes. And of course there are the times when I can not maintain a decent erection. On those occasions we relax and cuddle up and it usually happens. I occasionally use Cialis ( Viagra gives me a headache) but the main thing is that I don't have to use it all the time. I do agree with the comment that not laboring so much on the sex aspect and concentrating on love is important and also that your partner can reach orgasm without penetration. Keeping healthy otherwise is important also. I am 58 & 1/2 years old. I have other health issue but feel that this one is OK. Nato",
