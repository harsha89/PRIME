      "Content": "Goserelin (Zoladex) is a GnRH analog that prevents creation of testosterone by your body. Since most prostate cancers are heavily dependent upon testosterone to live and proliferate, this type of medication often has a very strong benefit in prostate cancer. Bicalutamide (Casodex) is a non-steroidal androgen receptor inhibitor. This blocks testosterone from attaching to individual cells and triggering pathways that will help them live and grow. It is also helpful to prevent a temporary worsening of symptoms when a GnRH agent is started in patients. Depending on the characteristics of one's disease, bicalutamide is often used for a limited amount of time, sometimes just for a few weeks, up to 6 months or 2 years. The duration of Goserelin (Zoladex) use is dependent on the stage and status of one's disease. The pages I linked have more information about side effects that you may find helpful.",

      "Content": "Edit: Sorry, disregard this response. Missed that one of the cores was gleason 3+4, which would not be appropriate for active surveillance. ------------------------------------------------------------ In addition to potentially curative therapies like surgery and radiation, another approach that can be considered is active surveillance, where the PSA, exam, and interval biopsies will be done. This would potentially delay the need for treatments and their side effects which include possible urinary and sexual issues. The argument against it for somebody so young is that, in contrast to people in, say, their 70s-80s who are diagnosed with such minimal disease, the likelihood of the prostate cancer being the biggest health problem for a young person is higher and will most likely need treatment. It can be very helpful for patients to meet with three specialties, medical oncology, radiation oncology, and urology to hear about the potential side effects of therapies so they can make the most informed decision. As a side note, why was a PSA checked in somebody who's 40 years old? Were there symptoms or family history?",

      "Content": "Though it may sound like splitting hairs, the study was not designed statistically to demonstrate equivalency of the two treatments. It was designed to show noninferiority (http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa1212299): \"The primary objectives of the trial were to determine whether intermittent androgen deprivation is noninferior to continuous androgen deprivation with respect to survival in patients with metastatic hormone-sensitive prostate cancer and to assess quality of life with the two regimens at 3 months after randomization.\" \"The hypothesis that the hazard ratio for death would be less than 1.20 was not rejected because the upper limit of the 90% confidence interval (equivalent to a one-sided 0.05 test) was 1.23, extending beyond the noninferiority threshold of 1.20. We therefore are unable to conclude that intermittent therapy was noninferior to continuous therapy with respect to survival. However, because the lower limit of the confidence interval (0.99) does not exclude 1.00, we cannot state that intermittent therapy was significantly inferior to continuous therapy.\" They were unable to show that intermittent therapy is noninferior to continuous therapy, and there indeed was a trend for improved survival in the continuous group. However, they couldn't say that intermittent therapy is not noninferior because the confidence interval crosses 1. So, statisically, the study is \"not not noninferior.\" The lead author Dr. Hussain summed it up honestly, but sounds biased toward continuous therapy: \"If a patient is coming in with newly metastatic prostate cancer, hormone treatment continuously is the standard. If they wish to do intermittent treatment, they should be counseled that based on this data, their outcome might be compromised.\" Sure, it \"might.\" The data pointed in that direction, but statistically it didn't reach significance. In the end, this will probably prompt discussions about how using intermittent care is probably not as good, but there's controversy in the data, and does the patient think the quality of life difference is worth that risk?",

      "Content": "People with cancer have a higher risk of clots (venous thromboembolism, VTEs); the association is very well-established. A possible scenario is that the doctors performed a CT chest with contrast to evaluate broadly for causes of the shortness of breath and not only found the blood clots, but also lung masses suggestive of metastatic disease. Then, wanting to figure out the origin of the cancer, somebody on the team may have checked tumor markers for cancers most common in people with this demographic--prostate cancer, colon cancer--and found the PSA to be significantly elevated, hence the high suspicion for prostate cancer. Or, perhaps they also had CT abdomen/pelvis imaging that showed a large prostate mass. If someone doesn't want a prostate biopsy, another reasonable option would be to biopsy a metastatic mass if it's accessible by a needle--this often can diagnose both the primary cancer and confirm the existence of metastatic disease.",

      "Content": "The Cleveland Clinic docs are closer to standard of care. I'll quote from the NCCN guidelines for prostate cancer, v. 1.2012, MS-20: \"A rise in PSA by 2 ng/mL or more above the nadir PSA (defined as the lowest PSA achieved) is the current standard definition for biochemical failure after EBRT [external beam radiation therapy] with or without neoadjuvant ADT [androgen deprivation] therapy.\" So first, many people would not consider a PSA of 0.9 (especially if it's just one value instead of a few increasing ones) to be biochemical recurrence. Next, the consensus \"expert opinion\" actually says that there's no proven survival advantage for early initiation of hormone therapy. I quote from the 2007 Update of an American Society of Clinical Oncology Practice Guideline: \"In metastatic or progressive PCa, immediate versus symptom-onset institution of ADT results in a moderate decrease (17%) in relative risk (RR) for PCa-specific mortality, a moderate increase (15%) in RR for non\u2013PCa-specific mortality, and no overall survival advantage. Therefore, the Panel cannot make a strong recommendation for early ADT initiation.\" So starting early hormone therapy for people with recurrent disease (typically with actual measurable disease, not just biochemical recurrence) may prevent how soon someone gets symptoms from recurrent prostate cancer, but there's no survival advantage. There are some studies that show early hormone therapy may affect how soon people develop measurable disease, but there hasn't been a definitive guideline or new data to change this thought about survival since that time. There are providers who start hormone therapy if the PSA doubling time is becoming shorter even when a patient lacks symptoms, but there's controversy about this too. Ultimately, the choice would be up to you since you've already found doctors on both sides of the fence, but hormone therapy has real potential side effects, especially for someone who may live quite a long time before ever encountering complications from prostate cancer.",

That's the only doctor that somebody in your situation would probably see regularly. Radiation oncologists usually are intermittently involved in care as needed, such as to radiate the prostate or deal with painful bony lesions. I wouldn't necessarily jump to the conclusion that the urologist is being money-hungry. Doctors default to continuing to be available for patients--for example, they can't abandon patients--and if there aren't any active urologic issues like urinary obstruction that the urologist is managing, I think it's unlikely the urologist would protest someone wanting to get hormone shots with their medical oncologist.",

The patients who participated in the AFFIRM trial (New England Journal of Medicine link--subscription required to read full article) were required to have very low levels of testosterone, which in the US generally means that they are also receiving a medication such as leuprolide (Lupron)--in some other places, these men have had their testicles removed (orchiectomy).
