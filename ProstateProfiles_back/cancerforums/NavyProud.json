      "Content": "Good day to everyone, I just received my first PSA test results since my surgery two months ago. The PSA level is shown as <0.13 in the test report. Per my quick research, it appears the PSA test was only sensitive enough to test down to the 0.13 level. It seems I should have been given a more sensitive test, at least to the 0.1 level. I would appreciate some help on this test result. I am meeting with my medical oncologist late this afternoon and I am trying to decide if I need to take a more sensitive test to correctly establish my post-surgery PSA baseline. Thank you, Jim",

Hopefully the sensitivity of that test will provide a more precise PSA measurement. Have a great day!",

He has done several hundred surgeries using the da Vinci robotic-assisted technique and he has trained over 60 surgeons in the use of the da Vinci robot. He willingly discussed the use of Partin Tables for guidance. He also entered my information (e.g., PSA, Gleason grade/score, tumor stage, # of positive/negative biopsy cores) into to the Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center prediction tool. This monogram can be used to predict what will happen after receiving treatments such as radical prostatectomy and brachytherapy. My doctor examined me regarding two prior surgeries I had for colon cancer and a ruptured appendix. He said I needed to have an Endorectal Coil MRI and his office helped me schedule the MRI.
