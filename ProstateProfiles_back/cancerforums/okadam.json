I know that a catheter will be involved for the first week. How did you deal with it? And I mean I want the nitty gritty. How did you sleep? How did you deal with the catheter. Did you have pajamas? Could you walk around? How soon? Sitting up? Watching TV? Pain? Pain management. Etc., etc. etc. How did you find out this information? From trial or error? Urologist office? Surgeon's office? I am not getting any info from anywhere, but not sure where and from whom I should? Or is it just too early? Thanks!",

      "Content": "I was reading my morning meditations today and realized that 3 years ago today, I was in the hospital, recovering from my prostate cancer surgery. I know that when I was first diagnosed I was full of fear. I turned to this forum for advice and re-assurance. So glad that I did! I just want to share that my life is great. No sign of any return of cancer. PSA levels are negligible. Looking forward to a pleasant retirement in about a year. For newbies, get as much information as you can. Read books, talk to doctors, consult friends, share your concerns on this forum, it all helps! Best wishes on your journey. Adam",
