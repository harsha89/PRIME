      "Content": "Hi Nick, I had surgery at Hopkins by Dr. Christian Povlovich this past Monday (10/19/15). I met Dr. Pavlovich when I attended the Prostate Cancer Multidisciplinary Clinic in late September. The clinic was great - a full day at Hopkins getting educated and reviewing your options. I attended the clinic because my urologist and 2nd opinion doctors simply recited my options with all sorts of caveats and admissions that their point of views were biased by their specialty - they did not give advice of what would be best for me. The clinic gave me a chance to get advice from Hopkins specialists on what's best for my specific situation - open surgery, robotic surgery, brachytherapy, external beam radiation, chemo, etc. All of the doctors at Hopkins are on salary so there is absolutely no financial incentive or competition for patients. After a morning briefing (with 3 other clinic attendees) and thorough medical history, the team of specialists met during the lunch hour to review our biopsy slides and reports etc. We were then told which treatment options were best for us according to what is most important (#1 = cancer erradication, #2 = recovery of urinary function, #3 = recovery of sexual function). My options were surgery or radiation therapy - so I met with Dr. Pavolich and Dr. Deville for almost an hour each. I was very impressed with both, but opted for robotic surgery. Dr. Pavlovich had done several hundred open radical prostectomies and over 1,000 laparoscopic prostectomies and almost 900 robotic prostetectomies. I've met with him four times so far. At the clinic, during prep for surgery, in the recovery room (I don't remember this one, but my wife told me), and the day after surgery shortly before I was discharged. His communication manner is excellent! At the clinic he listened patiently, answered my questions well, offered advice and discussed the pros and cons of surgery vs radiation. He was not hurried and helped me fill in the gaps of my understanding even when I wasn't sure what questions to ask. At discharge he gave me a full account of the surgery and made sure I was informed and prepared for going home. Just before being wheeled in to the operating room, the surgical nurse (who had raced against my cousin in track many many years ago) told me that if he ever needs to have a prostetectomy, he's going to have Dr. Pavlovich do the surgery. Good luck. I expect that you can't go wrong with anyone at Hopkins. John",

      "Content": "This is a continuation with Days 4 to 7. Day 4 - Thursday Another walk to the end of the drive for the Washington Post; this time I just carried the walking stick because I my pace was so much faster. I called Hopkins around lunch time to report continued constipation and left a message on the nurse\u2019s line saying that I had been instructed to call in my blocked bowels. I never did get a call back \u2013 they probably knew it was a matter of time. A few hours later had my first small success. It is so hard to pass anything when your insides can\u2019t bear any pushing or straining at all. Every few hours since then, the laxatives and softeners have created the urges to go and usually some small result \u2013 nothing gut clearing or relief from the discomfort of the gut cannon ball. I started to feel a lot of indigestion, my saliva felt frothy and everything tasted off \u2013 even water. My ears and neck didn\u2019t hurt as much as before, but now I was coughing frequently and recoiling from the pain to the abdomen. The catheter was still feeling uncomfortable, the bladder spasms with intense but brief pain and messy leakiness whenever I was exposed when using the toilet. I took to folding toilet paper around the tip whenever I stood, sat, or had a bladder spasm so I could catch the leaks before they dribbled all over. The highlight of the day was my first shower. I felt almost human afterwards. I took a lovely long walk to the river with my daughter (we live on a farm) that was about a mile \u2013 the return trip a gradual up hill. That night I actually slept well \u2013 only a couple waking times.Day 5 \u2013 Friday This day was the lowest point. Maybe I had pushed too hard on the long walk. Days 2, 3, and 4 had each felt better than the day before, but on this day I felt worse. Indigestion was worse, and everything noted above was still in force. The only noticeable improvement was in my ability to shift positions in bed or settle down in and rise up out of my chair. My voice still sounded funny. Bathroom trips were messy, frequent and minimally productive. I was crabby and not at all up for company. Day 6 \u2013 Saturday A better day \u2013 a slight lessening of the indigestion and all other pains. The cumulative bathroom trips had finally eased the pressure in my gut to some degree. I decided to try the leg bag just for a change and was happy to be relieved from the long tube and carrying the large overnight collection bag. (I carried it in a shopping bag to preserve a little decorum.) More walks at an almost normal pace. Catheter discomfort from the internal tubing increased to the point of being painful. After a few hours I noticed that the tubes had escaped their holding clip and tapes. An easy fix, but not instantaneous relief. Surely there was some minor tugging that aggravated the sensations. This was the first day I could read at length, but still not feeling up to playing any music.Day 7 \u2013 Sunday Such a better day on all accounts. I\u2019ve turned the corner! Almost no indigestion. More coughing, but my gut can take it now and it is unrelated to the surgery. My voice is almost normal and I can move and shift positions so much more easily now. Gut relief has been very gradual but I\u2019d rate it as \u2018not bad\u2019 now. Catheter is still uncomfortable and I have a constant sense of pressure, almost burning sensitivity from the perineum to where the tube emerges, but I can ignore it most of the time. 3 more days until catheter removal \u2013 can\u2019t wait!",

      "Content": "Steve - Send me a PM if you want to talk about Hopkins. They treated me wonderfully and I'm sure you'll find the same. Best of luck and let us know how it goes! Everyone - it is very helpful to read about the wide range of your experiences. Wish I had been on the easy recovery bus, but as Wilde points out, being clogged up can bring a legion of assorted and seemingly unrelated pains. For decades I've had an extremely sluggish colon and didn't consider taking a laxative until 10 days had passed since last BM. Going a week is not uncommon despite drinking lots of water and a high-roughage diet. Typically theres no pain or feeling bloated, just a bit longer on the throne to get the job done. That changed in August as one of the reactions to my biopsy (also most uncomfortable) was almost daily BMs for the next 8 weeks. By the time I had surgery the intervals were creeping back up to 3-4 days. So that may be a factor in why my digestive and urinary tracks have been in such rebellion. I should have brought it up to the surgeon beforehand, but it never occurred to me. John",

      "Content": "WARNING: If you are pre-surgery, consider postponing reading this until you come out the other side. I\u0092m candid about my discomforts \u0096 nothing horrible, but my experience seems worse than the few other accounts I\u0092ve read here. I don\u0092t wish to sow concerns about the recovery process. I\u0092ve had no complications and the most important thing is to just get through it. These are my experiences of the first week. I may remember it differently as time works its wonders. I\u0092m sure, your mileage will vary. Hi everyone, I'm 60 years old, 6' 1\", about 180 lbs. I have an office job and live on a farm. I run 15 to 20 miles a week to keep fit. This is my account of the first 7 days after robotic surgery. Sorry for the long post!! I'm happy to answer any questions about my experiences and I promise my responses will be brief. JohnDay 1 - 10/19/15 Monday At 11:30 we arrived at Johns Hopkins Bayview Medical Center at 11:30am with my wife and family. At 12:00 I was brought to the OR prep area. At 1:30 on the nose, I was wheeled toward the OR the general anesthesia started to kick in. At 5:30, I came to in the recovery room with a dry mouth and hearing my wife\u0092s voice saying \u0093you made it!\u0094 At 6:30, I was brought to my hospital room. I was able to shuffle around the hallways with wife and my IV pole around 9pm. I was very groggy all evening. I had an IV going into one hand, a catheter, and a drainage tube coming out my leftmost incision. This tube was connected to a plastic receptacle a little larger than a hockey puck into which blood etc. collected. I had Oxycodone at 8p, 12p, 4:30a, 8a \u0096 for pain, mostly rectum cramps and gas pains, but it did very little and I hardly slept. As the general anesthesia wore off, I became aware of how many different ways things didn\u0092t feel right \u0096 most of them painful. My face was puffy and my neck was very swollen and tender to the touch. My voice was fuzzy and nasally \u0096 a little bit like Donald Duck or speaking with a cleft palette or huffing helium at the point when it is no longer squeaky, but hasn\u0092t totally worn off. In the wee hours, I got up hoping another walk would lessen my pain. As I swung my legs over the bed and pushed myself upright, I somehow popped open the plug in the drainage disk and blood gushed all over bed, my gown and the floor. I summoned the nurses and had a whole team there quickly for the \u0091clean up in aisle 3\u0092 \u0096 I\u0092m afraid I didn\u0092t make their top ten list of favorite patients that night. But they were wonderful and reassuring and got me cleaned up in a jiff. I never did take a walk, but spent some time in the bathroom trying to relieve the gas pressure. When the sun rose, I sent out some texts saying I had made it through the night, then slept soundly for a couple hours. Day 2 \u0096 Tuesday Throughout the day everything south of my navel was hurting. The most intense sensations were the butt cramps and gas. The nurses regularly asked me to rate the pain on a 1-10 scale. My responses ranged from 3 to 6 with the caveat that I reserved 7 and up for intensity that made you cry out. I made regular trips to the bathroom and spent 20 minutes at a time trying to bend-stand-sit with many reps in an attempt to expel gas. Eventually, I passed a small amount of gas and diarrhea, but it brought no relief. In hindsight, I should have rated the pain higher on the scale and asked for a more powerful pain reliever. The catheter was uncomfortable and I could feel the tube from where it enters at the tip all the way across the perineum. In mid-afternoon, I was given Dilaudid and that helped a lot. I had frequent visits from the day crew \u0096 nurses and techs, the head of the unit, the pharmacist, and even a nurse from my insurance company. Despite the pain, I felt well looked after. Dr. Pavlovich stopped in about 4p to give a full report of the surgery. The neurovascular nerve bundle on the right was fully spared, but he had to cut into the one on the left as it was part of the margin close to the tumor. I asked if having only one spared nerve meant that my erections would be lopsided and he explained that the left and right nerves were redundant systems and that the left nerve should repair itself over time. Next another doctor who attended the surgery came in to remove the drainage disk. This did not hurt at all, but I was surprised that the tube that emerged was over a foot long. Things speeded up at that point \u0096 a huge bag of supplies and instructions on post-op care. The 50 minute ride home wasn\u0092t bad, but I felt every single bump. At home by 6:30p, I had little appetite but ate. I could hardly generate enough saliva to swallow bread, but it all tasted good. All of the pain, discomfort and tenderness noted above were in full force and I took Dilaudin every three hours, as directed so I was in a constant state of grogginess. I took some Tylenol as I had a strong headache. My voice was slurred and I couldn\u0092t manage much volume. Many stopped by to wish me well, but I don\u0092t remember much clearly. My gut was still seized up. It felt like a solid mass \u0096 an ancient pitted cannon ball was very slowly rolling and rotating around in my abdomen. The five incisions were tender, but nowhere as painful as everything else. I climbed the stairs to my bedroom and, despite the Dilaudid, had very little sleep. Several trips to the bathroom during the night to try to get some gas expelled. As a precaution, I slept on a towel and we put one at the side of my bed. While in bed, sitting up, rolling on my side, or adjusting my position in any way was very painful, but often could be accomplished if done slowly. My wife and daughter frequently helped me sit upright for the first few days. I used whatever I could grab on the headboard, floor lamp, mattress to use my arms and feet to help relieve the pressure on my abdomen when moving in, out, or around in bed or getting up or out of my living room chair. Ropes suspended from the ceiling hanging over me in strategic places would have been very useful.Day 3 \u0096 Wednesday I finally lapsed into a sound sleep from 5-7a then decided to brave a walk to the end of the gravel driveway (several 100 yards) to retrieve the newspaper. I took a walking stick and my progress was so slow that, from a distance, an observer may have thought I was barely moving. I felt steady on my feet despite the snail\u0092s pace. I did everything I could to get my gut moving \u0096 prunes, milk of magnesia, lots of water, Colace, body contortions but all I got was rumblings. I got calls from all sorts of nurses \u0096 Hopkins, insurance companies (CareFirst and Hartford - short term disability) and patient advocates. I had my last Dilaudid around lunch time and switched to Advil. Pain was still up there, but I couldn\u0092t stand the grogginess and, more importantly, the narcotics slowed down my colon. I bargained for more discomfort in exchange for unfreezing the gut plumbing. I told the Hopkins nurse about the constipation, and she said to call it in if it had not moved in 24 hours. I read on this cancer forum of patients who seemed to have sailed through the recovery days with minimal discomfort and felt like I had a long way to go to merely achieve the status of \u0091wimp.\u0092 By mid-afternoon I was more clearheaded, but distracted by the abdominal discomfort. Added to this was the burning pain of bladder spasms and leakage during frequent yet unsuccessful trips to the bathroom. For some reason as I went to bed, my ears, neck and head throbbed with pain \u0096 like I was coming down with the flu. Another fitful night with soreness amplified every time I shifted position or the two times in the middle of the night I got up to try the bathroom one more time.",

That changed in August as one of the reactions to my biopsy (also most uncomfortable) was almost daily BMs for the next 8 weeks. By the time I had surgery the intervals were creeping back up to 3-4 days. So that may be a factor in why my digestive and urinary tracks have been in such rebellion. I should have brought it up to the surgeon beforehand, but it never occurred to me. John",

      "Content": "This is a continuation with Days 4 to 7. Day 4 - Thursday Another walk to the end of the drive for the Washington Post; this time I just carried the walking stick because I my pace was so much faster. I called Hopkins around lunch time to report continued constipation and left a message on the nurse\u2019s line saying that I had been instructed to call in my blocked bowels. I never did get a call back \u2013 they probably knew it was a matter of time. A few hours later had my first small success. It is so hard to pass anything when your insides can\u2019t bear any pushing or straining at all. Every few hours since then, the laxatives and softeners have created the urges to go and usually some small result \u2013 nothing gut clearing or relief from the discomfort of the gut cannon ball. I started to feel a lot of indigestion, my saliva felt frothy and everything tasted off \u2013 even water. My ears and neck didn\u2019t hurt as much as before, but now I was coughing frequently and recoiling from the pain to the abdomen. The catheter was still feeling uncomfortable, the bladder spasms with intense but brief pain and messy leakiness whenever I was exposed when using the toilet. I took to folding toilet paper around the tip whenever I stood, sat, or had a bladder spasm so I could catch the leaks before they dribbled all over. The highlight of the day was my first shower. I felt almost human afterwards. I took a lovely long walk to the river with my daughter (we live on a farm) that was about a mile \u2013 the return trip a gradual up hill. That night I actually slept well \u2013 only a couple waking times.Day 5 \u2013 Friday This day was the lowest point. Maybe I had pushed too hard on the long walk. Days 2, 3, and 4 had each felt better than the day before, but on this day I felt worse. Indigestion was worse, and everything noted above was still in force. The only noticeable improvement was in my ability to shift positions in bed or settle down in and rise up out of my chair. My voice still sounded funny. Bathroom trips were messy, frequent and minimally productive. I was crabby and not at all up for company. Day 6 \u2013 Saturday A better day \u2013 a slight lessening of the indigestion and all other pains. The cumulative bathroom trips had finally eased the pressure in my gut to some degree. I decided to try the leg bag just for a change and was happy to be relieved from the long tube and carrying the large overnight collection bag. (I carried it in a shopping bag to preserve a little decorum.) More walks at an almost normal pace. Catheter discomfort from the internal tubing increased to the point of being painful. After a few hours I noticed that the tubes had escaped their holding clip and tapes. An easy fix, but not instantaneous relief. Surely there was some minor tugging that aggravated the sensations. This was the first day I could read at length, but still not feeling up to playing any music.Day 7 \u2013 Sunday Such a better day on all accounts. I\u2019ve turned the corner! Almost no indigestion. More coughing, but my gut can take it now and it is unrelated to the surgery. My voice is almost normal and I can move and shift positions so much more easily now. Gut relief has been very gradual but I\u2019d rate it as \u2018not bad\u2019 now. Catheter is still uncomfortable and I have a constant sense of pressure, almost burning sensitivity from the perineum to where the tube emerges, but I can ignore it most of the time. 3 more days until catheter removal \u2013 can\u2019t wait!",
