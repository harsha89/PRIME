      "Content": "I'm sure this is going to sound like bragging ( I am actually!) but last Saturday night \"exercises\" resulted in very nearly full length firmness. That's something I've not had since the surgery. It was good enough for over one minute of intercourse! I've had it firm enough to go at it, but it was a little on the short side. Seeing how my surgeon only save nerves on one side I'm sure I'm way early for this much success...but the more I think about it the more I think my daily exercises are helping. When I'm showering I do the exercises mention on the PE Gym web site I've mentioned before. I truly believe it's helping me. I'm getting instant reactions from just kissing the wife or playing with her when she is cooking. Not full blown but enough I have to adjust my little man. One of the main things they talk about in these exercises doing is to help improve the blood flow though out the penis...to help \"clean\" out the tubes where the blood goes... I was doing these before I even knew I had cancer so my penis is used to the activity...which is just like working out in the gym. Over-training is bad...but a couple minutes during every shower could help some of you guys recover faster. I'm one month 8 days post op as of today. Can't wait till I'm one month post op!",

I had read that you should not before psa test but from agony before the tests i couldnt sleep other way.. but i dont think it can raise the psa too much right? i was reading somewhere something like 0.10 raise.. The only thing I can add is I too didn't know not to have sex/ejaculations before having a PSA test...like you I had sex every time, but my PSA was not higher than one would have expected seeing how I did have PC. Mine ranged from 6 to 8...the 8 being the very first PSA test that started the ball rolling for diagnosis of having PC.",

To be honest I was going to ignore the test results because it was part of \"wellness\" program for work...I only took the blood test to save $10 a month on my medical insurance. About a month after the test which I kept secret I dislocated my color bone in the gym. The wife and I went to Dr. office to pickup a referral to see a specialist. While at the Dr. office picking up the referral the receptionist said...\"oh here is your other referral!\" Well the wife was curious about what was in the envelope and opened it. She insisted I go so I made an appointment. He did the finger thing and found a small lump on the left side and retested the PSA. It came back at 6 so he said because of the lump he wanted to do a biopsy. Came back again and had that done. To be honest neither of us thought to much about. I'm healthier than most horses...look much younger than I really am. Survived a loooong list of accidents that should have killed me when I was a teenager. So I figured it was nothing and we would continue our lives. Well....we go into his office and the look on his face was not good. He made the announcement that I tested positive with prostate cancer! My wife went hysterical, crying uncontrollably with her face buried in the pillow. The Dr. and I continued to talk about it. About the only thing I knew about it was you lost you bedtime pleasures. My wife never would look at the Dr. when he finished talking. He told us to take our time and see his reception before we left. It still a minute or two before she would look at me. She told me she wanted to slap his face for being so cold when he told us. So I went to researching Dr. for the job. The original Dr. had only done 300 robotic surgeries so I found Dr. Brian Miles and he had done thousand of operations, so went with him and been happy that we did! The rest is history!",

The older we get the lower our test gets, the more likely you are to get PC. So I think a case could be made that lower...or dropping test causes PC to kick off and start being an issue.

I forgot to ask on my last URO. visit...I had so many questions and took up so much time I could tell he needed to move on to the next patient. I think he has a surgery nearly every day.

So any way; Any one receive testosterone? Did it help? What was their goal testosterone level? Last time I had mine checked it was 330...bottom edge of except able.",

The older we get the lower our test gets, the more likely you are to get PC. So I think a case could be made that lower...or dropping test causes PC to kick off and start being an issue.

Celebrate, and just concern yourself with keeping your next recommended appointment. Yes...the 8.0 was actually in April I also had one in September that was 6.8...I like to see the Doctor on Mondays (not sure why but it always works that way) and always have sex on the weekends...ALWAYS...so my numbers are a little boosted by that. The one in September was the last one Pre-op. The 8.0 and the two most recent <0.1 are all the same labs...the 6.8 was my first uro, but not the one who did my surgery.",

Still had a couple of wet nights, due to being very tired upon going to bed and not getting woken up in the middle of the night with the urge to urinate. It's a slow progression getting back to \"normal\", whatever that turns out to be. ED still a issue, going to Doc next Tuesday to see if a new plan is in order. The saga continues... Sorry to hear yo're having to make a trip back for the ED issue. The Trimix is working for me luckily...not much action down there without it. I'm still using one pad a day...but I am having to get up in the middle of the night to go...like you the saga continues...",

This evening we made a steak dinner and had wine. We toasted on the continuation of our lives together. No longer worried about widowhood in 5 years, which makes leaking a small price to pay. Took a selfie and sent it to the kids. Nice! Like he said the leaking will go away! This definitely changes the way you look at the future! Enjoy every second of it!",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by HighlanderCFH Hi'ya Cock, It can differ from case to case, from doctor to doctor, etc. But most surgeons usually wait for 12 weeks before the first post-op PSA test. But others seem to prefer also taking one at the halfway point. So you are probably okay one way or the other. Perhaps with a Gleason 4+3, they just want a sneak preview. But it often can take more than 2 months before all of the PSA works its way out of the system. As usual I didn't type what I wanted to say I guess... I made the appointment myself....just cause I was wanting to know. I do plan to take the results with me on the 8th of February... My question is ...Will my numbers be accurate this soon after surgery? But from you guys are telling me it reasonable to expect them to be accurate. Thanks guy!",

I've scaled back the doses a little so I can stretch it out a little longer before needing a re-fill. $100.00 worth you get three syringes, each one good for two sessions (i'm getting three sessions per now). A lot better price than your needle! Get her to let you have a go at it...good luck! SC",

I can cough and sneeze without a loosing drop...but if I prop my leg up on a truck bumper to hang out and talk...I get the feeling that I lost a few drops, but have not seen any evidence that really I did. I don't check right away...but if I am it's not much. To be honest my bashful bladder is coming back. I have not done kegels at all. So to answer your question about should you stop...I can't say. But if I think someone is watching me...i'm locked up and can't get much more than a slight dribble going...slept last night for 5 hours without getting up to hit the rest room. Sex...Trimix is saving my life in that area. I was able to get it done one weekend twice without it, but it was not much fun...had to pay a lot of attention to the little guy. Orgasms...they are different...I've had issues with achieving orgasms during normal intercourse before RP, but had one a few weeks ago...that was better than the old days.

I get little heart burn/reflux from Viagra so I have to keep Tums handy...one Tums and it's gone...I get a little sometimes after using Trimix Gel too...So I'm pretty sure they are mixing them already",

      "Content": "Yeah...for you guys that are nervous about the needle...which i'm not, but the DR. gave the gel and it works fine...so I've never had to use the needle. From what I've read, the gel lasts better than the TriMix. I've left mine out over night with no ice or refrigeration during a cruise and it still worked perfect. During a trip to Destin Florida a similar thing happened...I had it in a little cooler and the cooler turned over and spilled all the ice out. It ended up getting very warm as it was in the heat of summer...rock hard in about 15 minutes! I have not tried to get my insurance to cover it because it was fairly new when I started it about one year ago. I can now get three sessions out of one syringe out of one. That kind of drops the price to $8.33 a dose...each syringe is $25.00. You get about two hours of guarantied wood (I think your mom could walk in on you and not kill it) so IMO its worth it. Cialis is a bit hit and miss as is Viagra...they work fine to give the little guy some exercise, but for real action...the gel is the BOMB!",

I have bashful bladder and I'm now thinking those muscles are still there....it must have not been the prostate. I've had a number of times over the past week and a half where I couldn't go...I had to talk him...talk it out like I used too... The pain is more of a stinging type feeling very close to the anus...pretty much been there since day one post surgery. Any thoughts on this?",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by JimBow I've had \"bashful bladder\" all my life as well. In fact, mine has been so bad that I learned to self-catheterize in case of an emergency, such as being away from a private restroom for hours. I've always called it shy bladder, and it's also known as paruresis. Something like 21 million Americans have paruresis, yet it isn't talked about much. Anyhow, I've been wondering how having a prostatectomy might ultimately make it easier to pee, and reduce the shy bladder problem. It's interesting that you brought that up. I'm probably a couple of months away from the surgery, so we'll see. Good luck with your recovery! I still have little problems going if someone walks up behind me...happened today. I took a deep breath and tried to relax and it worked...I was able to go. I think it's helping me control the leakage. I'm really only wearing a pad for just incase this week. Yesterday I didn't have to first drop get loose. I went to the gym this morning and was dry as a bone after.",

      "Content": "Sorry I've been gone so long guy! John, You almost sound like me! Sex is still my number 1 issue. Matter of a fact I just got off the phone with the Pharmacy about my Trimix. Let me say, your number one issue right now is the best Oncologists/Urologist/surgeon you can find! You want the best of the best! I have a very close friend who didn't comfy with me until it was too late. He went from an elevated PSA to a long hospital stay (almost one month) then to full blown cancer in about two months. I found out about his diagnosis just a few days before his surgery. I recall telling my wife I wish he had told me sooner so I could have talked him out of using a rookie surgeon. Last time I talked to him urinary control was not coming back too! 2 things will come out of getting the best of the best...no more cancer and an exceptable recovery. I'm as good as I'm going to get as for going into the bed room...so me and my meds go in and get'ter done! I have great sex and erection with certain meds. I just seen my new Urologist and he wants me to try the injectable Trimix...not big on needles, but have no fear of one...so here we go! Did I mention getting the best Oncologists/Urologist/surgeon you can find? Of course I did! Why because your life depends on it! Your sex life, urinary life, and a long life!",

      "Content": "FYI- surgery 12/11/2015 I know you guys have a ED sticky, but I wanted to throw this out where everyone would at least look at it. I think it can help! I happen to be lucky enough to have suffered from DE (delayed ejaculation). I was normally able to hammer away until I would reach orgasm, but not every time. Even when I was young (I'm talking teenager)...a number of times I would just give up and tell her we could finish later. It did get worse as I got older too. Any way in my quest to try to find a solution to my problem I found web site called PE Gym. They have forums that cover everything from enlarging your penis...exercises for ED...not much help for my problem, but I tried some of their techniques to make my erections harder and some for length as well as girth. And believe it or not I saw improvements in all three areas. I can't say the little women was as happy I was...so I had to stop length and girth exercises because it is uncomfortable for her. She is a little please that I might not be able to get back to my normal size...LOL...that really sucks doesn't it? Any way some of these exercise should be beneficial to all PC survivors. I've been stretching and doing the exercise for girth to help force blood into my penis and have had positive results and I'm not even one month past surgery. I'm on the Cialis 5mg for 6 days and 20mg for one day so I've got that helping me. I've had three occasions where I have got hard enough for penetration...75%ish has been my max. It didn't last long...but I got it in! https://www.pegym.com/ Not sure if the Admin's will freak out over this, but I'm for helping everyone get back in the saddle. And I truly think it can help. Guys look into the threads where they are talking about length and girth exercises...I believe they can help you recover!",

The needle is so thin and small it's virtually painless. Good Luck Allen Also...Trimix comes in a gel as well if the needle makes you squeamish...I've been using it for some time with great results.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by Sarg For what it is worth, the surgeon prescribed a vacuum pump after my surgery. I got one and used it faithfully for 6 months. While it may have helped some, it was not really noticeable that I can tell. On my 6 month follow up with the surgeon he said I could quit using it. So maybe it works wonders, according to the ads, but just not for everyone to the extent they say it will. I made one with PVC pipe and an automotive vacuum pump. It worked great if you needed girth, but that was not really the area I was looking to improve. It did help with firmness though. Of course then I had not had my surgery so I'm not sure what would happen now. The NP gave me instruction when she pulled my cath. that the Dr. wants me to start using a pump if I have no responses to the Cialis therapy by Jan. 18th. Luckily I didn't throw it away and still have. I might post up a picture and the details of it to help some of the guys save money if they are interested in having one. Also...I forgot to say you need to run these exercises by your Dr. before you take off doing anything from the site listed above...",

I ask him to find out which cancer because as of this morning no one that I knew of in either side of my family had PC. He called back to confirm Prostate Cancer! So now I have a hereditary connection to where it came from. This is kind of distant but just the same. His mother and my grandfather were brother and sister. To my knowledge we are the only two in the entire family of men to have it! Roughly 18 men sons, grandsons and great-grandson of my grandfather and his siblings. 5 or 6 of them have already passed...only two from cancer...one of those were at my level in the family tree.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by gkwhisler I actually was diagnosed in September of 2014 by Biopsy (2 of 10 samples one 5% the other 20% = Gleason 3+3) I had an MRI last April which did not show anything significant. I had my second biopsy yesterday and will get the results in 2 weeks. I am 55, very active (50 marathons and just ran 2 50 mile events). Do I need to have treatment to remove my prostate and if I do how long will I be laid up? Even though I have researched things some I am still very confused about all of it. I am told most people die with PC and not of PC. Welcome! I was born and lived in Virginia until I was 14yo! \"IF\" you need it removed you will most likely be back in action fairly quickly...three months should have you healed up enough to start training again. I'm a quick healing and have waited to be sure I don't mess up the good Dr. work. Remember ED is the result of the surgery and you don't want to damage any thing that will slow that process down. Personally I'd be nervous as a cat on a hot tin roof doing AS...knowing it is out is a pretty good feeling. BUT...medical advances could save you process of surgery and the ED that comes with it... IMO-radiation doesn't appeal to me...leaving the cancer in there...spooky to me...less options too if it comes back... Any way...way ahead of our selves...good luck on the results!",

      "Content": "Almost one month since my Prostate was removed. I'm 56yo and very sexually active before the surgery. No history of PC in my family...I was the odd man out looks like. My surgeon has done about 3,000 robotic surgeries so feel like I made a good choice, he was not the Dr. who did my biopsy and diagnosis. I moved to the other Dr. because orginal Dr. had only done about 300 procedures and his bed side manors was terrible. The way he told the wife and I nearly killed her! Today is my first day back to work. I'm on my third Maxi-pad for the day...not the best considering yesterday I was dry all day. I'm the most happy that I'm dry all night. The kegal exercise's are not what I thought they were. I've done them for years, but the muscle that controls my bladder is closer to the feeling of my prostate doing the job. So I'm still trying to figure that one out. My Dr. talked me through the exercise I thought I was dead on, but it causes me more leakage than it stops...so this is still a work in progress. Sex of course has been almost non-existent. I got about 75% about a week ago and was able to make penetration, but it didn't last very long. Got it back and again it didn't last very long. I did masturbate to orgasm this morning...but with only about 65%...was not expecting anything to come out, but should have known pee was going to come out...a little messy but felt great! LOL Any way...first post...I'll be checking things out over time!",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by gkwhisler I actually was diagnosed in September of 2014 by Biopsy (2 of 10 samples one 5% the other 20% = Gleason 3+3) I had an MRI last April which did not show anything significant. I had my second biopsy yesterday and will get the results in 2 weeks. I am 55, very active (50 marathons and just ran 2 50 mile events). Do I need to have treatment to remove my prostate and if I do how long will I be laid up? Even though I have researched things some I am still very confused about all of it. I am told most people die with PC and not of PC. Welcome! I was born and lived in Virginia until I was 14yo! \"IF\" you need it removed you will most likely be back in action fairly quickly...three months should have you healed up enough to start training again. I'm a quick healing and have waited to be sure I don't mess up the good Dr. work. Remember ED is the result of the surgery and you don't want to damage any thing that will slow that process down. Personally I'd be nervous as a cat on a hot tin roof doing AS...knowing it is out is a pretty good feeling. BUT...medical advances could save you process of surgery and the ED that comes with it... IMO-radiation doesn't appeal to me...leaving the cancer in there...spooky to me...less options too if it comes back... Any way...way ahead of our selves...good luck on the results!",

      "Content": "Hey guys! Been a while since my last post, been busy with a schedule change at work...vacation and things like that. Speaking of vacation...i mentioned we were going on a cruise...we did...had a blast! I did how ever pic up a slight summer cold while on the ship. The wife had some Nightquil so i took a good shot to hopefully kill it before we got to Cozumel so i could enjoy our snorkeling trip. About 2am I thought the ship was sinking! My underwear were WET and so was the bed! I had slept though the urge to go pee...and flooded the bed! I learned a hard lesson for when your sick. Wear something that can handle the flood if you're taking something for a cold! The killer is I had been running around without a pad a few times the week before. I've even started cutting the women's maxi pads in half because I only need the slightest of protection these days (almost 7 months post op). So it really cut into my pride to have wet the bed like that! Now for a little good news! Trimix gel does just fine for a few days without refrigeration! Took enough for a couple nights of action, but was not able to do much more than store it at room temperature. Only thinking about my PC a few times a day now...not constantly for every second like I was a month ago! LOL",

I had a stinging sensation when I pee'd right where the prostate used to be (where the union was made ) and a spot near the end of the penis that was irritated by the catheter. When I seen the Dr. the last time...6 weeks post op he put me on Vesicare. At times it was bad and other days ok...if I walked a lot it would be the worst, but after two days on Vesicare it was gone. I'm still taking it but doubt I need it. It must be expensive because he gave me a discount card with the prescription...",

      "Content": "Congrats! Yeah 2 out of 3 isn't too shabby...I'd trade a little squirt now and then to have my erections back to pre-op....usable erections are only through modern medicine still. They are close to usable at shower time and playing around with the little women, but nothing to get too excited about. Im still a couple weeks short of 5 months so I guess I should be pleased to have solid erections at all... My little squirts are only from odd positions...can't do the leg up on the bumper while everyone stands around the truck. That causes a tiny squirt every time...can't sit on the steps any more either...lol Any direct contact with \"that area\" and i get a tiny squirt...gym is no problem, even started drinking a bottle of water during the hour I'm there without any leakage.... Any way...I'm sure you'll be 3 of 3 soon enough! Good luck!",

Still have a moment here and there where I leak a tiny bit. But for the most part dry as a bone. Had to go before lunch last Friday and ended up in my truck before I thought about going. Went to lunch and returned...plus took care of some business before I \"hit the can\". Roughly and hour and half needing to go but didn't! ED still not where I'd like it to be. 50mg of generic Viagra is working pretty good now. The Trimix Gel of course bring me back to my teens! A grade 10 erection for a couple hours! MAN! I like that stuff...wife wants me to stay off that thinking I will return to normal faster without any kind of crutch! I need to make an appointment for this weekend...PSA time you know! Still carrying too much weight and never lost the pubic bulge that accompanied the \"bull balls\" post surgery. The testicles returned to normal but not pubic area?!?!?!?!? I'm still in the gym a few times a week and got my bench press back up to 160lbs. I really wanted to thank the men and women who post here. You guys have been a true life saver! I will post up my latest PSA when I get the results in! Thanks again!",

      "Content": "Wow....the longest year I can remember since I was a kid...waiting on Christmas! Like the title says...today is one day past my surgery! Still have a moment here and there where I leak a tiny bit. But for the most part dry as a bone. Had to go before lunch last Friday and ended up in my truck before I thought about going. Went to lunch and returned...plus took care of some business before I \"hit the can\". Roughly and hour and half needing to go but didn't! ED still not where I'd like it to be. 50mg of generic Viagra is working pretty good now. The Trimix Gel of course bring me back to my teens! A grade 10 erection for a couple hours! MAN! I like that stuff...wife wants me to stay off that thinking I will return to normal faster without any kind of crutch! I need to make an appointment for this weekend...PSA time you know! Still carrying too much weight and never lost the pubic bulge that accompanied the \"bull balls\" post surgery. The testicles returned to normal but not pubic area?!?!?!?!? I'm still in the gym a few times a week and got my bench press back up to 160lbs. I really wanted to thank the men and women who post here. You guys have been a true life saver! I will post up my latest PSA when I get the results in! Thanks again!",

My dr. told me I could get started that quickly but I've waited until after my 6 week check up to really start lifting heavy. My number one concern is ED and I certainly didn't want to pull something down there and take a chance to lose that for ever! Two months post op everything down there feels pretty much like it did before the surgery...still don't have solid wood without help...but there is improvements outside of the prescriptions.

Best of luck, MM Have you tried TrixMix Gel? When I first started using it my little man was not too lively, but he woke up quickly with a dose of TM gel. organic farmer; I think the pain comes from lack of erections...the pain has got much better after the 20mg of Cialis every other day. I don't have any pain any more. OMT-try to get him up every chance you get. it helps get the pain of erection under control.",

      "Content": "I have suffered from DE (delayed ejaculation) long before I ever found out that I had PC. I never thought to much about because the women in my life always looked at me like I was a super hero because it took so long. But my current wife doesn't like the long delay, so I went to the Dr a couple years ago and she prescribed me low dosage of Viagra to help keep me harder hoping that would help and it did, but it wasn't covered under my insurance. So I looked around and found Fildena. Supposed to be same thing...very cheap...I bought the 100mg and cut them into quarters. My Viagra prescription was 25mg... It did help a little with the DE but on long weekends or \"honey moon\" type vacation (just us) it was nice to have! 25mg would last about two days...so for sport sex is was fun to have around. However it comes out of India. I have bought it two times, both times I got some free stuff, plus the orders were filled to the quantity ordered. The web site is the name dot org. I never sent them any prescriptions just ordered and paid for...got it in less than two week...even got follow up email asking if I was satisfied with the service and product.",

His mother is on her last week of Chemo for lung cancer (non-smoker in a non-smoking house). But any way I was telling him I'm waiting on my 4th PSA test since I've had surgery. I'm 8 days short of 5 months post-op, but it feels like it should be twice that long since my surgery. I know I've talked about this before...seems like it was months and months ago, but I'm sure it's not even been two months ago. But I think about having PC nearly every hour of everyday...I'm not depressed or anything like that...not doing the poor little-o'll me thing. But every time I go to the rest room I think about it. EVERY TIME! I'm pretty sure that is one reason it seem like time is clicking along so slowly. Any way...here I sit waiting on another PSA blood test...I think my last one was about two weeks ago!

      "Content": "Originally Posted by PDV I'd be leery of any place that doesn't require a prescription. I've read some horror stories about people paying for bogus pills. As far as \"generic\" Cialis, the active ingredient is tadenafil (may be misspelled) which is already available. This is the third time I've ordered from the guy and they always send free samples of other products...ED pills...and they have always been professionally packaged and the doses seem consistent...The first time I felt like I was most likely throwing money away, but the cost of Viagra is so high I figured I try it. I got the 100mg and cut it into quarters... This is the Viagra generic;",

No reason to take any chances with your private accounts on overseas deals. Also of note...they have never ask me for the prescription. They say they want one, even give you a button to upload a scan of it during check out... PM me if you're interested...",

His mother is on her last week of Chemo for lung cancer (non-smoker in a non-smoking house). But any way I was telling him I'm waiting on my 4th PSA test since I've had surgery. I'm 8 days short of 5 months post-op, but it feels like it should be twice that long since my surgery. I know I've talked about this before...seems like it was months and months ago, but I'm sure it's not even been two months ago. But I think about having PC nearly every hour of everyday...I'm not depressed or anything like that...not doing the poor little-o'll me thing. But every time I go to the rest room I think about it. EVERY TIME! I'm pretty sure that is one reason it seem like time is clicking along so slowly. Any way...here I sit waiting on another PSA blood test...I think my last one was about two weeks ago!

First...congrats on the <0.1 To answer your question...yes everyone! I'm closing in on 12 months post op....peeing is well behind me now...that sounds funny! LOL As for \"stream\" thats a funny one for me...seem I can only pee for about 45 seconds...if my bladder is really full my stream is like a garden hose...I'm sure they can hear it out in the street in front of my house...if I'm just going because we are walking out the door...stream is like a needle...full power but just a thin stream.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by Pratoman This sounds like just normal healing. I dont think that you can extrapolate that because you've recovered from surgery fast in the past you should recover fast from this one. This is total plumbinb rearrangement. I sat on a donut when in the car, and in my recliner, for about a month. With that said, if it really is concerning, then call your Dr. You know your body better than anyone (but maybe not,, after this surgery) Thanks! I agree with the \"maybe not, after this surgery\" I'm sure I expecting too much for my body. My shoulder rebuild was 2 years ago and they gave me a sheet with the exercises on it that I would take to the rehab/therapist when I left after the surgery. I was already past all movement ranges within two weeks. So when I got to the therapist office he said he couldn't help and to continue with what I had been doing. One month today and I can see this is not going be a quick recovery!",

      "Content": "I had some swelling in the testical and pubic bone area after my surgery. My testical are near back to normal, but the pubic bone to the skin area is still about the same. The left side is worse than the right. Plus at times it is painful on the left side. I know it gets worse after I've been in and out of a vehicle several time during a short period of time. If I sit down for a while the pain easies up pretty fast. It's really the only source of pain since I had the surgery...the holes in my stomach were no problem after about 5 days. I could nearly sit up nearly pain free with the exception of this area. How long will this last? I recover from surgery very very quickly so this is concerning me.",
