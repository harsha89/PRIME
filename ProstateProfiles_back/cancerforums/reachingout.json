I have no \"classic\" prostatitis symptoms but BPH is a high probability says urologist. There was 5 weeks between 2 PSA tests for an antibiotic regimen. My age is 63. Because of ignorance, these two PSA test's were the first in 5 years, which is a hurdle I must deal with. Bone scan, and CT scan scheduled. I will know more in several weeks from 2 tests. Yes, another examination of slide pathology in process. Without 2 imaging scans, researching treatment options is the best I can do now if I understand all.",
