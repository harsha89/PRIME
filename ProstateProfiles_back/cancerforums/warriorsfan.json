      "Content": "Hello. I'm immensely scared because I found a hard small lump on my right testicle and the whole testicle is bigger than my left one. i also have a very tiny lump on my left one. I also have a big lump near my right testicle and i dont know what it is. I researched all this and it all leads to testicular cancer. I'm only 1 and I'm scared as heck. I dont know how to ask my mom or dad to go to the doctor to get checked out because it's embarrassing but im so scared. Please help. Does it sound like testicular cancer?",
