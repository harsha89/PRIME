      "Content": "Yesterday Dr Ramsey called to say he had my pathology report back and everything looked great. Upgraded from Gleason score of 6 to 7 (3+4). Margins and lymph nodes were clear. The tumor was 45% of the prostate which I thought was quite high. Today I went and had the catheter removed and got a printed copy of the report. I have updated my signature with more specifics from the report. After getting home I had my first bowel movement and I feel 100% better. Thanks to everyone who participates on these forums, it really made it much easier to know what was coming. I hope I am able to contribute more to help others that join this club. Now to get used to depends and pads until I know how much control I have. Jim",

      "Content": "Jfredc I have the same problems. My surgery was 2 months before yours. I haven't had any luck with erections, but if I try to use the pump or any type of sexual stimulation I leak urine also. I totally agree with the frustration. Both the surgeon and my regular urologist say urine is sterile so it won't hurt anything and it will get better in time. That doesn't help the mood any. I have done the kegel exercises and also went through several weeks of physical therapy for pelvic floor. I also have issues with overactive bladder. It is much worse since the surgery. I sometimes go more than 20 times a day. I am on my second medication try to help with this. This one worked for about a week, but now I'm back to the same situation. The Dr has suggested 3 options to address this. An implant similar to a pacemaker can be injected in my lower back to control nerves the affect the bladder. There is also a treatment with a needle in the ankle once a week for 12 weeks or Botox injections in the bladder. I am considering these options and will discuss more when I go back in August. Jim",

      "Content": "Mike, I had a topic on here going back to November when I had penile implant surgery. If you can find it you will see I had issues for several weeks. I\u2019m sure my issues were unusual and due to the surgeon, not the implant itself. Normally you can start using it in about six weeks, but in my case it was around 13 weeks. I did have to have another procedure done two weeks ago to reopen my pee hole after it started closing from the problems I had. I will have to wait 2 more weeks to start using it again. My wife and I did use it a couple times before this second surgery, and when pumped up, it is harder than anything I ever remembered. The other bonus is that it will stay hard until you deflate it. If you have any questions, you can pm me. Jim",

      "Content": "Hi Kevin, My surgery was 3 days after yours and our results are very similar. I had my catheter removed on day 6, Wednesday and that was the best day so far. I'm glad it wasn't in as long as yours was. I was also upgraded to 7 and 45% of my prostate was involved. When my Dr called he stated that this was also the best decision and done at the right time. He thought seeds would not have worked. I was told I might develop bruising but until yesterday I didn't have any. After taking a shower I saw a very large black/blue/purple spot on my left side(larger than my hand). It caught me off guard at first but I suppose this is just part of the process. We just have to continue to improve day by day. Other than wearing the depends/pads, I feel mostly back to myself.",

One of the gentlemen there reported last last month that he was getting this done after a year almost two years of incontinence since his surgery. It seemed like an interesting procedure. A nurse who oversees the meeting helped him explain how it works and had some pictures. The next meeting is not until the end of the month and I'm not sure if he will be attending. I think his procedure is scheduled for a few days before the meeting.",

      "Content": "I haven't posted lately but I try to keep up with everything on here. I went last week to review my PSA. 15 months post op I am still at zero. 😁 Most things have been good since the surgery but I have been having problems with overactive bladder and some minor leaking. I did physical therapy last summer for several weeks and and I have used one of the medications without much success. My urologist talked about some other options including an implant or Botox. I decided to hold off on those until Medicare kicks in when I turn 65 this summer. My insurance now has a very high deductible. Still have ED and I asked about injections. She prescribed caverject. I picked up the prescription and with a discount coupon I paid $91.90 for two prefilled syringes. I took one syringe yesterday to the office for a lesson and to see how it worked. The plan was to start with 5 mcg and increase as necessary. These syringes cannot be used again so the nurse injected the whole 10 mcg syringe. We waited almost 30 minutes and had very little success so some real disappointment there. The nurse went and talked to the doctor and they gave me a different prescription for a vial and several syringes. When I get that filled I will go back for another test run to determine the right dosage. The new prescription is still for prostaglandin which is the same as Caverject. I asked about trimix but she was afraid of priapism and though I should start with this first. I haven't seen much on these forums for injections other than trimix and was wondering if anyone has had success with just prostaglandin. Jim",

I don\u2019t use pads currently, but I have significant leaks during orgasm or when I attempt anything sexually. Since we are not in to \u201cwater sports\u201d, this has not been pleasant. I have also had several random accidents in bed over the last few months. I have an overactive bladder that contributes to the problem. A year ago my uro implanted an Interstim device in my lower back that is supposed to work like a pacemaker for my bladder. There are leads going in to my tailbone connected to nerves that control the bladder. This has only marginally improved my situation. I have not had an erection in almost 3 years. Tried pills, vacuum pump, and one attempt at a caverject injection that was about 75% effective. My sex drive is nowhere near what it was but my wife is 10 years younger than me and I feel like I need to explore all options. My regular uro has referred me to another in the practice that does primarily implants and artificial sphincters. It was scheduled for October 10th but they needed to reschedule so now it will be November 6th. I am wary of having that much hardware and I don\u2019t know if it would make sense to do them both at the same time. Looking forward to any more responses before I go. Jim",

As I was telling my cardiologist about my upcoming biopsy, he told me he was just back to work a month after having robotic surgery himself. He offered to talk to me more if I found out the results were positive, so I called his office and spoke with him again. He told me he researched several surgeons here in East Tennessee and in Chicago before deciding to have it done here by Dr Christopher Ramsey who has performed more than 1400 Da Vinci prostate surgeries.

She called to recommend me seeing a urologist, So I made an appointment for August 14th. I was asked to give a urine sample and the Dr then went over several questions with me while telling me the numbers really weren't bad, but there was concern with them rising. In doing the the exam the Dr said she felt something. She also informed me there was blood in my urine. I was scheduled for a biopsy which was done on September 29th. I went back on October 2nd for the results and was told I have cancer. 4 out of 12 samples were positive. 3 samples from one side and 1 from the other and they were all given a Gleason score of 3 + 3 = 6. After going over the options with me we decided on da vinci surgery. It is scheduled for Friday, November 13th. After reading through many of the messages on these forums, I feel very good about my surgery, but I am having trouble sleeping at night while waiting so long. I had the same problem waiting 6 weeks for my biopsy. I'm 63 years old and there is no history of cancer in my family that I am aware of. Thanks in advance for any support you can give me.",

Doctors can try to explain what they are going to do and what to expect, but that is usually the time your mind is trying to process everything that is happening and you don't remember everything. Additionally, everyone is different and your own experience is not necessarily going to be the \"norm\". With all of the information here, I was able to read and re-read what might happen and what to expect. I was able to relax more knowing that this is something that I will overcome. Ywo weeks ago I had prostate cancer, today I consider myself cancer free! Happy Thanksgiving to all my brothers! Jim",

The swelling has gone done quite a bit and it\u2019s easier to pee, but constipation is a problem. I have been taking stool softeners and I tried milk of magnesia but no luck. I will try MoM again today. It\u2019s also awkward walking around with an erection all the time. The surgeon said it\u2019s inflated to 70%. I can\u2019t imagine what 100% will be.

      "Content": "I too am thankful for this forum and those who have been so kind to provide all of the useful information. Doctors can try to explain what they are going to do and what to expect, but that is usually the time your mind is trying to process everything that is happening and you don't remember everything. Additionally, everyone is different and your own experience is not necessarily going to be the \"norm\". With all of the information here, I was able to read and re-read what might happen and what to expect. I was able to relax more knowing that this is something that I will overcome. Ywo weeks ago I had prostate cancer, today I consider myself cancer free! Happy Thanksgiving to all my brothers! Jim",

Looking down at myself it reminds me of a burnt hot dog on the grill. Weird colors and swelling. I have to keep it inflated until I go back on the 11th. Makes things awkward in the bathroom. Yesterday I was bleeding from the holes in the tip of my penis where he pulled the cylinders in. I\u2019m supposed to pull down on the pump to make sure it stays in place.

      "Content": "There's a few Jim's on here. I had the da vinci surgery Nov 13. My wife took a week off work to be with me but I only really needed help for a day or two after surgery. My biggest issue was having the catheter,and it was for 5 days. I know several others on here report having it longer. At 5 weeks I had a post op visit and was told I have no restrictions. I had been back to work at a desk job for a week. I felt like I could have gone back after two weeks, by they were expecting me off more so I took it. I am not fully continent yet but getting better. ED is another issue but I'll only worry about one thing at a time. The good news is that I had a PSA check at 4 weeks and it was 0.01, so after that initial shock of the diagnosis, and deciding how to attack it, I realize I'm on the other side of it now and looking forward to a normal life again soon.",

My biggest issue was having the catheter,and it was for 5 days. I know several others on here report having it longer. At 5 weeks I had a post op visit and was told I have no restrictions. I had been back to work at a desk job for a week. I felt like I could have gone back after two weeks, by they were expecting me off more so I took it. I am not fully continent yet but getting better.

The good news is that I had a PSA check at 4 weeks and it was 0.01, so after that initial shock of the diagnosis, and deciding how to attack it, I realize I'm on the other side of it now and looking forward to a normal life again soon.",
