      "Content": "Thanks for the words. A little more info: my dad is in stage one prostate cancer with a Gleason score of 7. He tested postive for cancer in 4 of the 10 results. His psa went from a 1.9 to, over the course of six years, a 8.74. His free psa was 14%. We are gathering more info. I understands there are risks to everything. I know this treatment might not make him cancer free but then again, neither does radial surgery (based on the free psa that is still in your system that wasn't, and can't be, removed.) I don't trust needle biopsies either. It is a blind hope that that the doctor caught all the cancerous tissues. But, with today's current technology and being as advanced as it, I trust MIR's. Will it catch the smallest tumor? Maybe not. But what is the chance that small tumor will amount to anything? I am looking at focal ablation because it is the best option in terms of keeping one's function. It is the middle ground per say. I am hoping, somehow, I can reach out to people outside of the USA where this technology is relatively old. Again, thank you for the words. I will continue updating.",

I am reaching out to anyone who had MRI focal laser ablation. What stage were you in when you had this surgery? How long ago? Dates are important. Have you experienced any major issues post op? Has the cancer returned? How long have you been cancer free? Have any of you seen the Dr. Sperling? What were your experiences with him? Thank you for your time.",

      "Content": "Hey guys, I was wondering if any of you knowledgeable folks can provide me with some info on the after care of the prostate gland once a biopsy has been done. How long does the gland take to heal fully? Is there anything one can take (food, supplements, exercise?) to help promote the healing of the gland? How long does the gland take to heal? 1 month? 3 months? Has anyone experienced a I guess a tight discomfort or just a general discomfort after having a biopsy? What about intense testicular pain? Or varying levels of pain in the testes? Does anyone know why this would occur? Last queston, how soon can an MRI be done after a biopsy? Right away? Or should it wait after a month(s)? Why do I need to wait? Thank you for taking the time to read this. I hope you all have a good day.",
