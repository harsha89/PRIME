      "Content": "I will never view those commercials that say if it lasts 4hrs the same again. i have robotic surgery on Nov 12th. Took Cialis and Lavitra for a couple of months. Started Trimix injections a couple of weeks ago. First injection on a Friday in dr's office was 0.1cc. The next Friday I used 0.2cc. Not enough results. The Wednesday after that I used 0.25cc. Not enough results. Last night (5 days since last injection) I use 0.3cc. Pain within 10 min and hard as a rock. You could have hung a coat on it it et didn't hurt so bad. After 3 hrs and taking Sudafed and trying ice packs and cold shower I told the wife we need to go in to ER. Injected at 8:30, arrive at ER at 12:00. Around 1:45 was injected with something I can't remember what. By 2:30 no results and my Urologist was called in. I fell asleep finally and 5 min before he came in the door I woke up and things had deflated.",

My recovery was on the same time line as yours. I hated the Depends and switched to the Depend brand pads after about a week. I used them for 2 to 3 weeks and now use nothing. I am 2 monts out from the surgery. I still wake up 1 or 2 times a night. During the day I don't go as many times as I did before, but when I need to go, I NEED to go.",
