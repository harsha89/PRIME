We met with the RO this week and the best course of treatment for my Dad is external radiation and hormone injections. He will get his first injection in January, wait one month then have gold markers placed in the prostate, 2 weeks later get CT scan and the little tattoo markers, then 2 weeks later start radiation. Holy hell! So we are talking end of March before he starts radiation. Spring will be arriving! Has this been everyone else\u0092s experience? Just seems like such a long time since being diagnosed. And the fact that he hadn\u0092t been to the Urologist since 2014, I keep thinking this has been festering for some time already. We feel good about his treatment plan and are going to enjoy the holidays and hit this full steam ahead in the new year! Was just curious if it typically takes this long.",

I am trying to remain calm and worry free (hard to do) while we go thru this process and figure out the next steps, as well as learning all I can about the disease. He is 75 years old. We met with his Urologist last week after getting his biopsy results back. We were hoping for a better result but are dealing with this day by day. His Gleason score is 9, his PSA is 6.2 He is going tomorrow to have a CT scan and bone scan done. Once we get those results back that will determine the course of treatment. I know that the Gleason score is on the very high end which isn't good, but I'm confused by the PSA level. With the PSA being on the lower end is there some hope that this could still be localized? Or doesn't that matter with such a high Gleason score? As you know, the waiting is the worst part. I'll be anxious to get the results of the scans back sometime next week.

      "Content": "Hello All, I haven't been on the board in a while but always reading and learning. My father has finished up with his 9 weeks of EBRT. His last treatment was on May 21. He had a follow-up appointment today with his Urologist. I guess I was expecting them to do a PSA test, but he said no. His Urologist said \"no use getting a PSA test because the hormones and the radiation will render that useless as it should read zero now\". I get that, but how are you going to know if it is at Zero unless you do a PSA test??? I'm confused. At what point in time should he be getting a PSA test done now that his treatments are over? The Urologist said nothing to do at this point in time until the end of July when he will get his 2nd hormone shot. They may send him for a bone density scan down the road, the one he had in January was normal. From your experiences does this course of action sound right? Do they wait a little while after treatments before doing another PSA test?",
