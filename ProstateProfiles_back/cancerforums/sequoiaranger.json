I have had so many needle-pricks, blood draws, and infusions that \"they\" are having a hard time finding useful veins (at least in my arms--where do they go from there--legs?). >SequoiaR, how fast is your PSA doubling? What is it currently?< Last month I had a PSA test to see how the extensive 80 Grays of radiation beat down the cancer. My pre-radiation PSA was 7.8; post-radiation was \"5\". Hmmm. I was suspicious that the number should have been MUCH lower. I am told that sometimes it took months for the radiation to work its magic, so I had another date with PSA scheduled for May. Then I went bold and ASKED for a bone scan. It was granted. That was BEFORE I had excruciating pain in my chest, spine and ribs (creeping up on me the past month--but truthfuly I had a \"sore spot\" by my sternum that didn't heal in two months). Bone scan results only last June showed NO bone mets. This scan showed me RIDDLED with bone mets, in all the places that ached. The latest PSA test came back--\"greater than 20\". OMG. That's at least FOUR times last month's reading!! So maybe my \"doubling rate\" is two weeks???? I was in the lowest, darkest region of my mind a few days before the Taxotere infusion, knowing I was truly \"dying\" with a close \"expiriation date\". I was thinking all my efforts in my little orchard, that were just now bearing miniature, growing fruit, would not be eaten by me this summer. I had done my last this-or-that, etc., and would leave a \"widow\" to fend for herself. Such mental agony. Now I'm in \"pain management\" with Vicodin (Dr. said I could have stronger stuff). But the pain seems to have stabilized and partially retreated with the Taxotere cocktail infusion (only 2 days ago!). I had the characteristic astringent tongue (like sucking on an un-ripe persimmon), tingles in the fingers and toes, and flushed face characteristic of Taxotere side-effects. UNLIKE \"Provenge\" (which I now think did NOT take in me--NO evidence of it retarding the cancer since August infusions) which has no real side effects I could feel, at least this Taxotere impresses me with ACTION I can FEEL!",

      "Content": "Update: I am now on Taxotere (3-week infusion), plus some other \"helper\" drugs. I have had so many needle-pricks, blood draws, and infusions that \"they\" are having a hard time finding useful veins (at least in my arms--where do they go from there--legs?). >SequoiaR, how fast is your PSA doubling? What is it currently?< Last month I had a PSA test to see how the extensive 80 Grays of radiation beat down the cancer. My pre-radiation PSA was 7.8; post-radiation was \"5\". Hmmm. I was suspicious that the number should have been MUCH lower. I am told that sometimes it took months for the radiation to work its magic, so I had another date with PSA scheduled for May. Then I went bold and ASKED for a bone scan. It was granted. That was BEFORE I had excruciating pain in my chest, spine and ribs (creeping up on me the past month--but truthfuly I had a \"sore spot\" by my sternum that didn't heal in two months). Bone scan results only last June showed NO bone mets. This scan showed me RIDDLED with bone mets, in all the places that ached. The latest PSA test came back--\"greater than 20\". OMG. That's at least FOUR times last month's reading!! So maybe my \"doubling rate\" is two weeks???? I was in the lowest, darkest region of my mind a few days before the Taxotere infusion, knowing I was truly \"dying\" with a close \"expiriation date\". I was thinking all my efforts in my little orchard, that were just now bearing miniature, growing fruit, would not be eaten by me this summer. I had done my last this-or-that, etc., and would leave a \"widow\" to fend for herself. Such mental agony. Now I'm in \"pain management\" with Vicodin (Dr. said I could have stronger stuff). But the pain seems to have stabilized and partially retreated with the Taxotere cocktail infusion (only 2 days ago!). I had the characteristic astringent tongue (like sucking on an un-ripe persimmon), tingles in the fingers and toes, and flushed face characteristic of Taxotere side-effects. UNLIKE \"Provenge\" (which I now think did NOT take in me--NO evidence of it retarding the cancer since August infusions) which has no real side effects I could feel, at least this Taxotere impresses me with ACTION I can FEEL!",

      "Content": "My Zytiga journey is *OVER*. EXTREME muscle cramping (even while doing nothing, but especially while sleeping) sent me into \"10\" pain some of the time, and \"9\" pain the rest. There was NO position of comfort that would even get the pain to \"3\" or so. Funny it did not affect my lower body, but my upper....UN-F-ing Believeable. I started taking Zytiga in early October, and had seemingly NO side-effects whatsoever. Around mid-October I started getting minor aches in the back/neck, but attributed them to \"overdoing\" some physical activity. The aches came more frequently and intensely, and the latest bout a few days ago was immobilizing without beaucoup drugs. I had deliberately NOT done any physical work that might \"set off\" the cramping a few days prior to Monday the 5th, because I had to drive my spouse to the airport early in the morning, before sunup (she can't drive in the dark). Sunday I was having doubts, as I had periods of INTENSE back pain, but also periods of relative calm. Monday I duly drove (hurting, but not too badly) her, and got some shopping done, but was hurting badly later. THEN, on Tuesday I had *THE WORST DAY OF MY LIFE* when agony was my constant companion. I mean SCREAMING OUT LOUD agony. Luckily, a phone call to my onc got me a prescription for \"Soma\" a strong muscle-relaxant, and the order to stop taking the Zytiga. I had a small window of \"medium\" pain, so drove myself to the pharmacy. I am assuming I have a build-up of Zytiga in my system that will take a while to purge, but at least with the Soma and Percoset my pains are now minimal again. But I am in a drugged haze, having difficulty typing (probably 10-15 errors per line I have to go back and correct). My reactions to Zytiga might be extreme, but there is NO WAY I can continue. I see my onc tomorrow, so we will re-stratigize then. --------------------------------------------------------------------------------",

      "Content": "If you remember, a supposed 6-month Eligard shot given to me in May of 2006 \"burned out\" prematurely (long before my scheduled November shot). When I contacted the manufacturers of Eligard, they gave me a factory-fresh 6-month dosage to be administered last November. The 6-month Eligard shot I got last November did the trick--six months later the testosterone was at castration level and my PSA was less than .1 (considered \"undetectable\"). In May I got another 6-month shot. I got tested for PSA and testosterone in July--perfect scores. So I got \"lazy\" with the continued success and stopped having frequent tests. Now it is November again, time for my next 6-month shot, and I got tested again just two weeks ago. PSA was up to .14 (low but detectable), and testosterone was 340 (near normal for a male adult). I was SHOCKED! Two out of three Eligard shots have failed. There are other leuprolides out there (Lupron, et. al) and I will try them instead when I resume hormone treatment. (I had agreed with my doctors to go off hormones this November anyway to see how my body and/or cancer responds--will see again in three months whether to go back to hormone treatment). ;-(",

At the time of the first infusion, it was LIKELY that I would be given additional infusions beyond six.

I am mostly through #7. I intend to keep with it as long as my PSA is dropping or \"level\", but if it starts to rise I will quit the debilitating chemo regimen and go on to something else.

Compared to when I first started taking Taxotere, I am MUCH BETTER off pain-wise (as a result of zapping the cancer causing the bone pain). For some people, PSA measurements do not tell the story.

Do you still have your prostate?? Are you still taking MDV3100? You must have been given it in TRIALS--did they dose you the same as what is now prescribed, or did you perhaps get a smaller dose as part of a comparison test? Did you NOT have severe fatigue?? And yes, ED is just a (sigh) fact of life for the testosterone-deprived.

Perhaps you should ask your doctor about BIND-014 or something similar just in case Taxotere stops working for you? Just a thought and best of luck to you. Your courage and perseverance are great inspirations to me. < Everything is OK, so far. Had my 7th infusion two days ago, and am entering the week-long \"Neulasta Netherworld\" of flu-like symptoms and general malaise. My \"plan\" is for three more (total, 10) infusions. My PSA had been dropping precipitously each infusion until the last one, where rather than a 30% drop or so, it was only 6%. Might just be a \"bauble\", might indicate the point of diminishing return. I have inquired into a \"local\" BIND-014 trial. They have openings RIGHT NOW, but I am temporarily ineligible (being under treatment). So I am sticking to my current regimen for at least one more PSA test. The BIND-014 system does use Taxotere, but of course rather than \"broadcast\" the drug throughout the body, cancer cells are targeted. I fully realize that cancer, especially at Gleason 9, is a CHRONIC disease, but I am getting really tired of being under a constant state of \"emergency\" trying to stifle expansive growth. Comparatively, it was so nice to be merely on Lupron when it was keeping my monster quiescent.",
