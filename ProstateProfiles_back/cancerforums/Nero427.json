While prostatic WIDTH:_4.7____mm; HEIGHT:_29____mm; LENGTH:_41.5____mm. The prostate revealed no evidence of hypo or hyperechogenicity suggestive of prostatic pathology. However there was asymmetrical growth of the right lobe that appeared to impinge into the prostatic urethra. Capsular margins appeared to be intact with well defined seminal vesicle-prostate margins as well as apical-membranous urethral margins. Seminal vesicles appeared to be normal bilaterally. Impression: ASYMMETRICAL GROWTH OF RIGHT LOBE OF THE PROSTATE. Now I wait until the 21st for the results.",

      "Content": "I came down with what was initially diagnosed as urethritis this spring (urethra pain, urge to urinate, etc etc.) After several rounds of antibiotics my symptoms had all but subsided. But since symptoms were still lingering my Urologist scheduled me for a CT scan and cystoscopy just in case. He gave me a DRE back in June, but didn't mention anything abnormal. I had the cystoscopy on the 15th of September and he found the asymmetrical growth of my prostate which is impinging on my urethra, which may have caused my previous urethritis symptoms. (actual diagnosis: The prostatic urethra reveals an unusual growth of right lobe that is completely obstructing the urethra. The left lobe and the median lobe are normal in size and caliber.) My PSA has been 1.1 since 2009 and was the same when I tested in August. Given my age and my fathers history with PC my Dr. suggested a biopsy to rule out cancer. That was the last thing I thought I'd have to deal with. It sounds more like Prostatitis to me, but what do I know? Anyone have any input??",
