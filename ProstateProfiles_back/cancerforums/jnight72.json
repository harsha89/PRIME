      "Content": "I don't know about the spasms, but I do also have some new sensations. I do notice that urination does stop much more suddenly. There is also a little bit of pressure on my rectum when stopping. Not really pain, but I do notice sensation where there was none before. Not sure exactly how to describe it other than that. I agree with Walnut that a lot has happened down there and I attribute it to that.",

      "Content": "I also bought two big packs of the pads (one heavy and one light). Still have a half of each sitting in my cabinet. I was nervous ahead of time, although I felt pretty calm the day of - just wanted to get over it. I never took any of the pain meds they prescribed - just didn't need them, and I didn't really take any tylenol or anything else either. Make sure you have some neosporin or some type of ointment for the catheter site - it is essential as the tube does slide in and out to some extent. It just keeps you from being irritated. Other than that, the cath was pretty much a non-issue. However, make sure that you always keep your urine bag below you. It requires gravity to drain correctly. If you get up and there is a little backflow, you get an interesting sensation. Feels like a little shock - nothing painful, just kind of surprises you. Also, I picked up a seat cushion (kind of a donut) that I used for a couple of weeks. It takes some pressure off of an area that can be a little sore. I went back to work two weeks after surgery. I had to get a doctor's note for the return, but I was going stir crazy sitting at home. He actually told me that many men use the whole six weeks and just enjoy a vacation. However, I have young kids who are in school, so a vacation was not realistic. I wish you all of the best, and you should be fine. Keep posting!",

      "Content": "Stuntmole - I was a little younger than you when I went through this, although my PSA was higher and my DRE was normal. My initial 3+3 was upgraded to a 3+4 post surgery, but everything was still organ confined. I have had one doc (family doc) tell me that prostate cancer in younger men can be more aggressive, however I have not asked my urologist/surgeon about that so I am not sure. My uro did tell me at my 6 month post opp check (with PSA being undetectable) that a PSA of 0 at 6 months equates with a cure in the 96-97% range. Then, if PSA is still undetectable at 1 year, the chances for a cure go up to 97-98% and increase slightly from there with each successive 0 reading. The one little concern I have in the back of my mind regarding recurrance is that I assume most of the research has been done on men who are older than us. I wonder if the increased life expectancy would affect those statistics as we should theoretically live longer post surgery. On the plus side though, I think that being younger really helped in recovery and healing post surgery. This whole process has been so much easier than I ever could have anticipated. Best of luck and keep us posted.",

I have had one doc (family doc) tell me that prostate cancer in younger men can be more aggressive, however I have not asked my urologist/surgeon about that so I am not sure. My uro did tell me at my 6 month post opp check (with PSA being undetectable) that a PSA of 0 at 6 months equates with a cure in the 96-97% range. Then, if PSA is still undetectable at 1 year, the chances for a cure go up to 97-98% and increase slightly from there with each successive 0 reading. The one little concern I have in the back of my mind regarding recurrance is that I assume most of the research has been done on men who are older than us. I wonder if the increased life expectancy would affect those statistics as we should theoretically live longer post surgery. On the plus side though, I think that being younger really helped in recovery and healing post surgery. This whole process has been so much easier than I ever could have anticipated. Best of luck and keep us posted.",

I am on the younger side like you (41) so I also had some anger that PC came much sooner than typical min the long run though, I think my age helped in the recovery process. As far as the discolored ejaculate, mine lasted all the way from biopsy to surgery - about 7 or 8 weeks. By the end it was close to normal. I think the more you use it the \"cleaner\" it gets. Bets of luck and keep asking all of your questions and looking at all the threads - helps keep you sane.",

I am on the younger side like you (41) so I also had some anger that PC came much sooner than typical min the long run though, I think my age helped in the recovery process. As far as the discolored ejaculate, mine lasted all the way from biopsy to surgery - about 7 or 8 weeks. By the end it was close to normal. I think the more you use it the \"cleaner\" it gets.

To me it felt like I was more in control and in charge as opposed to just a passive \"victim\". Just my two cents. Best of luck - nothing was near as bad as I had thought going in!!",

      "Content": "It can be tough reading these stories and going through this when you are young (I was diagnosed and had surgery at 41 - am 42 now). You tend to get a little resentful thinking about all of the years of \"normalcy\" you may be missing out on. However, fight that urge to feel sorry for yourself. Recovery has been pretty smooth for me on all fronts (I was even waking up with a \"semi\" while the cath was still in). I rarely even think about surgery or any of the side effects. I still use the viagra just to ensure things will work like I want, but I don't always need it - just helps with the confidence if you know what I mean. Sounds like you have accepted what you can control and are in a positive state of mind. You are right, there is hope. Keep up the good attitude - it really does help, and congrats on making it through!!",

Just because he/she is currently your doctor doesn't mean he/she is the best and most qualified. Make sure to find someone who is experienced and that you are comfortable with (if you do decide on a course of action). It may be your current doctor, but it also may not. I would think with you in Pittsburg, there should be some high quality facilities near you. Make sure that you get the best people available - you are worth it!",

I do urinate more frequently early in the morning, but as the day goes by I typically don't go for hours on end. As far as the bowel issues, the questions all relate to \"loose and shapeless\" movements as opposed to any constipation issues. I do not have any constipation issues - mine are looser than pre surgery, but maybe there is some long term connection between the surgery and bowel habits.",

Additionally, I was having \"morning wood\" by day three after surgery, which presented another type of pain while the catheter was trying to pull opposite of where my guy was moving.

      "Content": "Tom, this is a huge decision, and it does seem like with a Gleason 6 you would not need to rush your choice. I would really be concerned about any doctor who would drop a patient for wanting to take his/her time to be fully informed. I feel like 300 would be the number of surgeries where a doctor begins to feel comfortable - the more the better if they are skilled. My doctor encouraged me to take my time and talk with other doctors. I actually took less time than he had suggested. I was young and wanted to get treatment (I had surgery) over with and begin the recovery process. One thing I will say about surgery is that for me it was nice to be told that margins were clear and there was no spread to any lymph nodes. I know the results for surgery and radiation are very similar, but the piece of mind the final biopsy offered was huge for me. Additionally, I went from a G6 to a G7 in the final biopsy, so things were more advanced than initially suspected.",

I think Dr. Catalona is at Northwestern, he is one of the top guys in terms of surgeons and prostate cancer (although he does open surgery).

One of the things you will see repeatedly on this forum is finding the best and most experienced doctors available for whatever treatment (or lack there of) you choose. The skill of the doctor means a great deal in terms of side effects and overall success rates. Never be shy about questions or concerns that you have - this is your body and you should be in charge. You are young, and if you do seek treatment, it seems like younger guys bounce back and recover faster and easier. I was 41 when diagnosed, and knew I would need treatment at some point. I felt like it was better to do it while I was younger and more resilient, considering I was done having kids. Turns out that I was upgraded post surgery (I think this happens in almost a third of patients), so it was a good thing I was treated sooner rather than later. Best of luck and keep posting!!",

It is just on my lower legs, and the doctor said it wouldn't have anything to do with having my prostate out. Can't think of anything else that has changed. Sounds like you have had some different treatments, so there probably isn't any connection. Guess I'll just look funny in shorts!",

I actually felt like my function was better early on and has been tapering off more recently. The first time I tried the Viagra it worked almost immediately. I will note that the first few times I used it on an empty stomach and it was more effective. Since then it does take a little more time, although I have been taking it at night which may affect the potency. Still get some good wood while I am sleeping, but the wife is too so they go unused. I don't always need the Viagra but I feel like I should take it just the same. Guess there must be fluctuations in function for a while. Good luck with everything.",

      "Content": "I had a similar experience with the biopsy. I was very anxious going in and was waiting for over an hour to get in. My imagination was in overdrive as to how bad it was going to be. Well, it was all imagination. As Chuck and Allen said, it is NOT as bad as you have in your head. That is not to say that it is something I would sign up for, but it is not too bad. I had heard it was extremely painful. I would say that it was uncomfortable at most, and a little embarassing with your ass hanging out - other than that it was nothing to worry about. I had no blood in urine at all. In terms of the wait - I really feel like that was/is inappropriate. After I got my results and did second opinions, I went with a different doctor. At EVERY appointment I have had with him, I have been in the office within 5 minutes of my scheduled time - so it can be done. It seems like it is a matter of respect for the patient's time (as well as state of mind) and should be something we as patients expect.",

My PSA was higher than yours and my prostate felt normal on 2 DRE's from two different doctors, so this is process is never an exact science since there are so many things that could be going on.

      "Content": "York, my blood test was pretty incidental. It was through a health fair at work that I had registered for online. I checked the box for PSA testing, but after talking with friends and relatives I was informed that typically testing doesn't start until 50 unless there was a family history or some cause. I just never got around to \"unregestering\" for the PSA - guess it was a good thing. I had no symptoms in terms of incontinence, etc. I do seem to remember some slight discomfort in my right testicle, but that was after the first elevated result and scouring the internet - was probably just mental and looking for something to be wrong. At the time, I thought having no symptoms was a good thing, but I think now I may have been wrong. Having some sort of uniary issues might have indicated an infection or BPH which may have been better. Again, even though I was eventually diagnosed, I would not have changed my course of action. I think it was very important to have that second PSA test. Even though the biopsy was not a big deal for me, there are risks, and you should be sure it is necessary. I understand your worry, but try to take it slow. Prostate cancer is typically very treatable if found early. Make sure you are comfortable with the tests they recommend, and NEVER apologize for asking questions!",

      "Content": "I am reasonably close to your age (currently 41). Had surgery 3/26. I had bought a box of light pads, a box of heavy pads, and some disposable mattress \"pads\". Never needed the mattress pads and I went pad free yesterday. Still a little hesitant to leave for work without one or not have one if I have a few drinks, but I may be hard pressed to finish the boxes. I would recommend a seat cushion for car rides and hard chairs. Do those keagles prior to surgery to help post surgery. Also, make sure you stock up on bacetracin or neosporin for the time when you have the catheter. Walking is key post surgery as well - just helps to get things moving again! I am just getting cleared for exercise and have no restrictions. All that being said, I am at 6 weeks and were it not for the scars, I can't really tell I had surgery. Good luck - you should do fine!",

That is never a bad idea to confirm initial findings. the first urologist seemed pretty off thinking it would be nothing and then having 7 cores positive (although that may be common - not sure). Even talking to different doctors specializing in the same procedures can help. You are interviewing them and should want the best. After talking with a few different doctors, my choice was pretty easy because one just seemed to be the perfect mix of confidence, skill and compassion. I never would have found him if I went with the first one I saw. Best of luck.",

      "Content": "Had surgery 3/26 and I was actually getting some wood while I had the catheter in. Once out the doc has me on 100 mg Viagra three times per week. I actually felt like my function was better early on and has been tapering off more recently. The first time I tried the Viagra it worked almost immediately. I will note that the first few times I used it on an empty stomach and it was more effective. Since then it does take a little more time, although I have been taking it at night which may affect the potency. Still get some good wood while I am sleeping, but the wife is too so they go unused. I don't always need the Viagra but I feel like I should take it just the same. Guess there must be fluctuations in function for a while. Good luck with everything.",

I can only report on my experiences, which may be slightly biased, but it always helps to hear of other people's experiences. I am 41, and only had one core that was positive. However, it was at 60% which serveral doctors told me took active surveilance off of the table. My initial gleason was a 6, but that was upgraded after my surgery to a 7. When considering treatment, I was told that radiation and surgery are pretty equal in terms of success rates. However, when looking at long term survival, after fifteen years the chances of cancer returning were slightly higher with the radiation. Additionally, I was told that radiation would be possible after surgery, but it is more difficult the other way around if the initial treatment was not successful. Personally, I felt that given my age surgery was a better option for me - my wife and I agreed that for peace of mind, having the damned thing removed would go a long way. It did go very well, and they did remove some lymph nodes for testing as well. As you can see from my signature, lymph nodes and all margins were clear. The one \"downer\" was the increase in final staging and gleason score. I am not sure if I could have gotten this information had I opted for radiation. Again, radiation is a great option for many men, I just felt more comfortable with surgery.

My PSA was higher than yours and my prostate felt normal on 2 DRE's from two different doctors, so this is process is never an exact science since there are so many things that could be going on. I would think the issues are separate, but being proactive is always better. I opted for waiting 3 months and re-testing PSA after the initial elevated reading.

      "Content": "York, my blood test was pretty incidental. It was through a health fair at work that I had registered for online. I checked the box for PSA testing, but after talking with friends and relatives I was informed that typically testing doesn't start until 50 unless there was a family history or some cause. I just never got around to \"unregestering\" for the PSA - guess it was a good thing. I had no symptoms in terms of incontinence, etc. I do seem to remember some slight discomfort in my right testicle, but that was after the first elevated result and scouring the internet - was probably just mental and looking for something to be wrong. At the time, I thought having no symptoms was a good thing, but I think now I may have been wrong. Having some sort of uniary issues might have indicated an infection or BPH which may have been better. Again, even though I was eventually diagnosed, I would not have changed my course of action. I think it was very important to have that second PSA test. Even though the biopsy was not a big deal for me, there are risks, and you should be sure it is necessary. I understand your worry, but try to take it slow. Prostate cancer is typically very treatable if found early. Make sure you are comfortable with the tests they recommend, and NEVER apologize for asking questions!",

That is never a bad idea to confirm initial findings. the first urologist seemed pretty off thinking it would be nothing and then having 7 cores positive (although that may be common - not sure). Even talking to different doctors specializing in the same procedures can help. You are interviewing them and should want the best. After talking with a few different doctors, my choice was pretty easy because one just seemed to be the perfect mix of confidence, skill and compassion. I never would have found him if I went with the first one I saw. Best of luck.",

      "Content": "I had just turned 41 when diagnosed and had surgery not too long after diagnosis. My case was a little less \"optimal\" for AS as one of my cores was at a higher percentage than usually thought acceptable. I too was told that surgery was more optimal for younger patients, not that other options would not be equally curative, but that the chances of secondary cancers were slightly higher after 15 to 20 years. Being that I plan on being around much longer than that, I went with surgery. In terms of staging, my initial diagnosis was a Gleason 6, but I was upgraded to a 7 post surgery. After this whole process I decided that I need to have a general doctor, just for yearly check ups and such in making sure I was healthy otherwise. This gentleman told me that prostate cancers in younger men were often more aggressive than in older men (hence the higher post surgical staging). I am not at all sure of the truth in this. My uro/surgeon never mentioned it, and I forgot to ask at my last appointment so I really do not know if it is accurate or not, but maybe someone else can shed light on that. Just make sure to get as much info as you can - it's always better to be more informed than less. Make sure that you are comfortable with any decission you make.",

      "Content": "York, my blood test was pretty incidental. It was through a health fair at work that I had registered for online. I checked the box for PSA testing, but after talking with friends and relatives I was informed that typically testing doesn't start until 50 unless there was a family history or some cause. I just never got around to \"unregestering\" for the PSA - guess it was a good thing. I had no symptoms in terms of incontinence, etc. I do seem to remember some slight discomfort in my right testicle, but that was after the first elevated result and scouring the internet - was probably just mental and looking for something to be wrong. At the time, I thought having no symptoms was a good thing, but I think now I may have been wrong. Having some sort of uniary issues might have indicated an infection or BPH which may have been better. Again, even though I was eventually diagnosed, I would not have changed my course of action. I think it was very important to have that second PSA test. Even though the biopsy was not a big deal for me, there are risks, and you should be sure it is necessary. I understand your worry, but try to take it slow. Prostate cancer is typically very treatable if found early. Make sure you are comfortable with the tests they recommend, and NEVER apologize for asking questions!",

      "Content": "I had just turned 41 when diagnosed and had surgery not too long after diagnosis. My case was a little less \"optimal\" for AS as one of my cores was at a higher percentage than usually thought acceptable. I too was told that surgery was more optimal for younger patients, not that other options would not be equally curative, but that the chances of secondary cancers were slightly higher after 15 to 20 years. Being that I plan on being around much longer than that, I went with surgery. In terms of staging, my initial diagnosis was a Gleason 6, but I was upgraded to a 7 post surgery. After this whole process I decided that I need to have a general doctor, just for yearly check ups and such in making sure I was healthy otherwise. This gentleman told me that prostate cancers in younger men were often more aggressive than in older men (hence the higher post surgical staging). I am not at all sure of the truth in this. My uro/surgeon never mentioned it, and I forgot to ask at my last appointment so I really do not know if it is accurate or not, but maybe someone else can shed light on that. Just make sure to get as much info as you can - it's always better to be more informed than less. Make sure that you are comfortable with any decission you make.",

I can only report on my experiences, which may be slightly biased, but it always helps to hear of other people's experiences. I am 41, and only had one core that was positive. However, it was at 60% which serveral doctors told me took active surveilance off of the table. My initial gleason was a 6, but that was upgraded after my surgery to a 7. When considering treatment, I was told that radiation and surgery are pretty equal in terms of success rates. However, when looking at long term survival, after fifteen years the chances of cancer returning were slightly higher with the radiation. Additionally, I was told that radiation would be possible after surgery, but it is more difficult the other way around if the initial treatment was not successful. Personally, I felt that given my age surgery was a better option for me - my wife and I agreed that for peace of mind, having the damned thing removed would go a long way. It did go very well, and they did remove some lymph nodes for testing as well. As you can see from my signature, lymph nodes and all margins were clear. The one \"downer\" was the increase in final staging and gleason score. I am not sure if I could have gotten this information had I opted for radiation. Again, radiation is a great option for many men, I just felt more comfortable with surgery. Whatever you do, find the best people available and ask lots of questions - you need to be in charge of this! Good luck, and you should be here a long time!",

A little different situation because I am not dealing with the short term disability insurance issue. That being said my hope is to go back around the 10th or so of April. I know this may be pushing it but the doctor still wrote the note for 6 weeks. They said it is always easier to decrease than increase time. I would definitely get the surgeon to write a note, especially if there was the \"complication\" of an additional incision. If the insurance has a prescribed time frame for a normal procedure, this may not fit your situation because your surgery was not \"normal.\" Just my thoughts.",

Then they told me a joke - next thing I remember was waking up in my room. Not really any pain, just the annoyance from the cath. I do not need the pain meds they prescribed. The hardest part is that you need help getting up, or at least have to plan and take your time. Walking is key, had to get up last night a few times to get things moving, but overall it has been a walk in the park. Very relieved that it is over.

      "Content": "I agree that something is amiss. Going from a normal PSA to 17 in 90 days does not seem right. Hopefully it is more of an infection, but you should get some more information from a specialist. I know many times with an initial spike, doctors prescribe an antiobiotic and then re-test. My initial PSA was elevated (4.2) an when I went to a urologist, his initial suggestion was an immediate biopsy. That was not something I was ready for, so I suggested waiting and re-testing and he agreed that was a responsible course of action. As you can see from my signature, it did not go away, but it doesn't mean it would work that way with you. No professional doctor should be threatened by a patient asking for a second opinion. You are in charge, just don't ignore abnormalities.",

      "Content": "First off, don't panic. There are many things that could be going on, the first of which seems to be the prostatitis that the ER said. I am assuming the blood test you are talking about is the PSA test. If you do have a prostate infection, that would probably increase your PSA level so you don't want to test with a known infection. It sounds like all of your symptoms could be attributed to the infection. As far as the PSA test, make sure that you do not have sex, ride a bike, have a DRE 24-48 hours before the blood draw. All of those activities can affect the PSA level. Being so young, you probably do not have a baseline for your PSA, so take it slow. It may be wise to have a couple of tests months apart if your results are elevated. I know it won't be easy, but don't start worrying about cancer when it seems like there is an infection causing your issues. The one other thing I would advise is to be a pest. If your symptoms don't go away, keep calling or see another doctor.",

      "Content": "I think the more important information is that the scans were clear. Like the others have said, as long as everything is contained in the prostate, you should be good to go. It is completely normal to be all over the place and worried. For me, much of that anxiety melted away once I woke up and the surgeon said things looked good, and even more when the final path report said everything was contained and all margins were negative. For me, that was one of the main reasons I went the surgery route - knowing for sure (or at least as sure as possible) and having the ability to look at a final path report. I too am on the surgery side, since that is the route I took, but I would consider how much being able to have a final pathology report means. Obviously you will be having PSA tests, but would you wonder about margins, etc. if you did not know for sure? Jim put it much better than I could, but having as much info to consider is vital. Again, I readily admit my bias, but this was just something that I considered. On another note, in a way you have already turned this into a positive - you have been posting and asking questions that others can read and consider as they go through this and have the same worries. So it may not be a positive in your life (yet!) but you are helping others.",
