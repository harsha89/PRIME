      "Content": "Originally Posted by RobLee Which is exactly what happened to me, as well as a very small number of others here. I don't know about the Canadian healthcare system, but apparently here in the US, the only thing that will get you treated right away is a DRE, which is often the last thing to show up. Afterwards, I learned from my most recent urologist that at the base of the prostate is nearly impossible to detect tumors by DRE or TRUS. So dividing the prostate into three parts, apex, mid and base, it is not hard to see why approximately one third of TRUS biopsies are falsely negative. I have said it here often that doctors today are more concerned about overtreating than they are about curing. As you already know, my own dad's treatment - or lack of it beginning with his ignorant family doc - was so completely confusing to us that it left me with very little faith in the honesty of many in the medical profession, if not their actual competence. Sorry if that offends anyone here who's had the good fortune to encounter first-rate docs, this is just my experience. I asked for and received my dad's pathology many years after the fact and was sent a small stack of paper, which I brought to my doc. After he'd had a chance to go through it he said he didn't understand what could have happened, because his cancer had a low Gleason score. A nurse suggested to us after he died that it might have been too much morphine that ended his life, which added one more layer of confusion and sorrow. Anyway thanks RobLee for the info regarding tumors at the base. Can I hope that MRI has a better chance of detecting than other methods? Regardless I'm already prepared for a bit of a battle, because MRI wait times as well as wait times to see any specialist in Ontario can be notoriously long. Let's just get it right out there: with \"free\" healthcare, you get what you pay for. As I've said, I'm prepared to travel and pay cash as needed. I was pretty depressed yesterday but feeling a bit more optimistic today, because thanks to you folks I already feel 100% better informed.",

      "Content": "First a quick introduction and greeting to all. I'm a 58-year old Canadian whose dad passed from metastatic PC at age 59. The way we his family were treated is a story in itself, suffice to say I still don't know the truth - he underwent radical prostatectomy, hormone therapy and orchiectomy, and still died within a year of diagnosis. He had chemo and was chastised by docs/nurses for refusing it (\"don't you want help?\"), yet we were told at one point \"everything we're doing for him is palliative.\" Terribly confusing and sad. Fear of dying from aggressive PC has haunted me since - and I was 28 at the time. Have had twice-yearly DRE and PSA, had one high blip in PSA followed by biopsy and cysto, all negative. Just recently I did the full run of 23andme testing, downloaded my raw data and sent it to a site called Promethease (if anyone wants to do this it's $5 BTW and you get the whole gamut of results), and sure enough, several markers for PC including the one for the aggressive form. Sorry if this all seems a bit brutal and fast, but I've finally begun to feel desperate. I have a son just entering high school, and I'd like to see him become a father some day. I'll let you in on another thing: I was so convinced I shouldn't pass my own genes on that I had a vasectomy ages ago, and my son came from donor sperm. He's well aware of this, not a family secret or anything. Gladder than ever that I went that route too. My question is a big one: has anyone considered preventative removal, and/or is aware of surgeons who have no issues doing it if they know the risks? My dad's father and some of his brothers had PC as well - this is the genuine no-BS time bomb. I've just moved to a new city and am going to ask a doc to refer me to a urologist today, and get the dialog going there as well, but the input I receive here is also very important to me. Bless you all and happy Friday - Mike. EDIT: it's worth adding that his PC was well advanced at time of diagnosis. His family doc said \"I thought something felt wrong but he seemed too young\" ...so I don't really know if he had the aggressive form or not.",

So dividing the prostate into three parts, apex, mid and base, it is not hard to see why approximately one third of TRUS biopsies are falsely negative. I have said it here often that doctors today are more concerned about overtreating than they are about curing. As you already know, my own dad's treatment - or lack of it beginning with his ignorant family doc - was so completely confusing to us that it left me with very little faith in the honesty of many in the medical profession, if not their actual competence. Sorry if that offends anyone here who's had the good fortune to encounter first-rate docs, this is just my experience. I asked for and received my dad's pathology many years after the fact and was sent a small stack of paper, which I brought to my doc. After he'd had a chance to go through it he said he didn't understand what could have happened, because his cancer had a low Gleason score. A nurse suggested to us after he died that it might have been too much morphine that ended his life, which added one more layer of confusion and sorrow. Anyway thanks RobLee for the info regarding tumors at the base. Can I hope that MRI has a better chance of detecting than other methods? Regardless I'm already prepared for a bit of a battle, because MRI wait times as well as wait times to see any specialist in Ontario can be notoriously long. Let's just get it right out there: with \"free\" healthcare, you get what you pay for. As I've said, I'm prepared to travel and pay cash as needed. I was pretty depressed yesterday but feeling a bit more optimistic today, because thanks to you folks I already feel 100% better informed.",
