    "Content": "I was diagnosed with stage 1 prostate cancer. I nearly creamed myself, but after investigation realised the following. 1. Davinci robotic surgery left me with a complete 110% erection 12 days after surgery. 2. Davinci robotic surgery left me with 100% urine control. 3. Had this failed I would have opted for a valve that stops incontinence( urine leaking) My dad had this done and is 100% successful. 4. if I had no erection I would have opted for a penile implant. I know a guy who had penile implant done and preferred it to when he could get a normal erection. he says he now gets erections as and when he wants for as long as he wants to. and so my message to all of you is as follows. Catch your cancer early and there are solutions. If not there are another solutions. The dry orgasm is my only concern but with time that too will be ok. My wife prefers a clean orgasm as opposed to the mess. lastly, make absolutely sure you choose the right doctor. I used Dr Marius Conradie from the waterfall hospital in Midrand South Africa. He did incredible work on me. Good luck and hope this helps Armando",
