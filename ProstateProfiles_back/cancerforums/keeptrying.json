      "Content": "Due to a fairly high PSA reading (6.4 with 17.2% free at age 63, up from the mid-3s 18 months ago, as I mentioned in a previous thread), I made an appointment with a urologist. I figured I'd be able to present a more thorough picture to the urologist if I had a reading from the ExoDx Intelliscore urine test, so during the 2-week wait for the urologist appointment I asked my PCP if he would order it and he agreed (half-heartedly, saying he wouldn't know enough to expertly interpret the results). The results showed a score of 13.11%, which, encouragingly, is below the 15.6% cutoff point (see later in post for the fine print). I showed the ExoDx literature to the urologist and told him my score (which I got verbally from my PCP's office but hadn't yet gotten a copy of the report). The urologist was not familiar with the test but seemed interested and said he would research it. I asked whether a PHI or 4Kscore test might be a good next step, and he said that I should wait 2 or 3 more weeks (i.e. 5 or 6 weeks from the initial PSA reading, to allow any temporary prostate problems that might have contributed to the initial PSA to resolve themselves) and then get a 4Kscore test and we'd work from there. (He accurately said, \"I see you want to avoid a biopsy\". I'm not sure this was his preferred course of action, but he seemed OK with it for now. If anything further is needed after 4Kscore, mpMRI might be next.) I realize that an ExoDx reading below the cutoff doesn't necessarily mean that I don't have a Gleason 7 (or above) tumor, but in my mind it makes it more likely that the urologist and I can actively take some weeks to explore the best next step. When I first spoke to Exosome Diagnostics (which makes and processes the ExoDx test), I asked whether an ordering physician could be labeled as a non-urologist in their database so that Exosome wouldn't give his/her name to other patients, and they got back to me and said yes. As far as the cost of the test, while the self-pay price is $800, if a patient has health insurance the maximum out-of-pocket cost that Exosome charges is $300. In response to a follow-up question, they said \u0093You had also voiced concerns over a potentially high deductible from your insurance company. Even if the test is not fully covered, the max out of pocket cost to you would be $300.\u0094 But of course these things change, so if interested you'd probably want to ask them directly. Fine print re ExoDx test (from the report, paraphrased by me): It's for age 50+ with PSA 2-10 being considered for an initial prostate biopsy. A score below the 15.6% cutoff has a Negative Predictive Value (NPV) of 91% for Gleason 7+. Score should be used in conjunction with other standard-of-care prognostic info (so for example I assume a PSA of 9 with an ExoDx of 17 would carry a higher risk than a PSA of 5 with an ExoDx of 17). One question I have for other Forum Brothers: The 4Kscore test report provides total PSA and free PSA info (as well as the total 4Kscore), but since it's done by Bioreference Labs, the PSA methodology wouldn't necessarily be comparable to that of Labcorp where I got my other PSA tests. Has anyone had experience with how Labcorp and Bioreference PSA values from similar timeframes have compared?",

You may want to read the JAMA Oncology article that describes what the test shows and doesn't show. The link is https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jam...rticle/2506709 Someone with a reading above the 15.6% cutoff point does not necessarily have a high risk of high-grade prostate cancer. Rather, the article states that \"A binary cut point with a negative predictive value (NPV) of greater than 95% was selected.\" As I understand it (and that 4-word qualifier also applies to everything that follows here, since I'm far from an expert), that means that if one's test value is BELOW 15.6%, there's a 95% chance that a biopsy would NOT show high grade cancer. (That's JUST based on the Intelliscore and doesn't incorporate factors such as PSA, family history, etc.) Being above the cutoff does not mean that one would or wouldn't have a high-grade biopsy. In that article, if you click on Figure 3, you can see that at approximately your test result (26 or so on the vertical scale), there are plenty of blue bars (\"Biopsy negative/GS6\") but also a fair number of yellow (GS3+4) and red (GS4+3 and higher) bars. I think DjinTonic's statement that \"As to monitoring, what would you be waiting for? -- Your PSA to go even higher? A nodule to be felt on your DRE? That could be flirting with danger.\" is spot on. As far a whether to pursue a 3T mpMRI before a biopsy, I'm probably on that path (I'm a newbie so take my opinion for what it's worth). As DjinTonic said, for someone who has not had a biopsy, the cost of an mpMRI may very well be out of pocket, and each guy needs to make his own judgments as to what the best path for him is. Also, it might well take time to find a urologist who is willing to work with mpMRI requests, get an appointment with him, wait for the mpMRI, then wait to get the biopsy done. On the flip side, what I've read says that 3T mpMRI TRUS fusion biopsy is better than a standard TRUS biopsy.

      "Content": "(This is only from what I have read - fortunately not from personal experience since my risk level seems lower.) One option may be SBRT, of which Cyberknife is probably the most common vehicle. It seems that there are professionals who feel that it has similar, or almost similar, benefits as standard radiation treatment with fewer side effects. I'm sure there are other professionals who feel otherwise. There have been studies carried out -- search on SBRT for intermediate risk prostate cancer. Good luck, and as others have stated, research the heck out of your options. Don't hesitate to call Cyberknife centers and ask questions; the worse they can say is that they can't help you over the phone. There are also videos.",

      "Content": "My impression is that this is common (not sure about hospitals). For example the Princeton Radiology website says \"Princeton Radiology has acquired UroNav software by Invivo. With this new software we are able to gather pre-biopsy MRI images of the prostate and then seamlessly transfer them to local Urologists. Using UroNav, these Urologists can fuse the pre-biopsy MRI images with real time ultrasound-guided biopsy images for excellent delineation of the prostate and suspicious lesions, as well as clear visualization of the biopsy needle \u2013 allowing Urologists to directly aim biopsy needed at lesions. Better images means better results.\" (Note: I believe the radiology group actually uses Invivo's Dynacad and the urologist uses Uronav.)",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by Markiz My ExoDx Intelliscore test came back with score of 26. Urine sample was collected after the DRE which released some PCA3 into the urethra. Could that mess up with the test results? I can't find the instructions that were in the kit, but I'm pretty sure it specifically said that if DRE is to be done, it should be after the urine collection. QUESTION: Markiz, how long after the DRE was your urine sample collected? (If it was within a few hours or less, that tells me the doctor wasn't aware of the specification or didn't inform you of it.) As to whether the DRE could affect the test, that's a great question. Possibly Exosome Diagnostics customer service could be of help. Also, I'll try to send you a PM if I get a chance.",

      "Content": "I had a PSA scare 2 months ago, with a reading in the mid-6's, up from the high 3's a year and a half earlier. I just got the results of my PSA retest, and the reading is 3.73. I should get the 4Kscore result in a couple of days, but I'd be surprised if it's anything worrisome. I made sure before this PSA retest not to ejaculate for several days. Specifically I waited (and waited) 5 days before getting the blood test. Two months ago I had only waited about 36 hours (and had previously ejaculated a few times that week), after having read one study that seemed to indicate that things return to normal for most men by 24 to 48 hours. But I guess I'm not like most men, or there was some other factor at work. (I interpreted another study as indicating that the older one is, the longer it might take for the PSA to return to normal after ejaculation, partly due to BPH prevalence -- but my understanding of all this is quite murky.) To play it safe, I also avoided getting the retest when I was experiencing any significant discomfort that could potentially be (even non-bacterial) prostatitis. In the interim I had taken an ExoDx Intelliscore urine test (ordered by my PCP, as I detailed in another thread) that showed a score of 13.11, which is on the good side of the 95% Negative Predictive Value range for clinically significant (Gleason 7+) prostate cancer. (Note: The ExoDx test is described as a \"non-invasive test that does not require a digital rectal exam\", but I didn't realize until reading the test instructions that IF a DRE is being done, it should be done AFTER the urine collection. This is VERY UNLIKE another urine test, SelectMDx, which REQUIRES a POST-DRE sample. All of this is new territory for most urologists, so if a patient is planning on requesting or taking an ExoDx Intelliscore test, he should be proactive in ensuring that a DRE, if there is one, be done AFTER taking the urine sample.) To me the availability of the ExoDx test as an additional data point was a huge positive. The encouraging result provided me with an extra few weeks of relative optimism while waiting for the PSA retest, and now provides, in my mind, additional support for holding off on a biopsy unless the 4Kscore result is problematical. (If the ExoDx result had been less encouraging, it would have provided additional support FOR a (MRI-guided?) biopsy.) Interestingly, my urologist, who had not previously been familiar with the ExoDx test, correctly predicted based on the ExoDx result that the PSA retest result would be encouraging. The forum brothers who have been diagnosed with clinically significant PCa (or other risky PCa) understandably suggest erring on the side of biopsy (despite the fact that there are some risks with biopsy) when PSA shows a potential problem. Over time, based on prospective accumulated ExoDx experience of other forum brothers, perhaps a bit of an opinion shift will occur in cases with encouraging ExoDx results and SLIGHTLY problematical PSA. Maybe in those cases, a 3T mpMRI could be an (admittedly imperfect) tie-breaker if the patient strongly wishes to attempt to avoid a biopsy.",

Whichever urologist I go to, I'm planning to ask for the ExoDx Intelliscore urine test and a multiparametric MRI, and if both of those show low risk, I would lobby to avoid a biopsy.

But I have no reason to think he has experience with MRI-guided biopsy. If an MRI and/or the urine test indicate that a biopsy is really necessary, would it be simple and effective for a urologist who has not done an MRI-guided biopsy before to do it? (There is a radiology group in my area that recently started doing multiparametric MRI, will use a 3T machine if done at a particular location, and will send the results and raw data(?) to urologists.) Or I'm guessing I could take the MRI results to a urologist who is experienced in MRI-guided biopsy. I did find a urologist in my area whose bio says he's done MRI-guided biopsy, but I'm hesitant to make my initial appointment with him because he's part of a big practice (probably less flexibility to say \"sure, let's see if the tests say you can avoid a biopsy\") that only allocates 10 minutes even for an initial appointment.
