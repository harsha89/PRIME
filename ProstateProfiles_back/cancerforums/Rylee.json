      "Content": "I am getting a second opinion from John's Hopkins on my prostate cancer. They will be reviewing pathology and MRI. My urologist still thinks that active surveillance is the way to go, although he says it is my decision. It's been 5 years on active surveillance. No chage in PSI, but the cancer is bilateral. Probably always was. I have had PSA between 4.6 and 5.6 for 20 years now. Does anyone have questions I should be asking Johns Hopkins or is there a better place for second opinion. Is there a particular doctor at Johns Hopkins that we should ask to do the review? Thanks",

      "Content": "What constitutes a stage T2c. Does the cancer have to be felt by DRE to be stage T2? If cancer was found by fine needle biopsy because of high PSA (5.2) and the cancer is not felt by DRE, but minimal cancer (1 of 12 cores and less than 5% involvement) was found on both lobes on two separate biopsies is it considered T1 or because there is tumor on both lobes, right and left lobe, is it T2c?",

      "Content": "Do prostate tumors become more aggressive with time? Can a Gleason pattern 3 \"Pattern 3 - The tissue still has recognizable glands, but the cells are darker. At high magnification, some of these cells have left the glands and are beginning to invade the surrounding tissue or having an infiltrative pattern. This corresponds to a moderately differentiated carcinoma.\" become a Gleason 4 or 5 pattern. I know the Gleason SCORE often changes from what the biopsy found to what RP finds but is that always because the biopsy did not target the most aggressive part of the cancer or is it sometimes because the cancer itself has become more aggressive?",
