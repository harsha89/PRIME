      "Content": "Originally Posted by petermollie Hi Just recieved results of prostate biopsy Psa 2.4 to 4.7 in 12 months Gleason 3+3=6 Stage T2a Tumour 0.6mm long in 1 sample High Grade dysplasia (PIN) in 3 samples No Significant pathologic changes in rest of samples Total 16 cores. Thinking about going with Active Surveillance? Anyone with similar numbers gone that way? Thanks Peter approach, however, AS means exactly that. The most important thing one should do is gather as much information and knowledge as possible. Might I suggest the following, if your insurance will cover it. 1. Color Doppler Ultra Sound 2. Endorectal MRI with spectroscopy. 3. Genetic test on the positive core with either Prolaris or oncotype dx from Genomic health In addition, look into dietary changes, such as eliminating or reducing red meat. Major clinics such as UCSF, have recommended diets for PCa The reason you would like to have the above data,points is to insure that AS is reasonable. Based on your initial finding it seems that way You may want a second read of the biopsy slides also from John Hopkins, or Bostwick labs to insure the grade All the best",
