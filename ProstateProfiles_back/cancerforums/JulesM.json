      "Content": "Hello all! First time here and posting. I'm grateful for all of you who reach out, share thoughts and experience. My husband (age 54) was just dx this week with Clinical stage ll prostate cancer. Original doc visit was because of a deep ache that started in January 2017. His PSA in Sept. 2015 was 3.9, in May, 2017 PSA was 8.1, microscopic hemeturia found, then 8.9 at 4 weeks later, and 9.5 by September. Over the last few months, in addition to the deep ache, he has urinary problems - always going, pain, weak stream. He's developed a cough, he's tired, has weakness. Biopsy indicates Gleason 3+4. Ca detected on both sides. Doc says he's very confident that the ache is not related to cancer at all, saying it's muscle. Doc also says he feels Ca is localized. No other tests or scans?! The reason I'm confused is bacause Dr. Google (tsk tsk) states that there's no symptoms in early stage CaP. Hubby is scheduled to have radical prostatectomy with pelvic lymph node dissection on October 23rd. Anyone else out there have anything similar? What's your thoughts? Thanks sooo much",

Hubby is choosing surgery as that is what he is most comfortable with given his symptoms that prompted a dr. visit initially. As for the urinary symptoms, we have no other reason for it, no UTI, no BPH. (They said his prostate is actually small) 3/12 cores positive, also noted high grade PIN. Pattern 4 = 25% (no idea what this is). It's still unsettling that he's quite uncomfortable and presenting progressing symptoms for several months now. Bizarre :/",
