      "Content": "Good evening. I have been on this site researching for my husband. Here is our story so far. In August, my husband experienced bleeding in his ejaculate. We scheduled an appointment with the doctor. The earliest we could get was 8/28. This was about a week later. They did a U/A which showed no infection, but some microscopic traces of blood. Sent it off for further analysis. Results concurred. They also did blood work, complete panel, including PSA since he was 40 and the bleeding. When results came back, his PSA 16.1 with fPSA 0.5, and %fPSA 3%. At that time, his doctor decided to do a DRE at the 2nd visit. Stated his prostate was enlarged. They decided to refer him to an urologist. In the time in between appointments, my husband said he had been experiencing some periods of where it felt like something was \"stopping his flow.\" There had also been a couple problems with his erection a while back, but we attributed it to his blood pressure meds. His mom also told of there is a history of PCa in his family that he was unaware of. Anyway, we met with his urologist o 10/8. He was very straight forward and said that my husband's number was very high for his age. He did another DRE and PSA draw. His PSA was 18.9 with fPSA 0.63, and %fPSA 3.3% This number is probably slightly elevated since the DRE was done prior to the blood draw. We had already been scheduled for my husband to have a biopsy/CT/ultrasound before we got the result. They just want to make sure. So far we are not panicking about the possibility of cancer, and we have had very honest people around us to talk to us about the odds. We understand that the %fPSA is not a good number, but we also no we have no control over the results. We are confident in the doctors that been put in place to help us. We have an awesome church family praying us through whatever the situation, and honestly, we have been through worse with the loss of a child 13 years ago. With that being said, I want to make sure he is informed and has the best opportunities. I would prefer he be around with me for a long time I am not sure how many biopsies they will take on the 28th, but can he request more? If it comes back negative, when should he have another PSA drawn, and if another biopsy is done, how long in between? Would it be a six month wait? With his young age, we want to be proactive. Thank you for any answers, opinions, and time given.",

      "Content": "Good afternoon all. So I haven't really posted much since my husband's surgery. It has been a crazy ride. His post-op PSA one month after surgery was 0.01 (Feb.) Then they tested again 2 months later (Apr.) and it was 0.04. In May it was 0.09, and they tested again last week, and it's 0.15. 😕😳. We aren't really surprised that is climbing, but we had hoped it wouldn't be so soon. Between PSA's and bladder scopes, we are constantly on a rollercoaster. On the upside we get a break from the bladder for 6 months! Woohoo. Anyone else have a similar experience? Any advice would be appreciated also. Not sure what treatment will be next. We are continuing to take it one day at a time while we pray for answers and direction. Thanks in advance for any advice. T",

      "Content": "Thanks for the advice. He finally did prune juice last night and by 9 pm, he was passing gas and then poop. PTL. We got to come home today. He has two spots in his abdomen that are very sore, he is doing pretty good. Hopefully the rest of recovery will not be so difficult. Fingers crossed.",

      "Content": "My husband has his surgery on Monday. He is still in the hospital because he can't pass gas and he hasn't eaten. He is up walking as much as he can. It is causing him tremendous pain and discomfort. Anyone have any experience like this? Any suggestions? They already gave him a suppository and MoM. Anything would be much appreciated.",
