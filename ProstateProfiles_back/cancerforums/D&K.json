      "Content": "Our Fav Oncologist through the summer went into private practice & left the clinic. She provided lots of information as we went, and a preview of what we 'might expect'. I'm not (really) surprised by the back issues. The 'new' oncologist didn't impress me, and his response was \"the CT Scan doesn't reflect anything\"; didn't do anything further. The southern oncologist we met with on January 8th ordered an x-ray, and the degenerative joints and vertebrae was detected there. She didn't communicate with the Doc from December; and very honestly he wasn't really familiar with our case, only provided the results of the CT Scan. Monday THIS oncologist also ordered out a pain patch for his ongoing pain, since the hydrocodone barely touched his pain levels. I totally understand not blindly offering advice; and YES bone mets were detected early on. We're hoping to \"hold our own for as long as possible\" with as little pain & family disruptions as possible. \"life as usual as possible\" is the motto.",

      "Content": "An update from last summer's stage4 diagnosis; following chemo last summer. We are currently wintering in the south; trying to learn local protocol with the local clinic which was very frustrating. My honey had meeting with Oncologist who \"listened\" to his complaint about back pain; and ordered an x-ray. Then it took 2 weeks to find someone to provide us with the results: degenerative joints & arthritis in the cervical & thoracic vertebrae; no fractures. I've had time to think about it, and now have a couple of questions: 1) is there anything we can do to strengthen his back? 2) are there any activities/exercises we should be doing? or activities we should avoid? These are the two questions I've \"secure messaged\" the clinic after the diagnosis relayed to us earlier today. Any ideas or thoughts would be helpful.",

I am not sure about my personal results yet. Due to the aggressiveness of my prostate cancer (G9)with Metastatic Disease, my medical team is throwing all options at me. Next Tuesday I will start Chemotherapy as a proactive approach due to Metastasis and because they found Lung Nodules in my CT scan. Unfortunately the Lung Nodules are too small to biopsy or to be picked up on a PET Scan. My honey is also with Metastatic to the bone. The chemo 'stopped' the cancer growth in the lymph nodes. The hormone treatment has reduced his PSA to .23. Also has lung nodules. We just celebrated our first anniversary of diagnosis; have our 47th wedding anniversary coming up: our daughter says she's starting to plan our 50th! KEEP POSITIVE! It's all about attitude.",

Hopefully by the first of the year he will feel well enough to start doing some exercise and try to get it back off. He's almost 300# & really needs to lose some of it. Our spirits went UP yesterday when Oncologist said we \"have years left\". HOORAY! I just enjoyed my last day at work today, and plan to spend as much quality time as possible with my honey. If we're lucky, we'll celebrate 50 GREAT years together in 2019: my daughter is already planning a party. This is our third bout with cancer.

      "Content": "My husband was diagnosed in May with Prostate Cancer: PSA was 73; next month we met with the Urologist and PSA was 83 and he initiated the 'hormone therapy'; July we met Oncologist and his PSA was already down to 53. We did a bone scan as well as (MRI?). We have been diagnosed as 'stage 4; already metastasized into the bone & lymph nodes. In May I found your blog; discovered the book written by the Dr from Johns Hopkins. The book provided me with information/knowledge to prep me for the upcoming appointments. As the Oncologist says, \"Information is Knowledge\". Your group has helped me tremendously! We just finished 'our' second chemo session. ONLY 4 more to go. Thank you for your continued support!",

      "Content": "Our Docs jumped into action upon receipt of the PSA: immediate bone scan & (MRI?) were scheduled, moved from Urology who did hormone shot; to Oncology. Next met with Oncology to get the scan results && off and running with chemo. It all went VERY fast! Because we were already in lymph nodes & bone we are 'automatically' stage 4. Now fighting!!",
