      "Content": "Has anyone had an aneurysm and the surgery option for treatment? I don't know all of the stats, but I am Gleason 6 and it is contained within the prostate. My surgeon mentioned concern with the aneurysm and my PCP said it wasn't big enough for surgery and should not be an issue. It also was not proximal to the bladder. I have not decided on treatment yet and am meeting with radiologic oncologist tomorrow. Any help would be appreciated. Thank you",

      "Content": "I understand that but I am not interested in active surveillance. My surgeon agrees that getting the cure now at 66 is appropriate. I don't know the specifics of the pathology, but I don't want the cancer in me. I appreciate your comment and understand your position, but I am hopefully getting help for what I am comfortable with. I very much appreciate your help.",
