    "Content": "Hello, is there anyone out there who might be able to answer me a few questions? A relative of mine had prostate cancer a few years back, he had it removed and the last blood test this year was all ok. But he recently had a lump on his testicles, had a scan and it was all fine (a cyst). But while he was at the hospital they decided to scan his kidneys too, and then his pancreas. Why would they scan these parts as well if his testicle was fine? His kidneys are ok but they have found 'something' on the pancreas, they haven't said what yet and he now has to wait for the to let him know what they think it is. Could anyone shed a little light/or an educated guess on this for me? I'm just wondering why they decided to scan those two areas as well, and I'm obviously concerned about the pancreas bit....",
