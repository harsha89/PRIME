      "Content": "Originally Posted by leroybrown44 just checking out there for anyone who has had it already spread from the prostate and is still going strong with perhaps a bit of quality of life.I`ve been diagnosed 12 months ago and considered terminal but could survive from 6 months to 15 years -currently on Hormone therapy.Tried to go off the tablets to have a rest and within a week the bonepain came back bigtime.Whats the longest anyone has gone out there and why? My father was diagnosed with a stage D prostate cancer about a month ago. It was too late when we found out about it. He is 57 y.old and the cancer has spread to the lungs and bones too. Almost everywhere except his head... The doctor put him on hormone therapy about two weeks ago (Flumicine is the medication pills) and he will be on a Zoladex injection every three months, starting on Tuesday. Pills have already worked as he feels no bone pain anymore and the doctors confirmed through a biopsy last week that he will respond well to the hormone therapy. The unfortunate truth is that he will be able to live with a good quality of life for almost two years. Then he will become hormone resistant and the cancer cells will become active again. The pain then will start. I have not discussed with the doctors what will the case be then, but they have already implied that the only way is chemotherapy which buys you about 2-3 months. It is a really hard situation. Do you think we should tell my father the whole truth. He does not know yet that the tumor has spread everywhere.",
