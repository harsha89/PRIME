    "Content": "Just found out I have prostate cancer. Going to see surgeon and radiation oncologist this week to discuss treatment options. I think my cancer is stage 2. No indication it's outside the gland. bilateral. Gleason scores of 6 in six spots and 7 in one of the twelve biopsy points. I'm reading all American Cancer Society stuff, plus some stuff from Johns Hopkins. I think I'm going to opt for EBRT. Any advice for a newbie?",
