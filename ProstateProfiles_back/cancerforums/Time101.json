      "Content": "I am glad to hear that, for the sake if those who had some damage to their nerves after prostate surgery. I was, as you can tell from my question confused about how many dad lived in a good mood most of his days after surgery, and how did he manage to live with what I am living with now. Numbness fluctuates between a 5 and a 8, when it is severe it feels like a cold rubber, turtled, i lay down in bed and put a heat pad on, helps things feel better, but otherwise i feel i am living with a foreign body, or dead tissue. i am only 37. if any of you know a good hearted and thorough uro/neuro who might take me seriously please please let me know. thanks",

      "Content": "Hi, My dad has undergone partial removal that apparently, from what i understood from him, was not nerve sparing. I know from my mom that this has made him unable to have sex. That is all i know. He had the surgery 10 years ago and maybe now the technology allows doctors to spare nerves. My question is the following: IF nerves are not spared, are damaged during a prostate procedure, i assume this would result in a numbness in the penis and perinium. Am i correct? If so, how do people deal with numbness. My dad passed away and cannot ask him anymore. I am currently suffering from penile numbness and this is by far the worst thing that ever happened to me. In my case i did not have surgery and i am hoping sensation will come back. My question is not about my case, but I am trying to see patients out there about how they deal with the numbness. I have lived terrible things but none come close to walking down the street and no feeling anything in my trousers, going to pee and the feeling of holding a piece of rubber in my hand.... That has made my brain numb, and haunts each and every moment of my life. I wonder whether this is my reaction or whether it is typically distressful to people who have undergone some operation that resulted in such damage. Grateful for your answers.",
