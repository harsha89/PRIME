      "Content": "Hey all, My dad had a radical prostatectomy on 4/4/16 at Mt. Sinai with Dr. Tewari. The biopsy and pre-op MRI showed cancer in the left lobe. The pathology during surgery confirmed this in addition to cancer in the right lobe. We were surprised to learn that Dr. Tewari had to cut wider margins on the right. He did resect all the tissue until the margins were clear. Lymph nodes were reportedly negative. There was \"some\" nerve sparing on both sides. Does this mean that the cancer escaped the prostate and that he had \"positive margins?\" I'm not sure if positive margins intraoperatively are clinically significant if you end up cutting until you get negative margins. Thanks in advance for your responses. My dad is still in a lot of pain (mainly gas) from the surgery. The catheter is really bothering him (any tips there also appreciated). Finding out that the cancer was bilateral has been rough and I believe is hindering his recovery. Kate",

He is still struggling with incontinence and has only been able to urinate twice on his own during the day (at night he has better luck--anyone else with similar experiences?). My mom noted that he hadn't taken his anti-hypertensive (atenolol) on this particular day (his BP has been low since the surgery). We then recognized that this medication can actually worsen incontinence. If weaning off the atenolol doesn't prove to be helpful, what has worked for others? I know it is only a month out from his surgery, but this is obviously a huge quality of life problem. He is doing his Kegel's as directed by Dr. Tewari at Mt. Sinai. Any tips or words of encouragement would be so appreciated! Thanks all, Kate",
