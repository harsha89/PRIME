      "Content": "Hi there. Just thought I'd come have a browse around this site and post about my situation. Over the past year, I've had a three episodes of penile discharge. The first time, the Doctor gave me two types of antibiotics to take, and sent me for STI tests - all negative. The second time, Dr. gave me both antibiotics again, and sent me for STI tests, and this time, a culture of the discharge rather than just urinalysis. The culture was clear, but the analysis said, \"Many neutrophils\". I didn't get a call from the Dr, so assumed the \"Many neutrophils\" thing was nothing. Plus, it seemed obvious that there would be given there was discharge, and the antibiotics cleared it up. I have been in good shape and eat reasonably. In fact, I ran a half-marathon at the end of September. In mid-November, I developed diarrhea. I still feel fine other than a bit of discomfort in my gut, and I'm actually gaining a bit of weight as I don't exercise as much in the winter. I also got the penile discharge again (minor this time) in the past couple weeks, that actually went away on its own after a week, so by the time I went to the Dr it was gone, but I did tell her about it, and the diarrhea was my issue. She sent me for a complete round of blood tests, urinalysis, and stool sample (culture and parasite) and everything was normal - except PSA of 6, which she said is \"very high\" for someone my age. I had been taking Proscar for a year (for hair loss), and stopped in October, and the Dr. wondered if it is could be a \"rebound\" from stopping the Proscar given that the drug suppresses PSA readings. I have just resumed taking Proscar (Dr. said it was fine). Now, I've been referred to a urologist for a DRE, and I have a PSA re-test. The Dr. hesitated, but prescribed a two week course of Cipro to address the diarrhea and potential prostatitis. I'm on day 5 of the Cipro, and the diarrhea is improving. I have none of the typical symptoms of PC, no pain or swelling in my crotch or anywhere else, no trouble or pain peeing etc. Of course, I know that this lack of typical symptoms doesn't mean anything in terms of a PC diagnosis. Anyway, it all seems very weird to me... and of course, the a bad scenario here is that the previous Doctors should have investigated the discharge further, and because they didn't, it may well be Prostrate Cancer that has spread into my bowel - causing the diarrhea. Of course, the best case scenario is that the two are unrelated, the Cipro kills the bugs causing the diarrhea and the prostate infection. I guess I don't have a question really, but just wanted to type this out. I haven't shared this with anyone yet of course.",

Unfortunately my appointment with the urologist did not get scheduled until next week. December 20 is when my GP referred me - a long wait time, but she said he is an excellent urologist. I am having all new blood work and my PSA retest in a couple days. I'll provide another update after my urology appointment.",
