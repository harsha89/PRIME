      "Content": "My prostate has been messing with me for decades, so in a sense the cancer dx was just a lot more of the same. I was all excited about getting entirely rid of the damn thing after thirty plus years of BPH woe until my uro told me he wouldn't operate, that I was on mandatory A.S. Nor can I really get excited about my PSA readings (currently 7.0), since back in '96 (before my TURP) it blew past 11 and would have hit 15 without the surgery. (Huge gland) Back in November two years ago my family doctor called me in and told me I needed to see a uro, that my PSA was too high (after two tests) and it was time to see if I had cancer. (You may remember that back in the day they always told us that BPH had no relation at all to prostate cancer, apples and oranges, not connected, and then not too long ago THEY figured out that THEY had it exactly backwards. Ah, experts.) So I went to a new, local uro (new for me) because he was trained on the Da Vinci machine that my brother Gil out in Seattle said was just the greatest and signed up for a standard TRUS biopsy at our community hospital. As far as the biopsy was concerned this was not my first rodeo so I insisted on being put under. That helped substantially. Brothers Gil and Don (in Jacksonville) both advised me that no one is allowed into uro school unless they test out sadistic. As if I didn't know. The usual twelve cores. One had 20% cancer. One. Gleason 6. mpMRI thereafter, PI-RADS 2. Second biopsy eight months after the first. Result: no cancer findings at all. However, years and years of continuing BPH (all growing back after 1996 TURP) and related LUTS with maximum twice daily Flomax. So a recent surgical insertion of four Urolift stents, which helps a lot. The questions I'm working on now include but are not limited to: should I have another MRI within the next few months? Interestingly, the original MRI report states that: \"TRUS Bx negative for adenocarcinoma January 2017.\" But the original path report (right here in my hand) sez: \"L. Left apex medial: Adenocarcinoma, Gleason grade 6 (3+3=6). Note: Tumor involves approximately 20% of multiple tissue fragments.\" The original MRI report does recommend a follow-up MRI in a year \"IF PSA KINETICS ARE ABNORMAL.\" That's in numbered paragraph 5. In numbered paragraph 6 the gentleman opines: \"REPEAT MPMRI IN 12 MONTHS TO CONFIRM STABILITY IF PSA REMAINS STABLE.\" Covers all bases I guess. I'd still prefer to get rid of the whole apparatus. We haven't really been on speaking terms since 1979. That's why the Da Vinci thing seems so appealing. Mrs. Jack doesn't know why I put up with it. She had her mechanism out in '85. I don't know. Just sentimental, I guess.",

      "Content": "Thank you, Chuck, for your very knowledgeable reply. Your knowledge helps, because there's a significant part of my mind that immediately turns itself off when the words \"prostate\" or \"cancer\" come to my attention. I envy your obvious ability to *pay attention* to unfortunate actualities. Some of us are not so endowed. Originally Posted by HighlanderCFH Welcome aboard, Jack. Looks like you are in The Club, assuming that the first biopsy was accurate. One thing I'd say for starters is that BPH is NOT associated with prostate cancer. In other words, there is no evidence (that I've heard of) showing that BPH can cause PC. Originally Posted by HighlanderCFH I haven't heard that BPH causes PC, but that BPH is now associated with PC, which is different. See, e.g., Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia Doubles Risk of Prostate Cancer, https://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/750351. ... ... I had 3 positive cores of Gleason 6. Two were about 20% and one was only 5%. Since I had a case of PC, the avenue of surgery opened up as a treatment choice for me. And, due to the horrible urination problems, I opted for da Vinci at Mayo Clinic. This was after a Mayo radiation oncologist confirmed that, in my case, surgery was the best route because it could cure my urination troubles at the same time. Yes, my brother had the Da Vinci procedure and raved about it. ... They PAINLESSLY removed the catheter a week after surgery (I stayed at Mayo for all of this) and, from the very start, I was almost 100% continent. I remain totally continent today, run 8 miles every day and still urinate like a 16 year-old. I drink gallons of coffee and energy drinks throughout the evening and rarely have to get up more than once during the night (often not at all). That sounds just great. Wish I could be in your shoes! Maybe it has something to do with my being on Medicare, though I do have the best level of MediGap policy as well. ... As for the uro DENYING you the option of surgery -- tell him to crawl up his own orifice!! YOU are the patient and YOU have the right to decide on treatment options, or active surveillance, etc. You should be perfectly qualified for surgery with a cancer diagnosis AND also with BPH. I'm heartened by your reaction. I did have a local second opinion and the second uro endorsed the first uro. Perhaps it was professional courtesy, I don't really know. Or perhaps my guy's refusal was based on my cancer being only in one core rather than in three like yourself. I'll see him next month and ask him then. One of the reasons my family doc sent me to the specific uro I did see appears to be because this uro has a reputation of being very fast with a knife, an approach endorsed by my family doctor (who also believes I should have the whole thing out). I'll revisit this issue with my people very soon. Good luck!! Chuck Thanks again, Chuck! Over and out!",

      "Content": "Hi, Advocate! Thank you for your interest. As an AS veteran, I'm particularly interested in your point of view. Originally Posted by ASAdvocate Welcome to the forum, JackF. It sounds like the cancer is the least of your prostate issues. You have been through the usual AS first-year protocol of biopsy diagnosis, MRI, and fusion biopsy, with only insignificant cancer being found. The fact that no cancer was found on the second biopsy is a good indicator of indolent PCa. Originally Posted by ASAdvocate You have already had the confirmatory biopsy, so I don't see a reason why another MRI would be needed anytime soon. A possible regimen for you would be six month psa/fpsa or PHI tests, annual DRE's, and MRI's or biopsies every 2-3 years, or as required by the other test results. I'm unfamiliar with the terms \"fpsa\" and \"PHI.\" Could you expand? Originally Posted by ASAdvocate You are the first poster that I seen comment on the Urolift. Others will probably find your experience of interest. There is also a new bph treatment called Prostate Artery Embolization (PAE) that you may want to research. Yes, I've seen the PAE procedure mentioned, but I'm not sure I need an additional procedure at this time. I AM getting off the Flomax one pill at a time, because of the dementia angle that has recently raised its ugly head. The Urolift results are the only things making it possible to decrease the medication. If the present results hold up through complete cessation of the terazosin then I don't know that I'd be a present candidate for anything else. The Urolift stents have been very effective for me almost immediately after the ten-minute out-patient insertion procedure. I'd say they cut down the LUTS eighty to ninety percent. And no side effects or negative sequelae. The only potential problem might have been (I checked this out beforehand and found that I personally wouldn't have an issue) limitations on post-Urolift MRI's. The radiologist who did my prior MRI said that the Urolift stents would not pose a problem if or when I needed another one. Take care, Advocate! Good to hear from you!",
