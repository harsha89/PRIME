A surgeon may have less investment in that question than the RO/MO. Good questions. Most of the study refers to men on AS or WW.

Is there a difference for men on AS delaying treatment by slowing disease progression and a man who is delaying more treatment after the primary treatment fails? Maybe in my case with a 4+3 diagnosed I would want to hit it as soon as possible. Then again any rise in PSA after prostate removal is probably not just a 3+3. But what about RT as primary? Are you in kind of an AS mode after RT and it is good slowing it down. Probably, because the next treatment modes are not desirable. A lot of questions as usual. I know one thing.

Was I wrong to encourage him to get another PSA in a few months? I think another psa test is good advise but also important the doctor stating that he has no cancer based on a DRE and has not scheduled any follow up is either not qualified in this area or believes his patients should not be told the truth, for whatever reason. I would switch doctors to a good Urologist and continue under their care if I were him.",

A surgeon may have less investment in that question than the RO/MO. Good questions. Most of the study refers to men on AS or WW. They pointed out that there was some assurance that reduction in PSA is linked to disease status. Is there a difference for men on AS delaying treatment by slowing disease progression and a man who is delaying more treatment after the primary treatment fails? Maybe in my case with a 4+3 diagnosed I would want to hit it as soon as possible. Then again any rise in PSA after prostate removal is probably not just a 3+3. But what about RT as primary? Are you in kind of an AS mode after RT and it is good slowing it down. Probably, because the next treatment modes are not desirable. A lot of questions as usual. I know one thing. I don't want my eating habits to help the cancer along. I would rather it be a slow moving target when it hits the BCR level. Can I slow it down with the right diet and keeping my body healthy? Maybe. I will probably never know.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by ASAdvocate Brachytherapy had an 82 percent recurrence-free rate, which would make it clearly superior. I agree BT is a good option and not picking on you but if someone does not go read the whole article they would miss the point that this study is biased toward a better outcome for BT. As stated in their paper. Although this study analyzed a large cohort of patients, there are significant limitations. These include the single center retrospective nature of it leading to the obvious selection bias, and the fact that the BT patients probably had less aggressive disease due to the lower Gleason 7 percentage of patients. Furthermore, only 0.6% of RP patients received ADT compared to much high number in the radiotherapy patients. Additionally, no data is given on the duration of ADT. No significant difference was shown between patients treated with EBRT and RP, similarly to other large prospective published studies.",

But maybe a math guy can tell you what is more realistic with those numbers.

Question for Ed and all you RALP guys -- did any of your surgeons do intra-operative frozen sections to see whether there was EPE and, if not, continue the operation and spare both nerve bundles? Yeh, I am OK and no radiation has been talked about. But we were talking about radiation in another thread and it brought back to my mind my surprise that the RO's were not involved with the treatment but they monitor it and I wondered how would I know if the guy/gal operating the machine was newly trained or experienced at it and does it matter. I guess I should put this out of my mind but a PSA test every 3 months reminds me. Getting cancer kind of makes you feel vulnerable at times. As to the intra-operative frozen sections, I don't know but I will ask him my next visit. I asked him before the operation if he checked the tissue as he was operating and he said yes. I didn't ask how he checked it. My question and his answer could have meant a lot of different things. Fail on my part to understand what I was asking.",

I thought I read somewhere that there will be scar tissue at areas near the bladder and that slight and regular massage of the area can help break that up and help the issue. But I can't find that anywhere, anyone else recall?? (Or did I dream that somewhere along my own recovery) It was mentioned by MRj in this thread. https://www.cancerforums.net/threads...l=1#post351755 \"Also added in to the regimen was scar tissue release.

      "Content": "Brachytherapy: Where Has It Gone? An article by Kavanagh et al1 in a recent special issue of the Journal of Clinical Oncology highlighted several emerging technologies, translational frontiers, and novel clinical paradigms in radiation oncology. In the excitement generated by the plethora of these powerfully sophisticated tools now available to radiation oncologists, brachytherapy is often mistakenly viewed as an antiquated or even irrelevant modality, despite the central role it continues to play in the management of several cancer types. Further, having undergone its own remarkable recent technological advancement, brachytherapy continues to expand its potential application to a variety of clinical circumstances. There are several reasons for the decline in prostate brachytherapy. First, there was an increase in the number of robotic prostatectomies. Surgery accounted for approximately 44% of treatments before the introduction of robotic prostatectomy in the early 2000s and then rose to 60% in 2010.2 Second, there was an increase in the technical sophistication of EBRT, including intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT), stereotactic radiotherapy (SBRT), and proton therapy. For prostate cancer, there has been a near-complete transition from the use of conventional EBRT to IMRT over the past decade from 0.15% in 2000 to 95.9% in 2008. Third, reimbursement for IMRT is markedly higher compared with that for brachytherapy. This and other factors have led to the development of urologist-owned centers focused exclusively on delivering IMRT for prostate cancer.12 The fourth reason is negative press, a result of cases of poor-quality prostate brachytherapy procedures leading to adverse clinical outcomes.13 Fifth, the volume of prostate brachytherapy procedures used to train radiation oncology residents is suboptimal. http://ascopubs.org/doi/full/10.1200/jco.2014.59.8128",

You probably can't get surgery after radiation. It is done, but rare and only by a few doctors in the country when it is feasible to do. But remember surgery alone does not equal the cure rate of radiation. You have to throw in the guys that need radiation afterwards. It's not like you have surgery and you have an equal chance of a cure. And then you have radiation in your back pocket for an even better chance. Good luck and keep us posted.

      "Content": "Originally Posted by tok718 What are the usual steps to take after the urologist informs patient cancer was found ? I\u2019m looking for some advice and guidance. Thank you in advance -Anthony Anthony, I don't normally answer peoples first posts because there are others here that know a lot more than I do. But it is late and you sound very worried. First, prostate cancer is most of the time slow growing and the first steps you and your father need to take are getting informed about the disease and the treatment options. You have time. There are books in a sticky above and the one by Patrick Walsh is highly recommended by people here. When a urologist informs a patient that he has cancer it is usually a shock and you don't know what questions to ask and I think some doctors are not good in dealing with a patient in that initial meeting. Your father should get a copy of that pathology report and all tests performed. On the report will be a staging of the cores. It will be something like 3+3 or 3+4 etc. People here will not be able to give much advice without those numbers. The psa of 8 is high but is not over 10 which kicks it up to another level of concern. This all depends on the gleason score though. The urologist will normally have you meet with a radiation oncologist as an alternative to surgery. If the cancer has grown outside the prostate radiation may be the best choice but a psa of 8 sounds like it is still contained and he has options. You can of course change doctors to ones closer if that is better for your father. If you could tell the guys here what area your father lives in there may be people here that know the hospitals and doctors in that area. Others will chime in with more questions and advice but for now take a deep breath. I know this is tough but as you learn more over the next few weeks you and your father will be able to see some daylight and make the choices needed. It is good you are going to the meetings because a second set of ears is a big help. My wife went to all my meetings and reminded me of things I did not hear. Others will post and probably give you more advice and have more questions for you. Stay tuned. Ed",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by OldTiredSailor I am trying to buy a Melges MC Scow, which is a 16-foot serious racing sailboat. It is designed for one or two people and requires the operator to put their feet under straps on the centerline and lean back, way back, outside the boat to keep the boat on a 17 degree heel when sailing hard upwind in more than 10-knots. It is a strenuous exercise, which I have been doing for 35+ years, but she was very worried that I would buy the boat, have my gut cut open, and then not be able to sail the boat for six months to a year... Surgery will weaken your abdomen muscles and risk an inguinal hernia until you heal. No matter how good a shape you are in they are slicing through your muscles that hold your insides in place and it needs to heal. Ask your doctor when he would expect you to be able to hike on that boat. Every doctor is different. Mine was way cautious and weight restrictions were very strict for 5 months. The nurse navigator freaked when I told her I was riding my bike 4 weeks after the surgery. But reading other guys posts they were much less strict. I would be surprised if he would approve of that kind of physical exertion in less than 2 months, but who knows. Having said all that. You have a ways to go before you have to ponder treatment for more than a couple of minutes a day if at all. And hopefully you get to skip the treatment part. Good luck with the biopsy. Mine was like most peoples here. Not much of anything. I jammed my thumb a week ago when I flipped my boat and that has been more uncomfortable than the biopsy was. Ed",

Medicare favors and requires certain private companies over others for lab work? Seems very unlikely. Maybe the practice wants to use them for one reason or another and the tech is just name dropping.",

      "Content": "Michael is right. I have read that it is a 1 gm to 1 cc conversion for all practicable purposes. Just looked it up to be sure. https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20653780 Abstract AIMS: Prostate gland volume is generally assessed by transrectal ultrasound examination or magnetic resonance imaging at the time of prostatic biopsy or pre-brachytherapy planning. The volume is most commonly measured using the formula, prostate volume = height x width x length x pi/6, which is derived considering the gland as ellipsoid. There are conflicting data regarding the accuracy of this method, with most studies comparing this calculated volume with that measured radiologically using planimetry with summation of sequential area measurements. The aim was to determine the relationship between prostate gland volume and weight. METHODS AND RESULTS: The accuracy of prostate gland volume calculated from three-dimensional measurements of the gland in 20 radical prostatectomy specimens relative to the true gland volume determined using water displacement was prospectively evaluated. Since volume measurement by water displacement is not practical in routine practice, the relationship between prostate weight and volume was also evaluated. Our findings indicate that the calculated gland volume consistently underestimates the true volume. The volume of the prostate gland (in cm(3)) very closely correlates with its weight (in g). CONCLUSIONS: The weight of the prostate gland (without the seminal vesicles) is an excellent surrogate for prostate volume. The prostate gland in radical prostatectomy specimens should be weighed after transecting the seminal vesicles at the base",

I did not sleep on the recliner but I did sleep on the couch kind of sitting up. Took about 4 days until I felt comfortable laying down in the bed. My stomach was sensitive to most food. A lot of pain, I think from gas. I could drink coconut milk and eat yogurt. It took me 3 days to start eating solid food. No bladder problems and was continent from the time they removed the catheter. I had a UTI that had to be cleared up with antibiotics. There was nothing I could not do myself. I am married but I did not need any help. I started driving after 4 days and went to the grocery store with the wife and pushed the cart. Leg bag was attached. I just wore loose fitting clothes to the hospital and did not take anything to read or play with. Just watched the TV when I was not walking or sleeping. Other than the gas causing bad stomach pain for a couple of days when I tried eating the wrong things, it was pretty easy to deal with. I was up and walking every day first a half a mile and then a mile. It's 4 week out now and I am doing everything I used to do. Been riding the bicycle for the last 2 weeks and taking long walks.

      "Content": "Tim, I was in the hospital a couple of extra days. One for nausea and then they thought they saw something on my ekg so another day of blood tests and observation. I did not sleep on the recliner but I did sleep on the couch kind of sitting up. Took about 4 days until I felt comfortable laying down in the bed. My stomach was sensitive to most food. A lot of pain, I think from gas. I could drink coconut milk and eat yogurt. It took me 3 days to start eating solid food. No bladder problems and was continent from the time they removed the catheter. I had a UTI that had to be cleared up with antibiotics. There was nothing I could not do myself. I am married but I did not need any help. I started driving after 4 days and went to the grocery store with the wife and pushed the cart. Leg bag was attached. I just wore loose fitting clothes to the hospital and did not take anything to read or play with. Just watched the TV when I was not walking or sleeping. Other than the gas causing bad stomach pain for a couple of days when I tried eating the wrong things, it was pretty easy to deal with. I was up and walking every day first a half a mile and then a mile. It's 4 week out now and I am doing everything I used to do. Been riding the bicycle for the last 2 weeks and taking long walks. I have a weight lifting restriction. 5# last month 10# this month, 20# next month and the wife is watching me like a hawk and enforcing it.",

Can that happen, or will it really become something that never seems to go away. Good to here your doing well fishinguy. I don't think I will ever forget. It has been kind of life changing in a lot of ways. John Piper wrote on the eve of his prostate cancer operation in 2006 an article from a Christian point of view called 'don't waste your cancer'. There are a lot of people here that have not let it go to waste and are here helping people almost every day. I am grateful for all of them as I know you are. Take care. Ed",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by Onlyamonk I am new to this site, and have questions regarding whether I am a candidate for focal laser ablation. Am I in the right place? Hello Onlyamonk, Sorry you have to be here but you have found a place with a lot of knowledgeable, friendly and helpful people to try and answer your questions. Focal laser ablation is very new and studies are being done and it looks like most of the people receiving it were in studies. I don't know if anyone here has even had it done but this is an excerpt from a UofC web page that may help. http://www.uchospitals.edu/specialti....html#P37_3957 You may be a candidate for MRI-guided focal laser ablation therapy for prostate cancer if you meet the following criteria: Diagnosed with prostate cancer with a Gleason score of 6 or 7 Have no evidence that cancer has spread to other parts of the body (metastatic disease) Able to undergo treatment in an MRI. This includes having no presence of a metal medical device such as a pacemaker or surgical clips in the body or conditions including kidney disease that may prevent use of contrast dye during the procedure. Evidence of cancer on MRI that corresponds with the biopsy findings If you can post more information about yourself such as the diagnosis you received, psa history. Was a biopsy done to confirm cancer and if so what were the results. Your age. This would give the guys an idea where your at and help in the answers you are looking for. Ed",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by leach234 Am I okay to wait 1.5 months prior to surgery? leach234, Sorry for you diagnosis but glad you found us. You can see from my sig that it was about 2 months from my biopsy to the operation and that was pretty fast compared to most. My Gleason score was 4+3 which is not that much different than your 4+4 and I was happy it happened as fast as it did. I don't think you have to worry. I hope you have been informed of the other treatment options like radiation in it's various forms and not rushing to treatment thinking that surgery is your only option. In any case we are here to answer any questions and tell you our experience and we have a lot of pointers to help. Ed",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by Dave&Barb We just received the path report today, and noticed that one of the samples, a G7(4+3) mentioned \"perineural invasion present\". Quick bit of research shows some upsetting information, such as \"nerve sparing NOT recommended\", higher rate for mets, recommendation for surgery PLUS radiation, or radiation PLUS HT. Uro did not mention this on the initial diagnosis phone call, but I imagine he will address this at the appointment. Any thoughts or suggestions on what we should be thinking about or what to ask, will be appreciated. Trying to get our heads around everything, certainly a whirlwind. It's frightening to hear the C word. We've only just been together for 4 years, having lost our spouses both to cancer ten+ years ago. Thank you so much, Barb Barb, Welcome to the forum. I am sorry you have to be here and for your previous losses. Your husbands diagnosis is very similar to mine and nerve sparing was done on one side. The side that was thought to be cancer free. In the end some cancer was on that side and PNI was found in the final report after the operation. There is still debate about the significance of PNI but this 2017 study seems to indicate it raises the seriousness of the cancer diagnosis; http://cebp.aacrjournals.org/content/26/5/719 Conclusions: These data support the hypothesis that perineural invasion creates a microenvironment that promotes cancer aggressiveness. Impact: Our findings suggest that PNI should be a standardized component of histopathologic review, and highlights a mechanism underlying prostate cancer metastasis. The opinion on PNI will probably continue to change as more about it is known. I have not had any radiation or HT therapy since my operation a year ago and it has not been recommended yet. Your doctor might not have mentioned it because like my doctor he wants to wait for the final path report. Anyway, you should ask him about it and get his thoughts. Good you are checking into radiation. There are different type of radiation treatment. I was offered HD Brachy treatment. I suggest you check into it if the RO you meet with does not offer it. One of our forum brothers, SubDenis has just had it and is very satisfied. On another note. That jump in PSA. Was the PSA test given after the DRE? If it was that would account for the rise. Other will chime in to welcome you and give their opinions. They are a great group of guys and gals that hang out here. Take care, Ed",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by Dave&Barb We just received the path report today, and noticed that one of the samples, a G7(4+3) mentioned \"perineural invasion present\". Quick bit of research shows some upsetting information, such as \"nerve sparing NOT recommended\", higher rate for mets, recommendation for surgery PLUS radiation, or radiation PLUS HT. Uro did not mention this on the initial diagnosis phone call, but I imagine he will address this at the appointment. Any thoughts or suggestions on what we should be thinking about or what to ask, will be appreciated. Trying to get our heads around everything, certainly a whirlwind. It's frightening to hear the C word. We've only just been together for 4 years, having lost our spouses both to cancer ten+ years ago. Thank you so much, Barb Barb, Welcome to the forum. I am sorry you have to be here and for your previous losses. Your husbands diagnosis is very similar to mine and nerve sparing was done on one side. The side that was thought to be cancer free. In the end some cancer was on that side and PNI was found in the final report after the operation. There is still debate about the significance of PNI but this 2017 study seems to indicate it raises the seriousness of the cancer diagnosis; http://cebp.aacrjournals.org/content/26/5/719 Conclusions: These data support the hypothesis that perineural invasion creates a microenvironment that promotes cancer aggressiveness. Impact: Our findings suggest that PNI should be a standardized component of histopathologic review, and highlights a mechanism underlying prostate cancer metastasis. The opinion on PNI will probably continue to change as more about it is known. I have not had any radiation or HT therapy since my operation a year ago and it has not been recommended yet. Your doctor might not have mentioned it because like my doctor he wants to wait for the final path report. Anyway, you should ask him about it and get his thoughts. Good you are checking into radiation. There are different type of radiation treatment. I was offered HD Brachy treatment. I suggest you check into it if the RO you meet with does not offer it. One of our forum brothers, SubDenis has just had it and is very satisfied. On another note. That jump in PSA. Was the PSA test given after the DRE? If it was that would account for the rise. Other will chime in to welcome you and give their opinions. They are a great group of guys and gals that hang out here. Take care, Ed",

I would absolutely love to be able to sleep throughout the whole night and if I am able to someday soon, that will be the second biggest benefit to me (besides getting rid of cancer) of having Prostate surgery. Tim Tim, I am 5 months out now and even though I did not have continence problems I did not hold a very large volume. It is only now getting back to normal. Right after the cath was removed the volume was OK. Then it got worse until now. I think it has to do with the healing and scare tissue that keeps the bladder from expanding easily at first. If that makes any sense. It sounds like your on a normal track. Ed",

Ahh, just curious. I don't know what prompted you to get PSA checks at such an early age but it's good you did. You caught it early and have every reason to expect a cure. I hope your surgery is being done by someone with a lot of experience. I think a minimum 300 operations is what the guys here recommend. You want the best you can get to try and minimize side effects. You can ask any questions you want and we will try to answer the best we can. Good luck. Ed",

There is also links to other clinical trial web sites. https://www.cancer.org/cancer/prosta...ecurrence.html Excerpt quote from site page: \"Several promising new medicines are now being tested against prostate cancer, including vaccines, monoclonal antibodies, and other new types of drugs. Because the ability to treat hormone-refractory prostate cancer is still not good enough, men are encouraged to explore new options by taking part in clinical trials.\" https://www.cancer.org/treatment/tre...al-trials.html Ed",

I reflected on my journey to date and was struck by the difficulty I had and time it took to get to a decision. What factors affected my decision? I did not like either surgery or HD brachy. + EBRT which were my main 2 options. As I got closer to the surgery date I started thinking of changing to the radiation but I realized when I analyzed why I wanted to change I was just wanting to kick the can down the road and if it was radiation I was getting ready to do I would have felt the same apprehension. That was a little piece of my journey. The good thing is when you get this done all this anxiety will be gone and you can get on with your life. You will be forever changed but I think for you, you will make it better than ever. Some have accused this site of being pro surgery. I would say it is not. It just is not hostile to surgery and to some that is the same as being for it. They are wrong. We cheer on and support the radiation options also but we also point out what we have learned about it and don't sugar coat it. Take care denis God bless and enjoy the holidays. Ed",

Or is he just not expressing the same feelings of concern that he had before? He just went through a life changing experience. Mortality is now very real and the brevity of life comes into sharp focus. I don't think anyone goes through this without some change. And it probably is not yet over in his mind. You are not certain of a cure for years. You might have to give him some time to get it sorted out. Most guys would say that the experience though has made them a better person overall.

      "Content": "The study was for one doctors patients. There does not seem to be much value in such a study other than for the one doctor. This study has more information: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4659370/ Jonathan I. Epstein,a,b,c,* Zhaoyong Feng,b Bruce J. Trock,b,c and Phillip M. Pieroraziob Final version: http://www.europeanurology.com/artic...168-6/fulltext Quotes from the study: \"Almost 20% of RP cases have tertiary patterns. A needle biopsy can sample a tertiary higher Gleason pattern in the RP, which is then not recorded in the standard GS reporting, resulting in an apparent overgrading on the needle biopsy.\" \"There are fewer studies examining the incidence of downgrading. Three studies looked at downgrading from GS 8−10 to ≤7 with results ranging from 29%, 40%, to 56% [15,17,22]. In the current study, 51.3% of GS 8 biopsies had a lower grade at RP. In cases with biopsy GS 9\u201310, 31.1% had RP grades ≤7. Moussa et al. recorded a 7.3% incidence of downgrading from GS 3 + 4 = 7 to GS ≤6 [14]. In the current study, 12.0% of cases diagnosed as 3 + 4 = 7 on biopsy had GS 5\u20136 at RP. One explanation for these cases is that tangentially sectioned small glands of pattern 3 on biopsy were overgraded as Gleason pattern 4. Alternatively, in some cases the assigned biopsy GS may have been accurate with such small foci of Gleason pattern 4 in the RP that it was either not recorded or unsampled deeper within the paraffin block. In cases with borderline GS 5\u20136 versus GS 3 + 4 = 7 on biopsy, it is probably better to diagnose the case as GS 6 because potential undergrading due to sampling error is more acceptable than overgrading due to grading error.\"",

Mortality is now very real and the brevity of life comes into sharp focus. I don't think anyone goes through this without some change. And it probably is not yet over in his mind. You are not certain of a cure for years. You might have to give him some time to get it sorted out. Most guys would say that the experience though has made them a better person overall. Strange but true.",

      "Content": "Hi Alan, Glad you found our forum but sorry you had to. That is an aggressive form you have there but if treated you can expect to die from something other than prostate cancer. You said you wanted the prostate removed but I would suggest you look into radiation if you have not already and especially HD Brachy. Having two major surgery's would be tough and you didn't say how urgent your kidney removal is but I don't believe you want to put off treating this form of prostate cancer for long and radiation treatment would limit it to one surgery. HD Brachy does involve surgery to place the seads but it is nothing like a radical prostatectomy. You should be definitely talking to an RO and probably an MO to figure out what to do. I am sure other will be talking to you here. They are a great group. Take care Ed",

      "Content": "Jeremy, I have had some pains that I did not have before since the operation. Neck, back etc. Most have been worked out through exercises now. I have had frozen shoulder and there were exercises like put a rope over a pulley in the basement and pull the arm up gradually for a couple of weeks to fix it. But I would see a physical therapist to get evaluated for the type of treatment/exercises you need so you don't damage it further. If it is just a frozen shoulder it won't usually get better by itself. You will just adapt to it.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by GMJJ Our local surgeon (who is chief of staff at the center) told us he has performed \"hundreds\" since 2009, but as another forum member pointed out, over an 8 year span that really isn't a lot. My surgeon hadn't down thousands but it was over a thousand. It was not a major cancer center either. More of a heart surgery center. It all turned out OK. If \"hundreds\" is 800 in 8 years that is 2 a week, every week. More than enough. If 200 or 300 maybe not that much. You might want to nail that number down. My uro offered to get me in touch with former patients but I did not take him up on it. I figured that I would only talk to success stories anyway but in retrospect it might have be a good idea if offered. Some people don't think it is important to like your doctor but for me life is too short to deal with doctors I don't like or who are jerks. I can find a doctor just as good or better than them that I can talk to and have good information exchange. I don't need the stress. Get there for those 2'nd opinions and make sure you have a good conversation with the radiation oncologist. Radiation has been shown to have good results with more aggressive cancers as you are dealing with (4+3) and is worth serious consideration. Just know that whatever he decides is right for him and keep going forward. I am sure you two have a lot of years ahead of you. Ed",

      "Content": "Thanks ASA. I posted from the source material. I was not sure you saw the edit to your post. I think this should be OK for the rules. https://www.santishealth.org/prostat...prostatectomy/ Having spent a week in Seoul visiting Professor Rha In June 2016, I performed the UK\u2019s first robotic Retzius-sparing radical prostatectomy on the 4th of July, and the UK\u2019s first laparoscopic Retzius-sparing radical prostatectomy three days later. To date, I have completed 20 Retzius-sparing cases and the results look very similar to those previously published for the technique: 100% of patients were either pad free (80%) or used one small safety liner per day (20%) at 4 weeks following surgery. By contrast, my last 100 conventional, non-Retzius results (which are considered to be excellent), 22% of patients were either pad free (12%) or used one small safety liner per day (10%) at 4 weeks following surgery. Potency results are awaited but the early results also look much better than following conventional surgery. Clearly, to go from 22% to 100% shows remarkable validation for this technique, and I look forward to sharing more of my results in the future. There is 1 year follow up link in the article. Not having the same results here in the states at Henry Ford Hospital though. It was suggested in the original article that the technique may be hard to learn. https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29225060 CONCLUSIONS: Amongst patients with clinically low-intermediate risk PCa randomized to anterior ('Menon') or posterior ('Bocciardi') approach RARP, differences in urinary continence seen at 3 months were muted at 12 months follow-up, while sexual function recovery, postoperative complications and biochemical recurrence rates were comparable 1-year postoperatively.

From day one the arrow was pointing down. I guess someone thought that was flow direction. But it is not. It is supposed to be turned to point to the cath. It will not lock in properly if pointed down. Just a friction fit that will come loose. When the hospital called on a follow up I gave them some constructive advise that their nurses get retrained and learn how to set up these devices. I almost never complain but a lot of people just assume the hospital has it set up right and thats how it should be done. Does not give one confidence to walk around the block if it is only being held there by a friction fit and the leg straps. Anyway onces I went to the Statlock site and read their PDF it all made sense. Again, thanks for the advice. Ed",

If you came through this with that thought it will last. On one of my first posts I mentioned a co-worker gave me a small sailboat when they found out what I was facing. Guys got cancer, lets give him a sailboat. But that boat kept me busy getting it ready for the day I would be physically able to sail it. I have never sailed in my life and the clubs lessons were all over for this year. So I went out about 3 weeks ago in fairly calm wind and started teaching myself to sail. Of course I read a lot also. Ok, third time out today and the wind is 15 gusting to 25. I was a little afraid to try it until I told myself ' look what you just went through and your not going to let a little water scare you or be afraid of making a fool of yourself in front of all these real sailors'. I went out and did it. And fairly well according to people who saw me. On my way back I stood up on the bow to throw a line to the wife and a gust came up, blew the boat over and me into the water. My pfd popped me up and I flipped the boat back upright and looked at the wife and we both started laughing. Not afraid anymore.",

Other than that the surgery after effects, pain etc are really nothing thats bothers me. Easier than I thought. The doctor from what he saw and checked he didn't think the cancer had not left the prostate. But we will know for sure when the report comes back. It was nerve sparing on the left side and he went wide on the right side due to the biopsy report to be safe. Walking around the block for exercise. Not a problem. Catheter not really a problem. So all in all It's good. Daughter came over this morning to mow the lawn and other family are gathering tomorrow to grill some burgers and dogs. I am really blessed. Thank you everyone for posting the experiences. It truly helped me.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by bigalcalbisque This whole experience has changed my outlook dramatically, I don't feel like I am afraid of anything anymore. I hope that lasts! If you came through this with that thought it will last. On one of my first posts I mentioned a co-worker gave me a small sailboat when they found out what I was facing. Guys got cancer, lets give him a sailboat. But that boat kept me busy getting it ready for the day I would be physically able to sail it. I have never sailed in my life and the clubs lessons were all over for this year. So I went out about 3 weeks ago in fairly calm wind and started teaching myself to sail. Of course I read a lot also. Ok, third time out today and the wind is 15 gusting to 25. I was a little afraid to try it until I told myself ' look what you just went through and your not going to let a little water scare you or be afraid of making a fool of yourself in front of all these real sailors'. I went out and did it. And fairly well according to people who saw me. On my way back I stood up on the bow to throw a line to the wife and a gust came up, blew the boat over and me into the water. My pfd popped me up and I flipped the boat back upright and looked at the wife and we both started laughing. Not afraid anymore.",

I called and after waiting for 20 minutes the lady came back and told me it was .1. I asked her is that .1 or <.1. She said it was good and anything less than .25 was good. I said no, its not good and I asked again if there was a less than sign ahead of that .1 and she said \"oh yeah there is a less than sign in front of it\". I told her to get that posted up in the portal so I could see it. Anyway I guess if your BG was high enough it might put you in a deeper sleep than normal. Also a couple of drinks before sleep could relax you a bit too much but it sounds like your on an average path and doing will. Thanks for the update. Take care. Ed",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by Nhlsir54 Any words of wisdom would be helpful. Nhsir, Sorry your going through another cancer episode but you have found a good place to talk to men who have been through this. Surgery has it's down sides. But so does radiation. A recent study out of Toronto says this: CONCLUSIONS: Radiotherapy for prostate cancer is associated with an increased risk of overall and prostate cancer-specific mortality compared with surgery based on observational data with low to moderate risk of bias. These data, combined with the forthcoming randomized data, may aid clinical decision making. https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26700655 Another quote from https://www.cancer.org/latest-news/s...treatment.html Two years and 5 years after treatment, men in the prostatectomy group were significantly more likely than those in the radiation group to report urinary leakage and erectile dysfunction. But the problems increased in both groups over time, and 15 years after treatment, the likelihood of having these side effects was similar between the 2 groups. At 15 years, almost all the men reported having erection problems \u2013 87 percent in the prostatectomy group and 93.9 percent in the radiation group. So you see, any treatment choice we need to make to save our lives can take a toll and we just don't know for sure how it will affect us. Unfortunately the decision is more subjective than most of us are comfortable with. But anyway; As to your situation. You are young and your 3+3 may need more investigation because you could be a candidate for Active Surveillance. If not active surveillance than with treatment you have every reason to expect a cure since you have caught this fairly early. I will let others speak to that and other tests you may want to ask for to figure out what to do. There are guys on AS here and others that are very knowledgeable. But obviously not medical personal. Your medical team should be your main go to people for direction. People here though would normally suggest you get a second opinion on that biopsy at a minimum.

I still don't sleep like a rock like I used to, 6 months later, but it is getting better. Everybody is different and you will have your own unique experience. Things change during the healing. Pee flow rates (pee flow rates?) can change, pains pop up here and there etc etc, but everyday should get better and you will probably even forget about it for stretches at a time.

      "Content": "Originally Posted by keeptrying I'm 63 years old and recently got a PSA reading of 6.4 (17.2% free) with a negative DRE as per my very experienced Primary Care Physician. Values 17 months earlier were 3.4 and 18.5%, and all prior results were 3.6 or lower. I don't know the PSA density. I'm REALLY hoping to avoid a biopsy if possible. Welcome keeptrying to the forum, It is ok to hope to avoid a biopsy. Just don't try to avoid one if needed, obviously. Your free PSA indicates a 20% chance of cancer. But a free psa of .25 is the trigger point that would suggest a biopsy is the next step for you IF other reasons cannot explain the PSA rise. BPH, prostatitis, urinary tract infection, etc. So take it one step and a time and if a biopsy is needed so be it. But I think a second PSA test will probably be done and the doctor will look at the other conditions that can cause a rise in PSA before you get there. For most a biopsy is a mere bother but there are risks like all invasive procedures. Here a a discussion of the risks of biopsy. The data is varied, like most things pCA. Risks of biopsy \u0097 Although early reports indicated that prostate biopsies very rarely (<1 percent) caused complications (eg, bleeding, infection) serious enough to require hospitalization [132], subsequent studies suggest both higher rates of infectious complications and that the rate of infectious complications may be increasing over time [133-136]. Hospitalization rates for infectious complications in these studies have ranged from 0.6 to 4.1 percent [135]. Infectious complications can lead to sepsis, which can very rarely lead to death. A modeling study, assuming a biopsy mortality rate of 0.2 percent [137], concluded that prostate cancer screening could be associated with a net increased overall mortality, particularly under the conditions that biopsy rates are high and screening is relatively ineffective [138]. However, other studies have suggested much lower mortality rates following biopsy [135]. Population-based studies include an analysis of United States Medicare data that found a mortality rate of 0.3 percent in the 30 days following biopsy; this was actually 70 percent lower than the 30-day mortality in a comparison population not undergoing biopsy [133]. An analysis of registry data from Canada found a 30-day mortality rate of 0.09 percent [134]. Randomized trials with follow-up on 1147 biopsies [139], and 10,474 biopsies [140], reported no biopsy-related deaths. Other potential harms from prostate biopsy (eg, bleeding or urinary obstruction) are discussed elsewhere. (See \"Prostate biopsy\", section on 'Complications'.) Prostate biopsy can also lead to anxiety and physical discomfort [141]. Among 116 men undergoing biopsy in the Rotterdam screening study, 55 percent reported discomfort with the procedure, including 2 percent who had pain persisting longer than one week. Being diagnosed with prostate cancer is psychologically distressing, but even patients with a negative biopsy result may be distressed [142,143]. Chronic anxiety can follow a negative prostate biopsy because this apparently favorable result cannot completely rule out prostate cancer given the relatively high false-negative biopsy rate [144]. https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sc...rostate-cancer Don't stress and keep doing the next steps required. Take care, Ed",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by keeptrying I'm 63 years old and recently got a PSA reading of 6.4 (17.2% free) with a negative DRE as per my very experienced Primary Care Physician. Values 17 months earlier were 3.4 and 18.5%, and all prior results were 3.6 or lower. I don't know the PSA density. I'm REALLY hoping to avoid a biopsy if possible. Welcome keeptrying to the forum, It is ok to hope to avoid a biopsy. Just don't try to avoid one if needed, obviously. Your free PSA indicates a 20% chance of cancer. But a free psa of .25 is the trigger point that would suggest a biopsy is the next step for you IF other reasons cannot explain the PSA rise. BPH, prostatitis, urinary tract infection, etc. So take it one step and a time and if a biopsy is needed so be it. But I think a second PSA test will probably be done and the doctor will look at the other conditions that can cause a rise in PSA before you get there. For most a biopsy is a mere bother but there are risks like all invasive procedures. Here a a discussion of the risks of biopsy. The data is varied, like most things pCA. Risks of biopsy \u0097 Although early reports indicated that prostate biopsies very rarely (<1 percent) caused complications (eg, bleeding, infection) serious enough to require hospitalization [132], subsequent studies suggest both higher rates of infectious complications and that the rate of infectious complications may be increasing over time [133-136]. Hospitalization rates for infectious complications in these studies have ranged from 0.6 to 4.1 percent [135]. Infectious complications can lead to sepsis, which can very rarely lead to death. A modeling study, assuming a biopsy mortality rate of 0.2 percent [137], concluded that prostate cancer screening could be associated with a net increased overall mortality, particularly under the conditions that biopsy rates are high and screening is relatively ineffective [138]. However, other studies have suggested much lower mortality rates following biopsy [135]. Population-based studies include an analysis of United States Medicare data that found a mortality rate of 0.3 percent in the 30 days following biopsy; this was actually 70 percent lower than the 30-day mortality in a comparison population not undergoing biopsy [133]. An analysis of registry data from Canada found a 30-day mortality rate of 0.09 percent [134]. Randomized trials with follow-up on 1147 biopsies [139], and 10,474 biopsies [140], reported no biopsy-related deaths. Other potential harms from prostate biopsy (eg, bleeding or urinary obstruction) are discussed elsewhere. (See \"Prostate biopsy\", section on 'Complications'.) Prostate biopsy can also lead to anxiety and physical discomfort [141]. Among 116 men undergoing biopsy in the Rotterdam screening study, 55 percent reported discomfort with the procedure, including 2 percent who had pain persisting longer than one week. Being diagnosed with prostate cancer is psychologically distressing, but even patients with a negative biopsy result may be distressed [142,143]. Chronic anxiety can follow a negative prostate biopsy because this apparently favorable result cannot completely rule out prostate cancer given the relatively high false-negative biopsy rate [144]. https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sc...rostate-cancer Don't stress and keep doing the next steps required. Take care, Ed",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by Nhlsir54 Any words of wisdom would be helpful. Nhsir, Sorry your going through another cancer episode but you have found a good place to talk to men who have been through this. Surgery has it's down sides. But so does radiation. A recent study out of Toronto says this: CONCLUSIONS: Radiotherapy for prostate cancer is associated with an increased risk of overall and prostate cancer-specific mortality compared with surgery based on observational data with low to moderate risk of bias. These data, combined with the forthcoming randomized data, may aid clinical decision making. https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26700655 Another quote from https://www.cancer.org/latest-news/s...treatment.html Two years and 5 years after treatment, men in the prostatectomy group were significantly more likely than those in the radiation group to report urinary leakage and erectile dysfunction. But the problems increased in both groups over time, and 15 years after treatment, the likelihood of having these side effects was similar between the 2 groups. At 15 years, almost all the men reported having erection problems \u2013 87 percent in the prostatectomy group and 93.9 percent in the radiation group. So you see, any treatment choice we need to make to save our lives can take a toll and we just don't know for sure how it will affect us. Unfortunately the decision is more subjective than most of us are comfortable with. But anyway; As to your situation. You are young and your 3+3 may need more investigation because you could be a candidate for Active Surveillance. If not active surveillance than with treatment you have every reason to expect a cure since you have caught this fairly early. I will let others speak to that and other tests you may want to ask for to figure out what to do. There are guys on AS here and others that are very knowledgeable. But obviously not medical personal. Your medical team should be your main go to people for direction. People here though would normally suggest you get a second opinion on that biopsy at a minimum. Again, Welcome and stay tuned for more input. Ed",

      "Content": "Thank you everyone for your comments. And Chuck I use the MrEd moniker as a sign in to important places like this. It was my fathers name he was called by his friends down in Florida where he had a biker bar for many years and it is kind of my way to honer him. But I get the talking horse thing. I guess most all here remember that show. I kinda like the connection. I decided to go with the surgery and it is scheduled for the 28, next Wednesday. The HD Brachy and radiation sounded good also. It was a hard choice. The RO said he was sure whatever I chose would work out good for me. I am planning for the future. A co-worker and her husband gave me a small sailboat, A Mirror dinghy. Her father had radiation therapy 10 years ago and she thought I would enjoy sailing. I have only sailed catamaran type boats a little and am looking forward to giving this a try. I live by oodles of lakes including the big ones. I should have done this sooner. Probably not this year though given the situation. But who knows. I was amazed at how many people have been touched by prostate cancer. I was quite open about it with friends and co-workers and when I told them what I had been diagnosed with they came out of the woodworks with their personal stories. I told my little brother who is 52 and 6 inches taller than me, about my diagnosis and asked him if he had a PSA test when he had his last physical and blood work done a couple of months ago. He said he would check and when he asked his doctor the doctors reply was. \"what for?\" He explained why and the doctor said OK. Don't know the results yet but it seems to me a lot of people are going to be hurt by this trend in medicine to downplay the PSA tests.. Glad my PCP decided I better get one. I guess the insurance companies don't like the biopsy costs because of false positives, but still, is this only a numbers game? I will post back here after the operation. In the mean time I have a boat to get ready. Ed",

      "Content": "First off I want to say thanks to all that take their own time to post here. I have been reading the site now for the last few week and it has helped me so much to understand PCa, what I should be asking and doing. The attitudes and friendliness I have seen is rare and I am pretty sure I am in a better state of mind because of all of you here. I am married, grown kids and just retired on Monday, Been planned for 6 months. I have met with the Uro and RO and discussed options. The Uro talked to me about surgary. He is the person I was refereed to and has done over 1000 DaVinci procedures The RO talked to me about Brachy plus IMRT. I will meet with both doctors of them on Monday to answer some additional questions and make a decision. I think where I am at it's pick my poison and see what happens. Neither option is a clear winner for me though I am leaning to surgery, a lot of which is because of my confidence in the doctor, despite the 34% confined partin table stat. The hospital system is Beaumont in southeast MI. I live about 3 miles from there. Any comments, suggestions are of course welcome. Oh, and yes this was my first PSA test. Ed",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by Bholmes Not sure what to expect so any words would be greatly appreciated! Bholmes, For most of us the biopsy was just uncomfortable and after the initial needle \"pinch\" we did not feel much. Like any medical procedure where they are poking needles into you, especially through the rectum, there is a chance of infection. Severe enough to end back up in the hospital so don't delay calling your doctor if you have a fever or other symptoms that should be listed on an instruction sheet given to you before you leave the doctors office. You will have blood in the urine and semen for days afterwards. That was high at 14 but that drop to 9 is not something cancer will normally do. It could be an infection or maybe a combination of cancer and an infection causing havoc with the prostate. And as Rob pointed out there are false negatives. In other words the needles missed finding anything on the first try. Stay positive and take it one step at a time and don't assume the worst. Good chance it may well not be cancer. Ed",
