      "Content": "Originally Posted by wolfgang I am really sorry to hear that your PSA number has elevated after the prostate surgery. The PSA findings in the blood may come from prostate tumors only. The abbreviation comes from Prostate Specific Antigen so your blood test results indicate that some leftovers from the originating tumor are still releasing such antigens in your blood. Only special tests like biopsy or imaging may detect now what exactly is going on in your body and to what extent your PCa has spread. The initial tests that detected the existing PCa that led to your prostatectomy were very important to tell the surgeon what had to be removed at the time of the surgery. My biopsy results were devastating, I had most aggressive malignant tumor in my prostate (Gleason score 4+5) which required immediate radical prostatectomy and everything around that might be affected with such an aggressive tumor. Besides the prostate and seminal vesicles, they had removed 22 lymph nodes. Everything removed was sent to detailed pathology examining in order to categorize the PCa stage and to anticipate the further healing process. You lack of more detailed tests, what was found and what was expected in future. I hope that after more tests are done you'll have more clear picture what options you have toward your healing. Right now without those test results it is difficult to say what are those options, even for more educated person as your doctor is. thank you for your respond.After I do biopsy and MRI , I,ll be here. Do you think this is cancer? Is it possible not to be cancer ?",

Only special tests like biopsy or imaging may detect now what exactly is going on in your body and to what extent your PCa has spread. The initial tests that detected the existing PCa that led to your prostatectomy were very important to tell the surgeon what had to be removed at the time of the surgery. My biopsy results were devastating, I had most aggressive malignant tumor in my prostate (Gleason score 4+5) which required immediate radical prostatectomy and everything around that might be affected with such an aggressive tumor. Besides the prostate and seminal vesicles, they had removed 22 lymph nodes. Everything removed was sent to detailed pathology examining in order to categorize the PCa stage and to anticipate the further healing process. You lack of more detailed tests, what was found and what was expected in future. I hope that after more tests are done you'll have more clear picture what options you have toward your healing.

      "Content": "Originally Posted by wolfgang I am really sorry to hear that your PSA number has elevated after the prostate surgery. The PSA findings in the blood may come from prostate tumors only. The abbreviation comes from Prostate Specific Antigen so your blood test results indicate that some leftovers from the originating tumor are still releasing such antigens in your blood. Only special tests like biopsy or imaging may detect now what exactly is going on in your body and to what extent your PCa has spread. The initial tests that detected the existing PCa that led to your prostatectomy were very important to tell the surgeon what had to be removed at the time of the surgery. My biopsy results were devastating, I had most aggressive malignant tumor in my prostate (Gleason score 4+5) which required immediate radical prostatectomy and everything around that might be affected with such an aggressive tumor. Besides the prostate and seminal vesicles, they had removed 22 lymph nodes. Everything removed was sent to detailed pathology examining in order to categorize the PCa stage and to anticipate the further healing process. You lack of more detailed tests, what was found and what was expected in future. I hope that after more tests are done you'll have more clear picture what options you have toward your healing. Right now without those test results it is difficult to say what are those options, even for more educated person as your doctor is. thank you for your respond.After I do biopsy and MRI , I,ll be here. Do you think this is cancer? Is it possible not to be cancer ?",

If you had removal then you may have to consider Salvage Radiation if they think cancer is still in the prostate bed. Good luck.

      "Content": "Originally Posted by Hope2012 Unfortunately we are not medical professionals here, so we can't tell you what you are looking for. If you cant talk to you doctor about the side effects, can you go to your local drug store and talk to a pharmacist? They are usually trained in the side effects of medications. Good luck. Thank you.I asked from pharmacists but they don,t know about it!!! and say only doctors can tell you about it and doctors say we dont have enough time for explain.that is the reason I ask this question here. I read about your father and I'm really sorry for events that occurred.I can only repeat your quotation \"This dark night shall end and the sun will rise again... Believe\" Thank you",
