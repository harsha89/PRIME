      "Content": "62-years old and I suddenly find myself on the prostate cancer (or maybe not) conveyor belt and would appreciate any informed points of view. It started last spring when I underwent a physical, and the doc included a PSA test in the routine bloodwork. Honestly, I wasn't even aware that he ordered the test, which was my first. The result came in at 4.4. He recommended that I see a urologist right away for a consultation. I declined, figuring that at minimum I'd wait until, say, my next physical and another PSA score. Meanwhile, a DRE found no abnormalities but a \"very large\" prostate. And in fact, I've had the classic symptoms of BPH, though it's never been formally diagnosed as such, for many years now. Well my plan to hold off on the urologist was rudely interrupted in December when I woke up one morning to find a fair amount of blood in the bed, on my legs, and so forth. It had come from the urethra and was NOT mixed with urine. In fact, there was zero blood in the urine. The episode ended up being a one-day thing, but it did kind of force my hand on seeing a urologist who, weeks later, performed a cystoscopy, which, fortunately, was largely normal. One inflamed area was seen but no tumors or anything bad. The doc was pretty confident that the bleeding, whatever caused it, was NOT a result of prostate cancer. But seeing the 4.4 from 2016, he definitely wanted to run the PSA again just on general principles, and it came back at 5.9. So of course he's talking biopsy, and I do understand his reasoning. But my son is getting married in June, so I asked him whether it would be safe to just delay everything until, say, July and do another PSA then before deciding on a biopsy. He said that course of action was probably safe, though he preferred to get the ball rolling sooner than that with, at minimum, a variety of blood tests, to include the PSA. But in the end, we agreed to hold off, and I have an appointment in early July for bloodwork and a follow-up consultation. So the thing is, honestly, unless that PSA number in July is, like, significantly elevated again, I think I will NOT be real inclined to go down the biopsy road immediately. For example, if it comes back in the vicinity of the 4's, 5's, or even low 6's. So I don't know, I'd appreciate any other opinions on this, and thanks much in advance.",

      "Content": "62-years old and I suddenly find myself on the prostate cancer (or maybe not) conveyor belt and would appreciate any informed points of view. It started last spring when I underwent a physical, and the doc included a PSA test in the routine bloodwork. Honestly, I wasn't even aware that he ordered the test, which was my first. The result came in at 4.4. He recommended that I see a urologist right away for a consultation. I declined, figuring that at minimum I'd wait until, say, my next physical and another PSA score. Meanwhile, a DRE found no abnormalities but a \"very large\" prostate. And in fact, I've had the classic symptoms of BPH, though it's never been formally diagnosed as such, for many years now. Well my plan to hold off on the urologist was rudely interrupted in December when I woke up one morning to find a fair amount of blood in the bed, on my legs, and so forth. It had come from the urethra and was NOT mixed with urine. In fact, there was zero blood in the urine. The episode ended up being a one-day thing, but it did kind of force my hand on seeing a urologist who, weeks later, performed a cystoscopy, which, fortunately, was largely normal. One inflamed area was seen but no tumors or anything bad. The doc was pretty confident that the bleeding, whatever caused it, was NOT a result of prostate cancer. But seeing the 4.4 from 2016, he definitely wanted to run the PSA again just on general principles, and it came back at 5.9. So of course he's talking biopsy, and I do understand his reasoning. But my son is getting married in June, so I asked him whether it would be safe to just delay everything until, say, July and do another PSA then before deciding on a biopsy. He said that course of action was probably safe, though he preferred to get the ball rolling sooner than that with, at minimum, a variety of blood tests, to include the PSA. But in the end, we agreed to hold off, and I have an appointment in early July for bloodwork and a follow-up consultation. So the thing is, honestly, unless that PSA number in July is, like, significantly elevated again, I think I will NOT be real inclined to go down the biopsy road immediately. For example, if it comes back in the vicinity of the 4's, 5's, or even low 6's. So I don't know, I'd appreciate any other opinions on this, and thanks much in advance.",

      "Content": "I'm on an aggressive screening regime -- colonoscopies every two years -- for colon cancer because of a very bad history of that disease on my Dad's side of the family. In fact, I had one in November, just a few months before prostate surgery. None of the urology docs seemed to take much note of the issue in the lead-up to the surgery. Maybe if I'd opted for radiation it would have become more of a thing, as per Rob's experience above. Simple garden-variety polyps, as most of them are, are ordinarily no big deal at all. A zap with the colonoscope, and they're removed in a few seconds. I'm not sure why that would be a complicating factor in your situation, but the doc knows best. One thing of note: when I informed the colorectal doc of the prostate cancer diagnosis and said I was evaluating treatment options, he did raise one potential problem and that was not polyps but rather hemorrhoids. He said prostate RT can create problems in that area. Therefore, he recommended getting any hemorrhoids \"taken care of,\" whatever that means, before RT. Since I ended up going with surgery, all this proved kind of academic for me. As for the recommendation to get a colonoscopy, just on general principles it's a good idea once you reach a certain age. The vast majority of colon tumors start as polyps, which typically take many years to become cancerous. Remove the polyp, and you remove the threat.",

      "Content": "I understand what you're saying, and I respect the love and devotion that underlies it. Listen, I once knew a man who was 41 years old, a one-time star athlete and former Marine officer, who was struck down by cancer and in the space of six months went from the picture of health to a shell of a human being, skin stretched thin over bones, a hole in his abdomen to let waste out of his body, the last two days of his life spent in unspeakable agony...until he was mercifully released from this world. I heard his young wife say she did not think she could go on, could not bear to watch her husband reduced to a person she could barely recognize, could not understand how the God she worshipped her whole life could allow such an unthinkable thing to happen. I walked into a bedroom on the day the man died, with his wife paralyzed by grief, to find the man's daughters, aged 11 and 9, sobbing on the floor and repeating over and over: It's not fair...it's not fair...it's not fair. And it wasn't fair. It wasn't fair at all. The man was my father. His wife was my mother. The two little girls were my sisters. My Mom didn't think she could watch her husband die...didn't think she could raise the kids without him...didn't see how she could survive the ordeal and really didn't want to. But she didn't give up. She didn't give in. She kept fighting. And she survived. So did her four children...though none of them were ever quite the same. Believe me, Nancy, it can be done, and if you have faith, you will do it.",

      "Content": "I understand what you're saying, and I respect the love and devotion that underlies it. Listen, I once knew a man who was 41 years old, a one-time star athlete and former Marine officer, who was struck down by cancer and in the space of six months went from the picture of health to a shell of a human being, skin stretched thin over bones, a hole in his abdomen to let waste out of his body, the last two days of his life spent in unspeakable agony...until he was mercifully released from this world. I heard his young wife say she did not think she could go on, could not bear to watch her husband reduced to a person she could barely recognize, could not understand how the God she worshipped her whole life could allow such an unthinkable thing to happen. I walked into a bedroom on the day the man died, with his wife paralyzed by grief, to find the man's daughters, aged 11 and 9, sobbing on the floor and repeating over and over: It's not fair...it's not fair...it's not fair. And it wasn't fair. It wasn't fair at all. The man was my father. His wife was my mother. The two little girls were my sisters. My Mom didn't think she could watch her husband die...didn't think she could raise the kids without him...didn't see how she could survive the ordeal and really didn't want to. But she didn't give up. She didn't give in. She kept fighting. And she survived. So did her four children...though none of them were ever quite the same. Believe me, Nancy, it can be done, and if you have faith, you will do it.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by Allmo But tell me what you believe? To quote my favorite character from Star Trek, Dr. Spock: Fascinating! The BMJ numbers track pretty well with the USPSTF study that produced the controversial 2012 recommendation to ditch PSA testing. Still, it should be noted that other research, plus a variety of anecdotal evidence such as the experience of large urology practices, PLUS even the findings of both the BMJ and USPSTF, support a conclusion that the elimination of PSA testing will result in -- and has already resulted in -- an increased incidence of advanced prostate cancer in the general population. The BMJ and USPSTF peg that number as relatively low -- 3 in 1000. Other data would probably make it higher. The first doc I saw, who specialized in prostate cancer at a very large urology practice in Maryland, said they were definitely seeing more advanced-stage cases during the last few years the USPSTF guidelines from 2012 were in effect. At the end of the day, it all adds up, in my view, to a good argument for your Door Number Two, Allmo: that is, smart screening. Where the option is on the table for guys ages 50-69, and they themselves make educated choices based on the informed input of their GP's as to the risk-benefit tradeoffs. Some guys will choose to be tested. Some guys won't. Personally, I wasn't given the option. I described symptoms of BPH to my GP during an annual physical, and he ordered up the PSA test as part of the standard regime of bloodwork associated with the physical. I didn't even know about it until getting a phone call the following week advising that my reading (4.4) was borderline for my age. If the doc had given me the whole risk-benefit spiel, I might well have said no thanks, the biases of my own personality being what they are. In that case, I'd be blithely walking around with high-grade prostate cancer. In other words, in all likelihood I'd have been one of those three guys from the BMJ and USPSTF data. It's like they say: there's lies, there's damn lies, and then there's statistics. You can usually make statistics support any case you want to argue. That seems to be so here. Which takes us back to the question of why not allow guys to make their own informed choice. That's where the USPSTF came down earlier this year. And I think they got it right. Finally.",

      "Content": "Wow, I don't know who this guy, Dr. Blitz, is but if his surgical skills and experience are on par with the level of his diagnostic judgment and treatment advice, which is not guaranteed to be the case, I'd say you've got a very good doc, Sailor. In any case, I'd say his guidance is spot-on. However, keep in mind that there's a big difference between Gleason-7's (3-4, \"favorable\") and Gleason 7's (4-3, \"unfavorable\"). For a guy in his 70's, there's a strong argument to be made that treating the former with surgery or radiation doesn't make a lot of sense. As for the latter (or worse), well, that would come down to individual judgment. Either way, your wife is quite right to believe it would be better to hold off the purchase of the racing boat!",

      "Content": "Devorie, Chuck and the regulars here know a lot more about all this than I, but here are a few thoughts based on some research I wish I never had to do and some experience I wish I never had to have. First, as the others have said, more information would be very helpful. In the meantime, however, a crucial question is whether the cancer has spread outside the prostate -- either \"locally\" in the vicinity of the prostate or to a distant site in the body. If it has spread, then you can pretty much take prostatectomy off the table. The presence of Gleason 9 increases the chance that the malignancy has spread but by no means makes it certain. For example, my own G-9 was revealed, by unpleasant surprise, in the pathology report, which otherwise indicated that the disease was \"organ-confined\" -- meaning located entirely within the prostate. (Unfortunately, cancerous cells could still have escaped, undetected, before surgery and lodged elsewhere. If that happens, sooner or later the post-op PSA will reflect it.) That said, even if you could know that your dad's cancer were limited to the prostate, there are some studies -- see the link right below -- suggesting that radiation combined with hormone treatment is a better option for high-risk disease. And G-9, by definition, fits the category of high-risk. (With low- and intermediate-risk, on the other hand, all the data indicate the outcomes are more or less equal with respect to surgery versus radiation.) https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5002992/ Then again, in younger patients (say, 60 years old or below) docs often advise against radiation because of concern about long-term effects on organs in the vicinity of the prostate. Still, there have been huge advances in the technology and methodology of radiation delivery in recent years. The targeting is much more precise and the possible harm much less. Regarding side effects, keep in mind that if your dad goes the radiation route, he will almost certainly be administered hormone therapy as well. That's a big-time factor in the department of side effects. In the run-up to my surgery early this year, I consulted two radiation oncologists, one of them at Johns Hopkins, both very experienced in the treatment of prostate cancer. I was told by each of them that the most drastic urinary side effect, namely incontinence, seldom happens with radiation. However, there are sometimes lesser issues like a burning-type feeling when urinating, more frequent urination, more urgent urination, and so forth. I was also told that sundry bowel issues, usually not crippling or anything, can occur but typically resolve after treatment is completed. Regarding ED, the trigger will be more the hormone treatment than radiation itself. And generally, said both, a guy's looking at complete loss of libido and pretty much total ED for a long period of time -- maybe permanently. (Unfortunately, there are an array of other possible side effects stemming from hormones.) As far as continuing to work, I was told emphatically that it wouldn't be a problem. And I know at least one guy who worked the whole time while undergoing radiation. He stopped at the doc's office for treatment every morning over the course of, like, eight weeks and then proceeded directly to the job. That's not to say that he always felt at the top of his game. But he could manage. Well, there's a lot more that could be said, but this covers the main bases I think. You can find a tremendous amount of information on-line. In conclusion, you should know, and so should your dad, that though it's a bit of a shock to a person's system to get this diagnosis, prostate cancer is usually a manageable -- and very often curable -- disease. Guys can...and do...live a very long time with it. There's every reason to hope that your dad will be one of them.",

      "Content": "Yolli, re Pinto, I agree with Gary. His credentials are excellent, and he holds a high-profile position at a premier institution, but the key question is how many RPs has he done overall and how many in an average week. For surgery like this, you need a very experienced doc with a proven track record. Preferably, you'd like some idea of stats on positive margins, side effects (short- and long-term), and success in eradicating the cancer. It would also be helpful to be able to talk to some prostate patients of his, which the doc's office should be willing to provide. No question, up the road from D.C., at Hopkins, you've got one of the top urology departments in the country, with one of the highest annual volumes of prostate surgery. Also an array of outstanding docs, though it should be noted that even at a place like Hopkins there can be differences in skill levels among the surgeons. I mean, granted, you ain't gonna run into any slouches there, but the Hopkins name itself does not automatically turn a guy into an ace. My own very unscientific take, based on research I did and input I got, is that Allaf is definitely one of the top people in the RALP department and for open RP -- Carter. That's not to say they're THE best because I don't know. They might or might not be. But at the very least, they're both very good and have each done well over 2,000 of the procedures. Some guys there will do either robotic or open surgery. But generally everyone's experience and expertise lie in one arena or the other. And in my experience with docs, you really don't want a guy whose main expertise and comfort level is open surgery doing the laparoscopic/robotic variety. Or vice versa. Many of the old hands like Carter swear by the open method and have their reasons for doing so. But the fact is, robotic is rapidly becoming the standard approach. Effectiveness is pretty much the same -- IF the docs are good. On the other hand, there are some clinical advantages to robotic: typically less blood loss, faster overall recovery, significantly fewer instances of one particular potential post-surgical complication, namely urethral strictures. Again, however, none of it means anything if the doc is not top-notch. Therefore, you're absolutely right to ask and research that question.",

      "Content": "Stick with almonds, guys: >>Consumption of tree nuts is associated with lower mortality rates among men with prostate cancer...\u201cThis is important since more men live with prostate cancer than die from it,\u201d said Ying Bao, MD, ScD, from the Department of Medicine, Brigham and Women\u2019s Hospital and Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts, and senior author of this study. Published in the British Journal of Cancer, the study examined the potential correlation between eating tree nuts and prostate cancer risk and in 47,299 men in the Health Professionals Follow-up Study. Of the total cohort, prostate cancer was diagnosed in 6810 men during 26 years of follow-up. Of the men with prostate cancer, 4346 had nonmetastatic disease. The consumption of tree nuts was not associated with a reduced risk of developing prostate cancer. However, overall mortality was 34% lower in men who consumed tree nuts (eg, almonds, cashews, macadamias, pine nuts, and walnuts) at least 5 times per week after a prostate cancer diagnosis compared with men who consumed tree nuts less than once per month (HR=0.66, 95% CI: 0.52-0.83, P for trend = .0005).<< When the study was published in mid-2016, the headlines splashed to the effect that the consumption of almonds in particular -- one ounce 5 times a week -- appeared to be associated with a fully 34% reduction in the mortality rate among men already diagnosed with prostate cancer. (There was no observed effect on the chances of actually developing the disease.) A close look at the fine print, however, suggested no effect on PCa-specific mortality rate either. Just the overall rate of death. Leaving a person to ask whether the real story is simply that these nuts benefit overall health. In other words, if they ran the study on 47,000 guys with a diagnosis of, say, colon cancer, would the same results obtain. Oh well, I'm covering my bases anyway and have been consuming an ounce of almonds (exactly 28 of the scrumptious nuts) every day for lunch since I was diagnosed in the summer of 2017. So I'm almost two years down the road of the study's 26-year timeframe, still alive, and feeling fine. I'll check back in 24 years to report how it worked out. P.S. By the way, the little buggers are excellent weight-loss aids as well. One ounce, which can serve as lunch in itself, is highly nutritious, low in carbs, and surprisingly filling.",

The consumption of tree nuts was not associated with a reduced risk of developing prostate cancer. However, overall mortality was 34% lower in men who consumed tree nuts (eg, almonds, cashews, macadamias, pine nuts, and walnuts) at least 5 times per week after a prostate cancer diagnosis compared with men who consumed tree nuts less than once per month (HR=0.66, 95% CI: 0.52-0.83, P for trend = .0005).<< When the study was published in mid-2016, the headlines splashed to the effect that the consumption of almonds in particular -- one ounce 5 times a week -- appeared to be associated with a fully 34% reduction in the mortality rate among men already diagnosed with prostate cancer. (There was no observed effect on the chances of actually developing the disease.) A close look at the fine print, however, suggested no effect on PCa-specific mortality rate either.

In other words, if they ran the study on 47,000 guys with a diagnosis of, say, colon cancer, would the same results obtain. Oh well, I'm covering my bases anyway and have been consuming an ounce of almonds (exactly 28 of the scrumptious nuts) every day for lunch since I was diagnosed in the summer of 2017. So I'm almost two years down the road of the study's 26-year timeframe, still alive, and feeling fine. I'll check back in 24 years to report how it worked out. P.S. By the way, the little buggers are excellent weight-loss aids as well. One ounce, which can serve as lunch in itself, is highly nutritious, low in carbs, and surprisingly filling.",

On the other hand, there's a scene in Big Jake where, right before John Wayne rides in to a fateful confrontation with the Bad Guys, his Indian-guy sidekick expresses the hope that they'll both live to hunt elk in Montana but wishes they were hunting buffalo like in the old days. And the Duke says: Yeah, times change. Yes, they do. And how! For everyone. But it's all good. If you love a woman and she loves you, you're a lucky man. And on the other end of the ordeal, if you love one another, the both of you will be fine. Because sex is great -- I'm a big fan of it -- but it's love that counts.",

      "Content": "Interesting list and not many major surprises there. Well, one or two maybe. But I'm surprised there was no mention of tree nuts after that much-publicized (and very reputable) study a couple years ago suggesting that a mere ounce of tree nuts -- for example: hazelnuts, cashews, almonds, pistachios, and a variety of others -- reduces the mortality risk from prostate cancer by more than 30 percent! Go figure. Anyway, hard to believe, but see the link below. We're talking Harvard Medical and the British Journal of Cancer here. Not exactly fringe institutions. So I have dutifully been consuming one ounce of almonds every day for lunch for the last 18 months. So far it's gotten me a G-9 cancer score. Haha! Just kidding. Who knows, without the almonds maybe things would have been a lot worse! Maybe I'd be history by now! In any case, here's the link: http://prostatecancer911.com/what-ef...ostate-cancer/",

Your husband is slightly earlier, but if the doc is comfortable with it, based on how surgery went, then everything should be fine. I started with Depends and used them for several days. Then, it was Poise brand pads, which come in various sizes and strengths. I understand that Tena brand is also popular and works very well. All this stuff can be ordered on Amazon and delivered to your doorstep in short order. In addition, the Amazon option comes with lots of user reviews, which may be helpful. Hang in there! The first weeks are the most challenging. Improvement typically occurs on a steady trajectory -- over the course of days, weeks, or months. The watchword at Hopkins is \"patience.\"",

On the other hand, that 4.1 number, though concerning, is not alarmingly high, while the 4K markers propose only an 8% chance of intermediate-grade cancer -- not negligible but still pretty darn low, to the point where the doc is not overly concerned and is not pressing for the early biopsy. A single biopsy is generally safe but not entirely risk-free and far from certain in its own diagnostic value -- there is a fairly high false negative rate -- though still the only tool available for clinically detecting prostate cancer.

      "Content": "Murph, Another asks some good questions. Are there aggravating factors or circumstances that led to the PSA draw and follow-on diagnostic testing? That aside, the MRI is a very useful tool -- critical in my case -- but it's far from infallible. Of course, the same holds true for a biopsy. Regarding the endocoil, there's a school of thought holding this variant to be NOT superior to a regular (non-endocoil) MRI, if the equipment and software are state of the art and if those reading the results are sufficiently experienced and skilled. For example, I just had the regular MRI, and it worked fine. Plus there was no discomfort at all. As to the larger issue, what to do now, in the absence of additional risk factors, in your shoes I'd be going the AS route in a heartbeat. But that's just me. In any case, I'd honestly have to question the medical judgment of any doc who would hustle you onto an operating table at age 43 based solely on the facts as you've presented them.",

      "Content": "Murph, Another asks some good questions. Are there aggravating factors or circumstances that led to the PSA draw and follow-on diagnostic testing? That aside, the MRI is a very useful tool -- critical in my case -- but it's far from infallible. Of course, the same holds true for a biopsy. Regarding the endocoil, there's a school of thought holding this variant to be NOT superior to a regular (non-endocoil) MRI, if the equipment and software are state of the art and if those reading the results are sufficiently experienced and skilled. For example, I just had the regular MRI, and it worked fine. Plus there was no discomfort at all. As to the larger issue, what to do now, in the absence of additional risk factors, in your shoes I'd be going the AS route in a heartbeat. But that's just me. In any case, I'd honestly have to question the medical judgment of any doc who would hustle you onto an operating table at age 43 based solely on the facts as you've presented them.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by DjinTonic Why not \"You are young (!) and healthy, so why not enjoy life and we'll think about what you want to do if and when your PSA gets a bit high and is trending to go up further.\" As I've mentioned, for all his patients (except me, the nerd), my doc uses a PSA test with a LLD of 0.05 (same as some other major institutions). So you'd now be a Happy Camper who wouldn't even be on this test's radar. Come back when you have something real to bitch about Just kidding (sort of) -- It's fine to plan, but don't obsess, OTS. (And note the journal in which the above uPSA study was published.) Djin Well said, Djin. I totally understand and appreciate the rationale for the uPSA test. There's a solid case to be made for it -- as Djin and others have done in various discussions here. The problem is, too many guys end up torturing themselves for months or even years over tiny fluctuations in the measurement. I'll stick with the standard test, which, interestingly, is the protocol at various leading medical institutions. So OK, maybe my number will, unknown to me, inch up until a day comes when the dreaded bell rings at 0.1 or thereabouts. If and when that day comes, as it may well for a G-9 person like myself, I'll no doubt be quite worried and distressed. Meanwhile, however, I'll stay happily oblivious. Emphasis on \"happily.\" Because here's the thing: At the end of the day, it probably ain't gonna make a huge difference whether you treat at 0.1 (or even 0.2) as opposed to, say, 0.06. Alright, shoot me if I've got that wrong. In the end, we're all gonna die anyway.",

      "Content": "Interesting list and not many major surprises there. Well, one or two maybe. But I'm surprised there was no mention of tree nuts after that much-publicized (and very reputable) study a couple years ago suggesting that a mere ounce of tree nuts -- for example: hazelnuts, cashews, almonds, pistachios, and a variety of others -- reduces the mortality risk from prostate cancer by more than 30 percent! Go figure. Anyway, hard to believe, but see the link below. We're talking Harvard Medical and the British Journal of Cancer here. Not exactly fringe institutions. So I have dutifully been consuming one ounce of almonds every day for lunch for the last 18 months. So far it's gotten me a G-9 cancer score. Haha! Just kidding. Who knows, without the almonds maybe things would have been a lot worse! Maybe I'd be history by now! In any case, here's the link: http://prostatecancer911.com/what-ef...ostate-cancer/",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by 5K10K Okay, in 2011 I drove myself from the Doubletree in downtown Philadelphia to the ER at Johns Hopkins (99.6 miles) one afternoon three days into a bout of pancreatitis co-occurring with pneumonia. Who'd like to one-up that? Spring 1994, I was at work mid-day when I started to feel significant pain on the side, lower back. Forget which side now. As it got worse, I decided to leave work. By the time I got to my vehicle in the parking lot, I was about doubled over in pain. Like a fool, I got into the car anyway and headed toward home. 30-mile drive, pretty much all of it interstate highway, to include the Baltimore Beltway. Halfway there, the pain got even worse, if that were possible. Sweat poured off me. Fought like crazy to stay focused on the road amid the always heavy traffic on that stretch of metropolitan roadway. I realized that maybe I should pull off, but I kept thinking to myself, what the hell am I going to do then. Just sit there and scream? So I kept driving. Also praying. I drove straight to my doctor's office and staggered in, saying I needed to see a doc right away. They moved me to the head of the line and sent me in. On-scene urine test showed positive for blood, which confirmed the doc's preliminary diagnosis of a kidney stone. They called my wife who left the kids with a friend and drove me to an emergency room in Baltimore (Sinai Hospital). The doc had called ahead, so they took me right away and promptly gave me a high-dose shot of Dilaudid. Oh my gosh, the wonders of modern medicine! Within five minutes, I was feeling quite fine! The nurse told my wife that the pain of kidney stones is akin to that of having a baby. I won't argue the comparison, believe me. At some point in the next hour or two, before the meds wore off, I passed the stone. But I'll never forget the experience. Or the drive. Ever since then, I've religiously followed a urologist's advice to drink plenty of water every day. It's probably made a big difference in my overall health because before then I was strictly a soda and high-calorie juice drinker. But I stopped that cold out of fear of ever feeling that kind of pain again. Anyway, I've heard pancreatitis is pretty damn bad pain-wise too, so I don't want to say this one-ups you. But I'm ready to bet it was every bit as bad.",

      "Content": "Well on the one hand there's a steady 3-year rise in the PSA number, with the last number (4.1) reaching the standard biopsy threshold for your husband's age range. On the other hand, that 4.1 number, though concerning, is not alarmingly high, while the 4K markers propose only an 8% chance of intermediate-grade cancer -- not negligible but still pretty darn low, to the point where the doc is not overly concerned and is not pressing for the early biopsy. A single biopsy is generally safe but not entirely risk-free and far from certain in its own diagnostic value -- there is a fairly high false negative rate -- though still the only tool available for clinically detecting prostate cancer. All in all, it seems to me like the decision is no slam-dunk, though I suspect the majority here would agree with Djin's advice to have the biopsy sooner rather than later. Indeed, this would be the \"safest\" course, if you want to look at it that way. Moreover, the chances are pretty good he'll end up needing the procedure after the next PSA anyway, so all you really get by holding off is a six-month reprieve. That said, I totally get your husband's inclination to wait, and in his shoes I'm pretty sure that's how I would feel in this same circumstance. (Then again, my track record on such matters may not inspire confidence in my judgment!) Bottom line for me: there is no screamingly obvious answer. Weigh the pluses and minuses. At the end of the day, however, it is your husband's butt they'll be shooting the dart gun up, so you do need him on board.",

      "Content": "Dave, my surgeon was one of Partin's Hopkins colleagues, Dr. Allaf, and in response to a question from Gary, I not long ago discussed my experience in my Elevated and Rising PSA thread, which dates back to the beginning of my little adventure in Prostate Wonderland in February 2017. Right, I do understand your frustration, but I think Michael, as usual, offers some very good perspective. Plus you can take what you will from my own thoughts on the subject in the ref'd post. FYI, here's the text of what I told Gary last month: >>Gary, bottom line: I'm happy with Dr. Allaf and would not hesitate to recommend him to anyone -- including my own family if, God forbid, the occasion were ever to arise. That said, there are certain things in his operation -- and I don't know if this has to do with him personally or if it's a function of the way business is done among the busy prostate surgeons at Hopkins -- that some patients might find offputting. When I researched the surgery option, one thing that jumped out is that the skill and experience of the surgeon are critical-- in fact, probably the most crucial factor a person can control. And Allaf, as far as I could see, fit the bill. Thousands of procedures, the Director of Robotic Surgery at one of the top urology departments in one of the top hospitals in the world. Hard to beat those credentials. The flip side is that the man is very busy indeed. As you mentioned, he travels a lot. And people travel from long distances to be treated by him. It takes three months to get an appointment for a consultation. And so forth. The result is, you may not get much in the way of a personalized post-surgery experience from him directly. For example, I've only had two conversations with him. One was the pre-surgery consult, and one was 30 minutes before surgery. Both times, the man was as courteous and gracious as you could imagine. Of course, he well realizes how guys feel as they're lying on that gurney beforehand, wondering if their lives as they knew them are over. And in that circumstance, he communicated an air of total confidence, telling me I was in good hands, I would go home the next day and quickly find myself on the road back to normalcy, etc. It felt good to hear that. Then, immediately following the operation, which took longer than predicted because my large prostate was even larger than expected, he had a good and thorough conversation with my wife. Since then, all my own contact with his office has been via members of his \"team,\" which I gather is a fair-sized group -- to include nurses, nurse practitioners, doctors, and others. I received my post-op pathology report from a team member because Dr. A was \"out of the country.\" The 3-month PSA was ordered by a team member. The results of that test were sent to me by a team member. And so forth. Honestly, I'm OK with all this, though I can't say I realized -- or really even thought about -- exactly how things would work post-op. But again, as far as I can tell, the man skillfully did the thing that was by far most important to me: successfully remove the prostate and leave me in relatively good working order afterward. I'm very grateful for that. Now if, God forbid, things take a negative turn and I find myself contemplating post-surgical treatment, then I think I would call his office and request an expedited consult with him personally -- because I'll have a lot of questions. And if he's \"out of the country\" at the time, I may settle for Dr. Walsh. Finally, about the uPSA, in an exchange with Michael several weeks ago I said I suspected that Dr. Allaf might not be a fan of the ultrasensitive variant because his mentor, Dr. Walsh, was not enthusiastic about it. (Or at least that was the case in the third edition of Walsh's book; not sure what he has to say in the recently published fourth edition.) Like I said earlier, at this moment in time, I'll happily take my \"undetectable,\" on whatever test it was measured, to the bank. Granted, that way of looking at it might be a minority viewpoint. But if so, it's a pretty distinguished minority, what with guys like Allaf and Walsh subscribing to it!<<",

      "Content": "Well on the one hand there's a steady 3-year rise in the PSA number, with the last number (4.1) reaching the standard biopsy threshold for your husband's age range. On the other hand, that 4.1 number, though concerning, is not alarmingly high, while the 4K markers propose only an 8% chance of intermediate-grade cancer -- not negligible but still pretty darn low, to the point where the doc is not overly concerned and is not pressing for the early biopsy. A single biopsy is generally safe but not entirely risk-free and far from certain in its own diagnostic value -- there is a fairly high false negative rate -- though still the only tool available for clinically detecting prostate cancer. All in all, it seems to me like the decision is no slam-dunk, though I suspect the majority here would agree with Djin's advice to have the biopsy sooner rather than later. Indeed, this would be the \"safest\" course, if you want to look at it that way. Moreover, the chances are pretty good he'll end up needing the procedure after the next PSA anyway, so all you really get by holding off is a six-month reprieve. That said, I totally get your husband's inclination to wait, and in his shoes I'm pretty sure that's how I would feel in this same circumstance. (Then again, my track record on such matters may not inspire confidence in my judgment!) Bottom line for me: there is no screamingly obvious answer. Weigh the pluses and minuses. At the end of the day, however, it is your husband's butt they'll be shooting the dart gun up, so you do need him on board.",

      "Content": "Dave, my surgeon was one of Partin's Hopkins colleagues, Dr. Allaf, and in response to a question from Gary, I not long ago discussed my experience in my Elevated and Rising PSA thread, which dates back to the beginning of my little adventure in Prostate Wonderland in February 2017. Right, I do understand your frustration, but I think Michael, as usual, offers some very good perspective. Plus you can take what you will from my own thoughts on the subject in the ref'd post. FYI, here's the text of what I told Gary last month: >>Gary, bottom line: I'm happy with Dr. Allaf and would not hesitate to recommend him to anyone -- including my own family if, God forbid, the occasion were ever to arise. That said, there are certain things in his operation -- and I don't know if this has to do with him personally or if it's a function of the way business is done among the busy prostate surgeons at Hopkins -- that some patients might find offputting. When I researched the surgery option, one thing that jumped out is that the skill and experience of the surgeon are critical-- in fact, probably the most crucial factor a person can control. And Allaf, as far as I could see, fit the bill. Thousands of procedures, the Director of Robotic Surgery at one of the top urology departments in one of the top hospitals in the world. Hard to beat those credentials. The flip side is that the man is very busy indeed. As you mentioned, he travels a lot. And people travel from long distances to be treated by him. It takes three months to get an appointment for a consultation. And so forth. The result is, you may not get much in the way of a personalized post-surgery experience from him directly. For example, I've only had two conversations with him. One was the pre-surgery consult, and one was 30 minutes before surgery. Both times, the man was as courteous and gracious as you could imagine. Of course, he well realizes how guys feel as they're lying on that gurney beforehand, wondering if their lives as they knew them are over. And in that circumstance, he communicated an air of total confidence, telling me I was in good hands, I would go home the next day and quickly find myself on the road back to normalcy, etc. It felt good to hear that. Then, immediately following the operation, which took longer than predicted because my large prostate was even larger than expected, he had a good and thorough conversation with my wife. Since then, all my own contact with his office has been via members of his \"team,\" which I gather is a fair-sized group -- to include nurses, nurse practitioners, doctors, and others. I received my post-op pathology report from a team member because Dr. A was \"out of the country.\" The 3-month PSA was ordered by a team member. The results of that test were sent to me by a team member. And so forth. Honestly, I'm OK with all this, though I can't say I realized -- or really even thought about -- exactly how things would work post-op. But again, as far as I can tell, the man skillfully did the thing that was by far most important to me: successfully remove the prostate and leave me in relatively good working order afterward. I'm very grateful for that. Now if, God forbid, things take a negative turn and I find myself contemplating post-surgical treatment, then I think I would call his office and request an expedited consult with him personally -- because I'll have a lot of questions. And if he's \"out of the country\" at the time, I may settle for Dr. Walsh. Finally, about the uPSA, in an exchange with Michael several weeks ago I said I suspected that Dr. Allaf might not be a fan of the ultrasensitive variant because his mentor, Dr. Walsh, was not enthusiastic about it. (Or at least that was the case in the third edition of Walsh's book; not sure what he has to say in the recently published fourth edition.) Like I said earlier, at this moment in time, I'll happily take my \"undetectable,\" on whatever test it was measured, to the bank. Granted, that way of looking at it might be a minority viewpoint. But if so, it's a pretty distinguished minority, what with guys like Allaf and Walsh subscribing to it!<<",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by DjinTonic Why not \"You are young (!) and healthy, so why not enjoy life and we'll think about what you want to do if and when your PSA gets a bit high and is trending to go up further.\" As I've mentioned, for all his patients (except me, the nerd), my doc uses a PSA test with a LLD of 0.05 (same as some other major institutions). So you'd now be a Happy Camper who wouldn't even be on this test's radar. Come back when you have something real to bitch about Just kidding (sort of) -- It's fine to plan, but don't obsess, OTS. (And note the journal in which the above uPSA study was published.) Djin Well said, Djin. I totally understand and appreciate the rationale for the uPSA test. There's a solid case to be made for it -- as Djin and others have done in various discussions here. The problem is, too many guys end up torturing themselves for months or even years over tiny fluctuations in the measurement. I'll stick with the standard test, which, interestingly, is the protocol at various leading medical institutions. So OK, maybe my number will, unknown to me, inch up until a day comes when the dreaded bell rings at 0.1 or thereabouts. If and when that day comes, as it may well for a G-9 person like myself, I'll no doubt be quite worried and distressed. Meanwhile, however, I'll stay happily oblivious. Emphasis on \"happily.\" Because here's the thing: At the end of the day, it probably ain't gonna make a huge difference whether you treat at 0.1 (or even 0.2) as opposed to, say, 0.06. Alright, shoot me if I've got that wrong. In the end, we're all gonna die anyway.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by Smasherie Hi everyone, I'm new here. My dad was recently diagnosed with prostate cancer and underwent a radical prostatectomy with the belief that his gleason score was around a 7. That changed after the pathology report confirmed that it was actually a 9. As of right now, it has not spread outside the prostate or into the lymph nodes they removed. Will not know for another month when they are able to re-check his PSA levels if they removed it all from the surrounding tissue. I'm really scared. He's only 59, and he's the last guy on the planet I thought would ever get cancer. He doesn't deal well with this stuff and doesn't relay all of the information as he has trouble understanding it himself. I live in another state and although I was there for the surgery, I am back home now. So far, the urologist has not told him what to expect with a Gleason score that high. I've been trying to do some research myself but it's overwhelming. Does this mean that there is little hope? From everything I'm reading it sounds like it's going to come back and spread. If anyone has any advice or can give me more information on the realities of aggressive prostate cancer, I would appreciate it. I'm just at a loss. Thank you. Smash, being upgraded from G-7 to G-9 on pathology is not what you want to hear, but it's far from a death sentence. In fact, the same thing happened to me (see stats below), and 15 months out from surgery, everything is going fine -- <knock on wood>. A lot of guys here know more about all this than I and can probably provide better information and advice. I'll chime in because the situation you report -- Gleason 7 upgraded to 9 after surgery -- was mine as well. You say your Dad's report indicates \"it has not spread\" outside the prostate. That would be very good news. The clinical term is \"organ-confined.\" The urologist should be able to give you a direct yes or no, confirming that pathology shows no indications the disease has spread beyond the prostate.\" Also, the PSA level before surgery and the extent of cancer found within the prostate, which pathology routinely measures, are relevant factors in terms of long-term outlook. If indeed the pathology says \"organ-confined,\" then your Dad is looking at regular PSA follow-ups.

However, if post-surgery pathology shows any indicator that the disease did in fact spread to \"surrounding tissue\" OR if follow-on PSA testing suggests the likelihood of this, then your Dad will have to consider some standard follow-up treatment, which is not fun but is generally manageable and tolerable...plus, best of all: potentially curative. Be assured, the odds are very good your Dad is going to be around for a long time to come. Even in worst-case scenarios, which based on your brief description do not seem applicable in his case, it takes years for the disease to progress to symptoms and even then things can be containable for additional years thereafter.

      "Content": "Jerry, no question, the very word \"cancer\" is shocking and terrifying. Which is understandable, but frankly: not rational...and not conducive to logical decision-making. The fact is that 2 cores at Gleason-6 is no reason for panic. Indeed, with that profile, I think an awful lot of docs, actually most docs in 2018, supported by what is rapidly becoming the standard of care in such cases, would tell you that Active Surveillance (AS) is the preferred way to go with the biopsy numbers you report. (And by the way, AS does NOT necessarily involve annual biopsies.) Is AS fail-safe? No! Is it a guarantee? No! Because there are no guarantees in prostate cancer, or really in any cancer, or for that matter anywhere else in life. Which is why you need to do some research of your own. By all means, listen to the people here, who have a wealth of experience to share and put me on the right road. Still, weigh what they say carefully against the balance of medical expertise -- not least of which is the latest (201 Guidelines for Clinicians. As for the other treatment options you mention, well, there are holes and inaccuracies in your thumbnail \"upsides and downsides\" for all of them -- to include Proton Therapy, whose superiority is not proven by studies nor supported by the limited data on record.",

As a Christian, I would point to a couple helpful passages in Scripture where Jesus talks about fear: Fear is useless; what is needed is trust. And: Who of you by worrying can add a single day to his life? Of course, when faced with danger or disaster, it becomes pretty difficult to process those words. Personally, I find 19 grandkids to be a pretty good antidote to fear. They run my ass so ragged that I don't have time to be afraid! In fact, darned if those guys didn't cause me to forget my quarterly PSA check. Called Hopkins yesterday and got the lab order put in. We'll see if my brave talk holds up next week when the result comes in.",
