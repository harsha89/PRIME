      "Content": "You guys have helped me while we waited for my husband's biopsy, the results, and now the wait that the results are \"true\". I admire your ability to share your experiences and suggestions. It makes my job as a cheerleader easier. It also lets me prepare for the worse if it comes. My husband has been at my side during many health issues. It makes life easier to go as a pair instead of alone. But it is much more scary when you think that after all these years you may just have to go it alone because it is \"that time\". There are good women out there you just have to give them a chance. Remember it is scary to them too.",

      "Content": "To answer your question there are women out there. I have been married to my husband for 39 (10/21) I don't care if he doesn't preform at times. HE DOES. He thinks he is failing me. There are times I WOULD rather snuggle. The constant boosting his morale can be very difficult. Worse than any ED ever was. I love a good snuggle. Holding Hands? Go for it. Everything that you mentioned, I have told him is more important. But of course I am one woman. I am older. We ARE married. But even if we weren't and I was younger. There are more important things than sex.",
