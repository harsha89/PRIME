    "Content": "Hello, I wanted to give my testimony about a solution to treat my severe incontinence that has been proposed by my urologist. I have been implanted with the Artificial Urinary Sphincter ZSI 375, it has really improved my life, I can go back now to activities which I was doing before my incontinence (they just told me that riding bicycle was forbidden). After my implantation, I was still incontinent for 2 months because the device was not \"activated\" then after my full healing they activated the implant. Since then I am continent ! If you want you can look at my testimony on their WebSite. www.zephyr-si.com",
