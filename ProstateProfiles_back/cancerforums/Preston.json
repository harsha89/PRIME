      "Content": "Follow up: I removed the catheter yesterday and everything is working fine so far. I have the drugs handy in case I need them, but I am thinking that I will not this time. Looking back, after my second horrible spasm my wife called my doctor's number and talked with a nurse who recommended that I go to the ER. I refused to go and waited until the third time and went. I should have called my doctor back personally to be sure that they understood the situation and asked about drugs for spasms. Having the catheter in a couple of more days may have been better for me. My doctor told me not to lift anything over 10 pounds, but I can't imagine how much stress I put on my whole body while I was having the spasms. I am doing so much better this morning. Matt, I hope you are doing better as well.",

      "Content": "Matt, I had trouble logging in so had to set up a new profile. Yes, I am going through this as we speak. Unfortunately, I am 5 hours away from my doctor and clinic. And health services in my area are lacking. I did talk with one of my doctor's nurses and was told to have the catheter removed immediately. They did not understand why the ER doctor had the catheter installed since I was voiding, but I don't fault the ER doc. I don't know what precentage of people run into this problem, but I was totally unprepared for this. For the spasms I was prescribed flavoxate, one or two tablets, 3 to 4 times a day. There have been no spasms for me since the catheter was added. I will have the catheter removed in a couple of hours and hope for better results this time. We will hang in there together.",
