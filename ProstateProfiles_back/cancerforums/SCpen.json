      "Content": "Well I'm now 20 days post surgery as well as 10 days post catheter! Life to a certain extent is getting back to normal or better yet my \"new normal\". Still getting up several times at night to pee but now have no leaking. Still wearing a pad during the day as a laugh, fart, sneeze, sudden movement, etc can, cause as I call it a quick squirt. Still a bit sore from the surgery in spots and my abdomen is a bit sensitive but it is all worth it to be cancer free. Starting to push the walks a bit longer each day and increase the physical activity. The last hurdle to clear is on the erection front, for lack of a better way to explain I'm \"kneeling\" now but hopefully in the very near future hope to be \"standing tall\". Thanks to all for your advice leading up to and post surgery, all the little tricks and tips really paid off! Forever greatful! SCPen",

      "Content": "Thanks Highlander... The issues you raised with the high PSA and free PSA numbers are the same that concern me. My prostate is large but has not changed in estimated size in 2 years but the PSA continues to rise. Additionally with a total PSA of over 10 they don't calculate free PSA so moving forward with AS we would just be looking at the Total PSA as part of the AS program. I keep thinking that if I was 65 with these numbers and diagnosis AS would be a lock but at 52 I wonder if it would be best just have surgery. The second consideration if I elect surgery is open or robotic. In Walsh's 3rd edition I believe I read that for younger men with enlarged prostates open might have less side effects. Thanks again to all for the comments and suggestions. SCPen",

      "Content": "To all, What a 5 days it has been! Surgery on this past Monday went as expected (per surgeon) around 4 hours with a little longer recovery room time as they couldn't find an open bed. Was a bit uncomfortable day of surgery (Monday) with some bladder cramping, other than that just plain ass tired. Released day after surgery (Tuesday) around lunch time, got home and went for the first of many short naps, passed a lot of gas. Day three (wednesday) my first outside walk, 3 regular meals, and plenty of naps! Day four (Thursday) the greatest milestone yet, the first post surgical bowl movement! That was even more exciting then getting the JP drain pulled from the abdomen. Also got my first shower in 4 days. Day 5 (Friday)was the first day that I had some pain off and on thru the day as I chose to lay of the Norco pain med and control everything with the Motrin. Went to bed fairly early and slept good. Urine has cleared up and back to normal color. Day 6 (saturday) went for my first long walk, maybe a little to much but nothing a two hour nap won't cure! Got the Foley catheter removal scheduled for next Friday (will be 11 days total) and will hear from the doctor on Monday regarding the post surgical Path report. SCPen",

Probably the two most important piece's have been to take control of my situation and do your homework. Being relatively young (52) with a PSA now close to 12 (going from 8 to 12 in two years), free PSA below 9%, MRI with a PI-Rad IV lesion, I pressed for a third biopsy (MRI Fused) and it came back positive 20% 3+3 in one core. After discussions with lot's of folks in the medical profession I was being told to consider AI, Seeds, or surgery with no real consensus. After reviewing the forum, talking with friends with PC, friends of friends with PC, and most of conversations with my wife...we decided on da vinci surgery scheduled for June!...and I haven't second guessed it once.

      "Content": "Have been following this forum for the past few months and would like some thoughts and or opinions on my status... I'm a 51 year old who went to the urologist (Dec 12) for blood in the urine, DRE indicated enlarged prostate, no infection but PSA was 8.4. CT scan and cytoscopy both came back normal, followed with a 14 core biopsy that came back clean. Fast forward 6 months: PSA 9.92, PC3 at 17, MRI done that indicated two areas of \"moderate\" concern in the midline TZ area, free PSA at 7. I had a second 14 core biopsy done with a focus on the areas of concern, the results came back today clean in all samples. Urologist wants to see me in 6 months, the wife thinks I should consider going to a larger hospital that has a urologic oncologist speciality. I'm in a quandary as I have some good numbers and some not so good numbers. Any thoughts or suggestions would be appreciated... Thanks",

I'm sure a third biopsy is in my future. Should i consider pressing the Doc for a MRI prior to the biopsy? Thanks in advance. Thanks to all for the comments, just a little more info: The first biopsy was a 16 core the second was 18, once again both negative. I redid my PSA and in 7 days it dropped from 19 to 11.5, still it rose from 8 to 11.5 in a year. Between the first and second biopsy's I had a MRI done (july 2013) with contrast which showed \"a focal area of decreased signal in the transition zone anterior to the rectum but midline\" which they said was \"a moderately suspicious localized area\". When the second biopsy was done the Dr \"focused on this area\". In my research, I believe in a simplistic explanation that the anterior midline of the TZ is the hardest area to biopsy and since only ~10% of the PC's originate there and are so rare they don't usually get a lot of focus. Since my original post I have scheduled my second MRI. My Dr is going to compare the second MRI to the original to see if there are any differences. After the MRI will then discuss the next steps. If I do end up having a third biopsy reading about an MRI guided biopsy, dose anyone have thoughts on this approach? I'm concerned about my numbers and at 52 concerned more with a Quantity of life then the quality.",
