      "Content": "my husband had prostate removed in June 2006. ( his psa during 5 years were 0.04) then in Dec 2011 the PSA started to grow higher. today is 0.27. he will have a ct scan and bone scan to see if start radiation treatment. no target shows, no tumor. my questions is what next? and if the radiation have a side effect, or where the cancer goes from there? Carmentexas Originally Posted by tomdejoliet I am 56 years old. I had my prostate removed in December 2008. For over 2 years, my PSA level remained below 0.1. However, last year, my PSA began to slowly rise. When the level reached 0.3, I began radiation therapy in December and completed the first week of February. I had a follow up PSA test 2 weeks ago, and the level was 0.33. My radiologist said not to be concerned, and it may take another 2 months before I could see the level to begin dropping. I'm hoping there are others that may have experienced a similar scenario and how long it took for PSA levels to begin dropping following prostate cancer and radiation therapy. This is different from those only receiving radiation therapy, because the PSA levels are typically much higher, because the prostate has not been removed prior to treatment. Thanks in advance.
