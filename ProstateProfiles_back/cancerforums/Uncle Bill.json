      "Content": "Just before my group run i went to the rest room and my urine was clear. However after a five mile run I went to the rest room again and my urine was full of blood (no lower ab pain). I was a nervous wreck so I went to the ER for evaluation and they determined that i had a Prostate infection (WBC and RBC in urine) and prostatic calcifications through a CT. During my wait in the ER i drink a couple of bottles of water and before the evening was over my urine began to clear and was back to normal. My urologist has been watching my PCA counts (3.6) and climbing. I had a biopsy a year ago and no detection of cancer cells. I have an appointment with my uro on Monday and I'm guessing I will be getting Cystoscopy soon. I'm very nervous why I had so much blood in my urine and I'm like to know if this is normal for this to happen with a prostate infection.",

      "Content": "Thanks to everyone for the wonderful responses...I cant Thank you enough. My PCP did a full blood workover in July and that's how I discovered my elevated PSA. I called my Urology clinic once the results were in. My Urologist is out on vacation and his nurse consulted with another Physician at the clinic. He wanted me on Bactrim for thirty days and to retest before the cycle was over...not a day after. So I will retest in two weeks and have results to post in about three weeks. As far as I know I never had Prostatitis or any other infection related to the prostate. I'm not even sure what the symptoms are. My white blood count was normal so that could rule an infection out? Thanks again everyone!",

Earlier this month my doctor put me on Bactrim twice a day for thirty days and will retest me again in September. I have a feeling another biopsy is coming. Should I ask for an MRI first? I'm very active. I workout twice a day 5 times a week and I run a couple times a week. I been having a lot of lower abdominal pain, most of the pain happens when I run.

I realize I'm not in the same situation as most here but I have a feeling I maybe joining the club some day....probably much sooner than I hope. My Dad just found out that he has prostate cancer...He has the aggressive type. He's 74 and I don't think he's going to fight it. Once i learn more I will follow up. I had my followup appointment with my urologist concerning my MRI results. Going in I had prepared myself mentally for another biopsy but I was a little surprised that he wanted to wait three months and retest my PSA. He said the lesion that was found is a concern and we will be watching it closely. I'm still nervous about the whole situation and I would love to know what you think. Thanks again.",
