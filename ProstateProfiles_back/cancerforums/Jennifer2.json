      "Content": "Thanks Mike for sharing your story. My dad was diagnosed with Gleason 10 Prostate Cancer 1 year ago. This past January we found he now has Small Cell Carcinoma Prostate Cancer. Prior to that the cancer had spread to his bones: spine, ribs, back along with lymph nodes and his entire pelvic region. He doesn't understand what he has other than just prostate cancer. He is now opting for back surgery in 2 weeks because he thinks it will help with back pain. None of his doctors want him to have the surgery but he is not listening. He thinks it will help, and it may but I am concerned that it will spread the cancer. They are going in to drill out some of his spine as the fluid is not draining properly and is causing him pain. He is 73 years old. Any advice here? I know he is in so much pain so I understand him wanting to do what he can but I am worried about him even having the surgery and coming out. I am encouraged that you have done so well as with most small cell information I can find is not very positive in nature. On a side note, my dad is on palliative care. He does not handle chemo well as a year ago it almost killed him. Now he is on hormone shots and xtandi.",

      "Content": "My father was diagnosed with prostate cancer one year ago. (Gleason 10) It had metastasized to a couple of ribs, some lymph nodes, a small part of his back, his bladder and much of his pelvic region. He was able to do a couple of rounds of chemo before it made him so sick we nearly lost him. After those rounds of chemo the areas that had metastasized no longer showed on his bone scan. That last scan was done last summer. We found out now, two weeks ago, he now has small cell carcinoma. They did surgery a few weeks ago to remove part of his cancer from his pelvis as he was having trouble urinating. Those pathology results showed the small cell carcinoma. This week, they did another bone scan and all of the areas that showed cancer that had gone, have now returned. Has anyone had experience with small cell carcinoma? This is very scary as everything I read is not good. They said they can help him with pain using radiation but that is about it. They also told him to stop taking his xtandi a week ago but now tell him if he wants he can take it but it is up to him. His mind is not always right but the scans show no brain cancer. His balance is terrible and he is losing weight because he is not hungry. Does anyone have advice here? He lives alone and we are so very concerned about him daily but thank goodness he is not far away.",

      "Content": "My dad is 74 years old. I can't recall his initial PSA but I believe it was in the 30's range. It has never been really high. Right now it is around .08. His first symptoms was that he could not urinate. He had pain when doing so. They did a turp almost immediately. This helped but he did have to self-catheter for some time. He has only had 2 rounds of chemo and will receive no more. He did have stents put in to help as cancer has been in the ureters. The only treatments he has is his hormone shot every 3 months and his xtandi if he so chooses to use it. Other than that just pain meds. Some days his mind is good, others not so much. The siblings take food so that is not a concern. It is just getting him to keep eating as he forgets due to how much he sleeps. Is there any hope out there for men in this situation? I would like to hear from someone who has experience with small cell carcinoma. The Gleason 10 was bad enough. This was a huge blow to us all. I don't think my dad even realizes what he has right now. He thinks if he can get his UTI under control, everything will be ok.",

      "Content": "Does anyone else have experience with a Gleason 10 diagnosis? My dad was diagnosed with Gleason 10 just over a year ago. They found the cancer in his ribs, back, lymph nodes, bladder and all over his pelvic region to where things were connected in one mass. These areas have shrunk but he can no longer have any chemo as it was very hard on him so now he is just on palliative care while taking Xtandi and hormone therapy. His PSA was just checked and it is .02, which is awesome news but is this just a smoke screen? He feels fairly well but has ups and downs like a roller coaster. Right now he is at the top and doing pretty well over all but I am just waiting for him to start going down again. He also had a biopsy last January when they removed a mass from his bladder and the radiology report came back stating he had small cell carcinoma. I understand this is about the worst news we could have gotten but he seems to not be having major problems with this. I just am trying to learn everything I can and I can't find much information out there on a Gleason 10 much less on the small cell. Is it possible that the small cell they removed was the only place that it was and that he could be clear of it? Or am I just wishful thinking?",

      "Content": "When he was first diagnosed with PC, his PSA was around 30 and never got any higher than that. His urologist said he has only seen 1 other patient with as aggressive prostate cancer in his 25 years of practice. From what I understand the prostate cancer that was in his bladder turned into Small Cell Carcinoma as it is not a new cancer from what I am told. It is all so confusing. His oncologist has never really spoke of what the pathology reports read. I think because he knows it would just destroy my dads hopes. I spoke to the nurse about it and all she said was that she was sorry about what they found. After that, which was back in March, they have never said another word about it. They did say that he could continue to take the Xtandi if he wants to. I thought that was odd. He chose to keep taking it and I am glad he did because it is working from what the PSA shows.",

      "Content": "We had to put my dad in assisted living last October but just a few weeks later we had to make the decision to put him on hospice. Things have been going steady without much change other than his mind, (now they believe the dementia is progressing further). This week the nurse with hospice told us he has ascites in his abdomen. I have never even heard of this. We don't know if it is cancerous because they will not do any testing as he is on hospice. What causes this to happen? When he had his surgery last October to remove his bladder, one kidney and lymph nodes, the pathology reports came back clean. This shocked all of us! We don't believe that means his cancer is all gone but from those areas we were shocked to here they didn't find anything. The last scan he had last fall showed a spot on his liver, could that be the reason for the ascites? Is this easily treated and if so I don't even know that hospice would do it. He thinks he is gaining weight but we are certain it is from the fluid. he has gained almost 10 pound in 2 weeks. Any info on this condition would be appreciated. Thank you.",

He had it a year ago and although it did shrink the cancer, it nearly killed him. He was getting reoccurring infections from the stents they had placed so that he could urinate better. He was diagnosed a year ago and although we had high hopes for a few more years, that all changed when we found out he had small cell this past January. I know that his doctors are just trying to make him comfortable. They did mention that they could do some radiation to help with pain but he has not opted for that yet. He is now having terrible back pain which he thought was from years of working but I believe it is the cancer. We have an apt with his oncologist tomorrow so I hope to learn more then. I just hope that they can make my dad comfortable so that he can enjoy what time he has left. I don't want them to treat him like a guinea pig and do a bunch of different meds to further their studies. I just want him to be able enjoy life as best as he can and as most comfortably as he can.",

      "Content": "Hello everyone, I have posted a few times as my dad has Gleason 10 metastasized prostate cancer, he is 74. We found out about this over a year ago and then found out he has small cell carcinoma in January. As of this past weekend he is now in the hospital with a terrible UTI. It has caused problems now with his heart being one of them. They are talking about moving him to another hospital and possibly putting a port into his heart as his ekg came back showing problems and his blood work shows heart trouble as well. I HATE seeing my dad go through this. He is also having trouble breathing now but there has been no confirmation of pneumonia yet. How long does my dad have to suffer. He feels terrible all the time. Sorry for the negative post I just needed an outlet to go to. Jennifer",

      "Content": "He had the bladder removed because of many issues. Mostly because of the repeated UTI's. His right kidney was full of infection and it no longer filtered so it was causing the left kidney to work much harder. His bladder had hardened and gotten so small that the foley bulb would not hardly fit any longer. Thank goodness they were able to remove the prostate without harming the rectum or bowel as that would have required another bag. He has gone through so much. For the last 6 months they have told us he is on borrowed time and that he should live his life like each day is his last. He is not ready to quit fighting but he honestly doesn't understand much of what is going on, just that he isn't ready to call it quits. Even when we took him up for surgery he didn't understand what they were doing. He still thought he was going to have a foley bag and had no idea they were taking his bladder out. It is so hard on the family and I am sure it is much harder on him. We worry what the next weeks or months have in store and hope that he doesn't continue to suffer like he has. We will talk to the staff at the hospital and see if they can set him up at a rehabilitation center. Thank you for the advice.",

The doctors removed his left kidney as it was no longer working and full of puss. They also removed his bladder, prostate and some lymph nodes. They placed an ileal conduit so it was a long day of surgery. Has anyone had any experience with this? He is supposed to get out of the hospital in a week but nobody has said anything about going somewhere for rehabilitation and he lives alone. I am concerned as we can't care for him during the day. My dad is so strong and I am amazed at how he has pulled through this surgery yesterday. He is 75 years old and this morning he was in a chair asking for coffee. He is such a fighter but I am concerned about his care from here out. How difficult is it to care for this ileal conduit? Any advice or input would be so appreciated. -Jennifer",

      "Content": "I just thought I would give an update on my dad who has Gleason 10 stage 4 prostate cancer. He had to have surgery last month and they removed his left kidney, bladder, prostate and some lymph nodes. It was a 5 hour surgery and it went well. My dad had Hallucinations constantly for over a week after the surgery which was very scary! They believe that some of the cancer meds he has been on may have caused some of his mind troubles. He is better but he is still very confused and his memory is terrible. He went to rehab for 3 weeks after surgery but we have found he is just not strong enough to go home. At 75, I don't know how much stronger he can get with this disease growing inside of him. He is living at an assisted living facility which is very nice. He still wants to go home but I just don't see that happening. In the past week he has fallen twice while using his walker. My biggest concern is that he has not been on his Keytruda in 2 months and has had no Xtandi for over a month. How soon will his cancer start growing without these medications? (keeping in mind that his prostate cancer really has never caused an elevated PSA). He is still stage 3 kidney failure with the only kidney he has so if he does start treatment how damaging are those drugs to his kidney? So many concerns. He is meeting with a new oncologist this Wednesday to see what they think. He doesn't want to go back to where he was going. He seems to think he is going to start driving soon and we just don't have the heart to tell him he can't and that he probably never will. He has been falling for months and the only way we got him to assisted living is because they recommended it at the rehab facility. Any advice or words of wisdom would be helpful. We have a family member who is his POA, how does that person know when dad can't make decisions anymore and that it is just time to go on hospice and enjoy what time he has left? Sorry to sound so down about it but I hate seeing him go through all of this and the thought of him going back on medications is rough. They make him feel so sick. He has always but quantity over quality.",
