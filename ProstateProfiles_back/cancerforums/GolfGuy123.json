      "Content": "New Guy here, I have read all the books, and researched enough to become even more confused about PC so I am looking for some thoughts from the PC pro's. 57 YOA, diagnosed 5/2016, 7 of 12 positive cores G/6 one over 50%, and one G/7. PSA started at 7, brought down to around 5 over 3 months with a veggie/fish diet. Johns Hopkins did a second opinion on the pathology and 7 of 12 came back G/6 with one at 60% of core discontinuously. So now one oncologist (HDR Bracytherapy guy) says I am intermediate/unfavorable risk, another (proton beam guy) says I am low risk. It depends on which pathology they lend credence to. That doesn't help. I know I have a lot of positive cores and one over 50% which traditionally makes AS a no go and I am leaning towards PBT at UF in Jacksonville FL. Just looking for some thoughts from folks who have gone through the decision process, and treatment/surgery. Would anyone else even consider AS? Thanks..",
