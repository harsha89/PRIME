What stood out with my RO yesterday is that he agreed that I should get all the information I could from the other RO and two surgeons I am scheduled to see in order for me to figure out the best treatment plan for myself. Yesterday's RO was factual and to the point sharing his opinion with confidence and never gave me the impression it was his way or the highway. In addition to my diet from my URO ... I really need to give credit to my wife (of 35+ years) who is well read, informed and supportive of what is good for me with my diet and supplements. My wife allows me to veer a little off course for my mental health then nudges me back in line (nudge = kick in the ass). Blessings of being married to an Irish Newfie woman.",

What stood out with my RO yesterday is that he agreed that I should get all the information I could from the other RO and two surgeons I am scheduled to see in order for me to figure out the best treatment plan for myself. Yesterday's RO was factual and to the point sharing his opinion with confidence and never gave me the impression it was his way or the highway. In addition to my diet from my URO ... I really need to give credit to my wife (of 35+ years) who is well read, informed and supportive of what is good for me with my diet and supplements. My wife allows me to veer a little off course for my mental health then nudges me back in line (nudge = kick in the ass). Blessings of being married to an Irish Newfie woman.",

The old one goes into a plastic veggie bag to dump later. Actually pretty easy and no big deal.

      "Content": "Since my DREs with more docs than I can remember ... I will bare my \"butt\" and share the rest. Both surgeons are in Seattle. Surgeon #1 is William Ellis and Surgeon #2 is James Porter. My bad is that both surgeons were mentioned in a different prostate forum and not here, forgive me on the mistake. Both surgeons are highly regarded ... and the reason Dr Porter was preferred is based on both his experience, can get me in sooner and the fact he had prostate cancer treated with robotic surgery. Something to be said for walking in our shoes. Dr Porter is the only doctor in my over sixty years on this earth who has called me up at home (twice) to talk to me. It is hard to find the words, but I think he is seeing something that needs to be dealt with the others are not seeing. Time will tell. I have always followed my \"gut feeling\" for nearly 40 years of my career before I retired, and it has never let me down ... I don't intend to not follow my gut feeling now. Ice ... I know, and agree, with your taser / pepper spray analogy. Just sayin'.",

      "Content": "Been a crazy week or so. We decided on the surgery route for treatment and had a date with Dr Ellis setup for March 26th. On Monday night March 4th Dr Porter called me up at home saying after looking at my records he wanted to get this fixed for me. Told me to have my consultation with Dr Ellis on Wednesday the 6th and to call him back on Thursday the 7th. Dr Ellis said the earliest date he had for surgery was March 26th. On Thursday the 7th, Dr Porter said he could get me in for surgery on March 14th. Since Dr Porter was our #1 go to guy we selected the March 14th date with him. Met with Dr Porter on the 12th, prep on the 13th and surgery early morning of the 14th. Wow ... what a journey the last couple of days. Gotta say, all staff pre-op, op and post-op were amazing. The surgery was done with the newest version of the robot ... the xi. I was rolled into the operating room exactly at 0830 hours. Dr Porter was great chatting with me and assisting with moving me to the operating table. Surgery was 5 hours. The last thing I remember was being asked where I liked going on vacation, then the next was waking in recovery. I do not remember being moved from recovery to my room nor moved into my room bed. Next was seeing my wife and daughter at about 3p. Had a private room and my daughter spent the night with me. Staff was great making sure she had a sleeping cot and linens. Around 6p I took my first steps ... a total of 1/8 of a mile. (16 hallway laps to a mile). I ate a general menu dinner of meat loaf, mashed potatoes, broccoli, stewed prunes, yogurt and coffee. The dinner was taste, the coffee was not. Physically, it was hard to eat because of lack of saliva and the gas bloated pain was horrible. After dinner I walked a 1/4 mile. The next morning I was up at 6a walking alone just fine as my daughter went downstairs to get me a tall American (real coffee). We had our coffee walking a total of one mile then had a breakfast of scrambled eggs, chicken apple sausage, stewed prunes and yogurt. After breakfast walked another mile. Before lunch walked a 1/4 mile eating an Asian stir fry, white rice, stewed prunes and yogurt. After lunch walked another mile. I walked because really wanted to pass some gas to alleviate the cramping but just could not. Told I would be discharged at about 6p. At 5p walked another 1/4 mile and then prepared to be discharged learning how to change the piss bag and to have the drain in my side pulled out. Pulling that drain out was very, very unpleasant and I ended up at the end cursing with the \"f-word\" in front of my male nurse, wife and daughter ... they all said it as okay and understood, and gave me a little laugh for doing so. Ride home was about 30 minutes and I felt every bump in the road. Took a couple of tylenols and a stool softener. Did not feel like eating dinner, just wanted to drink water. I was able to get in and out of bed myself. Went to sleep at 8p, and up at 1a for a glass of water and another tylenol. At 5a this morning I was able to pass gas, with my wife waking up giving me a bad time about doing so. Since was awake, got up for a glass of water and a tylenol (500 mg) then into the den to watch tv. Passed more gas then fell asleep on the couch till 7a. About an hour later now sitting at the computer with a cup of coffee sharing my adventure with you all. Dr Porter saw me in my hospital room last night saying the surgery went well taking as wide of margins possible. Will have to wait till next Friday March 22nd for pathology and getting my piss tube pulled. Feeling pretty good, still passing some gas as I am typing this ... feels so good ! And ... just now my first gassy loose bowel movement. Thank goodness. Tomorrow is St Patrick's Day with corned beef and cabbage !",

      "Content": "Been a crazy week or so. We decided on the surgery route for treatment and had a date with Dr Ellis setup for March 26th. On Monday night March 4th Dr Porter called me up at home saying after looking at my records he wanted to get this fixed for me. Told me to have my consultation with Dr Ellis on Wednesday the 6th and to call him back on Thursday the 7th. Dr Ellis said the earliest date he had for surgery was March 26th. On Thursday the 7th, Dr Porter said he could get me in for surgery on March 14th. Since Dr Porter was our #1 go to guy we selected the March 14th date with him. Met with Dr Porter on the 12th, prep on the 13th and surgery early morning of the 14th. Wow ... what a journey the last couple of days. Gotta say, all staff pre-op, op and post-op were amazing. The surgery was done with the newest version of the robot ... the xi. I was rolled into the operating room exactly at 0830 hours. Dr Porter was great chatting with me and assisting with moving me to the operating table. Surgery was 5 hours. The last thing I remember was being asked where I liked going on vacation, then the next was waking in recovery. I do not remember being moved from recovery to my room nor moved into my room bed. Next was seeing my wife and daughter at about 3p. Had a private room and my daughter spent the night with me. Staff was great making sure she had a sleeping cot and linens. Around 6p I took my first steps ... a total of 1/8 of a mile. (16 hallway laps to a mile). I ate a general menu dinner of meat loaf, mashed potatoes, broccoli, stewed prunes, yogurt and coffee. The dinner was taste, the coffee was not. Physically, it was hard to eat because of lack of saliva and the gas bloated pain was horrible. After dinner I walked a 1/4 mile. The next morning I was up at 6a walking alone just fine as my daughter went downstairs to get me a tall American (real coffee). We had our coffee walking a total of one mile then had a breakfast of scrambled eggs, chicken apple sausage, stewed prunes and yogurt. After breakfast walked another mile. Before lunch walked a 1/4 mile eating an Asian stir fry, white rice, stewed prunes and yogurt. After lunch walked another mile. I walked because really wanted to pass some gas to alleviate the cramping but just could not. Told I would be discharged at about 6p. At 5p walked another 1/4 mile and then prepared to be discharged learning how to change the piss bag and to have the drain in my side pulled out. Pulling that drain out was very, very unpleasant and I ended up at the end cursing with the \"f-word\" in front of my male nurse, wife and daughter ... they all said it as okay and understood, and gave me a little laugh for doing so. Ride home was about 30 minutes and I felt every bump in the road. Took a couple of tylenols and a stool softener. Did not feel like eating dinner, just wanted to drink water. I was able to get in and out of bed myself. Went to sleep at 8p, and up at 1a for a glass of water and another tylenol. At 5a this morning I was able to pass gas, with my wife waking up giving me a bad time about doing so. Since was awake, got up for a glass of water and a tylenol (500 mg) then into the den to watch tv. Passed more gas then fell asleep on the couch till 7a. About an hour later now sitting at the computer with a cup of coffee sharing my adventure with you all. Dr Porter saw me in my hospital room last night saying the surgery went well taking as wide of margins possible. Will have to wait till next Friday March 22nd for pathology and getting my piss tube pulled. Feeling pretty good, still passing some gas as I am typing this ... feels so good ! And ... just now my first gassy loose bowel movement. Thank goodness. Tomorrow is St Patrick's Day with corned beef and cabbage !",

      "Content": "Still collecting my data after meeting with RO #1 and still need to meet with Surgeon #1, RO #2 and Surgeon #2. RO #1 suggested treatment plan beginning with Casodex and Lupron before seed implants followed with 5 weeks of EBRT. Knowing all cases are different, research suggests radiation and ADT many times follows surgery (depending on pathology afterwards). Question: Wonder if should start the ADT segment of treatment now before the decision on the treatment plan I take ? My thinking is if more than likely will be heading down this path either way why not get a jump start on things. I will be submitting this question to my RO #1 and is also on my list for my upcoming consultations. What you guys think from your experience ?",

We too (wife and I) considered all the options such as the radiation et al knowing that the long term results were probably ending up the same. For us, we need to know first hand nitty gritty what we are dealing with and the surgery would answer that question for us. The other consideration for us was knowing if the surgery did not get it all out (which it did not) we still had the option to go back to radiation to hopefully clean things up. Please know this is our personal decision and may not be the best decision for someone else ... it is all a personal decision we all must make. If there we other deciding factors we could of possibly opted for the radiation route instead of surgery.",

I am a new G9 with the ugly stuff. Thanks for the positive update. I am staying strong. If I may ask, just wondering about your PSA tests showing 0.1 vs a result further out such as 0.001 ? In the next few weeks I will have my first ultra-sensitive PSA post surgery. I called the lab yesterday and was told their results will be out to 0.001 for example vs 0.1. Just wondering.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by Dave&Barb Best wishes to those of you going thru or facing possible ART/salvage RT, hang in there, that light at the end of the tunnel will get bright before you know it. Few tips that worked for Dave: 9am appt time worked best for him as it gave him plenty of time to have empty colon and full bladder. Full bladder was uncomfortable, but we found that NO caffeine helped, as well as wearing pants with loose waistband. Earlier and smaller suppers with easier to digest stuff, light on veggies and fiber. He got sent home just one day because of non-empty colon, so he made sure that didn't happen again. He also said it was helpful having me go each time so he didn't have to stress about driving and parking. Great to hear ... and appreciate the tips as I am sure this will be one of the paths I will be going down.",

Researching, ordering books, making doc appointments, scheduling bone and CT scans as well as adding my five-year colonoscopy follow-up. Found this forum today and just signed up. Biopsy diagnosis: 13 samples, (6) Gleason score 7, (2) Gleason score 8, (4) Gleason score 9 and (1) suspicious. Staging is 3. CT in 2016 (little blood and stones due to dehydration working outside in extreme heat) and MRI Dec 2018 show prostate normal size with no enlargement (comparing the 2016 CT to the 2018 MRI). PSA Nov 2018 7.1 Prescribed Proscar and Flomax PSA Dec 2018 4.1 (PSA drop due to Proscar ?) Yesterday, off of Proscar and Flomax. Age 63. Still coming to terms with all this.",

My bone and CT scan are on Feb 19th and I figure those results with determine that best course of treatment to follow. At least I am retired, with a little local part time job that is flexible, so that gets me out of the house. I think for my future posts/questions I will open a new thread with a related title ... and will include a link in my signature to this introduction.

      "Content": "Quick introduction: Biopsy week ago, results 24 hours ago. Everything is a bit of a blur and working on getting a handle of things today. Researching, ordering books, making doc appointments, scheduling bone and CT scans as well as adding my five-year colonoscopy follow-up. Found this forum today and just signed up. Biopsy diagnosis: 13 samples, (6) Gleason score 7, (2) Gleason score 8, (4) Gleason score 9 and (1) suspicious. Staging is 3. CT in 2016 (little blood and stones due to dehydration working outside in extreme heat) and MRI Dec 2018 show prostate normal size with no enlargement (comparing the 2016 CT to the 2018 MRI). PSA Nov 2018 7.1 Prescribed Proscar and Flomax PSA Dec 2018 4.1 (PSA drop due to Proscar ?) Yesterday, off of Proscar and Flomax. Age 63. Still coming to terms with all this.",

      "Content": "Oh dang ... everything I wrote disappeared when I clicked on the wrong button. In short, yes know I am high risk and have appts setup with different doctors to determine my care as well as have scheduled my bone and CT scans. Felt like I got a lot done in the first 24 hours. Understand the pitfalls of information on the internet so I take that all with a grain of salt. My diet has been good but now told to stop red meat and go mainly veggie with occasional wild salmon. I feel good with no aches or pains and am looking for the snow/ice to be gone so I can get out and run (mostly likely next week). Obviously I am having some emotional anxiety but that is to be expected. I have a good support system. Thanks for reaching out Duck 2 !",

      "Content": "Thanks Michael F and Bab. Learned there is 6 to 8 weeks out from the biopsy before doing anything to let the prostate calm down. Am using every bit I time in the process to get my ducks in line ... been more like herding cats. Today got my colonoscopy scheduled for next week (my five-year is coming up and the URO thought may as well do it now instead of later. Not my first rodeo with this so know what to expect. My Dr Walsh 2018v book arrives tomorrow, looking forward to see what was updated from the 2012v. Agree with the one good opportunity to do it right. This is where I am stumbling around regarding what doc and where. Since I really need some thoughts on this I will let you all know that I am in the Seattle area. Lots of different medical facilities around here such as Seattle Cancer Care Alliance, University of Washington Medical Center, Swedish and Virginia Mason. Appreciate any thoughts. Bab ... great metaphor, gave me a chuckle, I needed that. And, I do not mind being second place to you for that \"honor\".
